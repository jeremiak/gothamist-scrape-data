<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> The hunt is still on for the man who was spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/20/staten_island_manhunt.php">transporting a woman&apos;s corpse</a> in a Staten Island neighborhood yesterday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/police_still_searching_for_man_2.html#incart_2box_silive-homepage-featured">One resident who spotted the man said</a>, &quot;The body was dangling off the cart. He had stuff on top of the body&#x2014;trying to camouflage it.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_05_alopez.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_05_alopez.jpg" width="250" height="313" class="image-right"> </span>Authorities believe that Anthony Lopez, 31, was the person seen wheeling the body on a dolly in Mariners Harbor. Apparently an off-duty police officer spotted him around 7 a.m., and, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/police_still_searching_for_man_2.html#incart_2box_silive-homepage-featured">Staten Island Advance reports</a>, recognized Lopez from a previous arrest. But when Lopez saw the officer, he ran and abandoned the body, which was wrapped with a cloth.</p>

<p>A photograph of the dolly, left on the lawn, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/search_for_man_continues.html#incart_most-read_news_article">published yesterday</a>.</p>

<p>The body belongs to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/nyregion/police-search-for-man-spotted-pushing-dead-woman-on-dolly-on-staten-island.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=7&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">woman in her 20s or 30s</a>, and it&apos;s suspected that she&apos;s Lopez&apos;s wife. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/20/staten-island-body-dolly/">In an interview with CBS New York</a>, a neighbor said &quot;she often saw the victim and the suspect together. She said they lived in the Richmond Court condominium complex on Richmond Terrace about a block away. &apos;She would come outside, and I would see her a lot with bruises,&apos; the neighbor said. &apos;She was very scared of him.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The neighbor added, &quot;He&#x2019;s a very well-known crackhead and drug user, so when he used, I feel like it really added to his aggression.&quot;</p>

<p>Another resident was rattled, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Body-Wheeled-Dolly-Staten-Island-Police-NYC-Post-Lane-380269441.html">telling NBC New York</a> the body was &quot;Half naked, half dressed. This don&apos;t make no sense, this is not that type of block. This is not that type of neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:28 p.m.</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015334/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/police_arrest_man_who_wheeled.html">SI Advance reports</a> that police have a person in custody.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the deceased has been identified as 26-year-old Obiamaka Aduba.</p>
