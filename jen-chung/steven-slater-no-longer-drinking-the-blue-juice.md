<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://gothamist.com/upload/2010/08/2010_slater6.jpg"> <img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2010/08/2010_slater6-thumb-500x667-537070.jpg" width="200" height="266" class="image-left"> </a> </span>Well, at least he got to say good-bye in the most memorable way possible:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevenslater">Steven Slater</a>, the JetBlue attendant who emergency chute-shot his way to infamy when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/jet_blue_flight_attendant_activates.php">exited a flight at JFK Airport via the emergency slide</a> after an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/10/jet_blue_flight_attendant.php">alleged confrontation with an obnoxious passenger</a>, is no longer working for the Queens-based airline.  Spokeswoman Jenny Darvin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jetblue_nut_gets_pink_slip_DUbJFfMPY8PlmO5dc0k0fJ">confirmed as much but added</a>, &quot;I cannot confirm whether he resigned or whether he was fired. It&apos;s considered a private matter.&quot; </p>

<p>The initial story was that Slater left the plane in a huff&#x2014;with two beers&#x2014;after a passenger hit him on the head.  But some other passengers said that the supposedly malicious passenger wasn&apos;t being that terrible and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/jet_blue.php">actually Slater was acting weirdly</a> (an internal JetBlue memo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/14/jetblue_memo_says_slater_lied_about.php">says he lied</a>).  The Queens DA&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/11/steven_slater_bag_nazi_folk_hero_ho.php?gallery0Pic=4#gallery">charged him with a felony</a> for endangering the lives of people on the ground at JFK by deploying the emergency chute. </p>

<p>Still, Slater has many fans.  One who started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=144862372208443&amp;ref=ts">Steven Later Legal Defense Fund</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://abcnews.go.com/US/steve-slater-officially-leaves-jetblue/story?id=11563655">told ABC News</a>, &quot;I&apos;m a pilot myself and I was working with my crew when we heard about this. We just feel bad. It&apos;s just the way that we&apos;re treated. We all feel for him.&quot;  And sorta upside: His escapade exposed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530143645/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/11/2010-08-11_escape_exposes_gaps_in_security.html">flaws in JFK Airport security</a> (&quot;Slater managed to run through what are supposed to be secure zones near planes, dragging two carry-on bags, before taking an AirTrain to his car and driving home&quot;).  </p>
