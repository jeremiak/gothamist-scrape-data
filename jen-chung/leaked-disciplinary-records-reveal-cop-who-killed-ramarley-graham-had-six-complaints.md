<p>Days after the police officer who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/04/bronx_teen_did_not_struggle_with_po.php">fatally shot unarmed teenager</a> Ramarley Graham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/27/cop_who_killed_ramarley_graham_quit.php">quit the NYPD</a>, the ex-cop&apos;s disciplinary record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/https://thinkprogress.org/richard-haste-disciplinary-record-474f77eb8d19">was apparently leaked to ThinkProgress</a>. Former officer Richard Haste apparently had six complaints lodged against him before killing Graham.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2017_03_rgraham.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_03_rgraham.jpg" width="300" height="300"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Ramarley Graham </i></div> In 2012, Haste, who was not trained in street level narcotics enforcement, and his partner chased 18-year-old Graham into Graham&apos;s Bronx home. While Haste and his partner claimed they thought Graham was armed when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/video_nypd_kicks_in_door_before_sho.php">busted through a bathroom door</a>, Graham was not armed and had only flushed some marijuana down the toilet. <p></p>

<p>After the shooting, Haste was put on modified duty. He was indicted on manslaughter charges, but they were tossed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/15/nypd-officer-teenager-bronx-ramarley-graham">because of a procedural error</a>. The federal Department of Justice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/ramarley_graham_feds_nypd.php">declined to prosecute</a>. That left an NYPD departmental trial, which ultimately recommended that Haste be fired. Haste quit the NYPD two days later, on March 26th. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/https://thinkprogress.org/richard-haste-disciplinary-record-474f77eb8d19">ThinkProgress</a>, which also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/eric_garner_pantaleo_history.php">published the leaked disciplinary records of police officer Daniel Pantaleo</a>, who choked Eric Garner to death, reported that Haste was &quot;accused of using physical force, pepper spray, and offensive language, as well as making an abusive frisk.&quot; (There were ten allegations in six cases over 13 months.) The Civilian Complaint Review Board [CCRB] was not able to substantiate any of the allegations. </p><blockquote>Still the number of complaints made against Haste is highly unusual. Roughly 8.8 percent of more than 36,000 NYPD officers have that many complaints, based on publicly available data spanning 2006 to 2017 on the CCRB website. The timing of Haste&#x2019;s complaints also stands out, with all six occurring in just over a year. By contrast, Pantaleo&#x2019;s CCRB records indicate that he had eight complaints, including four substantiated allegations, in nearly five years.<p></p>

<p>The number of complaints lodged against Haste in such a short time span is &#x201C;unusual,&#x201D; according to [former CCRB spokesman Andrew] Case. &#x201C;I would say that six complaints in one year, regardless of their outcome, is an extremely high number of complaints,&#x201D; he said.</p></blockquote>After Pantaleo&apos;s disciplinary record&#x2014;which also contained allegations the CCRB could not substantiate&#x2014;was leaked last week, Legal Aid attorney Cynthia Conti-Cook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/eric_garner_pantaleo_history.php">told Gothamist</a> that based on her experience as a civil rights litigator, &quot;unsubstantiated is not exonerated, it&apos;s &apos;inconclusive.&apos; The finding isn&apos;t enough to trigger discipline but it certainly suggests allegations may have merit.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The NYPD abruptly stopped releasing disciplinary records of police officers in the spring of 2016, claiming it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/27/nypd_disciplinary_records_secret.php">suddenly realized it had violated state law</a>, and critics of the NYPD have sued to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/nyregion/nypd-disciplinary-records.html">have the records made public again</a>.</p>

<p>Graham&apos;s mother, Constance Malcolm, said in a statement, &quot;Accountability and transparency shouldn&apos;t be based on what&apos;s convenient for Mayor de Blasio, it should be based on truth and justice without delays. So far, the de Blasio administration has failed to fulfill that obligation to my family, our communities, and the public. The de Blasio administration should publicly release Richard Haste&apos;s complete CCRB record (not just a summary of a few years) and the final NYPD report of findings against Richard Haste,  since he is no longer a NYPD employee that can be shielded by 50-a protections.&quot;</p>

<p>She added, &quot;Mayor de Blasio must also announce trial dates for Sergeant Scott Morris and Officer John McLoughlin who participated in the killing of my son, so that they are not afforded the same resignation scheme as Haste, or worse allowed to retire with full benefits.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Today, NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033246/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/29/ramarley-graham-james-oneill/">he would meet with Malcolm</a>.</p>
