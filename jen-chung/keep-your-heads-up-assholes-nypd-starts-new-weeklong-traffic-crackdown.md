<span class="photo_caption">How the NYPD felt about bike lanes in 2011&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102444/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/06/cops_park_in_bike_lane_for_emergenc.php#photo-2">they were perfect for special parking outside Papa John&apos;s</a></span></p>

<p>For the third week in a row, the NYPD has announced &quot;Traffic Safety Enforcement Initiative.&quot; This time, it&apos;ll be over seven days, starting Monday, and running through Sunday, June 1.</p>

<p>The police say it&apos;s part of their &quot;effort to reduce traffic collisions and conditions that cause death and injury.&quot;</p><blockquote>Enforcement will be conducted in 21 selected precincts throughout the five boroughs and will focus on hazardous driving behaviors such as speeding, passing through red lights, driving while using a cellphone, driving while texting, making improper turns, disobeying traffic signs, and failing to yield to pedestrians. <p></p>

<p>There will also be focused enforcement on parking violations that create roadway hazards for pedestrians, as well as bicyclists and vehicles.  These violations include parking at a bus stop or in a crosswalk, and double parking.</p>

<p>The NYPD strongly encourages safe driving and urges the public to use caution and drive safely by adhering to vehicle traffic laws when driving on City Streets. </p></blockquote>On May 13 and May 16, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102444/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/heads_up_assholes_nypd_cracks_down.php">went after drivers who texted or didn&apos;t yield to pedestrians</a>, resulting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102444/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/20/nypd_writes_5000_summons_during_dis.php">in over 5,000 summonses</a>. On May 20 and May 21, the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102444/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/20/watch_out_leadfoot_nypd_starts_2-da.php">focused on speeding violations</a> and wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102444/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/23/nypd_speeding_blitz.php">4,814 summonses</a>.<p></p>

<p>During the first crackdown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102444/http://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a>&apos; Noah Budnick said of the effort, &quot;It shows that the goal is changing people&#x2019;s behavior not writing the most number of tickets. Writing tickets is important, but the point isn&#x2019;t to set-up an &apos;I gotcha&apos; situation and nab people. The point is to compel people to make safe decisions.&quot;</p>
