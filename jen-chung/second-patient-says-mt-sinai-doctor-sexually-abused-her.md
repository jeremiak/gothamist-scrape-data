<p>The emergency physician who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/14/doctor_sex_assault.php">accused of drugging, molesting and then masturbating</a> on a patient at a Manhattan hospital was also charged in a second incident. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_01_davidnewman12.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_01_davidnewman12.jpg" width="250" height="327"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> Dr. David Newman</i></div> Dr. David Newman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/doctor_sinai_allegation.php">turned himself</a> into Special Victims Unit detectives yesterday after a young female patient, 29, said he sexually assaulted her when she went to Mount Sinai Hospital for shoulder pain. She was first given pills and morphine from a nurse, but when Newman checked on her, he allegedly gave her more morphine, even though the patient said she had been given a dose. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-mount-sinai-doc-accused-ejaculating-patient-article-1.2496055">According to the Daily News</a>, the patient said that &quot;Newman started fondling her breasts&quot; when examining her right side and then &quot;moved her bed away from the wall and positioned himself with his back toward the patient. The woman heard the sounds of someone masturbating &#x2014; and then felt semen on her face, she claimed.&quot; </p>

<p>During this time, she was in and out of consciousness.</p>

<p>The patient then saved the blanket Newman allegedly used to wipe semen from her face as well as a hospital gown that she used to wipe remaining ejaculate. He is charged with sexual abuse and forcible touching.</p>

<p>After this incident was publicized, a second woman came forward with similar allegations. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/nyregion/er-doctor-at-mt-sinai-hospital-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-2-patients.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The woman, 22, had gone to the emergency room with a cold around 6 p.m. on Sept. 21 when, she told investigators, Dr. Newman groped her breasts, according to a criminal complaint. He has been charged with sexual abuse in that episode.&quot;</p>

<p>During a court hearing,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/19/mount-sinai-doctor-david-newman-sex-abuse/"> the Manhattan DA&apos;s office </a>&quot;said only nurses are given access to morphine - concluding that Newman must have had his own stash.&quot;</p>

<p>Mt. Sinai says that Newman had been suspended from seeing patients since the beginning of the investigation. He is being held on $50,000 bail or $150,000 bond. </p>

<p>The married 45-year-old doctor is an Iraq War veteran and has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCk_vTkS6bU">given Ted Talks</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/opinion/at-the-er-bearing-witness-to-gun-violence.html">contributed to the NY Times op-ed</a> section. The Times notes that the back cover of his book, <em>Hippocrates&#x2019; Shadow: Secrets From the House of Medicine</em>, declares that Newman &quot;sees a lack of candid communication between doctors and patients.&quot; The book promises to &quot;show the patterns of secrecy and habit in modern medicine&#x2019;s carefully protected subculture.&quot;</p>

<p>One woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124531/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/19/mount-sinai-doctor-david-newman-sex-abuse/">told WCBS 2</a> that the allegations were &quot;horrifying, especially since I&#x2019;ve been to Mount Sinai multiple times. I&#x2019;ve had multiple surgeries here. And so to hear something like that is very scary, &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s like how many other women has this happened to?&quot;</p>
