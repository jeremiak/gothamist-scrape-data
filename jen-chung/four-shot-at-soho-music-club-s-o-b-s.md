<p>A mixtape party at SOB&apos;s for a rapper Fat Trel turned violent just after midnight today. Four people were shot and injured at the Manhattan nightclub around 12:15 a.m.&#x2014;and it was apparently after &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305052949/http://nypost.com/2013/09/12/four-shot-inside-soho-music-club/">a gang member from New Jersey insulted New York City.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305052949/http://nypost.com/2013/09/12/four-shot-inside-soho-music-club/">Post says</a> three people&#x2014;two men and a woman&#x2014;were shot in the leg while one person was grazed by a bullet. The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305052949/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/4-people-shot-club-sob-varick-st-article-1.1453270"> Daily News says</a> two had leg wounds, while two others were grazed. A DJ at the club told the News, &quot;I&#x2019;ve never been so scared because I didn&#x2019;t know where the shots were coming from. Everybody is jumping on each other, trying to get away from the action.&quot;</p>

<p>Another clubgoer said to the Post, &quot;It was mayhem. We heard four or five shots. People were ducking and rolling on the floor,&quot; then people fled for the doors. The Post has details behind the beef:</p><blockquote>The argument allegedly started when a Bloods gang member from New Jersey approached the stage and started to trash talk New York City, witnesses said.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;It was stupidity between some Bloods and Crips,&#x201D; a witness said. &#x201C;It was so ignorant. People started yelling at each other and then a gun got pulled.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>The shooting occurred before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305052949/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9245239">Fat Trel even performed</a> anything from his mixtape, &quot;Sex, Drugs, Money, &amp; Guns.&quot;<p></p>
