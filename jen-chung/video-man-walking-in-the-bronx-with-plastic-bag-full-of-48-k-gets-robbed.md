<p>A man carrying tens of thousands in cash was robbed last month in the Bronx, and authorities say the suspects made away with $21,500.</p>

<p>The incident took place around 12:45 p.m. on March 8th, across from 3046 Buhre Avenue in Pelham Bay. According to the NYPD, the victim, 27, was walking with a plastic bag mysteriously full of $48,000 in cash, when a man approached him and ripped the bag out of hands, sending fat stacks flying everywhere. As the victim and this man struggled, police say a second person punched the victim as the first assailant grabbed as much cash as he could carry. </p>

<p>The two muggers fled the scene with about $21,500. Video shows the assault and robbery&#x2014;you can see the victim trying to fight off the suspects as the money falls to the sidewalk:</p>
