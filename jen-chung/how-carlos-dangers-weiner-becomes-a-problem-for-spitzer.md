                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_weinerline.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_weinerline.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Anthony Weiner at yesterday&apos;s post-Carlos Danger admission press conference (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, former congressman Anthony Weiner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/weiner_swells_to_slight_lead_over_q.php">surprisingly strong</a> mayoral campaign got socked with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">new sexting allegations&#x2014;which he later confirmed were mostly true</a>. During a press conference, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/anthony_weiner_carlos_danger.php">he emphasized</a>, &quot;This is entirely behind me. That is why if you remember the early days of the campaign, people were pressing me if there were more out there and I said yes,&quot; and his wife Huma Abedin voiced her support, &quot;I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him. As we have said from the beginning, we are moving forward.&quot; But what does this mean for this campaign? We spoke to Hunter College Professor of Political Science, Kenneth Sherrill, who doesn&apos;t think this is a big issue for Weiner, &quot;In a strange way, this becomes a problem for Eliot Spitzer.&quot; </p>

<p>Sherrill explained, &quot;I think it reinforces pre-existing attitudes toward him. If you like him, it shows how aggressive and forceful he is. If you don&#x2019;t like him, it shows how bad his judgment is. Everybody who&apos;s going to vote knows who he is and what he is. My standard joke is that the campaign is &apos;Vote For Weiner&#x2014;He&apos;s Got Balls&apos; and there are a lot of people who like that.&quot;</p>

<p>The latest sexting incidents, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/carlos_danger_weiners_sexting_partn.php">involving a 22-year-old woman</a> and Weiner&apos;s cock-shot sending alter-ego Carlos Danger, apparently occurred last summer/fall, a year after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">his resignation</a> and around the same time he and Abedin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/18/weiner_family_exposed_in_people_mag.php">gave an interview to People</a> touting his recovery and their strength at rebuilding their family. Sherrill doesn&apos;t think the timing of the sexting matters to voters, but it just brings up the &quot;men are pigs&quot; theme: &quot;If one politician apologizes and can&apos;t keep it in a pants, why should you expect another politician to do the same?&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_07_spitzersmilesmall.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_spitzersmilesmall.jpg" width="300" height="240"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Eliot Spitzer (Getty Images)</i></div> &quot;Given the generally negative view people have towards politicians, this reinforces the notion that politicians can&apos;t be trusted, particularly on this sort of issue,&quot; Sherrill said. &quot;It is a matter of not being trusted or being exactly what you thought they were.&quot; He also doesn&apos;t think politicians&apos; infidelity is a big deal to New York voters: &quot;A lot of New Yorkers liked Rudy Giuliani,&quot; whom he called a &quot;flagrant public philanderer.&quot; Giuliani dated his future third wife Judi Nathan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134534,00.html">even talking her to events at Gracie Mansion</a>, while still married to second wife Donna Hanover (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163615/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/29/did_nyc_taxpaye.php">Nathan had her own police detail</a>). &quot;That went off [Giuliani] like water off a duck&apos;s back!&quot;<p></p>

<p>As for what this means to Spitzer, Sherrill opined that now there&apos;s &quot;a contagion of doubt&quot; because Spitzer will be asked about his past transgressions, &quot;It eats up the air&#x2014;it&apos;s a raging fire that consumes the air that eats up the press and public&apos;s attention and you can&apos;t talk about the other things.&quot; When it comes to voting day, he believes New Yorkers can handle one cheating public officials, but &quot;two would be a problem.&quot;</p>
