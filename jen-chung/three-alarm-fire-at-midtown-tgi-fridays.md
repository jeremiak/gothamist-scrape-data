<p>A fire broke out in a TGI Friday&apos;s restaurant in midtown Manhattan last night. The FDNY says the fire started in the basement of 604 5th Avenue at 48th Street, where the kitchen is, just before 9 p.m. Friday. Then, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021027/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/06/06/fire-rages-at-midtown-tgi-fridays-restaurant/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;Flames and smoke raced to the top of the building through the duct work.&quot;</p>

<p>Numerous blocks around the restaurant were shut down so firefighters could battle the blaze. The smoke and fire could be seen from great distances&#x2014;here&apos;s a photo taken from Long Island City:</p>

<p>A Friday&apos;s busboy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021027/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/flames-smoke-spew-high-rise-fire-rockefeller-center-article-1.1820457">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;It started over the grill. It shot right up the wall. It was flame and smoke everywhere.&quot; Another employee added, &quot;It was hell.&quot;</p>

<p>On the other hand, for tourists, the fire was a real treat. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021027/http://nypost.com/2014/06/06/three-alarm-fire-erupts-in-midtown/">From the Post</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;There were a lot of hot firemen,&#x2019;&#x2019; said Lori Gagula, of Houston. &#x201C;What more could we ask for?&#x2019;&#x2019;<p></p>

<p>Her pal, Lisa Hutchison, said: &#x201C;It was awesome. I thought we were walking up on a movie shoot.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>Robert Herring of North Carolina, said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like this before.<br>
&#x201C;Where I come from we don&#x2019;t have skyscrapers &#x2014; or ladder trucks.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>He was looking forward to telling some real New York stories to his friends back home.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I especially enjoyed getting chewed out by the cops for crossing their police tape,&#x2019;&#x2019; he said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The fire was finally under control by 11 p.m. One firefighter suffered a minor injury.</p>
