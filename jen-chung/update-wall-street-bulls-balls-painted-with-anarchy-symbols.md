</div></div><p>Crowds have gathered at Wall Street, as unions are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081200/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/25/unions_to_protest_against_wall_stre.php">protesting both greed and Mayor Bloomberg</a> today. Fittingly, someone has painted or affixed anarchy symbols on the Wall Street Bull&apos;s side and, uh, genitals.  A tipster got this photograph and tells us that the cops have a barricade around the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081200/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_Bull">Charging Bull</a>. This is vandalism, but way less embarrassing than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081200/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/09/wall_street_needs_relief_in_more_wa.php">having his balls painted blue</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, about the protests&#x2014;here&apos;s what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081200/http://www.onmay12.org/">On May 12 website says</a>:</p><blockquote>The Big Banks crashed our economy, destroying jobs, foreclosing on millions of homes and wrecking city and state budgets across the country. After trillions in taxpayer funded bailouts, Wall Street is making billions in profits and giving away record bonuses to CEOs. But our communities are still hurting. Here in New York City, tens of thousands have lost their homes and their jobs. Now, Billionaire Mayor Mike Bloomberg is proposing devastating budget cuts as the only solution to the economic crisis that Wall Street caused. Enough is Enough. On Thursday May 12, 2011 we&#x2019;ll be bringing some of that spirit of Wisconsin to Wall Street when thousands of people, from all walks of life, converge in a unique and inspiring action in the heart of the financial world - Wall Street. Join us &#x2014; because it&apos;s time to make the Big Banks and Millionaires pay!</blockquote>You can share your photographs of the revolution with us by tagging them &quot;gothamist&quot; on Flickr or emailing them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081200/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">photos@gothamist.com</a>.<p></p>
