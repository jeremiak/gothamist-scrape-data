The crane happens to be a Kodiak tower crane owned by New York Crane &amp; Equipment Co.--the same model and firm involved last month&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425154445/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/30/breaking_manhat.php">fatal crane collapse at East 91st Street and First Avenue</a>. </p>

<p>Cracks were found in the crane&apos;s turntable; the crane in the May collapse also suffered from cracking (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425154445/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/08/questions_about_4.php">it was also hit by lightning</a>) but was repaired.  The Kodiak tower crane is an older, discontinued model, and all similar models were immediately prohibited from being used at sites after the May collapse.  </p>

<p>While the DOB told the News the cracks weren&apos;t compromising &quot;structural integrity,&quot; the crane will be dismantled this weekend.  Acting DOB Commissioner Robert LiMandri said, &quot;We want to err on the side of caution.&quot;</p>

<p>And yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425154445/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/owner-of-e-side-building-hit-by-crane-sues/80411/">owner of 1749 First Avenue</a>, an apartment building hit by the crane, is suing New York Crane &amp; Equipment Co., the crane operator, general contractor and owner of the 1765 First Avenue construction site for $100 million, citing &quot;recklessness, carelessness and negligence.&quot;  1749 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425154445/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/01/das_office_open.php">sustained considerable damage</a>.</p>
