When asked whether Ospina had driven drunk before, his 19-year-old brother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050233/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/dwi_cop_brakes_fast_at_tiffany_PDKoi27aiMeamhy7VBKZdO">helpfully said</a>, &quot;I&apos;m sure he has. He must have. I don&apos;t know for a fact.&quot;  With a brother like this, who needs a keeper? </p>

<p>The impact of the crash left Ospina&apos;s Chrysler 300 a wreck; he and his two passengers had to be cut out of the car before being taken to Bellevue for treatment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050233/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/dwi_cop_brakes_fast_at_tiffany_PDKoi27aiMeamhy7VBKZdO">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Ospina, who joined the force in 2004, was so out of it that he told detectives that the year was 2009 and George W. Bush was still president, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>The cop&apos;s brother Daniel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050233/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/02/13/2010-02-13_offduty_cop_slams_car_into_tiffanys_famed_midtown_storefront_in_possible_drunk_d.html">added</a>, &quot;Yeah, he likes to live life. He&apos;s the type of guy everyone likes to be around. He likes to get people in a great mood,&quot; and &quot;I have to stick up for him, he&apos;s my brother. Everyone makes mistakes. Nobody&apos;s perfect.&quot;  Ospina was suspended without pay for 30 days.  </p>
