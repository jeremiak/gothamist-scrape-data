You could hear the yelling and screaming, but I was kind of hoping it was a fight for a minute then reality kind of hit you and see people on the ground. It was kind of mayhem.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, police do not believe the women were his intended target. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325062151/http://abc7ny.com/news/3-women-shot-1-fatally-in-flatiron-district;-police-searching-for-black-bmw/1028700/">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;Police say a man attending a party inside was kicked out but refused to leave, and then told people he was going to get his gun.&quot; </p>

<p>Recounting the confrontation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325062151/http://pix11.com/2015/10/12/3-hurt-in-manhattan-shooting/">another witness described to PIX 11</a>, &quot;[The suspected shooter] tried to start fighting with another man inside the club [and then security] put him outside. They didn&apos;t let him back in. He said, &apos;That&apos;s how it&apos;s going to be?&apos; He goes back inside the car. I don&apos;t know if it was him who shot [at the women]. He [ran] into the back into the black BMW and that&apos;s when I heard the gunshots, and hurt the three ladies.&quot;</p>

The investigation is ongoing. Police say the shooter appeared to be in his 20s. A man who happened to be walking in the neighborhood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325062151/http://pix11.com/2015/10/12/3-hurt-in-manhattan-shooting/">said to PIX 11</a>, &quot;I wasn&apos;t sure what it was. As I approached I saw the screaming, the mayhem. Definitely uncommon for this part of town.&quot;
