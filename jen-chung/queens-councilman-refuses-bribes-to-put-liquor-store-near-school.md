<p>Finally, an antidote to those many stories of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001552/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/27/queens_state_sen_huntley_turns_hers.php">politicians selling out</a> their office for personal financial gain: Queens City Council Member Donovan Richards helped the NYC Department of Investigation nab three businessman who tried to bribe him in hopes of getting a liquor license. DOI Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn said, &quot;Clearly, the good news is that there are public officials unwilling to sell their offices.&quot;</p>

<p>Tarsem Singh has been hoping to open a liquor store at 219-11 North Conduit Avenue and filed an application for a liquor license in May. However, the location is close to a school, and Richards was opposed to it. During a conversation with Singh and his associate Davinder Singh, the men tried to give cash to Richards to sway his stance. </p>

<p>Richards contacted the DOI immediately and worked with the agency. An investigator, posing as a representative of Richards&apos;, met with Tarsem Singh, Davinder Singh and Rajinder Singh at various times. From the DOI (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001552/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doi/downloads/pdf/2013/sept13/29bribe09-13-2013.pdf">PDF</a>):</p><blockquote>. The first meeting took place in June at a Queens diner where TARSEM SINGH and RAJINDER SINGH offered the DOI undercover cash in exchange for the Councilman&#x2019;s support of the liquor store. During that meeting, RAJINDER SINGH went to a vehicle, obtained cash, and returned to the diner where he handed money to TARSEM  SINGH who in turn handed the undercover investigator $500. During a second meeting at the diner in September TARSEM SINGH and DAVINDER SINGH offered the undercover $2,000 for the Councilman&#x2019;s support for the license, which was to be the subject of an upcoming hearing before the SLA. TARSEM SINGH paid the undercover investigator $900 and the two businessmen agreed to pay the remaining $1,100 after the SLA hearing. The next day, DAVINDER SINGH texted the undercover investigator with the following, &#x201C;Call the Liquor Authority. We are counting on you.&#x201D; DOI notified the SLA, and arrests have been made.</blockquote>The three men were charged with bribery and giving unlawful gratuities. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001552/http://nypost.com/2013/09/13/queens-businessmen-busted-for-trying-to-bribe-politician/">Richards told the Post</a>, &quot;When I was elected, I promised my constituents that I would carry myself with the utmost integrity. May these arrests show those who seek to bribe public officials that our communities and children aren&#x2019;t for sale.&quot;<p></p>
