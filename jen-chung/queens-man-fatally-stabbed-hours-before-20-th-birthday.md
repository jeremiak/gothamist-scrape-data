<p>Just after 9 p.m. on Friday, police responded to a call about a male stabbed outside of 128-15 Linden Boulevard, near his home. They found McDonald with a stab wound in his chest, and he was pronounced dead at Jamaica Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723015740/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/19-Year-Old-Man-Teen-Stabbed-Death-Killed--Queens-211674741.html">According to NBC New York</a>, &quot;Police say another teen who McDonald had gotten into a fight with earlier returned with a knife and stabbed him on the sidewalk after chasing him.&quot;</p>

<p>McDonald&apos;s father Eric Anderson said, &quot;I know they took my boy away from me. They stabbed him in his heart. And he was a good boy. The world is not a good place right now. It&#x2019;s missing a good boy.&quot; He tried to save his son&#x2014;Anderson is a registered nurse&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723015740/http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/25/southozonestabbing_web_2013_06_15_q.html">by performing CPR</a>, &quot;He breathed his last breath into my mouth. I knew he was gone.&quot; Anderson added that he didn&apos;t want his son&apos;s friends to avenge his death, &quot;One boy&#x2019;s life is gone. One boy&#x2019;s life is ruined and I don&#x2019;t want his friends to do anything stupid.&quot;</p>

<p>Anderson also said that his son wanted to enlist in the Marines, &quot;He wanted to help out our country. He wanted to be part of something bigger.&quot;</p>
