<p>Police announced they arrested the second suspect in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013422/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/12/nypd_woman_walking_in_clinton_hill.php">series of attacks on a woman in Brooklyn last month</a>. The 32-year-old woman was sexually assaulted twice, by two different people, in the span of about an hour.</p>

<p>According to the police, the first attack occurred at 5 a.m. on August 31st, when the woman was walking in front of 187 Gates Avenue; the NYPD says that a suspect pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. The suspect claimed he had a gun and would use it but did not display it. (Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013422/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/20/cops_arrest_one_in_clinton_hill_sex.php">arrested Nicholas Isaac</a>, 17, last week.)</p>

<p>Then the second attack occurred around 6 a.m., in front of 58 Irving Place, when a second suspect pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. Again, police say the second suspect claimed to have a gun and said he would use it, but never displayed it. Daquan Jackson, 21, was charged criminal sex act for this assault.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013422/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/nyregion/despite-affluence-clinton-hill-is-home-to-active-sex-trade.html">NY Times noted that in spite of gentrification</a>, the neighborhood still has a seedy element:</p><blockquote>Standing in the doorways of multifamily buildings valued at $1 million to $3 million, residents told of their encounters with prostitutes and their clients.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been on my way to work in the morning and they&#x2019;re doing their thing, doing the do,&#x201D; said Tony Moorer, a teacher who has lived on the block for 22 years. &#x201C;You see it and you keep moving.&#x201D;</p>

<p>...At the Carlton, an expensive Irving Place condominium built in 2012, the superintendent, Khalif Lomax, 40, said he regularly has to clean up the building&#x2019;s outdoor trash area after people break into it to have sex. Next to Alice&#x2019;s Arbor, an organic foods restaurant on nearby Classon Avenue where young diners in expensive sunglasses eat brunch at outdoor tables, a clerk at a scruffy hotel called the Pleasant Stay said that until recently, rooms there rented by the hour.</p></blockquote>One couple believed they witnessed the second attack (while &quot;waiting for a delivery from Fresh Direct&quot;) and called the cops.<p></p>

<p>The president of NOW&apos;s NYC chapter, Sonia Ossorio, told the Times, &quot;It&#x2019;s easier to believe that the violence is perpetrated against a certain class, therefore I&#x2019;m safe. That&#x2019;s a mistake. Rapists are rapists.&quot;</p>
