<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823023047/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/queens_teacher_allegedly_raped_form.php">Prosecutors say</a> that Reilly met the student when he taught her English at IS 237 in Queens. According to the criminal complaint, the victim told the Queens DA&apos;s office that sometime in August of last year, Reilly &quot;sent her a text message indicating in sum and substance that he wanted to have sex with her.&quot; </p>

<p>Then, beginning in October, the pair allegedly met in Reilly&apos;s apartment&#x2014;the one he shares with his wife and baby daughter&#x2014;and had sex at least 10 times, with the last incident on Monday, April 6th.

<p>Reilly will also be on 10 years probation as part of the plea deal, which was reached so the victim wouldn&apos;t have to testify, and he will have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823023047/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9212241&amp;rss=rss-wabc-article-9212241&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">register as a sex offender</a>. The Post reports that the sex offender &quot;label could keep him from raising his own daughter,&quot; who is 15 months old, but has &quot;gambled that probation officials wouldn&#x2019;t order that.&quot; </p>
