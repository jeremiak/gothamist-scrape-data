At least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011259/http://online.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-police-officer-wont-face-criminal-charges-in-eric-garner-death-1417635275">32 people have been arrested</a> so far.</p>

A group of police officers had approached Garner because he was suspected of selling loose cigarettes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011259/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">A video showed Garner arguing</a> with the police, swatting their hands away and saying, &quot;Don&#x2019;t touch me, please.&quot; Pantaleo put him in a chokehold while other officers struggled to pull him to the ground and get his arms behind his back. Garner, an asthmatic, can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe.&quot; </p>

<p>Many protesters started at Union Square and then walked to Times Square, in an attempt to reach Rockefeller Center. With the tree lighting, there were more tourists than usual as well as more police officers and barricades.</p>

<p>All 32 arrests so far were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011259/http://online.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-police-officer-wont-face-criminal-charges-in-eric-garner-death-1417635275">near Rockefeller Center</a>. Then the protesters walked up Broadway, to Columbus Circle and the Upper West Side. One group went to Harlem, while another went to the West Side Highway where they blocked traffic by laying on the highway.</p>
