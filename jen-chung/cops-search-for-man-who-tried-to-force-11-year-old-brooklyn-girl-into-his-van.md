<p>An 11-year-old girl was nearly abducted yesterday evening while she was waiting at a bus stop in Flatbush, police say. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred around 5:40 p.m. while the girl stood at the bus stop at the corner of  Rogers Avenue and Albermarle Road: </p><blockquote>&quot;[A] gray van pulled up in front of her and an unknown male offered to give her a ride home. After the victim declined his invitation the man stepped out of the van and tried to grab her. <p></p>

<p>The victim said she saw a wooden stick in his hand at that time. The victim ran back to her school, which was approximately a block and half from the bus stop, and alerted the school safety agents inside the school; the agents called 911. The victim said the man got back inside the van and fled North bound on Rogers Avenue.&quot;</p></blockquote>Police say the suspect is a black male, about 40 years old, 5&apos;3&quot;-5&apos;4&quot; and 140 pounds. He was last seen wearing a gray baseball cap, a gray sweater and gray pants. He was driving a very old, rusty gray van.<p></p>
