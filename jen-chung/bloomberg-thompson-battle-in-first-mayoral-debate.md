<p>Last night&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145735/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/13/bloomberg_and_thompson_square_off_t.php">first mayoral debate</a> between incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Comptroller William Thompson showed both men in attack mode:  Bloomberg went after Thompson&apos;s record heading the Board of Education and accepting donations from pension funds that the city uses while Thompson reminded voters how Bloomberg maneuvered for the term limits and extension and how he&apos;s spent $65 million on his campaign so far. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145735/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/107273/ny1-online--2009-mayoral-debate--1--10-13-09-">watch the debate at NY1</a>, but here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Thompson on Bloomberg&apos;s wealth: &quot;Can the richest man in New York City play by his own set of rules, while we play by a different set of rules?&quot;</li>
	<li>Bloomberg on Thompson&apos;s education record: &quot;The schools were much worse then. It was a failing school system&quot;; &quot;Rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic &#x2014; that is exactly what he did&quot;</li>
	<li>Thompson on the term limits extension: &quot;It is wrong. Mike Bloomberg lied to the people of New York City.&quot;</li>
	<li>Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145735/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mike_bill_turn_debate_into_all_out_FEbpGCZpB5Lc9hF41eH3qL">on term limits</a>: Noting that voters are facing issues about education, crime, and tough financial times, &quot;No one is indispensable. But voters have a choice. And if that&apos;s their issue on Nov. 3, they can express themselves.&quot;</li></ul>
