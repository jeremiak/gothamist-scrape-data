<p>Firefighters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160930/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/04/24/2009-04-24_house_explodes_in_queens.html">found a woman&apos;s body under the rubble</a> of a Floral Park house on 260th Street that exploded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160930/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/24/queens_house_explodes_2_injured.php#comments">yesterday afternoon</a>.  The Daily News reports the body was discovered four hours after the 4:50 p.m. explosion: &quot;Her husband was at work and her three kids were in an after-school program.&quot;  The woman&apos;s husband, Dindail Boobram, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160930/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/nyregion/25explode.html?ref=nyregion">told the NY Times</a> that his wife didn&apos;t show up to pick up the kids.  </p>

<p>The house was completely leveled and the NY Times reported the &quot;resulting fire quickly spread to three neighboring ones, creating an inferno that prompted the evacuation of the entire street.&quot; Houses shook and debris flew into the neighborhood, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160930/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/nyc/090424_House_Explodes_in_Queens">frightening residents</a>. Two neighboring homes were badly damaged and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160930/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04242009/news/regionalnews/queens/home_in_queens_explodes_166027.htm">may be condemned</a>.  Several other people, including residents, firefighters and a Con Ed worker, were injured.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160930/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/04/24/2009-04-24_house_explodes_in_queens.html">According to the Daily News,</a> neighbors Stanley and Vita Barth noticed their electricity was off and called Con Ed. Twenty minutes later, they called again when they smelled gas; Stanely Barth said, &quot;They came pretty promptly.&quot; After finding evidence of a gas leak in their basement, the utility worker went outside to check the manhole&#x2014;and then the house across the street exploded. The Times offers the timeline: Con Ed received the gas leak call at 3:35 p.m., a crew arrived at 4 p.m., and the manhole cover was removed around 4:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Con Ed spokesman Chris Olert wasn&apos;t immediately sure if other gas leaks were reported in the area, but told the News the manhole cover removal may not be the cause, &quot;There are scores of things that can trigger this, but what would need to have happened is a spark in the sewer. Our guys open manholes on a regular basis.&quot;</p>
