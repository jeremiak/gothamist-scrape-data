<p>One cat owner, Adam Fulrath, says,&quot; My cat takes priority over the new relationship. Realistically, unless there&#x2019;s something absolutely amazing about her, he wins.&#x201D;  Elizabeth Daza &quot;who dated a cat-owning man for eight years,&quot; said, &quot;Straight men with cats seem to be really secure and stable. They don&#x2019;t need to be running around the park and proving their masculinity like the dog guys.&#x201D;  And cat lover and owner John Scalzi--of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312045840/http://scalzi.com/whatever/004457.html">bacon on cat fame</a>-- even goes as far to <strong>call dogs &quot;the insecure man&apos;s best friend.&quot;</strong>  </p>

<p>This reminds us the part in Meet the Parents where Robert DeNiro&apos;s character has a mini-monologue on cats, after calling dogs &quot;emotionally shallow&quot;:  &quot;When you yell at a dog, his tail will go between his legs and cover his genitals, his ears will go down.  A dog is very easy to break, but cats make you work for their affection. They don&apos;t sell out the way dogs do.&quot;  </p>
