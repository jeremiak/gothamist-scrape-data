                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161703/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_rebeccaf/081613_si.jpeg"> <img alt="081613_si.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161703im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/08/081613_si-thumb-350x466-804477.jpeg" width="200" height="266" class="image-left"> </a> </span>Last week, the police found the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161703/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/decomposed_body_found_in_staten_isl.php">decomposing body belonging to Megan Marotte</a>, a 20-year-old Staten Islander who was reported missing earlier this month. Yesterday, the NYPD announced that they had arrested Pedro Martin, 27, and charged him with murder. </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that Martin and Marotte met on August 4th at a deli on Staten Island. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161703/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/new_details_emerge_in_death_of.html#incart_m-rpt-2">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, cops think that Marotte was &quot;approached by Martin at the Staten Island Five Eleven Deli &amp; Grocery on Port Richmond Avenue. Before she went missing, Ms. Marotte had told family she was pregnant. Investigators, at least for now, are working on the theory that the young woman agreed to have sex with him for money, according to sources.&quot; A cabbie apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161703/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/eerie_flier_on_killer_street_CeoEfs0twFlJQWKtee3QXJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">tipped off the police</a>.</p>

<p>The Advance&apos;s source says the pair went to the Ramada Inn but were turned away, so they then they went to Willowbrook Park. Her family had reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161703/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspect-charged-strangling-pregnant-woman-article-1.1430110">her missing on August 7</a>. Marotte&apos;s body was found in the park on Thursday. The ME&apos;s office is still conducting an autopsy, but it&apos;s suspected that the pair had a dispute over money and that Martin strangled Marotte and struck her on the head. </p>

<p>The Post notes that in front of Martin&apos;s home, there are missing posters of Marotte.</p>
