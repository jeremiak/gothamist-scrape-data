										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_06_eastcrane.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_06_eastcrane.jpg" width="320" height="181" class="image-left"> </span>On March 15, 2008, a towering construction crane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/15/midtown_crane_c.php">fell from East 51st Street and 2nd Avenue</a>, across East 51st, with the top section crashing onto a townhouse on East 50th Street. The collapse killed seven people; one survivor, a resident of the East 50th Street, testified in the trial of the crane&apos;s rigging contractor.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/nyregion/24crane.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">John Gallego said</a>, &quot;I hear something like breaking, like when a train, let&#x2019;s say a train is crashing. I look up through the window and I see a huge thing coming down.&quot;  He was buried alive for four hours, &quot;It was so quiet at one point that I was thinking I was dead.&quot;</p>

<p>Rigging contractor William Rapetti is on trial for manslaughter, as prosecutors say he used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/18/with_seven_dead.php">worn nylon slings</a> to lift up a 12,000 pound component <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/06/manhattan_da_accuses_crane_rigger_o.php">which gave way and led to the deaths</a>.  Rapetti, who opted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/crane_slay_trial_to_skip_jury_ByV07BSxApSBcLMX5kRTBP">forgo a jury trial</a>, claims that the crane itself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/trial_opens_for_rigger_in_crane_jOlB9CEFctimFbKQqFJn9J">wasn&apos;t properly anchored</a>. Six of the seven people killed were construction workers; one was Gallego&apos;s friend who was visiting from out of town.</p>

<p>A tape of Gallego&apos;s frantic 911 call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/06/24/2010-06-24_crane_rigger_jury_hears_buried_vics_call_to_911.html">was also played</a>:</p>

<p>It took firefighters two hours and 40 minutes to rescue Gallego.  He underwent numerous surgeries over five days. He told reporters after his testimony, &quot;I just want to get on with my life. I don&apos;t blame nobody.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150733/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/crane.collapse.east.2.1770372.html">Rapetti told WCBS 2,</a> &quot;I have faith in God; that he will not send me where the voice of God will not protect me. I will be vindicated.&quot; </p>
