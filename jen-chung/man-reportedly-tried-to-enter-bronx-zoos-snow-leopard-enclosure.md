<p>A man was removed from the Bronx Zoo after allegedly trying to breach the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093406/https://bronxzoo.com/exhibits/himalayan-highlands">Himalayn Highlands exhibit</a>, where the snow leopards and red pandas are kept, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093406/http://nypost.com/2016/06/26/crazed-cat-lover-tries-to-jump-into-bronx-zoo-exhibit/">according to a NY Post report</a>.</p>

<p>The man was not arrested, but his &quot;season pass&quot; (likely a zoo membership) was revoked, per the Post&apos;s sources. </p>

<p>The Wildlife Conservation Society, which has not commented on the incident and manages the Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo and New York Aquarium, actively works to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093406/https://www.wcs.org/our-work/species/snow-leopards">conserve the snow leopard population</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093406/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/19/snow_leopards_1.php">Three snow leopards</a> have been born in the Bronx Zoo since 2013.</p>

<p>Nearly four years ago, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093406/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/breaking_man_jumped_into_the_tiger.php">jumped from the Bronx Zoo&apos;s monorail into the tiger enclosure</a>, where he was mauled.
