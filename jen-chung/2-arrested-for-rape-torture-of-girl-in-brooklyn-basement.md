Anthony King and Kevin Evans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150725095059/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-girl-raped-beaten-in-brooklyn-basement,0,287921.story">were charged </a>with rape against a physically helpless person and unlawful imprisonment.</p>

<p>According to the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office, Evans picked up the girl and her friend and took them to NJ to use heroin on April 27. But when they returned to Brooklyn, prosecutors say the friend was dropped off but the 14-year-old was &quot;not allowed to exit the automobile.&quot; He allegedly took her to his home on President Street where he handcuffed her to a chair and injected her with drugs. The girl was also scalded with boiling water.  </p>

<p>The Daily News reports, &quot;King, who lives in the neighborhood, eventually joined Evans in raping and beating the girl, sources said. The drugged and savaged girl drifted in and out of consciousness until Tuesday, when she woke up and realized she was uncuffed and that another woman was in the basement, sources said.&quot;  When the girl found out no one else was in the house, she ran off and called her mother.  The girl had been reported missing but &quot;a police source described her as a &apos;chronic missing person,&apos; a known drug user and a prostitute.&quot;</p>

<p>Neighbors were not surprised about the violence.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150725095059/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/klyn_basement_kid_rape_torture_Vu3AGLATU8DvfcaDJFJPDO">One told the Post </a>that the living arrangement at Evan&apos;s house (he lived there with foster siblings) were like the &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150725095059/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/05/16/2010-05-16_thugs_in_teens_rape_were_neighbors_from_hell.html">another said to the News</a>, &quot;We all knew there were bad things happening at that house.&quot; A third said, &quot;In the summer, neighbors would call the cops every other night. They were the neighbors from hell. [Evans is] going to be a guest at Hotel Rikers Island, and I think everyone is relieved.&quot;</p>
