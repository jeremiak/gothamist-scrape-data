Long Beach City Manager Charles Theofan said, &quot;Unfortunately, not even the best swimmer could survive in water that rough and that cold.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Yesterday&apos;s hot, sticky day brought out sunbathers and swimmers to Long Beach, which doesn&apos;t officially open for swimming until this weekend (which means there weren&apos;t any lifeguards).  There were a number of calls about swimmers or surfers in distress, and during one of them, Long Beach police officer Paul DeMarco drove his police SUV onto the beach&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160542/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/26/sunbather_run_over_long_island_poli.php">right over sunbather Marshall Starkman</a>. </p>

<p>The 43-year-old has a broken spine and was taken to Nassau University Medical Center. He<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160542/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/officials-police-suv-strikes-sunbather-in-long-beach-1.1953366"> told Newsday</a>, &quot;I&apos;m alive, but in a lot of pain.&quot; As for when the incident occurred, &quot;I was literally just sitting on my chaise longue on the beach&quot; while talking on the phone and playing the radio... Honestly, it hit me out of the blue. The only thing I can remember is getting hit. Not knowing what it was. Realizing that I&apos;m alive.&quot; </p>

<p>Starkman also says that he didn&apos;t hear a siren or horn.  A witness said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160542/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/li_beach_horror_TnIdrkbW1hrDljLkoGtDLK">saw tire tracks on Starkman&apos;s chest</a>, &quot;When he first hit him, he stopped. <strong>Then he accelerated and went over him while people were yelling. I guess he didn&apos;t see him and went right over him.</strong> It was just a horrible accident.&quot;  The Long Beach Police asked the Nassau County Police to conduct an independent investigation of the incident.</p>

<p>Another swimmer who went missing off Jones Beach last night is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160542/http://wcbstv.com/cbs2crew/police.suv.sunbather.2.1718007.html">presumed dead</a> and a surfer in Rockaway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160542/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rockaway_hero_surfer_saves_PHLc05gTmtPwRcejpJFXwL">saved three drowning teens</a>.</p>
