title: MTA Removes Subway Ad Showing Woman's Strangled Head In Plastic Bag
---

	
										<p>A subway ad that has upset more than a few passengers has been removed, after the MTA decided it violated its advertising policies (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://web.mta.info/mta/realestate/PDF/MTA_Ad_Policy_April_2015.PDF">PDF</a>).</p>

<p>The ad, promoting a Haunted Hay Ride attraction on Randall&apos;s Island, is still running on trains, but not for long. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://www.wnyc.org/story/halloween-subway-ad-pulled/">WNYC reports that after it made inquiries</a>, the transit agency said, &quot;MTA has determined the ad violates our ad policy - specifically that it is &apos;so violent, frightening, or otherwise disturbing as to reasonably be deemed harmful to minors&apos; and we have instructed our advertising contractor to have the ad pulled immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>The MTA doesn&apos;t approve ads on the subway&#x2014;its advertising contractor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://www.outfrontmedia.com/">Outfront Media</a>, does&#x2014;and while political ads <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/08/political_subway_ads.php">are currently banned</a>, other provocative ads are allowed. For instance, the ads for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/subway_ads_mta.php">Thinx, the &quot;period&quot; underwear</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://www.amny.com/transit/thinx-period-underwear-subway-ads-offended-me-mta-chief-says-1.11022451">offended MTA chairman</a> Thomas Prendergast, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-approves-underwear-ads-targeting-women-period-article-1.2415366">still ran</a>.</p>

<p>MTA board member Charles Moerdler told WNYC, &quot;In my view, [the haunted hayride ad] demonstrates not just a lack of taste, but a clear absence of taste. Unfortunately, under the case law as it&apos;s been coming down from the federal court of appeals, there&apos;s not much the MTA can do about it.&quot;  </p>

<p>Last year, the MTA allowed Amazon to completely cover the S shuttle train between Times Square and Grand Central Terminal with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/nazi_mta_subway_castle.php">Nazi-imagery ads for their fantasy series</a> <em>Man In the High Castle</em>, which imagines the world if Axis powers won World War II. Amazon eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020413/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/24/amazon_nazi_ad_deniers.php">decided to pull them</a>.</p>
