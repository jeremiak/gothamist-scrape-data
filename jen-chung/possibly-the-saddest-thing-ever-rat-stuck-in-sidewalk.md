</div></div>					<p>Reader Wayne sent us this photograph and explains, &quot;I was walking along and texting. Not really paying that much attention. Then something caught my eye. I thought I was about to step in dog shit, but quickly realized it was a rat stuck in the sidewalk. A big rat. It had tried to squeeze through a crack in the sidewalk and failed.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714170352/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/possibly_the_saddest_thing_ever_rat.php#comment-2372712">reader</a> created the second photograph in the gallery, adding, &quot;hopefully this makes it a little better!&quot;</p>

<p>We are still awaiting a reply from Wayne to ask if he tried to help the little guy (or gal) out, where it was located and whether we needed to send out a rescue squad.  And if you want to pass the time with some Photoshopped sad rat images... well, you can send them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714170352/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tips@gothamist.com</a> and we&apos;ll compile them into a gallery later.</p>

<p><b>Update 7:50 p.m.</b>: We&apos;ve added some of the rat-in-sidewalk Photoshops&#x2014;if you&apos;re not doing anything this Friday night, send &apos;em our way!</p>

<p><b>Update 10/24</b>:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714170352/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/24/sad_rat_in_sidewalk_forever.php">More Photoshopped Sad Rat photographs here</a>, plus a poll asking what you would do if you saw a rat emerging from a sidewalk.  And Wayne got back to our questions. He says, &quot;It was on my block on the Upper West Side. 82nd Street between CPW and Columbus. I thought it was alive, but after getting up the nerve to poke it with a (long) stick, I realized he was dead. I did what any wonderful caring masculine New Yorker would do, I told the doorman about it and ran off to work. That night the sidewalk with spic and span. I hear the Eulogy was beautiful and moved some to tears.&quot;</p>
