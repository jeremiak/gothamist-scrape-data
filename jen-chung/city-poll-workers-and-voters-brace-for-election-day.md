<p>With only six days to go until Election Day, we should all be excited or relieved to finally cast our ballots and leave the worrying for when we wait for returns.  But all signs are pointing to a rough day for NYC&apos;s 4.6 million voters, courtesy of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515154137/http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/">NYC Board of Elections</a>--and Mayor Bloomberg.  For instance, this is what BOE official Frederic Umane said yesterday, &quot;<strong>We just hope that people would be as patient when they try to vote as they would be trying to wait for a hamburger at one of the more fancy hamburger places, which I understand the lines can be up to two or three hours.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, the NY Times led the charge, with an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515154137/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/opinion/28tue2.html">editorial slamming the NYC BOE</a> as an &quot;<strong>arcane and secretive body</strong>&quot;- -a &quot;<strong>nest of good old-fashioned patronage that Boss Tweed and the boys down at Tammany Hall would have admired</strong>&quot;-- and wondered about a &quot;purge of more than 30,000 voters&quot; as well as the hundreds of thousands of new registrations its recently received.  Plus, the editorial says Bloomberg has &quot;made things worse in the short term,&quot; cutting funds to the board and not funding extra workers to help on Election Day.</p>

<p>Umane suggests voting at mid-day, when lines are generally the shortest (since many people vote on the way to or from work).  Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515154137/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/nyregion/29ballots.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">Times speaks</a> to some voters in search of absentee ballots at the BOE office in Manhattan; one said, &quot;It&#x2019;s more a matter of incompetence than anything else. They&#x2019;re extremely disorganized. They don&#x2019;t even seem to know what information people need. We were sitting here two and a half hours, and we had the voter ID cards and nobody thought to ask for them until just now.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Next Tuesday, November 4, polls open at 6 a.m. and close at 9 p.m.  Here&apos;s the NYC Board of Elections&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515154137/http://gis.nyc.gov/vote/ps/index.htm">poll site locator</a>.  For more questions, call 866-VOTE-NYC (the Times notes that the calls are also forwarded to 311 &quot;if operators are overwhelmed&quot;).</p>
