</div></div>					<p>A second-story deck behind a historic Brooklyn mansion collapsed just after midnight. At least 13 were injured. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028101208/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/second-story-deck-collapse-brooklyn-injures-13-people-article-1.2661701">One woman told the Daily News</a>, &quot;The worse thing that probably could have happened, happened. No one died though luckily.&quot; </p>

<p>The deck at 670 Bushwick Avenue gave way around 12:30 a.m., during a party. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028101208/http://abc7ny.com/news/several-injured-when-deck-collapses-during-party-in-brooklyn/1372135/">WABC 7 reports</a> that there was a &quot;party when it suddenly fell.&quot; <strike>A fire official said to the News that &quot;as many as 50 people were&quot; on the structure.</strike> <b>Update</b>: A resident tells us that about 50 people were at the party and 16 people were on the deck at the time.</p>

<p>The partygoer who spoke to the News said she was not on the deck during the collapse and also described the incident as &quot;f---ing insane.&quot;</p>

<p>FDNY Battalion Chief Dennis Murphy hypothesized, &quot;I think just old age and rot and disrepair, it just wasn&apos;t maintained properly.&quot;</p>

<p>The building, known as the Cook Mansion (or the Catherina Lipsius House), was designed by  Theobald Engelhardt in the &quot;American Round-Arched&quot; style and built in 1890, for Catherina Lipsius and her family; they owned the Claus Lipsius Brewing Company. It was named a landmark in 2013, and the Landmarks Preservation Committee said, &quot;Despite some alterations over time, the house remains remarkably intact and serves as a rare surviving reminder of the late 19th century period when the German immigrant community flourished in Bushwick and the manufacture and consumption of beer was a major part of the lives of people in this community.&quot;</p>

<p>The building has been divided into apartments; in 2014, a one-bedroom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028101208/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/bushwick_mansion_rent.php">was renting for $1750/month</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028101208/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3434083">listing for a two-bedroom, $2500/month</a>, appears to show the apartment with the second-floor approximately 8&apos; x 22&apos; deck.</p>

<p>The victims suffered injuries including a broken leg and broken ankles. Battalion Chief Murphy explained, &quot;It seems like the victims rode the deck down, no one was trapped under the deck.&quot;</p>
