<p>This week&apos;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em> will be a special show devoted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/22/prince_tribute_rip.php">Prince</a>. The episode, dubbed &quot;Goodnight, Sweet Prince,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live"> was announced on SNL&apos;s website</a>.</p>

<p>The iconoclastic star first performed on the program in 1981. Charlene Tilton was the host and Todd Rundgren was the musical guest, but then-producer Jean Doumanian wanted to book Prince, so he ended up going on at the end. In 2014, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/10/30/the-first-time-prince-could-have-saved-saturday-night-live/">she told the Washington Post</a> that she &quot;remember[ed] getting a tape from Prince&#x2019;s agent. He was just 22, hot off opening for Rick James but still more than a year away from releasing his breakthrough, &apos;1999.&apos;&quot; She said, &quot; was blown away. He was just the most original act I had seen in a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>He performed &quot;Partyup&quot;&#x2014;this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDEzNzQwMDMy.html">Japanese site has video of the segment</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/may/01/todd-rundgren-interview">Rundgren recalled the show</a>, &quot;My most interesting experience with Prince was on Saturday Night Live. I was wearing a slightly racy costume in which my, er, package was prominently displayed. And there were some complaints. Then Prince came on for his first national TV appearance and he wore a pair of tidy-whitey underpants and a big cape. So no matter what anyone had to say about my costume, it became all about Prince in his underwear.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Prince returned in 2006, when Steve Martin hosted, singing and playing &quot;Fury&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/http://tvpot.daum.net/v/vbcb1xTxsTx1376oU2s96C2">video</a>) and &quot;Beautiful, Loved and Blessed.&quot; In 2014, when Chris Rock returned to host, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/02/videos_chris_rock_prince_ebola_joke.php#photo-13">Prince appeared with 3rdeyegirl</a>, playing a medley of &quot;Clouds&quot;, &quot;Marz&quot; and &quot;Another Love.&quot; </p>

<p>He also performed at the 1989 SNL 15th anniversary special and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090834/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/17/party_documented.php">played the after-party at the 40th anniversary</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, one of cast member Fred Armisen&apos;s most popular recurring characters was Prince:</p>
