<p>However Anthony Ruccatano points out, &quot;We would all be out of business&quot; if there was such a rule limiting customers to tanning beds to once a week.  When Ruccatano <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617121211/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/tanorexic_nj_mom_tans_about_20_days.php">spoke to us</a> last month, he said the law allowed someone to come every 24 hours. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617121211/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/nutley_salon_frequented_by_tan.html">he told the Star-Ledger</a> that people usually tan three times a week, &quot;for reasons such as treating skin conditions, depression as well as to enhance their appearance.&quot;</p>

<p>Krentcil was accused of child endangerment for allegedly taking her fair-skinned 6-year-old child into a Nutley, NJ tanning booth, after a school nurse saw a severe burn on the little girl&apos;s arm...and after the little girl said, &quot;I went tanning with Mommy.&quot; Krentcil denied the charges, saying that her daughter got burned while playing outside.  She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617121211/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/nj_tanning_my_kids_are_mad_everyone.php">has said in recent weeks</a>, &quot;I didn&apos;t do anything. Is there&apos;s something wrong about getting your nails done or somebody who smokes to much or someone who overeats&#x2026; if this was such a problem, why didn&apos;t anyone say anything?&quot;</p>
