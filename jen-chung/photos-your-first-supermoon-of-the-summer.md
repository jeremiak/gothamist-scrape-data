<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015747/http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/supermoon.html">Let the experts at NASA put your tax dollars to work</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;Supermoon is a situation when the moon is slightly closer to Earth in its orbit than on average, and this effect is most noticeable when it occurs at the same time as a full moon. So, the moon may seem bigger although the difference in its distance from Earth is only a few percent at such times.<br>
It is called a supermoon because this is a very noticeable alignment that at first glance would seem to have an effect. The &apos;super&apos; in supermoon is really just the appearance of being closer, but unless we were measuring the Earth-Moon distance by laser rangefinders (as we do to track the LRO [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter] spacecraft in low lunar orbit and to watch the Earth-Moon distance over years), there is really no difference. The supermoon really attests to the wonderful new wealth of data NASA&apos;s LRO mission has returned for the Moon, making several key science questions about our nearest neighbor all the more important.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The next supermoons are on August 10 and September 9. </p>
