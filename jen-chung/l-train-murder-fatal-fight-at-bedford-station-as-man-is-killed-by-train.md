<p>Last night, a fight between two men spilled from the L train, onto the Bedford Avenue platform, and then onto the subway tracks. What started as a verbal altercation on the train, eventually escalated and resulted in both men falling onto the tracks&#x2014;while one managed to get out, the other was hit and crushed by a Manhattan-bound train.  The victim, Joshua Basin, 20 of Howard Beach, was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital, while the other man, described as a white male between 30 and 35 years old, fled.  [<strong>Update</strong>] Police released a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110062611/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/24/police_release_sketch_of_l_train_mu.php">sketch of the suspect</a>.</p>

<p>According to police, they received 911 calls around 10 p.m. and say that the man who fled was the one who started the physical altercation as the pair were leaving the train. The NYPD says this a homicide and they&apos;re looking for the suspect, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110062611/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/24/police_release_sketch_of_l_train_mu.php">who is described as</a> being a white male, between 30 and 35 years old, with a thin build, light complexion, dirty blond hair with pock marks on the right side of his face. </p>

<p>Numerous people saw the incident. A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110062611/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-struck-train-critically-injured-williamsburg-station-article-1.1050148">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;Two guys were fighting on the tracks. One of them got trapped between the platform and the train... I had a sickening feeling. He was still breathing heavy and trapped from the waist down. He seemed like he was in shock.&quot;</p>
