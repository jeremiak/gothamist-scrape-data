<p>At this time, the NYPD was unable to provide any information about possible arrests or injuries. However, City Councilman Jumaane Williams had some tough words:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164420/https://twitter.com/JumaaneWilliams/status/312009452326891521">Williams did thank</a> those who &quot;respected the family of Kiki&apos;s wishes, didn&apos;t march &amp; remained at the peaceful vigil tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier today, it was revealed that Kimani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164420/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/kimani_gray_shot_7_times_by_nypd_3.php">was shot seven times</a> by police officers. The NYPD has said two plainclothes police officers saw him acting in a suspicious manner and appearing to reach for his waistband at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday night. When they approached him, he allegedly aimed a gun at them so they fired for a combined 11 rounds.</p>

<p> While the police have said that witnesses heard the cops say &quot;Freeze&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t move,&quot; one witness insists that the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164420/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/witness_claims_kimani_gray_was_not.php"> teen was not holding a gun</a> and had backed away from cops with his hands up.</p>
