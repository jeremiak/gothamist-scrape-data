<p>Robert Kraft may be a self-made billionaire (and Columbia graduate) who owns the New England Patriots, but he&apos;s also merely a 71-year-old man who loves helping out his 32-year-old girlfriend prepare an audition tape.  <br>

<p>Kraft&apos;s wife died last year; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015023/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/11/bob-kraft-ricki-noel-lander-audition-video_n_1664980.html?utm_hp_ref=sports">Huffington Post notes</a>, &quot;Noted for her philanthropy, Myra was honored by the Patriots during the team&apos;s recent Super Bowl run by an MHK patch on the uniforms.&quot;</p>

<p>The Patriots just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015023/http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/eye-on-football/19560631/robert-kraft-ricki-noel-lander-audition-video-is-just-bizarre">released a statement from Kraft</a>, &quot;I tried to help Ricki prepare an audition tape for an upcoming Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson comedy by reading Wilson&apos;s lines. I never intended that it would be made public and I regret that it has. I think we can all agree that Owen Wilson has nothing to worry about. I am going to stick to my day job.&quot;</p>
