Shahzad passed all the criminal and national security background checks required for citizenship, the Associated Press reported.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074852/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/nyregion/05bomb.html?hp">According to the NY Times</a>, Shahzad  &quot;has made statements implicating himself&quot; and &quot;told the authorities that he had acted alone.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074852/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/times_square_bomb_suspect_says_he_y3UdNXWIQCANGgDwg3TRjI">eight people have been arrested</a> in Pakistan and one of those people allegedly met with Shahzad in Karachi.   It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074852/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/04/2010-05-04_times_square_bomb_plot_suspect_faisal_shahzad_says_he_acted_alone_traced_by_cell.html">also believed</a> that three other people helped purchase ingredients for the failed Times Square bomb.</p>

<p>Authorities apparently found a loaded handgun in the Isuzu Trooper that Shahzad drove to JFK Airport. Shahzad was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074852/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/04/hispanic_or_middle_eastern_man_boug.php"> apprehended last night</a> while on a plane from NYC to Dubai and the plane had to be called back to the gate.  The Times says, &quot;All of the passengers were taken off, and they, their luggage and the Boeing 777 were screened before the flight was allowed to depart, about seven hours late, at 6:29 a.m. Two other men were also interviewed by authorities but were released, according to one law enforcement official. It was not known when Mr. Shahzad bought his ticket.</p>
