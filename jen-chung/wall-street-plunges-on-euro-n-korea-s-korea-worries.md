<p>The U.S. stock markets fell this morning, due to ongoing concerns about the European debt crisis and the conflict between North Korea and South Korea.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161613/http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-25/stocks-commodities-slump-on-korea-spanish-banks-u-s-index-futures-drop.html">Bloomberg News reports</a>, &quot;Stocks plunged from Tokyo to London and New York, dragging the MSCI World Index to a nine-month low, and commodities slid as concern grew that Spain&#x2019;s ailing banks signal a widening debt crisis and as tension mounted on the Korean peninsula... The MSCI gauge of 23 developed nations&#x2019; stocks fell 2.9 percent at 10:55 a.m. in New York to the lowest intraday level since August.&quot;</p>

<p>A currency strategist says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like Murphy&#x2019;s law. When you don&#x2019;t want something to happen, it happens. The Korea story&quot;&#x2014;North Korea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161613/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10156834.stm">announced it&apos;s severing all ties</a> to South Korea&#x2014;&quot;just happens at the wrong time when the global market is already jittery. I worry more about what&#x2019;s going on in Europe. We&#x2019;re going back to nervousness about the banking sector.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Dow is currently under 10,000, at 9875 (down 1.9%); the Nasdaq lost 2.13% and S&amp;P; 500 fell 1.95%. </p>
