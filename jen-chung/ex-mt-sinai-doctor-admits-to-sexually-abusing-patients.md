<p>A once respected emergency room physician is facing prison as part of a plea deal in which he admitted drugging and sexually assaulting female patients. Dr. David Newman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://nypost.com/2016/12/16/ex-doc-admits-to-sexually-assaulting-er-patients/">now faces up to two years in prison</a>; if the case went to trial and he was convicted, his sentence could have been up to seven years. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_01_davidnewman12.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_01_davidnewman12.jpg" width="250" height="327"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> Dr. David Newman</i></div> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-mount-sinai-doc-accused-ejaculating-patient-article-1.2496055">In January</a>, a 22-year-old patient visited the hospital&apos;s ER for shoulder pain; during her visit, she claimed that after a nurse had given her morphine for pain, Newman gave her another dose even though she told him she was already given some. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/14/doctor_sex_assault.php">She said that she heard some noises</a> and felt someone touch her breast and something on her face and mouth before Newman allegedly ejaculated on her.<p></p>

<p>The patient was very medicated as Newman wiped her off but she kept the hospital blanket and gown, which was later tested and reportedly tested positive for semen. </p>

<p>Soon after, a second patient came forward to say that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/20/mt_sinai_doctor_sex_assault.php">Newman had molested her</a> and, by late March, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/24/mt_sinai_doctor_assault.php">indicted for sexually assaulting four patients</a>. </p>

<p>Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said, &quot;I would like to thank these brave women for their strength in coming forward, and encourage any other additional potential victims to call our Sex Crimes Hotline at 212-335-9373.&quot;</p>

<p>The DNA on the patient matched Newman&apos;s. When detectives questioned him, Newman reportedly had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/mt_sinai_doctor_semen.php">this explanation for why semen was on her face</a>: &quot;I treated that woman in the ER for shoulder pain... I am embarrassed because I wacked off in the lounge, and it was possible that the ejaculate may have gone from my hands to the woman&#x2019;s blanket... Semen may have also transferred from my hand to her face during the time I treated her.&quot;</p>

<p>In court today, Newman revealed that in addition to assaulting and ejaculating on the 22-year-old woman in January, he actually groped her during an earlier visit. He also said he abused three other women. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://nypost.com/2016/12/16/ex-doc-admits-to-sexually-assaulting-er-patients/">From the Post</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I administered an unnecessary dose of Propofol [to one victim], causing [her] to be unable to speak or respond, leaving her unconscious and masturbating next to her,&#x201D; Newman told the judge.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;On three other occasions, I unnecessarily touched the patients during treatment,&#x201D; Newman added. &#x201C;These compulsions twisted my brain, and I am so deeply sorry to all of these victims.&#x201D;</p>

<p>[Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Michael] Obus told Newman, &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve gotten yourself into a very bad position here.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Newman, a prominent doctor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCk_vTkS6bU">who has given Ted Talks</a> and  written an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218181536/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/opinion/at-the-er-bearing-witness-to-gun-violence.html">op-ed for the NY Times about gun violence</a>, is free on $50,000 bail. He will be sentenced next month.<p></p>
