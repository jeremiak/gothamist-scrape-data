<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> A four-year-old boy slipped through a gap between an elevator and the wall at a Brooklyn parking garage last night, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055842/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/25/boy-down-elevator/">dropping some 50 feet</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>The incident occurred around 8 p.m. at 841 Union Street, at a parking garage condominium; a listing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055842/https://www.halstead.com/sale/ny/brooklyn/park-slope/841-union-street/condo/13231073">offers a spot for $279,000</a>. </p>

<p>The staff usually takes the cars up and down. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055842/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Boy-Falls-Down-Elevator-Shaft-Park-Slope-Brooklyn-380903441.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;Although residents normally don&apos;t go up to their cars, the parents wanted to grab something quickly, so an attendant made an exception and went up with them. The parents lost sight of their boy for just a moment and he somehow fell through a 10-inch gap between the elevator and the third floor.&quot;</p>

<p>The Department of Building&apos;s listing for the building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055842/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ComplaintsByAddressServlet?requestid=1&amp;allbin=3019896">notes a complaint</a>, &quot;OEM REQUESTS AN INSPECTION DUE TO A CHILD FALLING DOWN AN ELEVATOR SHAFT.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy was rushed to Methodist Hospital and is in critical condition. The garage manager told NBC New York that &quot;he didn&apos;t know how the boy fell down the elevator shaft and that it has never happened to anyone before.&quot; He also said he would visit the boy.</p>

<p><strong>Update 11:58 a.m.</strong>: The NYPD says that the boy has died.</p>
