										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2014_03_maurysurprise.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405035353im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_03_maurysurprise.jpg" width="365" height="274"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Whoa!</i></div> A couple was arrested Tuesday night for domestic violence at a Norwalk, Connecticut hotel. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405035353/http://www.thehour.com/news/norwalk/couple-slated-to-be-on-maury-show-arrested-for-domestic/article_9f019618-7c3a-528a-bed0-b1018159b054.html">According to The Hour</a>, the woman &quot;said that the two were slated to appear on Maury Povich&apos;s talk show, and she became upset after finding out that [John] Coley slept with her mother, according to police.&quot;<p></p>

<p>It appears that when police arrived at the DoubleTree hotel, they found Shantae McGhee-Brown, 25, wearing a towel in the hallway; police says she admitted she threw a vase and broke a table during her fight with Coley. Then Coley, 47, came upstairs and said that McGhee-Brown had been fighting with a different John Coley.</p>

<p>The Hour reports that McGhee-Brown and Coley are being held on $100,000 bail. It&apos;s unclear if The Maury Show, which films in Stamford, will chip in to get them out and on the show. At any rate, we can&apos;t help but recall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405035353/http://rapgenius.com/Beastie-boys-3-minute-rule-lyrics">the immortal words of Mike D</a>, who once rapped: &quot;I&apos;m out of your backdoor and into another / your boyfriend doesn&apos;t know about me and your mother.&quot;</p>
