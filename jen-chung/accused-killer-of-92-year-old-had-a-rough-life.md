Jamal Blair is being held without bail and his lawyer is trying to explain that his client has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140313/http://wcbstv.com/local/sadie.mitchell.arrest.2.1266838.html">had a tough childhood</a>, &quot;In 1993 he was 2 years old and witnessed his father murder his mother. He stayed with his mother&apos;s body until his grandparents found discovered what happened almost a day later. It still stays with him.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Shahron Williams van Rooij, daughter of victim Sadie Mitchell, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140313/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/10/23/2009-10-23_lawyer_bronx_teen_who_killed_92yearold_sadie_mitchell_had_rough_life_watched_fat.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I&apos;m not buying any of it. He is culpable. Period. End of story.&quot; Prosecutors also pointed out that Blair confessed to police, &quot;I was coming from school. I was walking with two of my friends....I shot one shot in the air. I threw the gun into the crowd.&quot; That one shot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140313/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/anger_over_beloved_bronx_womans_dea.php">entered Mitchell&apos;s house</a> and hit her in her hip and traveled into her lungs.  She died at Jacobi Hospital.  </p>

<p>When being escorted from the precinct house on Thursday night, Blair <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140313/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/teen_arrested_in_bronx_womans_killi.php">claimed </a>the police framed him.  His lawyer thinks the second-degree murder charge is too harsh and believes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140313/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/man_who_shot_granny_saw_his_mother_4aNYoy3SAdZpApwpzs2ayM">manslaughter is more appropriate</a> for Blair to face.</p>

<p>Police still haven&apos;t recovered the gun, which Blair reportedly said he threw into another yard.</p>
