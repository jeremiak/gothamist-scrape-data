<p>Why does Apple insist on making their glass-facade stores so glassy?  That&apos;s what one Long Island grandmother wants to know, after walking into a glass door at the Manhasset Apple Store.  Evelyn Paswall, 83, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144258/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pane_suffering_at_the_apple_store_S3xMnbHvrSjn1KPmSvkhQK">suing Apple for $1 million</a> and her lawyer says, &quot;Apple wants to be cool and modern and have the type of architecture that would appeal to the tech crowd. But on the other hand, they have to appreciate the danger that this high-tech modern architecture poses to some people.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144258/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pane_suffering_at_the_apple_store_S3xMnbHvrSjn1KPmSvkhQK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Post has the scoop on the allegedly hazardous conditions</a> that Apple is encouraging.  See, Paswall had no idea that there was a door ahead (since you can, you know, see through glass!) and she claims she &quot;smashed her face against it, breaking her nose. In her suit, she argues that Apple should have put marks on the glass that older people could spot before they come face-to-face with disaster.&quot; The suit says Apple &quot;was negligent...in allowing a clear, see-through glass wall and/or door to exist without proper warning.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the Manhasset store now has &quot;small white warning strips&quot; on the glass (though it&apos;s unclear if the granny vs. glass incident prompted it) and her lawyer continues, &quot;There were no markings on the glass or they were inadequate. My client is an octogenarian. She sees well, but she did not see any glass. The stereotypical Apple customer is a Gen-Y person or a teenager or a college student, but they have to realize that the elderly generation are their customers, too.&quot;  Translation: Grannies have money!</p>
