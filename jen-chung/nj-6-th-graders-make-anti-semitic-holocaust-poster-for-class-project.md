<p>A NJ school district has removed a poster that some sixth graders created, in response to a fictional book about the Holocaust, after a Jewish staffer took offense. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413002416/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2014/04/offensive_holocaust_poster_removed_from_fairview_school_after_staff_member_complaint.html">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;One of the posters&#x2014;shown above&#x2014;features a swastika interlocked with the Star of David, red droplets on the Israeli flag that appear to be blood, photographs of Jewish children with Xs through their faces, magazine cut-outs of a number of prohibited foods (like cupcakes and meats), and scenes from the Warsaw ghetto.&quot;</p>

<p>The poster was hanging in the hall at Lincoln Elementary School in Fairview. The staffer who complained, an Orthodox Jew who doesn&apos;t work at the school but works in the district, said there wasn&apos;t any information about why the poster was up: &quot;It&apos;s highly offensive to anybody, especially someone who is Jewish and whose family members were survivors of the Holocaust.&quot; She also said there was no context explaining what the poster was for.</p>

<p>She expressed her concern to the principal, who allegedly did nothing. But the Fairview Superintendent, Louis DeLisio, ordered that the poster be taken down yesterday, &quot;I run across this every once in a while, where one sector of our population is offended, and we always try to compromise. We&apos;re not trying to offend anyone... my true feeling is they (the students) did not have any ill-intention with this poster. They were trying to depict things that were prohibited during the Holocaust.&quot; Right, like the Israeli flag&#x2014;which was created <em>after</em> the Holocaust. </p>

<p>Further, DeLisio told the Star-Ledger that the teacher behind the class project was &quot;very upset&quot; that another staffer was so upset. The teacher also happens to be engaged to a Jewish man. </p>

<p>Last year, a third-grader in NJ was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413002416/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/n-j-school-criticized-for-counseling-kid-who-drew-swastika">counseled after he drew a swastika in a tree</a> for a school assignment. The student reportedly is Hindu, and the Raelians (those believing that life on Earth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413002416/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlism">was created by aliens</a>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413002416/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2013/01/raelians_defend_old_bridge_thi.html">pointed out</a>, &quot;The swastika is part of the official Raelian symbol.  There cannot be a more sacred symbol for us Raelians and this is also the case for the billions of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and members of other religions on this planet.&quot;</p>
