<p>Nike released the  Air Jordan 11 Retro &quot;Concord&quot; at midnight, and the $180 sneakers caused a stir at shopping malls across the country, to the point where reports of violence spurred a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053835/http://dcist.com/2011/12/no_there_was_not_a_murder_here_over.php">hoax Tweet that one person was killed for the shoes</a>.  Over in the NYC-area, there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053835/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/air-jordan-stampede-hits-local-mall-1223111324663046309">stampede at the Burlington Center Mall in NJ</a> and a scuffle at the Staten Island Mall with at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053835/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/air_jordan_madness_at_the_stat.html">two people being taken into custody</a>.</p>

<p>According to the Staten Island Advance, six stores at the mall were selling the shoes and &quot;thousands of people -- some of whom had waited on line for most of the day -- rushed to score a pair of the coveted Air Jordan XI sneakers.... The trouble began about 7:30 p.m., when folks discovered that the tickets they were holding for the midnight sale were useless, and some 2,000 of them made a dash for the front of the line, at the entrance to JCPenney. The line stretched back to Macy&apos;s, halfway across the Mall.&quot;</p>

<p>One man, who had tickets was waiting on line with his son and nephew <strong>SINCE 2:30 PM</strong>, wasn&apos;t impressed with the lack of security and had predicted &quot;mayhem&quot; (he was right!).  Another person said, &quot;They can&apos;t handle crowd control. Look at something as small as a sneaker line. They can&apos;t handle it,&quot; while another lamented society, &quot;It was like a riot going on. This is disgusting. This is for a stupid sneaker. If this is what they&apos;re teaching our kids in schools and what their parents are teaching, then we have a huge problem.&quot;</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Indianapolis Police Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053835/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/nike-air-jordan-xi-concord-shopping-frenzy/story?id=15220618#.TvTy_SNSSFd">told ABC News</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t remember anything like this in the recent past at all, definitely not with the iPhone or anything like that.&quot; And in suburban Atlanta, a woman left her <em>two toddlers in the car</em> while she went to buy the sneakers&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053835/http://www.13wmaz.com/news/article/158268/52/Woman-Leaves-Toddlers-in-Car-at-Air-Jordan-Sale-">the cops had to smash the car&apos;s windows to get the kids out</a>.</p>

<p>But at least there are many pairs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007053835/http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trkparms=65%253A12%257C66%253A2%257C39%253A6%257C72%253A5952&amp;rt=nc&amp;_nkw=air+jordan+11+concord&amp;_dmpt=US_Men_s_Shoes&amp;_sticky=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;_sop=10&amp;_sc=1">being sold for hundreds of dollars on eBay</a>!</p>
