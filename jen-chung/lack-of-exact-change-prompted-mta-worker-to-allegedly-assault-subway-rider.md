title: Lack Of Exact Change Prompted MTA Worker To Allegedly Assault Subway Rider
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:339px; "> <img alt="2012_02_jtejada.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317182401im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_jtejada.jpg" width="339" height="226"> <br> <i>Janet Ojeda</i></div> Yesterday, a MTA worker was arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317182401/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/mta_worker_allegedly_punched_subway.php">allegedly punching a subway rider in the face</a> at the 138th Street 6 train station in the Bronx.  Police said that Phylathia Monroe got out of the subway token booth to confront a passenger and then allegedly assaulted her.  Last night, the victim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317182401/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/03/15/mta-employee-arrested-for-allegedly-punching-bronx-straphanger/">Janet Ojeda, told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;She came [out] and she swung me against the gate and she picked me up with one hand and she was just looking straight into my eyes &#x2026; like&#x2026; I started seeing a blur. And I&#x2019;m trying to get air. And she could hear me, but she didn&#x2019;t let go. It was scary. All I was thinking was if I was going to see my family again.&quot;<p></p>

<p>This unfolded at 5:30 a.m. and apparently Monroe got impatient with Ojeda: &quot;Ojeda was going to work and was, she said, 10 cents short on a MetroCard when Monroe called for the next customer through. Ojeda said she found the dime, but that&#x2019;s when the argument began. She claimed Monroe got out of the booth, put her finger in her face and punched her.&quot;  </p>

<p>When Ojeda was freed, she went to a police station to file a report.  Her lawyer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317182401/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/mta_agent_attacks_YSN3cBzHyu6EJpMHeGdc2K?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Bronx">Justin Blitz, said</a>, &#x201C;This was a really big woman, and the victim is a really little lady,&quot; and added, &quot;We intend to look at all the legal remedies on her behalf, and we&#x2019;re confident we will be successful.&quot;  Ojeda said, &quot;I want justice. And she didn&#x2019;t just assault me, she tried to kill me.&quot; So a lawsuit is <em>totally</em> on the way.</p>
