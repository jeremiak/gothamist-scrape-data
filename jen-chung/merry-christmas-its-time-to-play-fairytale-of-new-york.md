<p>Mariah Carey is definitely the Queen of Christmas (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/arts/music/mariah-careys-list-is-short-all-she-wants-is-immortality.html?_r=0">the NY Times certainly thinks so</a>) thanks to her yuletide love song, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQViqx6GMY">&quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You,&quot;</a> which is on repeat everywhere throughout the holiday season. But for purists who insist that Christmas is a time of melancholy as well as celebration, the Pogues&apos; &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; is a must-listen on December 25th.</p>

<p>The song, about a couple who ends up spending Christmas in a drunk tank, was released in 1987 and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/fairytale-of-new-york-is-the-true-sound-of-christmas0/">originally censored by the BBC</a> for its language (check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/http://genius.com/The-pogues-fairytale-of-new-york-lyrics">lyrics here</a>). A few years ago, the Guardian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/dec/06/fairytale-new-york-pogues-christmas-anthem">offered a feature about how the song came to be</a>, which included fascinating details like how Kirsty MacColl was not the first choice for the female lead. Also:</p>

<blockquote>The Pogues shot the video in New York during Thanksgiving week. The air was bitterly cold and fairy lights twinkled in the trees. Matt Dillon played the NYPD officer who arrests MacGowan but he was too nervous to manhandle him until the shivering singer snapped: &quot;Just kick the shit out of me and throw me in the cell and then we can be warm!&quot; Contrary to the lyrics, the NYPD didn&apos;t have a choir, so [director Peter] Dougherty hired the force&apos;s pipe band instead. When it turned out that they didn&apos;t know Galway Bay, they mouthed the only lyrics they all knew: the Mickey Mouse Club chant.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/fairytale-of-new-york-is-the-true-sound-of-christmas0/">MacGowan has said of the now-classic song</a>, &quot;It was the perfect time, and the perfect female singer. But it was kept off the top of the charts in England by the worst record the Pet Shop Boys ever made.&quot; Still, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/http://entertainment.ie/music/news/Shane-MacGowan-reportedly-earns-over-half-a-million-PER-YEAR-Fairytale-of-New-York-royalties/374619.htm">brings in over $500,000 a year</a> in royalties.</p>

<p>Anyway, MacGowan&apos;s Christmas came early: He got gold teeth!</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gotta love that Shane McGowan finally fixed his teeth but insisted on one being gold. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/https://t.co/IuLwBmXBjC">https://t.co/IuLwBmXBjC</a></p>&#x2014; daveweigel (@daveweigel) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/678679224505475072">December 20, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>As it happens, it&apos;s also MacGowan&apos;s birthday today&#x2014;happy birthday and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325072040/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3373797/It-Christmas-Eve-babe-s-no-fairytale-Pogues-Shane-MacGowan-struggles-lunch-crutches-old-mate-Bono-hits-streets-Dublin-busking-session.html">feel better, man</a>!</p>
