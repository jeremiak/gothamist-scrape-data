When they approached David Flores, 33, near 49th Street and 10th Avenue, he opened fire on them.  Motty Perl, who was shot in the hand and shoulder, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711195943/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_patrol_shot_0hNu6RCgtqft4Q2YbwptTN#ixzz0yTLBUVmd">told the Post</a>, &quot;I tackled him and as we were falling to the ground, he started shooting all over the place. I thought it was a BB gun. I didn&apos;t think the gun was real.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Shomrim, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711195943/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/nyregion/03shot.html?_r=2&amp;hpw">licensed and unarmed and has a &quot;strong&quot; relationship</a> with the NYPD, had been following Flores  because, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711195943/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/03/2010-09-03_shomrim_members_shot_in_attack.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;they got a call that he was touching himself in front of kids near Borough Park.&quot; The News adds, F&quot;lores - who has nine prior arrests, including for public lewdness and weapons possession - saw the volunteers in his rearview mirror and bailed from his vehicle on 46th St. near 10th Ave. at about 7:30 p.m., when he got stuck in traffic, authorities said.&quot; But when the Shorim members tried to apprehend him, he fired.</p>

<p>Another member of the group, Jacob Daskel, who wasn&apos;t injured, said, &quot;It was like a scene out of the movies. He kept on shooting. He was on the floor.  We were grabbing his hand, holding it down.&quot; According to the Post, Abraham David Kastow, who tried to kick away the gun, was hit in the shoulder and suffered a burn to his palm while trying to get the gun from Flores; Yoel Klein was hit in the abdomen, back and torso; and Motty Broner was hit in the neck.  </p>

<p>Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that Flores, who also shot himself in the arm during the incident, could face charges of public lewdness as well as attempted murder.</p>
