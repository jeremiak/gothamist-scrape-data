<p>Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, the California-based coffee chain that opened its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051308/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/29/nycs_first-ever_coffee_bean_tea_lea.php#photo-1">first NYC location in 2011</a>, is throwing in the blender on the Big Apple. The chain has closed all of its 12 locations.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051308/http://www.westsiderag.com/2016/10/04/coffee-bean-and-tea-leaf-closes-all-new-york-stores-including-3-on-uws">West Side Rag broke the news</a>, noting the three Upper West Side locations were all shuttered. The company sent the site a statement confirming the closures:</p><blockquote>International Coffee &amp; Tea, LLC regrets to announce that all of the franchised The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&#xAE; locations in Manhattan closed on October 1, 2016.  We value the brand&#x2019;s loyal following in the Big Apple and intend to swiftly bring The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&#xAE; hand-crafted coffees and teas, including the world famous Ice Blended&#xAE; drinks, back to New York City.  <p></p>

<p>It is our hope that when The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&#xAE; returns to New York, the new store owners will deliver the products and service our customers have come to expect through their experiences at the other 1,000+ company-owned and franchised The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&#xAE; locations around the world.</p></blockquote>While signs at some locations claim they will be &quot;reopening&quot; soon, the company spokesperson told West Side Rag, &quot;All NYC stores were franchised and unfortunately are closing.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Coffee Bean talks about its franchises in NYC on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051308/http://www.coffeebean.com/store/franchise.aspx">franchising section of its website</a>. It&apos;s working on opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051308/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-coffee-bean--tea-leaf-inks-exclusive-development-deal-to-expand-into-china-300132130.html">700 stores in China</a> in the next 10 years.</p>
