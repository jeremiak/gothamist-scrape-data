<p>A parks worker at the Manhattan park where Gracie Mansion sits has accused her supervisors of forcing her to wipe and scrub dog feces from an artist&apos;s shoe. Tasheema Chatman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2016/10/black-park-worker-made-to-clean-dog.html">told A Walk in the Park</a>, &quot;I felt completely humiliated and degraded. My reaction was, &apos;Why I&#x2019;m I cleaning the poop off of someone&#x2019;s shoe. This is crazy, I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;m cleaning someone else&apos;s shoes.  I know this is not in my job specs that&#x2019;s what was going through my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658/https://www.facebook.com/Gracie-Square-Art-Show-128683940545106/">Gracie Square Art Show</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658/https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/carl-schurz-park">Carl Schurz Park</a> earlier this month. Chatman claims her supervisor John Heimerle called her &quot;to come over to booth 75 because there was poop in the area.&quot;</p><blockquote>She came from several blocks away with a bucket and toilet brush and fresh cleaning solution.  When she arrived she asked them were the poop was. &#x201C;When I get there there was no poop on the ground,&#x201D; she said.<p></p>

<p>She said the artist commented, &#x2018;I asked your supervisor to come over here because I have poop on my shoe,&#x2019;&#x201D;  he reportedly said.</p>

<p>The artist said,  &#x2018;I need your to help me clean the poop off of my shoe.&#x2019;&#x201D; </p>

<p>He said, &#x201C;can you help me scrub it,&#x201D; which meant can you do it for me, she explained.</p>

<p>She said she knelt down before the artist. He took off one his black, European-bought shoes and held it up.  She proceeded to scrub the bottom of the sole with a toilet brush with the cleaning solution.</p>

<p>She walked away when she said the artist began to take off his other shoe to check to see if there was dog crap on the other one. &#x201C;He took off his other shoe to smell it to see if there was poop on that shoe for me to clean that one too, &#x201D; she said. </p></blockquote>Chatman said that she walked away because she was so upset and went to a bathroom to break down. She later told her supervisors, Heimerle and Steven Digiovanni, that she felt extremely demeaned, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t feel like I had a choice (not to do it) because John&#x2019;s supervisor was standing right there, so I felt like I had to do it like it was a direct order...I was afraid I would get written up.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Christos Palios, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658/http://www.graciesquareartshow.com/copy-of-ken-orton">the artist</a> whose shoe she cleaned, said that he was told that the park had people to deal with dog crap. In an interview with A Walk in the Park, Palios insisted that Chatman was very accommodating and willing, though he did feel a little uncomfortable during the encounter. </p>

<p>&quot;What bothers me universally is that she had a choice just to say no, no, no,&quot; Palios said. &quot;I mean I didn&apos;t order her, I asked her actually a couple of times, I said are you sure, and I just thought she had helped someone else with it or, or it was no big deal... It was just, &apos;two people helping each other.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_10_graciesqboothmap.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_10_graciesqboothmap.jpg" width="640" height="259"> <br> <i> A booth map from the art show (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658/http://www.graciesquareartshow.com/copy-of-booth-map">Gracie Square Art Show</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>However, that comes as a surprise to Chatman, who says Palios &quot;asked me could I do it. No, he didn&#x2019;t suggest &apos;could he do it&apos; because I would have liked for him to clean his own shoes. I mean I wouldn&#x2019;t even be here.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658/http://nypost.com/2016/10/13/park-worker-forced-to-clean-dog-poop-off-artists-shoe/">She also told the Post</a>, &quot;[Pallos] had this cocky, arrogant demeanor to himself, like this was a regular thing for him.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012658/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2016/10/black-park-worker-made-to-clean-dog.html">Chatman is disappointed</a> in how her supervisors handled the situation, &quot;I would thought that having a black commissioner, us having a mayor with a black wife a lot of things would have changed in parks but it hasn&#x2019;t. Everything is still the same.  Their views of minorities working in the Parks Department haven&#x2019;t changed they still treat us the same way.&quot;</p>

<p>The Parks Department said, &quot;NYC Parks&#x2019; investigation has already included interviews with all parties involved, including Ms. Chatman. Ms. Chatman filed a request to be moved to another district, which has been met.&quot; We&apos;ve also contacted the Gracie Square Art Show and Carl Schurz Park Conservancy for comment.</p>

<p>Palios deflected the blame onto the broader issue of dog curbing in NYC: &quot;New Yorkers don&#x2019;t clean up their dog poo.&quot;</p>
