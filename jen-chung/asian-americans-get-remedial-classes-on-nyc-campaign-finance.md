The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314230626/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/nyregion/for-an-asian-american-audience-lessons-on-campaign-finance.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The workshop was requested by a new coalition of community groups, the Asian American Civic Alliance, which was formed after the fund-raising woes of the comptroller, John C. Liu, who had been regarded until recently as a likely candidate for mayor, came to light.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Liu fund raiser Xing Wu &quot;Oliver&quot; Pan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314230626/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/comptroller_lius_political_future_i.php">is accused</a> of accepting a $16,000 donation, which is higher than the allowed $4,950, from a FBI undercover. Pan allegedly sought to mask the large donation through straw donors.  Treasurer Jia &quot;Jenny&quot; Hou is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314230626/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/feds_arrest_lius_mayoral_campaign_t.php">accused of masking higher-than-allowed donations</a> through straw donors&#x2014;she allegedly instant-messaged, &quot;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. I&#x2019;m gonna mail it to [individual&#x2019;s residence]. Whenever you get a chance though, I need [you to] sign that form and send it back to me cus [because] I can&#x2019;t charge your card without a signature.&quot; Hence tips like &quot;Don&#x2019;t forget to ask each contributor to fill out as much information about himself or herself &#x2014; including place of employment &#x2014; as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>At a workshop on Monday night, Korean American Community Empowerment Council John Park said, &quot;I worry about John Liu. But I am more worried about how this will hurt Asian-Americans&#x2019; political involvement and scare off contributors.&quot; And Edward Ma, who is on Community Board 2, told the Times, &quot;<strong>Asian-Americans have learned a hard lesson, because everyone hoped that John would be mayor.</strong> But there are land mines, and they are very clear &#x2014; don&#x2019;t do this, do this. It&#x2019;s very preventable for any politician.&quot;</p>
