<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_05_marblehill.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183205im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_05_marblehill.jpg" width="210" height="158" class="image-left"> </span>Last night, a Metro North train struck and killed a person just south of the Marble Hill station at 225th Street in the Bronx.  Metro North spokesman Dan Brucker tells us that at 10:41 p.m. a northbound train traveling 50 MPH hit a trespasser, who was pronounced dead at the scene. It&apos;s unclear what the the person, who has not been identified, was doing (laying on the tracks, running across them, etc.).</p>

<p>The train&apos;s engineer thought he spotted two people and struck both. The NYPD Aviation unit conducted an aerial search, which came up negative.  </p>

<p>For passengers, it meant a very long delay: A reader told us that she was on the 10:20 Hudson line train that struck the person, &quot;The word was that it was two kids that were being chased by the cops... We were there for hours and it seemed like they were trying to figure out whether they had just hit the one kid or whether they had also hit another (or whether that one had escaped). It was pretty nuts, they shut down the Hudson line for some time and we had to evacuate our train at 1:30 or 2:00 in the morning, one-by-one by ladder, and then we boarded another train.&quot;  She added, &quot;The Metro North conductors handled it really well given how crazy it was, but it was an intense situation.&quot;</p>
