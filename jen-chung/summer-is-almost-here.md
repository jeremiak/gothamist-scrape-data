One person said, &quot;You don&apos;t get too many hot days like this, this early in the year. This is the first time I&apos;ve been to the beach this early in the season.&quot;  But even though it was hot and humid yesterday, &quot;the shore temperatures hovered in the 70s and the water temperatures were in the low 50s.&quot; One person said, &quot;I wanted to get wet, but the water is so cold you come out numb; it&apos;s crazy. I couldn&apos;t feel my legs.&quot;  However, the city&apos;s beaches and pools are not officially open until Memorial Day, which is when lifeguards go on duty.</p>
