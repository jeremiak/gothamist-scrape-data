<p>Silda Wall Spitzer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090656/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/11/silda_spitzer_a_1.php">wife of Eliot Spitzer</a>, is reportedly poised to dump her hard-charging, hooker-loving husband immediately after the election. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090656/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/fed_up_silda_plans_divorce_Zk6nRhJI8V1JSzZk65vPAK">Page Six reports</a>, &quot;Multiple sources tell us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090656/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/11/silda_spitzer_a_1.php">long-suffering</a> Silda &#x2014; who, he last night admitted, will not be joining him on the campaign trail &#x2014; &apos;has had enough&apos; and plans to start divorce proceedings after his run for New York City comptroller is over.&quot;</p>

<p>One source says, &quot;Silda is telling her female friends that she is done with him. She will file for divorce after the [Nov. 5] election,&quot; while another explains, &quot;Silda is saying she is going to wait until this is all over. She has been telling friends, &#x2018;This is too hard. This is too rough.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>Eliot Spitzer suddenly<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090656/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/ho_yes_client_no_9_is_back_eliot_sp.php"> jumped into the race for NYC Comptroller on July 7</a>&#x2014;just days before petitions to get on the ballot had to be turned in. Silda Spitzer hasn&apos;t been campaigning for him, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090656/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/silda-spitzer-stands-man-article-1.1397741">she did gather two signatures for her husband</a>. He&apos;s claimed he&apos;s running with his family&apos;s support, and said to a Post reporter last night, &quot;I think it&#x2019;s fair to say I&#x2019;m running for office. No other member of my family is running for office. And I think the public is going to judge me, not who else is with me or not with me. She&#x2019;s got a career. There are other things I think the public appreciates &#x2014; I&#x2019;m out here fighting every day for them.&quot;</p>
