The injury was so severe that his bone was apparently sticking out and he was bleeding profusely.  But, according to 911 calls, he was calm&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235106/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/joba-a-pitcher-calm-911-tape-article-1.1051252">Daily News reports the person who called 911</a> said, &quot;He&#x2019;s awake and he&#x2019;s perfectly calm&quot; and emphasized, &quot;There&#x2019;s bleeding absolutely. We need something quick.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Chamberlain, who is 6&apos;2&quot; and 240 pounds, was jumping on a trampoline at a children&apos;s play center in Tampa, Florida with his son Karter last Thursday.  Chamberlain was released from the hospital yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235106/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/step_program_4K2zGLSN2RGmVHAekXIFUN">and looked &quot;somber.&quot;</a>  It&apos;s unclear if the injury is career-ending, but manager Joe Girardi said, &quot;I am optimistic he will pitch for us this year. I saw him Friday. I&#x2019;m pretty optimistic after talking to him. It&#x2019;s good to see him doing well,&quot; while general manager Brian Cashman said, &quot;You know Joba, he is a healer. He gets hurt, but his healing process is really significant. We are counting on that. That&#x2019;s why my gut tells me that he is going to be OK. I hope I am right on that. I can rely on the history.&quot;</p>

<p>ESPN says that Chamberlain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235106/http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/7742072/joba-chamberlain-new-york-yankees-meet-media-set-record-straight-sources-say">will speak to reporters today about his injury</a>, apparently to deny the reports of major blood loss, &quot;He&apos;s also expected to say that his life was never in jeopardy and unless something unforeseen happens in his rehabilitation, his career won&apos;t be in jeopardy, sources told [ESPN&apos;s Buster] Olney.&quot;</p>
