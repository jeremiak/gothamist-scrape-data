<p>The man accused of slashing a 71-year-old woman inside a Manhattan subway train this week was taken into custody last night after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912052904/http://pix11.com/2016/01/27/man-21-charged-for-slashing-woman-on-train/">arrested for allegedly &quot;getting violent&quot;</a> with his girlfriend. Then a grandmother&#x2014;either his own or his girlfriend&apos;s&#x2014;called the cops about the slashing.</p>

<p>Police say that Damon Knowles, 21, was on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912052904/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/subway_slasher_flees.php">southbound D train on Monday morning</a> when he slashed the victim in the face and fled at the Broadway-Lafayette station. The woman, Carmen Rivera, suffered a four-inch laceration. </p>

<p>Rivera ended up getting 20 stitches; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912052904/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/27/d-train-subway-slashing-arrest/">she told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;He just pretended that he fell, and he fell on top of me and that&#x2019;s when he slashed my face. I didn&#x2019;t even know cause I didn&#x2019;t feel no pain.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912052904/http://pix11.com/2016/01/27/man-21-charged-for-slashing-woman-on-train/">PIX 11 reports</a> that Knowles was arrested yesterday after he &quot;trespassed into his girlfriend&apos;s apartment in Brownsville and allegedly attacked her. Police sources tell PIX 11 that his girlfriend&apos;s grandmother called police and identified him as the subway slasher seen in surveillance video released by the NYPD. &quot;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912052904/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-arrested-in-subway-slashing-was-turned-in-by-his-grandmother/1175459/">WABC 7 reports</a> that Knowles&apos;s grandmother saw the surveillance video and notified police herself. She reportedly kicked Knowles out of her house when detectives arrived seeking to question him. When detectives arrived to question him, she kicked Knowles out of her Brooklyn home. (Either way, go, Grandma!)</p>

<p>Knowles, a Brooklyn resident, was charged with assault with intent to cause disfigurement and assault with intent to cause serious physical injury.</p>
