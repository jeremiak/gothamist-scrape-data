John Capano, an ATF explosives specialist, was killed as was suspect  James McGoey.  The Nassau County police are investigating the incident, and it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015521/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/friendly_fire_eyed_in_death_of_hero_ua43EMkTowtpgLRWsgk4JJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">possible &quot;friendly fire&quot; from the off-duty cops</a> may have killed Capano.<p></p>

<p>Capano had been in Charlie&apos;s Family Pharmacy on Merrick Road in Seaford to pick up cancer medication for his 82-year-old retired NYPD detective dad. McGoey appeared with what looked like a handgun in his waistband and asked for cash and Opana, an oxymorphne.  Capano also entered and reportedly took out his weapon when he saw McGoey.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015521/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/friendly_fire_eyed_in_death_of_hero_ua43EMkTowtpgLRWsgk4JJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;He reached for his sidearm and engaged Mr. McGoey,&#x201D; the source said, adding that the perp then moved toward the front door, his gun drawn and his pockets stuffed with cash and drugs.<p></p>

<p>At the same time, two women who had witnessed the robbery ran to the deli, which is owned by the family of retired Nassau County police Lt. Chris Garaghty, 54.</p>

<p>Garaghty sprang into action, rushing to the scene with Joseph Abria, a 29-year-old off-duty NYPD cop who was also at the deli.</p>

<p>It was unclear how many shots were fired and whose bullet killed Capano during the ensuing mayhem just outside the drugstore&#x2019;s front door.</p>

<p>Sources indicated that McGoey was wielding only a realistic-looking pellet gun.</p></blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015521/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/nyregion/a-routine-errand-to-drugstore-turns-deadly.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=nyregion">NY Times notes</a>, &quot;Should investigators conclude that the fatal bullet or bullets were fired by the off-duty New York City officer or the retired Nassau lieutenant, it would underscore a peculiar danger that law enforcement officers in Nassau County and some other New York suburbs face: the ubiquity of other officers &#x2014; on duty, off-duty and retired &#x2014; who often converge at the scenes of emergencies, raising the possibility that an officer might be mistaken for a criminal.&quot;  In March, a MTA cop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015521/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/13/li_cop_tragically_killed_after_sata.php">accidentally killed a plainclothes Nassau County cop</a> who was wielding a weapon while was going into a home for an arrest; a retired NYPD cop near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015521/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/the_story_of_the_friendly_fire_cop.php">apparently yelled, referring to the plainclothes cop, &quot;He&apos;s got a gun.&quot;</a><p></p>

<p>McGoey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015521/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/james-mcgoey-had-robbed-3-pharmacies-1.3422584">was a career criminal</a>, with four robbery convictions (three of them for robbing pharmacies).  And Capano&apos;s father, James Capano, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015521/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/capano-family-struggles-with-sudden-loss-1.3422549">stood outside the pharmacy</a> yesterday, saying, &quot;I should have gone&quot; to the pharmacy instead.</p>
