</div></div>					<p>Jabbar Collins was freed yesterday after 15 years in prison.  A day earlier, a judge had overturned his 1995 murder conviction after evidence that the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office never turned over crucial information to the defense.  Information like how one of three witnesses was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610052533/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/da_blunder_convict_home_qm364uqsEeDCi73bPhbmLN"> allegedly threatened by the lead prosecutor</a> to testify against Collins and how another witness testified after getting a deal from the DA&apos;s office in another case.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610052533/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/06/10/2010-06-10_finally_at_home_again_joy_after_15_years_in_jail_as_slay_conviction_kod.html">Collins said</a> outside his mother&apos;s Queens home with his family, &quot;I can&apos;t even describe how good I feel right now. I&apos;m dream-walking. ... I&apos;m just happy to be home.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1994, Brooklyn landlord Abraham Pollack was killed while collecting rent.  An anonymous tip was made, saying Collins was involved and, while proclaiming his innocence, he was convicted the next year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610052533/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703890904575297140262493002.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTTopStories">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;For 10 years Mr. Collins, who submersed himself in the law, gathered documents and made attempts to contact the witnesses whose testimony landed him behind bars for 33&#xBD; years to life. By 2005, Mr. Collins had documents and affidavits in which witnesses claimed they made deals that Mr. Collins said resulted in &apos;extraordinarily favorable&apos; sentences for past crimes in exchange for their testimony,&quot; which conflicted with lead prosecutor Michael Vecchione&apos;s claim during the trial.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610052533/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/nyregion/09vecchione.html?scp=1&amp;sq=jabbar%20collins&amp;st=cse">NY Times explains</a>, &quot;The chain of events that led to vacating the case against Mr. Collins began last month when, after years defending the handling of the case, the district attorney&#x2019;s office acknowledged that a key witness had briefly recanted his testimony in the presence of a prosecutor before trial, a fact never disclosed to the defense. The office, which said it had just discovered the information, offered to release Mr. Collins if he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter, but Mr. Collins declined, saying he was willing to risk retrial to clear his name.&quot;  </p>
