<p>After the heady rush of opening presents&#x2014;or not, depending on your faith, views on material gift giving, etc.&#x2014;Americans are expected to go to the movies today and this weekend, thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423194646/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/23/weekend_movie_forecast_27.php">Christmas Day releases</a> like <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> and <em>It&apos;s Complicated</em> and recent releases <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423194646/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/18/weeken_movie_forecast.php"><em>Avatar</em></a> and <em>Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel</em>.  </p>

<p>And this was no different at the Pavilion in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where the line stretched around the corner.  Are you heading to see a big budget movie or catching up on Oscar fare this weekend?  </p>
