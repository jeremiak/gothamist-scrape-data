<p>NJ authorities have arrested the man accused of attacking a woman pushing a stroller in NYC&apos;s Fort Tryon Park and trying to rape her. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522170009/http://cliffviewpilot.com/englewood-detectives-catch-fugitive-wanted-in-nyc-attempted-rape-of-woman-with-stroller/">According to the Cliffview Pilot</a>, Oscar Ruiz was found in Englewood, NJ: &quot;After spotting Ruiz on Palisades Court last night, Englewood detectives grabbed him and brought him in to headquarters.&quot;</p>

<p>On September 27, Mary Jane Jarman, 33, was jogging with her 8-month-old son in Fort Tryon Park near the the Henry Hudson Parkway and 190th Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522170009/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/27/woman_with_baby_in_stroller_beats_a.php">when a man approached her</a>, telling her, &quot;Come here, come here.&quot; Jarman started to run but the suspect, armed with a broken bottle, managed to grab her in a bear hug and knock her and the stroller down. </p>

Nothing was going through my head except hit him hit him hit him... I was protecting [my baby] for sure. I was not going to go down like that. I was protecting him with my life. I was prepared to kill this man.&quot;</p>
