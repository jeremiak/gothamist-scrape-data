	<p>Former governor Eliot Spitzer loves the limelight&#x2014;especially when that limelight is nationally broadcast! He flew to Los Angeles to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno last night, to discuss his NYC Comptroller campaign, plug his upcoming book and, yes, talk about being caught in a federal investigation of a prostitution ring. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130716052444/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/eliot-spitzer-hit-tonight-show-jay-leno-article-1.1397794">Spitzer admitted</a>, &quot;There was a phrase that I used that was, &#x2018;Hubris is terminal.&apos; People who fall prey to hubris, end up falling themselves ... And this is something that I think infected me.&quot;</p>

<p>Leno had asked how he &quot;could have made this big a blunder&quot; and then asked if Spitzer really think he could not get caught. Spitzer said people engage in risky behavior, &quot;There&apos;s no reason, no justification, no good explanation for it... It&apos;s something that speak to a failure of judgement in a grotesque way that is a moral failing.&quot;</p>

<p>Leno also asked if Anthony Weiner&apos;s entrance in the mayoral race factored into Spitzer deciding to run. The public is forgiving in certain circumstances and has been forgiving of people throughout our political history... But that doesn&apos;t mean they will be forgiving of me as an individual. It needs to see contrition, needs to see growth, it needs to see understanding. And whatever one&apos;s record may have been before fall from grace, you need to show that you have changed in some way.&quot;</p>

<p>Spitzer also use the nearly-ten minute interview to pump up his credentials as a fighter against Wall Street and noted that recently, when he and his wife (poor, poor Silda) were out, an AIG executive starting ripping into him for investigating the firm back during his Attorney General days (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130716052444/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/17/aig_saved_with_85_billion_federal_l.php">remember what happened later</a>).</p>

<p>There were lighter moments: Bill Hader, the former Saturday Night Live cast member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130716052444/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/16/snl_makes_our_paterson_spitzer_drea.php#photo-5">who was a memorable</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130716052444/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/10/video_snl_brings_in_love_gov_to_fle.php">Eliot Spitzer portrayer</a>, was Leno&apos;s first guest and sat next to Spitzer during the interview. At the start of the interview, Leno played one of Hader&apos;s impressions of Spitzer and they both recounted how they met at the White House Correspondents&apos; Dinner. Spitzer called Hader a &quot;great actor&quot; but noted how nervous Hader was. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130716052444/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/nyregion/spitzer-appears-on-tonight-show.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">Hader responded</a>, &quot;I was nervous. I&#x2019;m shaking and quivering right now!&quot;</p>
