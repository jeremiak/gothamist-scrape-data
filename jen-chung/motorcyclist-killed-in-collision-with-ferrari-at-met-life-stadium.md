Photographs from the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153246/http://photos.nj.com/star-ledger/2012/05/fatal_car_accident_4.html">show the motorcycle in two pieces</a>.<p></p>

<p>The motorcyclist, Stephen Lenge, was heading to his job as a stagehand for the Electric Daisy Festival and was on Berry&apos;s Creek Road, a service road around the parking lot.  According to the Star-Ledger, &quot;A pair of 2006 Ferrari F430s &#x2014; one red, one silver &#x2014; were heading toward him on the other side of the road, police said. The automobiles, which cost several hundred thousand dollars, are owned by Gotham Dream Cars of Englewood and were being driven by employees of the company, [Sgt. Dante Ruocco, a N.J. State Police spokesman.]. The two luxury vehicles were returning from a gas station when 19-year-old Joseph Meyer, of Oviepo, Fla., lost control of the silver Ferrari and spun out of control, striking two cement curbs... The driver of the red Ferrari, 28-year-old Dumont resident Joseph Ferreti, swerved over the double yellow line to avoid being hit, but collided with Lenge&#x2019;s motorcycle head-on.&quot;</p>

<p>Authorities are investigating the matter, but they believe the Ferraris were going over the 25 MPH speed limit. The Ferraris were apparently being set up for the Dream Car Sprint, a Gotham Dream Cars event. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153246/http://www.northjersey.com/news/bergen/Motorcyclist_killed_in_head-on_crash_near_MetLife_Stadium.html">Bergen Record describes</a> it as an opportunity in &quot;which customers pay $100 to drive a Ferrari or Lamborghini three laps around a closed course in parking lots E or J near the Meadowlands&#x2019; Racetrack. Coupons for the sprints can be found on social networking sites such as Groupon.&quot; The event was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153246/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=8659783">cancelled after the collision</a>. </p>

<p>The Ferrari drivers suffered minor injuries.  A MetLife stadium spokesperson says there&apos;s a contract with Gotham Dream Cars for 28 Dream Car Sprints this year.  </p>
