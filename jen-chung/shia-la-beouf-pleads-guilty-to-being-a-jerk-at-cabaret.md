<p>Shia LaBeouf was in Manhattan Criminal Court today to face <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013811/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/27/shia_labeouf_allegedly_called_cop_a.php">charges of being a Cabaret-hole</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013811/http://laist.com/2014/01/10/shia_labeouf_quits_amid_attacks_aga.php">reluctant star</a> pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for his behavior at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013811/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/26/shia_labeouf_reportedly_arrested_es.php">performance of Cabaret on June 26th</a>. He was apparently acting out by smoking and grabbing actors&apos; butts. </p>

<p>After he was arrested, he allegedly told cops, &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; and &quot;F-k you. I&#x2019;ll f-k you up!&quot; When he started spitting on them, they put a face mask on him. LaBeouf also reportedly called one officer a &quot;f-g&quot; and added, &quot;I have millions and millions of dollars and attorneys. I&#x2019;m going to ruin your career.&quot; And that&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013811/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/28/then_10_weirdest_parts_of_shia_labe.php">even as bizarre as his pre-Cabaret behavior</a>.</p>

<p>... &quot;You must come to court each time the case is on. There must be no new arrests,&quot; Judge Diana Boyar warned the troubled &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; leading man.</p>

<p>Boyar said that if LaBeouf doesn&apos;t comply &quot;all bets are off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; LaBeouf said, in pleading to disorderly conduct, a violation that is expected to be expunged from his permanent record.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>It seems like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013811/http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/09/09/shia-labeouf-runs-nike/">LaBeouf is taking solace in running</a>&#x2014;the past few days, he&apos;s been spelling out letters with his Nike+ (so far it&apos;s &quot;#ME&quot;).</p>
