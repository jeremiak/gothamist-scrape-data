The buyback, funded by the NYPD and Manhattan DA&apos;s office, followed in the footsteps of similar programs in Brooklyn where a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142050/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/10/26/2008-10-26_manhattan_churches_draw_more_guns_off_st.html">$200 cash card would be given for every firearm</a> turned in with no questions asked.  The Daily News spotted two women handing over guns they inherited from relatives; one said, &quot;I found it&quot; in the apartment &quot;and freaked out.  I was afraid to even touch it.
