Now, it turns out that the school turned down Draven&apos;s request&#x2014;but his vision will still be partially realized in the yearbook. Now the principal will be taking a picture with the cat and lasers... and a dog!<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013630/http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2014/sep/16/schenectady-high-seniors-cat-will-appear-yearbook/">The Daily Gazette reports</a>:</p><blockquote>The school district recently reached a compromise with Rodriguez... Instead of the original cat-and-laser photo going in the book, a picture of Rodriguez, his cat, [principal Diane] Wilkinson and her dog will be featured on the principal&#x2019;s yearbook page, district spokeswoman Karen Corona said.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;We reached a compromise that everybody&#x2019;s happy about,&#x201D; she said...The new photo will be taken by the same photographer, Vincent Giordano of Trinactia Photography. The lasers, like Mr. Bigglesworth, will also stay.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We wanted to make sure that Draven knows that we appreciate his creativity and energy around this, and we wanted to do something out of the ordinary with it,&#x201D; Corona said.</p></blockquote>We hope that photographer Vince Giordano takes some photos of just Mr. Bigglesworth and the dog, because those would be pretty cute!<p></p>

<p>Anyway, Draven <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013630/http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/get-my-photo-into-the-yearbook">wrote on his petition page</a> (over 7,000 signatures in support) about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013630/http://teespring.com/dravenandhiscat">T-shirt that&apos;s now for sale</a>, &quot;The proceeds will be going to a cheap car for myself, as well as college and my photographer, Vince. Feel free to get one!&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;ll be perfect to wear while watching this:</p>
