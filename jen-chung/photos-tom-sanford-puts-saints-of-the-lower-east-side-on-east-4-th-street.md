</div></div><p>If you walk on East 4th Street between Bowery and Second Avenue, you&apos;ll be able to see some new public art hanging on scaffolding. And the faces will seem familiar.  Artist Tom Sanford (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120608052111/http://gothamist.com/2003/09/05/thug4life_becoming_tupac.php">Columbia alum</a>) has just completed installing seven gilded icon paintings of downtown artists, Martin Wong, Joey Ramone, Miguel Pi&#xF1;ero, Ellen Stewart, Charlie Parker, Arthur Fellig (WeeGee) and Allen Ginsberg. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120608052111/http://www.tomsanford.com/2012/06/installing-the-saints-of-the-lower-east-side/">Sanford says</a>, &quot;Of course I could have come up with hundreds of other equally influential and prominent figures who have haunted the streets of the LES, but these are my seven.&quot; He adds, &quot;In the meantime I will be trying to find a more permanent resting place for the saints, hopefully in a public or semi-public place on the Lower East Side, so if you have any ideas feel free to pass them along.&quot;</p>

<p>The project&apos;s curator, Keith Schweitzer, has been working to create a corridor of public art in the East VIllage&#x2014;there&apos;s  work on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120608052111/http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/street-scenes-music-machine-at-extra-place/">East 1st</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120608052111/http://blog.vandalog.com/2012/03/know-hope-east-village/">East 2nd</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120608052111/http://thestreetspot.com/2012/05/cake.html">East 3rd</a>, too!  </p>

<p>The &quot;Saints of the Lower East Side&quot; is hanging on the scaffolding of 70 East 4th Street (so you probably want to stand across the street!).</p>
