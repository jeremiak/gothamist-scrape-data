<p>Want to know what the GOP thinks of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/buffet_rule.php">the Demcorats&apos; &quot;Buffett Rule&quot;</a>, which would require those earning at least $1 million dollars a year (or more!) to pay at least a 30% tax rate so they can pay the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/24/obamas_state_of_the_union_millionai.php#photo-1">same tax rate as their secretaries</a>?  Senate Republicans<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/us/politics/buffett-rule-debate-blocked-by-republicans.html?hp"> blocked debate on the measure</a>, ensuring that it won&apos;t even come up for a vote. Thanks a lot, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/cloture.htm">cloture</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/04/16/Buffett-Rule-Senate-cloture-vote-fails/UPI-22141334561400/">According to UPI</a>, &quot;The cloture vote failed 51-45 along mostly partisan lines. Sixty votes were needed to end debate on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.2230:">Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012</a> and move it to a vote. Prior to the vote, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., ridiculed the reasoning behind the Buffett Rule, saying it would only open the door to higher taxes on the middle class.&quot; You know, the middle class would love to earn over $1 million/year!  </p>

<p>The Democrats had said the measure would have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/16/us-usa-tax-buffett-idUSBRE83F05H20120416">generated $47 billion between 2012 and 2022</a>, which would help pay down the deficit. But the measure would have applied to investment income, which is now taxed at a lower rate&#x2014;that&apos;s why Mitt Romney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/24/mitt_romneys_tax_rate_was_139_in_20.php">only paid a 13.9% tax rate on over $21 million</a> in investment income in 2010.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-rejects-consideration-of-buffett-rule-tax-increase-for-millionaires/2012/04/16/gIQAouHOMT_story.html?hpid=z1">Washington Post points out</a>, &quot;On Thursday, the GOP-led House is scheduled to vote on a counterproposal championed by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) that would cut taxes by 20 percent for businesses with 500 or fewer employees. Neither measure will be signed into law; the business tax cut proposal is likely to win approval in the House but be rejected by the Senate. <strong>But in a gridlocked Congress, passage was never the point. Instead, both parties aim to force their opponents into the politically uncomfortable position of killing proposals they are convinced are broadly popular.</strong>&quot;  Thanks a lot, politicians! We&apos;re just going to watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419182016/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/16/romney-gets-fat-cat-treatment/">MoveOn&apos;s pro-Buffett Rule ad to feel better</a> because at least we&apos;re seeing pictures of fat cats.</p>
