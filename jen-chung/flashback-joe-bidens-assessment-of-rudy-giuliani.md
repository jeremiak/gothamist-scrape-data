<p>Gawker looks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161721/http://gawker.com/5038900/meet-joe-biden-future-vice-president-of-saying-stupid-things-in-public">much of the the stupid stuff said</a> by Joe Biden, Senator from Delaware and allegedly on Demcratic presidential candidate Barack Obama&apos;s shortlist.  But this classic moment (video above) of Biden breaking down our former mayor almost makes up for it!</p>

<p>And, yes, Biden has had a history of many unfortunate gaffes--like saying Obama was clean and articulate.  But that doesn&apos;t seem to bother Obama too much--when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161721/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/08/19/politics/fromtheroad/entry4362334.shtml">speaking about the conflict in Georgia</a>, he said, &quot;We must help Georgia rebuild what has been destroyed. That is why I&#x2019;m proud to join my friend, Senator Joe Biden, in calling for an additional $1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of Georgia.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Obama is reportedly going to make his VP pick soon (like maybe tomorrow soon!). </p>
