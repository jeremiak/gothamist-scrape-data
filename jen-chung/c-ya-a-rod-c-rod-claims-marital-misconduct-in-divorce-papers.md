<p>Cynthia Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811132339/http://www.tmz.com/2008/07/07/a-rods-wife-files-big-d/">filed for divorce from Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez</a> today in Miami. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811132339/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0707081arod1.html">According to the papers</a>, she claims A-Rod &quot;emotionally abandoned&quot; her and that the marriage is &quot;irretrievably broken&quot; due to his &quot;extra-marital affairs and other marital misconduct.&quot;  She is looking for primary custody of their two daughters, child support to &quot;maintain the existing lifestyle of the children,&quot; and their $12 million home in Coral Gables, Florida, plus paying attorney&apos;s fees. Notably, she is also seeking &quot;equitable distribution&quot; of assets acquired during their marriage--how much of A-Rod&apos;s $275 million Yankees contract that includes will be up to the lawyers.</p>

<p>One of her lawyers, Earle Lilly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811132339/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/07/06/2008-07-06_court_papers_filed_in_arod_divorce.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;She has reached the end of her ability to tolerate his continued marital misconduct...<strong>As a baseball player, the guy&apos;s terrific. This is the game of real life, and that&apos;s where he&apos;s not going to make the all-star team. As a parent and as a husband, he&apos;s not going to get voted in.</strong>&quot;  </p>
