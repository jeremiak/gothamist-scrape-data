	<p>Animal rescuers and local officials responded to a condemned home in Central Islip yesterday where they found dozens of animals&#x2014;and a woman&#x2014;living in horrible conditions. The animals were removed and the woman, believed to be in her 70s, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073214/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=9080843">&quot;taken to a hospital against her will.&quot;</a></p>

<p>It&apos;s believed there were at least 50 cats in the home, plus a dog. Suffolk County SPCA&apos;s Roy Gross <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073214/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/26/dozens-of-cats-found-living-in-deplorable-conditions-at-central-islip-home/">told 1010 WINS</a>, &quot;There was one dog removed from the home, I&#x2019;m not sure of the age because it was so severely dehydrated it couldn&#x2019;t even stand.&quot;</p>

<p>The home, which had numerous code violations over the years and was condemned last year, had been board up but Rosemarie Kobylak continued to live there, ignoring a vacate order (she may have been living in a car). According to WABC 7, &quot;Neighbors routinely brought the woman food and water, but someone called 911 Friday morning after reporting that Kobylak appeared ill.&quot;</p>

<p>Because the home was full of cat feces and urine, crews needed to wear hazmat outfits. Further, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073214/http://bronx.news12.com/news/rosemarie-kobylak-nearly-50-cats-removed-from-central-islip-home-on-bayonne-ave-1.5145305?firstfree=yes">News 12 reports</a>, &quot;Town officials say the house had minimal electric and lacked water, heat and plumbing. The floors are also caving in.&quot;</p>

<p>At least one cat was put down. The Islip Animal Shelter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073214/https://www.facebook.com/IslipAnimals/posts/525315480848785">posted on Facebook</a>, &quot;Another small update on the house with the hoarding situation: A local rescue is trapping the remaining cats and having the ones healthy enough spayed or neutered at Grady Animal Hospital. Then once fixed they&apos;ll be socialized and will go into their adoption program. The costs are being mainly paid for with a donation of vouchers from Shelter Link. Thanks to everyone for there support in this situation. The rescues, hospitals and shelter employees have been outstanding!&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this week, over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073214/http://www.midhudsonnews.com/News/2013/April/25/NP_cats-25Apr13.htm">100 cats were rescued</a> from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073214/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151645583846528&amp;set=a.10151645569026528.1073741842.296702991527&amp;type=3&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fsphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-prn1%2F164198_10151645583846528_1702772708_n.jpg&amp;size=478%2C640">two-bedroom apartment in New Paltz</a>. Not only were there so many cats with an adult owner&#x2014;there was also a child in the apartment!</p>
