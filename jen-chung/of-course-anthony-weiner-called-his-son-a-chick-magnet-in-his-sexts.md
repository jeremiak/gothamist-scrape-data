<p>As if it wasn&apos;t depressing enough to learn that Anthony Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/anthony_weiner_sexting_saga.php">sexted a photograph of himself in his underwear</a> with his sleeping toddler son Jordan next to him, now we find out he referred to the child as a &quot;chick magnet.&quot; All thanks to the private Twitter conversations Weiner&apos;s sexting pal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://nypost.com/2016/08/30/anthony-weiner-used-his-son-to-pick-up-chicks/">shared with the NY Post.</a></p>

<p>The Post, which broke the news about the disgraced Congressman&apos;s <em>third</em> sexting scandal (thus prompting Weiner&apos;s wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/huma_abedin_weiner_separation.php">Huma Abedin to announce their separation</a>), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://nypost.com/2016/08/30/anthony-weiner-used-his-son-to-pick-up-chicks/">reports that Weiner was</a> &quot;complaining he was only having sex once every two months&quot; before bringing up his son to the unidentified woman who lives on the West Coast:</p><blockquote> &#x201C;Put him to work,&#x201D; the buxom brunette suggested during their March 12, 2015, online chat.<p></p>

<p>Weiner, 51, then sent the 40-something divorcee a photo of his son sitting in a playground swing, smiling and holding a toy car in his hands.</p>

<p>Weiner told the woman he had dropped off the tyke &#x201C;at grandpas after school,&#x201D; but bellyached that the free baby-sitting &#x201C;only bought me a couple of hours,&#x201D; the screenshots show.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Already at work. Being a chick magnet,&#x201D; he wrote.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like a puppy. Chicks love cute kids and puppies,&#x201D; she wrote back.</p>

<p>The picture of Weiner&#x2019;s son, Jordan &#x2014; now 4 &#x2014; was among at least nine images featuring the boy that he sent the woman.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>From January 2015 through this month, Weiner and the woman would flirt and complain about their sex lives through private messages on Twitter. Weiner said of Abedin in February 2015, &quot;We occupy the same space from time to time. Actually been very civil nowadays.&quot; To which the woman replied, &quot;That&#x2019;s nice. It takes a woman a long time to forgive if ever.&quot;</p>

<p>Abedin, notably, stood by Weiner&apos;s side in 2013 when he confessed to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">second sexting scandal</a>. She said at the time, &quot;It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where I could forgive Anthony.&quot; </p>

<p>The couple has reportedly been drifting apart and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/30/anthony_weiner_huma_abedin_hamptons.php">have essentially been &quot;estranged&quot;</a> for the past year though living in the same Manhattan apartment and caring for Jordan together. Abedin only learned of the latest incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/30/anthony_weiner_huma_abedin_hamptons.php">on Sunday night</a>, right before the Post published their story. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/huma-abedin-relaxing-hours-weiner-sext-revelation-article-1.2772306">was in the Hamptons</a> with Weiner and Jordan, to be with her boss, Hillary Clinton, for a round of fundraisers. </p>

<p>Weiner has not commented about the separation, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052630/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3764495/EXCLUSIVE-PICTURES-Anthony-Weiner-seen-time-latest-sexting-embarrassment-new-messages-knew-marriage-furious-Huma-Abedin-busted.html">Daily Mail took photographs of him</a> inside his apartment &quot;moping around the darkened kitchen.&quot;  His sexting friend told the Post that Weiner was a &quot;broken&quot; man: &quot;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s a bad guy. Maybe he&#x2019;s an unfulfilled person. He&#x2019;s in an unhappy marriage.&quot;</p>
