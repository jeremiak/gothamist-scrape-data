According to Newsday, Douglas Rome, 25, and Jason Ragoo, 26, plus a third man, allegedly assaulted 32-year-old Brian McNamara, after he &quot;objected when the men made a rude remark to [his 22-year-old] sister.&quot;  McNamara ran away after they punched and kicked him, but the men followed him and beat him again.  McNamara&apos;s sister helped the police find the assailants, who &quot;were covered in blood.&quot;  Rome and Ragoo, who work at the 101st Precinct in Far Rockaway, were charged with third-degree assault.  McNamara was treated and released from a local hospital.  </p>
