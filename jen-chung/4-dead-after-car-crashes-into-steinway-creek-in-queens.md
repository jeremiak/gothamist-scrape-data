<p>A car carrying a group of friends, who were celebrating a woman&apos;s 19th birthday, plunged into Steinway Creek in the Astoria section of Queens on Friday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153202/http://nypost.com/2014/04/04/5-rescued-after-car-plunges-into-creek-in-queens/">According to the NY Post</a>, &quot;The 20-year-old driver escaped the Honda Accord and called 911, but his four passengers &#x2014; two men aged 20 and 21 plus the birthday girl and another woman &#x2014; all died after rescue divers pulled them from the submerged car.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say they responded to a 911 call about a car in the water at 10:37 p.m. last night. When they got to 19th Avenue and 37th Street, they found the 2009 Honda Accord in the Long Island Sound with a 20-year-old man, the driver, on the road. Apparently he was able to get out while his four passengers were still inside.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153202/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/car-filled-people-drives-creek-queens-article-1.1746537">Daily News reports</a> that the car &quot;careened through a 3-foot high chain-link fence and rolled over into&quot; the creek. Police said it hit the curb and continued into the bay. Per the News, &quot;The driver placed the call at around 10:36 p.m., and rescue workers first arrived roughly six minutes later, officials said.&quot; </p>

<p>Divers broke open windows and pulled out the first body at 11:10 p.m. Two female passengers and a male passenger were taken to Elmhurst General Hospital, where they were pronounced dead. The other male passenger  was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>One woman, who identified herself as the mother of the male taken to Elmhurst, told the News, &quot;He wasn&apos;t driving, it wasn&apos;t his car. He was with friends. They were supposed to be going to some restaurant for their friend&apos;s birthday.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver, who had borrowed the car from his grandmother, had blown a 0.00 on the Breathalyzer, according to the Post. The crash is still being investigated by the police.</p>
