<p>A man waiting for an F train at a Queens subway station ended up being stabbed another rider on Monday evening, policy say. And he had no idea that he was attacked until he got home.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the assault occurred on December 20: At 7:10 p.m., the victim, 42, &quot;was standing on the Queens bound &apos;F&apos; train platform, at the 71 Avenue and Continental Avenue train station, when he felt the suspect bump him from behind with an unknown hard object.&quot; </p><blockquote>The suspect bumped him a second time, with the unknown object, as he was boarding the train.  When the victim exited the train at the Union Turnpike station, the suspect also exited the train and bumped him two more times from behind before the victim  was able to walk away from the suspect.  The victim discovered that he had been stabbed four times on his buttocks when he arrived home.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160506150736/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20151221/forest-hills/man-stabbed-butt-on-f-train-platform-didnt-notice-until-he-got-home-pd">DNAinfo reports</a> that the victim only realized he was hurt when he &quot;saw blood on his pants. He then discovered three puncture wounds to his left buttock and one to his right buttock, each of them about half an inch wide, police said.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The authorities released a video of the suspect, describing him as 25 years old, about 6&apos; and 220 pounds and wearing a cast on his right hand. He was last seen wearing a multi-colored jacket, Oakland Raiders shirt and black pants and tan pants.<p></p>
