<p>On the heels of NY State being super-duper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118212250/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/25/ny_state_thrilled_it_can_start_to_o.php">excited to allow online gambling</a>, now Governor Cuomo has signaled his support for a casino in the Big Apple.  In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118212250/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gov-cuomo-puts-full-tilt-casino-city-table-article-1.996790">year-end interview with the Daily News</a>, Cuomo said, &quot;Do I support casino gaming at a New York City location? ... Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>New York could use the revenue from the gaming industry, though there have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118212250/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/31/politicians_at_odds_over_casino_in.php">been some concerns</a> about having one in the Big Apple (Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said earlier this year, &quot;I don&apos;t want to see people going out for lunch during work and losing a week&apos;s pay or a month&apos;s pay&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118212250/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/top_pols_ok_boosts_odds_for_ny_casinos_pM7a8ZucfHoW7l0HFn1qBN">doesn&apos;t want them in the inner cities</a>). Cuomo explained, &quot;I&#x2019;m not excluding any locations at this time,&quot; but NYC would be a natural option because of its huge population&#x2014;he just doesn&apos;t want one in a very dense part of the city.  He added, &quot;New York City is a real location,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Albany is a real location. Buffalo is a real location.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the News, &quot;Cuomo expects to call on the Legislature in his Jan. 4 State of the State address to give the first of two needed votes to a state constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling in the state.&quot;  Voters, for the most part, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118212250/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/12/ny-voters-call-casino-gambling-a-win">like the idea</a> of having a new way of losing a chunk of their change.</p>
