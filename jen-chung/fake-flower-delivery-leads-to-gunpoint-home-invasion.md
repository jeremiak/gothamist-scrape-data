<p>The police are asking the public for help in identifying three suspects in a home invasion that took place last week in the Bronx, and occurred under the guise of a flower delivery.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, on Monday, March 17 at 11:15 a.m., a woman living in an apartment on East 169th Street heard a knock on her door&#x2014;after opening it, a woman said she had a flower delivery. As the victim asked more questions, two men in masks forced their way in, &quot;punching the victim and knocking her to the floor. The female suspect produced a silver firearm and demanded that the victim cooperate.&quot;</p>

<p>The police say the victim fought with the female suspect and one of the male suspects as they tried to tie her up with duct tape. The other male suspect went through her bedroom closet and took money.</p>
