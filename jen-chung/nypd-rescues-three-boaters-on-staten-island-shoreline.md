<p>A woman was airlifted from a tiny island off of Staten Island&apos;s South Beach yesterday by the NYPD. She and two others were rescued after their boat got stuck on Hoffman Island.</p>

<p>Police say they received a 911 call at 12:25 p.m. about a boat in distress in the Verrazano Narrows. The NYPD Aviation Unit began a canvass of the area and found a 24-foot pleasure boat on the shoreline. </p>

<p>On the boat was an 81-year-old man, and on the rocky shore was a 20-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145732/http://nypost.com/2016/09/05/cops-use-helicopter-to-rescue-woman-in-new-york-harbor/">The Post reports</a> the boat &quot;lost power and crashed into Hoffman Island.&quot; </p>

As he did, the female victim tried to follow him. She stepped onto the rocks and slipped in between the rocks and the boat. So as the tide was pushing the boat into the rocks, she was wedged in between that.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD decided to airlift the woman to Staten Island University Hospital. Video shows her being lifted in a rescue basket; the woman is currently in stable condition. The two other men were taken to the Marine Basin Marina by the NYPD Harbor Unit and they refused medical attention. </p>
