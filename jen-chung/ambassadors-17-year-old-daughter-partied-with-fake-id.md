</div></div>					<p>Early yesterday, the 17-year-old daughter of the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174712/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/27/18-year-old_falls_to_death_from_34t.php">fell over 20 stories to her death</a> in Midtown, after a night of partying. While it&apos;s unclear whether she was drinking (an autopsy is being performed), Nicole John apparently had a fake ID; on her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174712/http://melancholysouls.tumblr.com/">Tumblr blog</a> (now removed), she gave advice, &quot;As long as the ID is pretty legit looking it should be okay. It&#x2019;s also easier if you&#x2019;re a girl, lol. I have a brazilian ID that was made here in NYC and it&#x2019;s really good, it&#x2019;s never been rejected.&quot;</p>

<p>John, daughter of Ambassador Eric John, had graduated from high school in Thailand and was about to start college at the New School.  She had been out at the Meatpacking District club Tenjune until 2:15 a.m. Friday morning, when Ilan Nassimi, 25, invited her and her friends to his 25th floor apartment at the Herald Square Towers on West 34th Street. John apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174712/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/diplo_teen_in_death_plummet_IAOJzCdJ2w2FCr1XvhSG7L?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">took off her shoes and climbed out</a> &quot;onto an 18-inch window ledge with a camera&quot;; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174712/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/nyregion/28fall.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;<strong>Being unfamiliar with the apartment, she might also have believed there was a terrace outside the window.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The others didn&apos;t realize she had climbed outside the window, but a witness nearby called the police after seeing John fall; her body was found on the third-story ledge of the building.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174712/http://dnainfo.com/20100827/midtown/teen-falls-22-stories-her-death-at-herald-square-apartment-building">building&apos;s super said</a>, &quot;I found her there. I looked at her and she was so young. It was not a pretty sight. She was just a baby.&quot;</p>

<p>Nassimi was arrested for misdemeanor charge of unlawfully dealing with a child last night; in court papers, he said he invited people for an afterparty, &quot;During the party there was drinking and smoking.&quot; He also said he had no idea John was under 21. By the time police arrived, the apartment was cleaned up&#x2014;Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;There was no alcohol, or no indication of a party going on&quot;&#x2014;but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174712/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/27/2010-08-27_nicole_john_daughter_of_us_ambassador_to_thailand_plunges_to_death_from_highrise.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Investigators discovered an empty bottle of Patron tequila on the windowsill inside the flat and empty bottles of Glenlivet scotch and Belvedere vodka on a living room shelf. A bottle of Skyy vodka was on ice in the freezer, prosecutors said.&quot;  The Post&apos;s sources also say the cops will be interviewing Tenjune.</p>
