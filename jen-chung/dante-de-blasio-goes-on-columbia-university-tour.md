<p>A Columbia staffer at Hartley Hall also told Bwog, &quot;I was on the phone talking, and I just looked up and it was him, and I was like, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s You!&#x2019; and he came over and shook my hand.&quot;</p>

<p>The mayor has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505170047/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/de-blasio-family-tours-columbia-son-dante-visits-colleges-article-1.1762567">pointed out Dante is only a junior</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505170047/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/dante_de_blasio_the_closer_of_schoo.php">and budding meteorologist</a>/excellent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505170047/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/breaking_dante_de_blasio_shoveled_t.php">stoop shoveler</a>&#x2014;and has time to think about it, &quot;Dante is very open-minded.
