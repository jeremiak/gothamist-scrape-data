<p>A 26-year-old woman was found murdered in her Chelsea apartment by her sister last night, and the murder victim&apos;s boyfriend--and the murder suspect, according to police-- killed himself a few hours after the discovery.</p>

<p>Margaux Powers&apos;s family had been worried they didn&apos;t hear from her for a few days, so her  sister Dana went to Margaux&apos;s apartment at 235 West 22nd Street on Friday night.  Doorman Constantine Ionescu accompanied Dana to the apartment, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121193710/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/06/01/2008-06-01_prepschool_grad_26_found_chopped_up__boy-1.html">Daily News reports</a> though they found Powers&apos; cellphone, &quot;the apartment appeared orderly and there was no odor...But they did not think to check behind the closed bathroom door.&quot;</p>

<p>Then last night, Dana Powers returned with friends and they, with Ionescu, checked the apartment at 6 p.m., this time checking the bathroom and found Margaux&apos;s body under a green blanket.  Ionescu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121193710/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06012008/news/regionalnews/bloody_bath_slay_113464.htm">said Dana was distraught</a>, &quot;She said, &apos;No! No! It&apos;s not possible. Tell me it&apos;s not true!&apos;...I just saw some hands... I didn&apos;t want to look. I didn&apos;t see her face. When I saw the girl, I prayed.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear when Powers was killed--her throat was slit and her body was &quot;chopped into pieces.&quot; </p>

<p>The News says police &quot;<strong>found a written apology from the murderer in the apartment, but the note was unsigned</strong>,&quot; and started to search for Powers&apos; boyfriend Jonathan Smith, who also lived in the Chelsea apartment.  From the News:</p><blockquote>While police swarmed the Chelsea building, Smith was downtown, where he jumped from an apartment house at 15 Broad St., landing on Exchange Place in two pieces, cops said.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I was walking with my girl. Somebody just fell off the building,&quot; said a stunned Chao Williams, 21, of East New York, Brooklyn. &quot;I just heard the noise. It was like a loud boom.&quot; </p></blockquote>Ionescu said that Powers and Smith &quot;fought all the time&quot; and a friend of Dana Powers said, &quot;They used to fight. I heard he had a bad temper. He was a little crazy.&quot;  <p></p>
