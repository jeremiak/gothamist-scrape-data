<p>Bad boy fashion designer&#x2014;and someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233725/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/designer_john_galliano_found_guilty.php">convicted of anti-Semitism</a>&#x2014;John Galliano won&apos;t be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233725/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/22/hitler-lover_john_galliano_to_teach.php">teaching at Parsons after all.</a> His much-ballyhooed four-day &quot;masterclass&quot; workshop has been cancelled!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233725/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/nyregion/parsons-school-for-design-cancels-visit-by-galliano.html">According to the NY Times</a>, Parsons at the New School for Design made the announcement last night and issued this statement, &quot;An important element of the planned workshop with John Galliano was a candid conversation about the connection between his professional work and his actions in the world at large. Unfortunately, we could not reach consensus with Mr. Galliano on the conditions of this conversation, and the program could not move forward.&quot; </p>

<p>Let&apos;s see&#x2014;given that there&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233725/https://www.change.org/petitions/parsons-the-new-school-for-design-anti-semitic-fashion-designer-john-galliano-should-not-teach-at-the-school">backlash against the workshop</a>, we&apos;d wager Galliano didn&apos;t want to talk about calling a Parisian cafe patron a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233725/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/john_galliano_fired_from_dior_after.php">&quot;dirty Jew face&quot; and saying things like &quot;I love Hitler</a>... People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, would all be f****** gassed&quot;&#x2014;and losing his job at Christian Dior over it.</p>

<p>The New School had said earlier it hoped its &quot;students can learn from his talents and achievements as a designer and from his personal failures.&quot;</p>
