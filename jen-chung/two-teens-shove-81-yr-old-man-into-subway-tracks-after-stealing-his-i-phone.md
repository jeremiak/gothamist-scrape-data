<p>What the hell is wrong with our world: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015249/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teens-shove-octogenarian-train-tracks-brooklyn-subway-station-article-1.1026681">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Two heartless teens shoved an octogenarian onto the train tracks in a Brooklyn subway station when he chased them for swiping his iPhone, police said.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occured on Friday at the Lorimer Street stop around 11:45 a.m..  The 81-year-old man had been waiting for a J train &quot;when one of the thieves approached him and stole his smartphone. As the man chased his robber, a second suspect pushed him onto the trackbed below, police said.&quot;</p>

<p>While it&apos;s unclear how the victim got out of the tracks (did he get out himself? did a good Samaritan help him?), he was taken to Woodhull Hospital in stable condition.  Cops believe the suspects are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015249/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/man_pushed_to_tracks_in_iphone_theft_S6eeI392aRDG3wWQS8MwQL">between the ages of 16 and 18</a>&#x2014;&quot;The first suspect is about 6 feet tall, and wore a black Adidas sweatshirt and black sneakers. The second youth is about 5 foot-8, and wore a red shirt, jeans, and white sneakers during the vicious robbery.&quot;</p>
