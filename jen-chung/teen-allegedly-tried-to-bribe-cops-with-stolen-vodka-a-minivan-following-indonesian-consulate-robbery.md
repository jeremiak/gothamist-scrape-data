<p>Two teenagers were arrested yesterday for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015755/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/vodka_samsung_tablet_clothes_and_va.php">stealing, among other things, a case of vodka and a minivan</a> from the Indonesian Consulate. They were caught thanks to a Bronx hotel guard who recognized them because they also allegedly stole a guest&apos;s belongings.</p>

<p>David Rivera, 18, and his 16-year-old female accomplice were charged with burglary, grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property and criminal trespass for the Monday burglary of the Indonesian Consulate on the Upper East Side. Authorities say they entered through an unlocked side door and took a case of vodka (reportedly Grey Goose), a suitcase of clothes, a Samsung tablet and keys to a Honda Odyssey minivan before driving off in the vehicle. </p>

<p>Apparently the teens had been at the Marriott Residence Inn on Eastchester Road in the Bronx over the weekend, where they are accused of stealing a hotel guest&apos;s jewelry and purse. NBC New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015755/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Teen-Burglars-Arrested-Indonesian-Consulate-Break-in-Vodka-Van-Bribe-391121561.html">reports</a>, &quot;The teens apparently went back to the Marriott on Tuesday and that&apos;s when the guard recognized them and called police. The teens took off, but security followed them.&quot;</p>

<p>The police arrested them, and a cop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015755/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/teens-accused-breaking-ues-consulate-nabbed-bronx-article-1.2763754">realized they might also be the suspects</a> in the consulate burglary.</p>

<p>The NYPD said, &quot;During the arrest process Mr. Rivera attempted to bribe the officers with US currency, alcohol and a motor vehicle.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015755/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/teens-accused-breaking-ues-consulate-nabbed-bronx-article-1.2763754">The News adds,</a> &quot;Though police couldn&#x2019;t say for certain that Rivera was bribing the officer with the swag from the consulate heist, the minivan he offered was a gold-colored Honda Odyssey, cops said.&quot;<br>
