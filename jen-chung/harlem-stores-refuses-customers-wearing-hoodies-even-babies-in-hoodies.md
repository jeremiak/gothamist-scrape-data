<p>A number of Harlem shops are now telling customers &quot;No hoodies&quot; are allowed. And that even means babies in hoodies!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012347/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141027/central-harlem/harlem-businesses-post-sign-telling-people-wearing-hoodies-not-enter">According to DNAinfo</a>, three businesses on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, between 126th and 129th Streets, have signs that say &quot;DO NOT ENTER WITH HOODIE OR MASK&quot; and &quot;IF SO YOU ARE NOW TRESPASSING.&quot; One business claimed they are letting in customers with hoodies, as long as they wear them down, but one young mother, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, said she and her baby&#x2014;also wearing a hoodie&#x2014;were asked to leave.</p>

<p>Princess Johnson, while carrying her baby clad in a pink jumper with hood, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012347/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/10/27/some-harlem-businesses-display-no-hoodies-allowed-signs/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I can&#x2019;t get her milk because they said we&#x2019;re trespassing. I feel offended,&quot; adding, &quot;The signs are everywhere. They should take them down because it&#x2019;s violating everybody and we can&#x2019;t go into a store because of a hoodie? That&#x2019;s crazy.&quot;</p>

<p>Participating stores say that they turned to the signs to make customers feel more comfortable&#x2014;and also because when they&apos;ve been robbed, hoodies prevent clerks from getting a good look at suspects for police description.</p>

<p>The signs were created by Joe Stark, a Philadelphia businessman. He told DNAinfo, &quot;We&#x2019;re trying to put robbers and shoplifters on notice. When you get a guy walking into a store and he has a hood up, a mask up, it can be a scary thing.&quot; He insists the signs aren&apos;t targeting races, because criminals can be &quot;can be black, white, brown, yellow, blue or green... The only complaint you might have is from the little thugs selling drugs in the corner.&quot;</p>
