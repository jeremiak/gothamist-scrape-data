One example is a internist and a labor nurse (plus two kids) living in a $3,995/month Greenwich Village rental--though spacious, there&apos;s a &quot;queen-size bed, a crib, a toddler bed and a dresser&quot; wedged in the sole bedroom.  Then there&apos;s a Lower East Side couple who gave up their bedroom for their two kids (the couple sleeps in a former closet).  Census data says there are more white, white-collar families living in one bedroom apartments; Queens College demographer Andrew Beveridge explains, &quot;<strong>Oftentimes both parents are working and have lives in the city and don&#x2019;t want to commute in and then worry about having to get back home.</strong> There is a much bigger traction to city life.&#x201D;</p>
