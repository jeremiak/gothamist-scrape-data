When MTA police spotted the stolen vehicle on Monday morning at the Verrazano Narrows Bridge toll plaza, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012215/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/07/mta_cops_shoot_at_carjacked_humvee.php">they fired at the vehicle when it didn&apos;t stop</a>. <p></p>

<p>Police say that on Sunday, July 6, at around 6:10 a.m. Tyrell Brown, 25, approached a 29-year-old man at the rear of 55 Holland Avenue while holding a gun and demanded money. Then, cops say, Brown &quot;made the victim lay on ground, the victim complied, and the suspect fled in the victim&apos;s 2006 black Hummer and drove away.&quot;</p>

<p>The Hummer was apparently spotted at the toll plaza on Monday shortly after 1 a.m. When officers approached, they heard a bang that sounded like a gunshot, so they fired. A woman was thrown out of the car (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012215/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2014/07/cops_offer_12000_reward_for_ty.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Advance reports</a> that she was charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle and criminal possession of stolen property) and the car sped off.</p>

<p>The car was then dumped and the driver fled. </p>

<p>Brown is described as being 5&apos;8&quot; in height, 150 pounds, with black hair, brown eyes and has &quot;Doreatha&quot; tattooed on his neck. He was last seen wearing a red hooded jacket and tan pants. Police also say he is armed and dangerous.</p>

<p>There is a $12,000 reward now&#x2014;$2,000 payable by Crime Stoppers upon arrest and indictment and $10,000 payable by the NYPD upon the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the above listed crime.
