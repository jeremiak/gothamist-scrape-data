The client says broker Leif Lopez showed her the apartments, which she planned to sublet to tourists.  She signed contracts and paid in cash--because he said &quot;he would give me a huge deal on the apartments&quot;--but then Lopez never gave her the keys.  Lopez, charged with grand larceny, is currently being held on $7,500 bail.  The victim says, &quot;I&apos;ve been depressed since this happened to me.  I lost all the money I had.&quot;</p>
