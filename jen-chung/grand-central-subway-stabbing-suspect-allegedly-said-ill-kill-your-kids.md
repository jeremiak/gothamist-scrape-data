<p>The man accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014321/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/16/three_stabbed_by_drunk_man_at_6_tra.php">stabbing three people at the Grand Central Terminal subway station</a> is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014321/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/18/lawyer-of-subway-slashing-suspect-it-was-self-defense/">claiming it was self-defense</a>, but prosecutors say that Ivan Deleon started swinging his knife when he bumped into a child.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014321/http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/subway-slasher-threatens-ill-kill-your-kids-prosecutors/">the Post</a>, &quot;The incident began when he bumped into a child and allegedly threatened, &apos;I&#x2019;ll kill your kids.&apos; He then whipped out a folding knife and swung wildly at his victims, authorities said.&quot; Then he allegedly &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014321/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/18/lawyer-of-subway-slashing-suspect-it-was-self-defense/">swore at the adults to get out of the way</a>, threatened them and then pulled out a folding knife and wounded three men.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Deleon&apos;s lawyer claimed, &quot;He had to fight for his life,&quot; and that the three men had attacked him.</p>

<p>Deleon is being held on $100,000 bail.</p>
