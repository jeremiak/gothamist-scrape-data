She told CBO in 2009</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I have never been one to see a glass half empty, but instead a glass that overflows with opportunities and solutions. I think out of the box and I am a 24/7/365 day personality. I embrace learning and strive to be proactive in order to follow my motto to its fullest: to make a
difference in the world...  While everything is new, it is also familiar because I have seen it all before through Michael&#x2019;s eyes. I have a vision for the company and I believe in the values that Michael kept dear to him.  I plan on taking them and expanding into the new generation without changing the original qualities...The best is yet to come, and Archie Comics are cooler than ever!&quot;</blockquote>
