It&apos;s been nearly two-and-a-half years since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/12/spitzers_kriste.php">we first met you</a> (via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/10/hookergate_a_year_later.php?gallery0Pic=4#gallery">relentless news media</a>, of course).  Back then, you were just an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/15/celebrity_whori.php">aspiring singer</a> and a high-class call girl whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/governor_spitze_1.php">rendez-vous with a governor</a> resulted in his resignation.  Now, you&apos;re an aspiring singer who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/ashley_dupre_with_whip_candles_litt.php">posed for Playboy</a>, is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/13/ashley_dupres_new_gig_ny_post_sex_c.php">Post&apos;s sex columnist</a> and just finished taking a course in... real estate.<p></p>

<p>Page Six (naturally) found out that Dupre may be headed towards a job that pays in commission.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/ask_ashley_about_apartments_Hy4T4dkLuadiH9yjYiQHPO"> She said</a>: </p><blockquote>I recently moved back to New York from Los Angeles. Since being home, I took and passed the accelerated Real Estate Salesperson Course at NYU.<p></p>

<p>New York City real estate has always been an interest of mine. It&apos;s just something that I wanted to do. Where this goes is yet to be determined. I am so excited to be back -- there&apos;s no place like New York.</p>

<p>Music has always been my passion and will remain that always. Right now my focus is on my column, Ask Ashley, every Sunday in The Post.</p></blockquote><br>
And P6&apos;s &quot;sources&quot; that Dupre was a hit at NYU: She &quot;made a ton of friends. She dressed very cute to class, hung out with students during lunch, and has been very into the course. She was one of the top students -- often answering questions from the lecturers before they&apos;d even finished speaking.&quot;  On his website, Pat&apos;s Papers<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092754/http://www.patspapers.com/story_stack/item/ashley_dupre_now_ill_show_you_the_bedroom/">, Pat Kiernan points out</a> that she may be saying, &quot;Now, it&#x2019;s time for me to show you the bedroom.&quot;<p></p>
