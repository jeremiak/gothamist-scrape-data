<p>Multiple dolphin deaths are concerning some in NJ; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823125033/http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/string-of-stranded-dolphins-worries-humans/article_d53256f8-f5e7-11e2-9d65-001a4bcf887a.html">Press of Atlantic City reports</a>, &quot;In the past week, six dolphins have washed up dead or dying on beaches.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Robert Schoelkopf, of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823125033/http://www.marinemammalstrandingcenter.org/">Marine Mammal Stranding Center</a>, &quot;Two of the dolphins showed signs of being caught in some type of fishing net, Schoelkopf said, an indication the animals were ensnared during a commercial fishing operation. A third dolphin washed up with its throat slit, the knife wound running all the way down to its stomach, he said.&quot; He contacted the Bureau of Marine Fisheries to see &quot;if there is some type of commercial fishing operation that was observed.&quot;</p>

<p>The dolphins washed up in Long Beach Township, Holgate, Barnegat Light, Ocean City and Ship&apos;s Bottom. Commercial fishing fleets are required to report any accidental catchings of marine mammals. A marine mammal stranding coordinator with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823125033/http://www.app.com/article/20130727/NJNEWS/307270011/Six-dolphins-found-dead-Jersey-Shore">told the Asbury Park Press</a>, &quot;It may be unusual, but it&#x2019;s not necessary to cause alarm right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Another NOAA representative indicated that the combination of warm weather (meaning, more boats in the area) and dolphins&apos; migration patterns might result in more dolphin strandings. Also, with the increase in dolphins in the area, the more likely it is for old or sick dolphins to wash ashore.</p>
