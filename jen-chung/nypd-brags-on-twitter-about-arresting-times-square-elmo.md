<p>As the city considers a bill that would require <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/costume_law_nyc.php">pretty much anyone wearing a costume in NYC</a> to pay a $175 licensing fee, yet another Times Square costume character was arrested.</p>

<p>The NYPD&apos;s Midtown South Precinct Tweeted the news yesterday: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just another day in Midtown South. Elmo arrested in Times Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYPD?src=hash">#NYPD</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/https://twitter.com/hashtag/TimesSquare?src=hash">#TimesSquare</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTS?src=hash">#MTS</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/http://t.co/RibtEH0gVz">pic.twitter.com/RibtEH0gVz</a></p>&#x2014; NYPD Midtown South (@NYPDMTS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/https://twitter.com/NYPDMTS/status/512010640123506688">September 16, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/http://nypost.com/2014/09/16/elmo-in-handcuffs-after-times-square-bust/">According to the Post&apos;s NYPD sources</a>, &quot;Rosa Sanchez, 36, was busted after 10 plainclothes cops posing as tourists took photos with her Tuesday during a sting, according to law-enforcement sources. The Elmo was arrested at about 3:30 p.m. after she allegedly became aggressive over a tip she was unhappy with. When Sanchez was searched at the station house, cops found that she had about $200 in singles, fives and 20s in her possession.&quot;</p>

<p>Sanchez was charged with aggressive solicitation. While the characters are allowed to accept tips, they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/09/quirky_is_fine_creepy_is_not_times.php#photo-1">not allowed to intimidate Times Square visitors</a> into posing with them and demanding money. This past weekend, a Batman and Spider-Man were arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/14/batman_spider-man_arrested_for_figh.php">fighting Times Square pedestrians who were heckling them</a>.</p>

<p>The proposed &quot;costumed individual&quot; licensing program might seem like a good idea to those creeped out by Times Square Elmo zombies, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/costume_law_nyc.php">some critics argue it goes too far</a>. According to the broad language of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031917/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1903343&amp;GUID=5A45C651-7373-4589-86B4-F77DD0FD5CFC&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=Costumed+individuals">the bill</a>, a permit would be required for anyone wearing a costume who is &quot;interacting with the public&quot; <em>anywhere</em> in NYC. A costume is defined by the legislation as:</p>

<blockquote>An article of clothing, accessory, mask, paint, or other object that: (1) obscures or shrouds the face of a person beyond recognition; or (2) causes a person to resemble a character rather than his or her own personal identity</blockquote>

<p>An advocate for street buskers told us, &quot;It is difficult for us to see a valid public interest in requiring a license for any political speech in costume in the whole city,&quot; adding that it could be interpreted &quot;to require a license for trick-or-treating in Halloween anywhere in New York City.&quot;</p>
