</div></div>					<p>Have you ever wonder what would happen if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045715/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/have_you_fallen_for_a_hipster_trap.php">dozens of hipster traps</a> were airlifted to Berlin&apos;s hipster community and then someone decided to hold a Hipster Olympics to the music of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045715/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ">Yakety Sax</a>&quot;?  Well, that was pretty much the scene yesterday&#x2014;think events like &quot;skinny jeans tug o&apos; war,&quot; a &#x201C;horn-rimmed glasses toss,&quot; &quot;turning vinyl records,&quot; &quot;bobbing for bubble tea pearls,&quot; and an &quot;Apple product &apos;The Price is Right&apos; game.&quot; And lots of hipster mustaches.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045715/http://www.thelocal.de/society/20120722-43899.html">According to The Local</a>, &quot;The tongue-in-cheek event, held in eastern Berlin&#x2019;s hip <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045715/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain">Friedrichshain</a> district on Saturday, saw twelve teams of self-proclaimed hipsters compete in Olympic-style events - whilst at the same time attempting not to appear too keen... But being a hipster in Europe&#x2019;s capital of cool is &apos;not all fun and games&apos; warned games organiser Thomas Blockus, 27, in his opening speech to the crowd, there&#x2019;s like, you know, politics and stuff?  Blockus then proceeded to read out a &apos;Hipster Manifesto&apos; of demands to Berlin city administration - more iPhone charging stations in U-bahn stations, a Club Mate fountain at Rosenthaler Platz in Mitte and more places where party goers can hang up their jute bags at the infamous Berghain Techno club.&quot;</p>

<p>And, per a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045715/http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/hipster-olympiade-in-berlin-im-namen-des-bartes-und-der-brille,10809148,16673536.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DThomas%2BBlockus%2Bhipster%26hl%3Den%26prmd%3Dimvnso&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a1sMUMXfKcTA0QGys7SMBA&amp;ved=0CGkQ7gEwAQ">Google translation of an article in Berliner Zeitunge</a>, there are photographs of American hipster moments, with captions like &quot;In American cities like New York hipsters are against establishment and crazy clothes. You can find hipsters in pubs and shops&quot; and &quot;Long brown beard? Bizarre and weird hobbies?&quot; And, yes, there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045715/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/hipster_cop_secrets_spilled_by_nypd.php">photograph of Hipster Cop Rick Lee</a>, &quot;He is a symbol of the hipster spirit in his hometown.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are some videos of the events:</p>
