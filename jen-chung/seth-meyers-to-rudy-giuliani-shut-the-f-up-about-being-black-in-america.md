<p>Television news producers know by now that having Rudy Giuliani on their programs is like broadcasting a ten car pile-up happening in real time&#x2014;so that&apos;s why they book him. Coming off the heels of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626170655/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/10/rudy_giuliani_says_the_black_kid_wh.php">his tone-deaf, racist remarks</a> criticizing the Black Lives Matters movement&#x2014;&quot;The real danger to you is that black kid who is going to shoot you on the street&quot;&#x2014;on MSNBC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626170655/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/giuliani-blacks-crime-problem-dallas-police-rap-music-chicago/">Giuliani appeared on CBS&apos;s Face the Nation to declare</a>, &quot;When you say black lives matter, that&apos;s inherently racist. Black lives matter. White lives matter. Asian lives matter. Hispanic lives matter. That&apos;s anti-American, and it&apos;s racist.&quot;</p>

<p>Giuliani also had some thoughts about being black, &quot;If I were a black father and I was concerned about the safety of my child, really concerned about it and not in a politically activist sense, I would say be very respectful to the police, most of them are good, some can be very bad and just be very careful. I&apos;d also say be very careful of those kids in the neighborhood, don&apos;t get involved with them because son, there&apos;s a 99 percent chance they&apos;re going to kill you not the police.&quot;</p>

<p>Seth Meyers put it well on his show last night: &quot;First of all, don&apos;t ever start a sentence with the phrase &apos;If I were a black father.&apos; If you are a black father, you don&apos;t need to say it. And if you&apos;re not, you should probably just shut the fuck up.&quot;</p>

<p>Luckily, Face the Nation had Wellesley, MA police chief Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626170655/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-black-lives-matter.html"> to refute Giuliani&apos;s claims</a> that the Black Lives Matter is harming police officers&apos; lives: &quot;I wouldn&#x2019;t make that connection,... I wouldn&#x2019;t say that it&#x2019;s Black Lives Matter that put a target on those police officers. Unfortunately, I think, you know, people have really polarized this issue. If we really want to work towards solutions, we need to work together.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626170655/http://www.clickhole.com/blogpost/if-black-lives-matter-isnt-racist-hate-group-then--4610">Clickhole article summed up the problem</a> Giuliani and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626170655/http://www.salon.com/2016/07/11/mike_huckabee_the_real_movement_in_america_should_be_male_lives_matter/"> other stupid people </a>have in an article titled, &quot;If Black Lives Matter Isn&#x2019;t A Racist Hate Group, Then Can Someone Please Explain To Me Why I Keep Insisting They Are?&quot;</p>

<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626170655/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/opinion/rudy-giulianis-racial-myths.html?ref=opinion">editorial in the NY Times reminds everyone</a>, &quot;<strong>Those who remember Mr. Giuliani as the hectoring mayor of New York know what he has to offer any conversation on race and violence &#x2014; not a lot</strong>...In 1999, when Mr. Giuliani was New York&#x2019;s tough-on-crime mayor, Amadou Diallo reached for his wallet and was cut down in a hail of police bullets. Patrick Dorismond was minding his own business on a Manhattan street in 2000 when Mr. Giuliani&#x2019;s undercover officers confronted him and shot him dead. In one of the disgraceful acts of his or any mayoralty, Mr. Giuliani smeared the victim&#x2019;s reputation and released part of his juvenile police record, as if to suggest that he deserved to be murdered.&quot;</p>

<p>So, please TV producers&#x2014;stop putting Giuliani on your shows. Except you, Fox News, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626170655/http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/07/11/rudy-giuliani-black-lives-matter-violence-chicago-fox-and-friends">we know how much you love his divisive trolling</a>.<br>
