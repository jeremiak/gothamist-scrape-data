Weiner (ABC News)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Those Anthony Weiner photographs&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104945/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/weinergate_no_parade_for_weiner_mor.php">me</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104945/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/weinergate_weiner_waxes_extremely_g.php">Pussys, topless</a>&#x2014;haunting you came from the account of a 26-year-old single mother from Texas, Meagan Broussard.... who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104945/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-anthony-weiner-picture/story?id=13774605">now told her side of the story to ABC News</a>.  She said that she commented on his Facebook page on April 20, soon became his Facebook friend, and then they were exchanging &quot;hundreds of messages,&quot; (&quot;many of a sexual nature&quot; according to ABC News).  Broussard said, &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s a bad guy. I think he&apos;s got issues just like everybody else. Everyone&apos;s standards are different, but to be elected to Congress and sit there all day on Facebook and chatting?&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner admitted to Tweeting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104945/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php">photograph of his underwear-clad crotch</a>, intended for a different young woman, at a bombshell press conference today.  Broussard said that she received the same photograph and when the scandal broke, &quot;I just chuckled. It would be one thing if he came out and said, &apos;Hey, so what?&apos; But now he&apos;s saying he got hacked.&quot;</p>

<p>Broussard explained that she Facebook-liked a YouTube video of a speech Weiner which was on his page and also commented, &quot;Hottt.&quot;  </p><blockquote>She also commented -- &quot;hottttt&quot; -- on the link, which is still publicly visible on Weiner&apos;s page and has received hundreds of other comments from Facebook users.<p></p>

<p>Weiner &quot;almost immediately&quot; added Broussard as a Facebook friend through his personal profile account, she said. And she accepted his request.</p>

<p>According to Broussard, the two immediately began messaging through Facebook chat, eventually exchanging &quot;hundreds of messages,&quot; many of a sexual nature.</p>

<p>Because of how Facebook messaging works, ABC News was not able to view records of the alleged chats.</p>

<p>He would say &quot;just good morning, how are you doing, what are you doing today? What are you wearing? What do you like? You know, in the bedroom, you know, that sort of thing,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>During one Facebook chat conversation, Broussard said she voiced uneasiness with the electronic relationship, to which she says Weiner replied, &quot;you are not stalking me....I am stalking you.&quot;</p>

<p>In another conversation, Broussard said she asked Weiner, &quot;Why are you so open? I said, I&apos;m not an open book like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He replied, &apos;I&apos;m an open book. Maybe too open,&apos;&quot; she said.</p></blockquote>They would also email each other photographs&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104945/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/slideshow/meagan-broussard-explicit-exchanges-rep-weiner-13772537">see them here</a>&#x2014;and she said, &quot;I don&apos;t think he has any control over what he&apos;s doing in this area. I don&apos;t think someone can be that open in that amount of time.&quot; She was also surprised that he knew the name of her daughter (he overheard her laughing in the background and inquired about the child by name), &quot;That kind of freaked me out because you had to pilfer through my Facebook to find out her name.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Broussard also said she was coming forward to get ahead of the story, &quot;I have my own life, my own things where I&apos;m from and I just wanted to go ahead with them. I thought I could just be private about it, but there&apos;s no reason for me to hide. I didn&apos;t do anything wrong. I don&apos;t know him. I&apos;m just putting my story out there before anyone else tries to.&quot;</p>
