<p>Apparently the feds &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425153800/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/teacher_in_kid_porn_rap_lLjpPMJBzyDRGBFkBJobQM#ixzz0wUTNstFm">traced the Internet path of the lurid videos to his doorstep</a>.&quot; (Read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425153800/http://www.scribd.com/doc/35819556/John-E-Thomas-Arrested-on-Charge-of-Possessing-Child-Pornography">charges</a>.) The Daily News reports, &quot;The porn featured children around the same ages of those he taught and counseled.&quot; Which means that when a News reporter descended on parents of campers, parents offered quotes like, &quot;It&apos;s awful! There&apos;s a lot of sick people out there... . It&apos;s so scary.&quot;  However, Thomas&apos; friend said at the courthouse, &quot;This is not him. He has never been in trouble before.&quot; </p>

<p>A federal prosecutor asked for electronic monitoring of Thomas, noting, &quot;There are kids everywhere and it&apos;s to keep him away from kids. The danger here is not just his employment, there are playgrounds everywhere,&quot; while his lawyer argued, &quot;Mr. Thomas has been a teacher for five years and there have been no allegations of acts like this.<strong> The charges are severe indeed but they are limited to viewing</strong>.&quot; In the end, the judge rejected monitoring but said Thomas had to &quot;avoid anywhere where children congregate.&quot;</p>

<p>Thomas was supposed to start teaching at the Bank Street School this fall.  He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. </p>
