<p>Police released video surveillance footage of a possible abduction in upper Manhattan in hopes that the public can help them identify people wanted for questioning.</p>

<p>The incident allegedly happened at 6:55 p.m. last night: According to police, &quot;several persons notified members of the 33rd precinct Detective Squad after hearing a woman scream and observing two unidentified males force the victims into a vehicle at gunpoint, in the vicinity of Haven Avenue and West 173rd Street. The minivan fled south bound on Haven Avenue from West 173rd Street.&quot; </p>

<p>[Note: A reader tells us, &quot;I live on 175th near Haven. Haven is a one-way round that runs South but van shown in the video is driving in the opposite direction the cars parked. I&apos;m familiar with that intersection and it looks like they drove West down 173rd St and turned NORTH on Haven.&quot;]</p>

<p>According to the Post, five men maybe have abducted a woman at gunpoint and the men running in the video are fleeing: </p><blockquote>The woman was walking along Haven Avenue near 173rd Street at about 7 p.m. when the men, dressed in black, forced her into a black Chrysler van with tinted windows that sped south on Haven, the witness told police. <p></p>

<p>The woman was described as white or a light-skinned Hispanic wearing a long white coat with black pants and two backpacks.</p>

<p>The abduction took place near housing for Columbia University medical students, but it was unclear if the woman lived in the building, police sources said.</p></blockquote><br>
