<p>It seems the road to fame and fortune&#x2014;or at least infamy and lingerie photo shoots&#x2014;still exists even if you&apos;ve been deported from the United States as a bumbling spy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711164527/http://gothamist.com/tags/annachapman">Anna Chapman</a>, the former NYC party girl with extensive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711164527/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/spy_babe_embarassed_over_facebook_p.php">Facebook pictures</a> who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711164527/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/alleged_russian_spy_anything_can_ha.php">accused of being a Russian spy</a>, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711164527/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/09/spies_successfully_swapped_russian.php">sent back to Mother Russia</a>, where she&apos;s been made an advisor to a bank and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711164527/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/10/18/2010-10-18_anna_chapman_and_other_russian_sleeper_agents_arrested_in_us_awarded_with_kremli.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader#ixzz12o383BaG">feted by President Dmitry Medvedev</a> with the Kremlin&apos;s highest honor.  And now she&apos;s in the new issue of the Russian Maxim!</p>

<p>Animal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711164527/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/10/maxim-reduces-spy-anna-chapman-to-spy-caricature/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+animalnewyork+%28ANIMAL%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">has more photographs and notes</a>, &quot;Unlike her cheap hotel room fiasco, the glossy Maxim session - her first professional photo shoot (and airbrushing) - is a valiant attempt to restore the spy gal fantasy... &apos;Curiosity is my favorite trait about myself,&apos; says Red in busty leotard.&quot; And there&apos;s also video: </p>
