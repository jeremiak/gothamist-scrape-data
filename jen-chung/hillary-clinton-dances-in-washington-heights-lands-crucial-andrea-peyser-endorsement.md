					<p>As that upstart 74-year-old Socialist from Vermont draws huge crowds to rallies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/washington_square_park_bernie.php#photo-1">with Vampire Weekend</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/bernie_sanders_prospect_park.php">Grizzly Bear as his opening acts</a>, Hillary Cilnton&apos;s public campaign events have been a little bit more subdued, which seems about right for someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-hillary-clinton-keeps-new-york-edge-leads-bernie-sanders-in-california-election-2016/">ahead in the NY polls by 10 points</a>. But then Hillary broke out her dancing shoes yesterday.</p>

<p>In Washington Heights, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/17/politics/hillary-clinton-washington-heights-dancing/">Clinton told the crowd</a>, &quot;Imagine an America where we are unified again. Where we stand against the hate(ful) rhetoric coming from the Republicans, where we say to Donald Trump, &apos;BASTA!&apos;&quot; And, as Latin music played, State Senator Adriano Espaillat spun her around: </p>

<center><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621if_/https://vine.co/v/itY6VgYWaWD/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621js_/https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script></center>

<p>If you watch the director&apos;s cut, you&apos;ll note that Espaillat&apos;s challenger for Rep. Charlie Rangel&apos;s House seat, New York State Assemblyman Keith Wright, also danced with Clinton:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvXut5tUhxQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p>Clinton also visited Staten Island, which is traditionally a Republican stronghold (and Donald Trump happened to be visiting the borough as well). Her visit, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/04/trump_clinton_visits_show_stat.html#incart_big-photo">Assemblyman Matthew Titone</a>, suggests that S.I.&apos;s votes &quot;were in play.&quot; From the Staten Island Advance: </p><blockquote>A 27-year-old woman named Maxine opened, recalling getting pregnant at age 18, struggling to stay in school, getting on public assistance, and later, raising a child as a young, single mother. She was a domestic violence victim, too. She got coverage through the Children&apos;s Health Insurance Program for her daughter, a program for which Clinton gets credit.<p></p>

<p>Now, the woman is an internal auditor at a large bank, is earning six figures and has a few degrees. &quot;We can become the victim or we can become the victor. I chose to become the victor,&quot; she said, thanking Clinton for helping her get there.</p></blockquote>Clinton did not hold back from slamming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/16/zodiac_ted_on_the_offense.php">Ted &quot;Bad Old Days&quot; Cruz</a>: <p></p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hillary Clinton addresses Staten islanders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Clinton?src=hash">#Clinton</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/https://t.co/D6mwOlUWFp">pic.twitter.com/D6mwOlUWFp</a></p>&#x2014; Tracey Porpora (@TraceyPorpora1) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/https://twitter.com/TraceyPorpora1/status/721817656811249664">April 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20160926134621js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Today, Clinton is planning a big Get Out The Vote event in Manhattan at the New York Hilton Midtown (Trianon Ballroom, 3rd Floor, 1335 Ave of the America; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/events/view/DL3VRVWDC4NHAHP2/">public RSVP here</a>). Doors open at noon and the event begins at 2 p.m.; U.S Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, and Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Cecile Richards will be speaking, along with NYC First Lady Chirlane McCray. </p>

<p>One vote that Clinton can now add to her column is that of trolling NY Post columnist Andrea Peyser. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134621/http://nypost.com/2016/04/18/im-only-voting-for-hillary-because-shes-not-bernie/">In her column today</a>, Peyser explains that she&apos;s a registered Democrat (!) because &quot;in order to have a say about which chucklehead wins a seat, my party affiliation must be Democratic.&quot; Her explanation for choosing Clinton, who she doesn&apos;t even like: &quot;I&#x2019;m voting for Hillary for one reason: She&#x2019;s not Bernie Sanders... I believe Hillary Clinton is just too smart to wreck the country.&quot;</p>
