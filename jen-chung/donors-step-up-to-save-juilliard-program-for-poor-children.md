<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_mapj.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151905im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_mapj.jpg" width="250" height="164" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151905/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/arts/music/08juil.html?scp=1&amp;sq=juilliard&amp;st=cse">NY Times reported</a> that budget cuts were forcing the Juilliard School to cut its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151905/http://www.juilliard.edu/musicadvancement/musicadvancement.html">Music Advancement Program</a>, which has been offering mostly free musical training to African-American, Latino, and Native American students (grades 3 through 8).  Luckily, the article also sparked concern: Today the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151905/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/arts/11juil.html?ref=arts">NY Times reports</a> there are &quot;numerous offers of help, including a major pledge from the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation of Los Angeles.&quot;</p>

<p>The program &quot;consists of a two-year core curriculum that includes private lessons, small and large ensembles, music theory, and music history classes, as well as classes dealing with creative musical expression,&quot; and costs about $450,000/year to run.  The Broad Foundation is pledging $425,000 over four years and Juilliard President Joseph Polisi, who started the program in 1990, says he&apos;s contacting interested donors to raise enough money for three to four years, &#x201C;<strong>I did tell everybody that I&#x2019;m not going to accept a dime until I&#x2019;m sure I have a million and a half in place. I can&#x2019;t restart a program and then close it down again</strong>.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Eli Broad said, &quot;I strongly believe that all children, regardless of their economic circumstances, deserve access to quality arts education programs.  The Music Advancement Program is a model for bringing musical training to children who would not otherwise have access.&quot; In 2005, 60 Minutes&apos; Morley Safer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151905/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/15/60II/main702095.shtml">revisited MAP students</a> he had met in 1994 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151905/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/15/60II/main702095.shtml">video</a>); one, Rosie Mora, who attended NYU and University of Vermont for her master&apos;s in music, said if she hadn&apos;t gone to Juilliard, &quot;<strong>I&apos;d probably be in Iraq right now. Before I got involved with Juilliard, I didn&#x2019;t see college as an option. I never thought I would be able to afford it. So, I thought my only option into getting any kind of profession was joining the Army.</strong>&quot;  And if you&apos;re interested in donating to Juilliard, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151905/http://www.juilliard.edu/target/friends.html">here&apos;s more information</a>.</p>
