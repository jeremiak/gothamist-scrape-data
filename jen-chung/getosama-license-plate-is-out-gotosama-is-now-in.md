Retired NYPD cop Arno Herwerth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064801/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/taking_creative_license_2VodqebsDfKxKdFhFnwmnI">was initially worried</a> that the license plate wasn&apos;t available, based on his search on the DMV website, but the NY State DMV said there was a computer glitch and the plate is his for the taking.<p></p>

<p>Back in 2007, Herwerth battled the state to have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064801/http://www.moonbattery.com/arno_herwerth.jpg">GETOSAMA license plate</a> and won. When speaking to 1010WINS, Herwerth said of his outdated license plate, &quot;Obviously &apos;GETOSAMA&apos; is no longer fashionable so I first thought of &apos;GOTOSAMA&apos; but I looked on the internet and that&#x2019;s already taken.&quot;  But then the Post shared the good &quot;GOTOSAMA&quot; news with him, he said, &quot;I&apos;m thrilled. It&apos;s perfect.&quot;  Oh, and his other car&apos;s license plate is &quot;AX-ALQADA.&quot;</p>

<p>As you can see from the photograph, his van has the words &quot;Live Free Or Die&quot; and &quot;Get Osama.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear if he was invited to meet President Obama at Ground Zero tomorrow. </p>
