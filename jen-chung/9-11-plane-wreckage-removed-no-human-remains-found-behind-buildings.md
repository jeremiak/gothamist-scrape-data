	<p>Investigators have removed wreckage, believed to be the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020900/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/911_plane_wreckage_will_probably_be.php">trailing edge flap</a> of a plane that hit the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, from a narrow alley in lower Manhattan earlier today. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner had also been on site, saying it &quot;has concluded the inspection at 51 Park Place,&#x201D; a spokeswoman for the forensic medical agency said this morning. No potential human remains have been recovered.&quot;</p>

<p>The plane part was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020900/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/12_years_later_after_911_plane_land.php">found last Friday</a>, by site surveyors for 51 Park Place. The space is being rented by developer Sharif El-Gamal, who has proposed turning 45-47 Park Place into a mosque (known to haters as the &quot;Ground Zero&quot; mosque) and community center. El-Gamal is also buying 43 Park Place. </p>

<p>Since rope had been found on the plane part, El-Gamal, through his lawyer, suggested that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020900/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/27/911_plane_landing_gear_may_have_bee.php">plane wreckage was planted</a> by opponents of his mosque-and-community center plan. (Some opponents had argued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020900/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/03/ground_zero_mosque_fury_at_fever_pi.php">that the building should be landmarked</a> because wreckage from the attacks had landed on the roof.) However, it turns out that one of the first responding police officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020900/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/911_plane_wreckage_will_probably_be.php">had tied the the rope</a> onto the wreckage, in an attempt to move it to find identifying marks. </p>

<p>It&apos;s suspected that the part is from United flight 175, which hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center&#x2014;that plane&apos;s parts were scatted for blocks around Ground Zero (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020900/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Trade_Center,_NY_-_2001-09-11_-_Debris_Impact_Areas.svg">see diagram</a>).</p>

<p>The wreckage has been taken to the NYPD property clerk&apos;s office in Brooklyn. It&apos;s unclear what will happen to it&#x2014;the NYPD has pointed out that sometimes the federal authorities seize plane parts, while it&apos;s possible it may also be a historical artifact for a museum. </p>
