<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115810/http://abc7ny.com/news/wrong-way-head-on-crash-on-henry-hudson-seriously-injures-2/1376448/">minivan was reportedly first spotted</a> &quot;striking several parked cars on Eighth Avenue&quot; and 17th Street &quot;in Chelsea around 11:45 p.m.&quot;</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman says officers tried to stop the car, but were unsuccessful. Police continued to attempt to stop the car, but, the spokesman emphasized, it was never a pursuit with sirens and lights.</p>

At West 79th Street (where the road is the Henry Hudson Parkway), the vehicle crashed into a silver car heading south. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_06_hhw1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115810im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_06_hhw1.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> (David Torres)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The silver car&apos;s occupants, a 53-year-old male and a female, were both taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital; the female is in critical condition. The minivan&apos;s driver, a 24-year-old male, was also taken to St. Luke&apos;s, while the passenger, also a 24-year-old male, was taken to Weill Cornell; both are in stable condition.</p>

<p>Charges are pending against the minivan driver and passenger. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115810/http://pix11.com/2016/06/08/wrong-way-crash-on-west-side-highway-injures-4-2-men-in-custody/">PIX 11 reports,</a> &quot;Police believe the minivan may be stolen since the Connecticut plates on it don&apos;t match the vehicle.&quot;</p>

<p>The Henry Hudson Parkway reopened to traffic at 5 a.m. this morning.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The police said that the female passenger of the silver car, Olga Ilina, 54, died at the hospital. </p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>
