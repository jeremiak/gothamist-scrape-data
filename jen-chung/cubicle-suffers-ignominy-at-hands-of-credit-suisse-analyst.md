<p>Dealbreaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006200508/http://dealbreaker.com/2010/04/area-credit-suisse-employee-chose-unwisely">shared a photograph of a tech analyst&apos;s handiwork</a> at Credit Suisse. According to an email sent to analysts and associates, &quot;The attached picture was sent to me by Corporate Services and HR. This is nothing short of embarrassing for our group and something that the Firm takes very seriously. Vandalism of company property will result in disciplinary action leading up to, and including, termination of employment. We all work in a corporate environment - not a college dorm - if you cannot behave in a professional and respectful manner, you should consider alternative employment.&quot;</p>

<p>The analyst was fired.</p>
