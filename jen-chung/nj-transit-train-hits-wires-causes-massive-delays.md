<p>There are hours of delays in store for NJ Transit and Amtrak riders, after a NJ Transit train apparently hit some wires.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308085532/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-nj-transit-stuck-030612,0,5752127.story">WPIX reports</a>, &quot;A NJ Transit train carrying about 500 passengers was stuck in a Hudson River tunnel, causing rippling delays for Tuesday morning commuters. The train was New York-bound and supposed to have arrived at Penn Station at 5:40 a.m. But the train snagged on some overhead wiring, causing a malfunction at Secaucus Junction. By 8 a.m., the stalled train had begun moving again toward Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p>A WPIX producer happened to be on the train and she said, &quot;I felt us hit a wall or a fence and I saw sparks. All the power went off and they said we had hit a power line or some wire.&quot;  An emergency train eventually pushed the disabled train out but now only one tunnel is open.  Amtrak says it&apos;ll take a few hours to get it fixed.  Naturally, commuters are <em>pissed</em>:</p>
