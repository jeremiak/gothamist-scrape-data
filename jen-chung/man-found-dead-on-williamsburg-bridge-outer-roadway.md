<p>The man was discovered unconscious and unresponsive around 5:22 a.m., a police spokesman said, adding that it&apos;s unclear if he was struck by a vehicle or whether he fell from a walkway above where he was found.</p>

<p>A tipster said, &quot;I thought it was a Halloween prank, until police showed up and covered him up.&quot; </p>
