</div></div><p>Yesterday, Mayor Bloomberg headed from the Big Apple to Martha&apos;s Vineyard to play a round of golf with President Obama.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121008/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20014930-503544.html">According to a White House press pool report</a>, &quot;We are told Bloomberg and Obama talked in the clubhouse for about 15 mins about the economy. They then went to the driving range and are about to begin their round.&quot; Then the White House said, &quot;The president and Mayor Bloomberg took the opportunity to discuss plans for short- and long-term economic growth at a pivotal point in our recovery.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post thinks there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121008/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/mike_avoid_rough_subject_ShuKRp3zEm7GAGp33gcCeI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">something else behind Bloomberg&apos;s visit</a>: A source said,  &quot;It&apos;s definitely a <em>telling</em> invite. Bloomberg can really help Obama fend off the crazy Tea Party types. He&apos;s an independent, and he&apos;s the most well-known mayor in the country.&quot;  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121008/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/08/27/2010-08-27_president_obama_mayor_bloomberg_take_their_swings_on_economy_during_round_of_gol.html">Daily News points out</a> that Bloomberg &quot;notably didn&apos;t direct any blame at Obama for what he called [the federal stimulus bill&apos;s] failings&quot; during his radio show yesterday; the mayor said, &quot;Once you get it to Congress, there&apos;s real-world politics.  I&apos;m not knocking them, but the real-world politics is everybody&apos;s got to bring home something, or the local press and commentators like you will blast, &apos;Our Congressman didn&apos;t bring home something.&apos;&quot; </p>
