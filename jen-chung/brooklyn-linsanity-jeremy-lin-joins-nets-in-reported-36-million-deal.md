<p>Jeremy Lin, whose breakout 2011-2012 season actually made people care about the Knicks, is coming back to New York. The 27-year-old announced he&apos;s leaving the Charlotte Hornets for a Russian oligarch&apos;s team:</p>

<p>New Nets coach Kenny Atkinson was instrumental as an assistant coach with the Knicks in improving Lin&apos;s game. In April, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015512/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/sports/basketball/jeremy-lin-charlotte-hornets.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=1">Lin discussed Atkinson&apos;s ascent with the NY Times</a>: &quot;I&#x2019;ve kind of been saying it was just a matter of time for him because I know how good he is, I know how much he was there for me in New York. When you&#x2019;re around him, you kind of understand there&#x2019;s something different about him: his energy, his passion, the juice he approaches his work with.&quot;</p>

<p>Sports reporters say that Lin and the Nets have agreed on a three-year deal worth $36 million. </p>

<p>Lin started his career with the Golden State Warriors, but joined the Knicks for one season that resulted in a dazzling month. Last month, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015512/http://nypost.com/2016/06/17/how-despicable-knicks-pretend-linsanity-never-happened/">NY Post&apos;s Knicks sports reporter Phil Mushnick complained</a> that Knicks owner James Dolan was being his usual petty self by not putting &quot;Linsanity&quot; in an MSG Network program about memorable Madison Square Garden moments:</p><blockquote>However, the singularly most unexpected, extraordinarily exciting and successful 21st-century Knicks happenstance was omitted: Those three weeks when an undrafted scrub who was about to be cut, Jeremy Lin, took an injury- and star-depleted team and turned the Knicks and New York City and its environs into Holy Mackerel Land, those three weeks when &#x201C;Linsanity&#x201D; erupted with an all-in, run-and-pass offense that led to countless uncontested layups and an 8-15 team winning seven straight and eight-of-nine &#x2014; including wins against the far more talented Lakers, Jazz and Mavericks.<p></p>

<p>From Feb. 4 through Feb. 29 (2012 was a leap year), New York City went Linsane. And while it&#x2019;s impossible to forget what by far was the most exciting, successful thing about this century&#x2019;s Knicks, it didn&#x2019;t make MSG Network&#x2019;s cut.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The Knicks decided not to keep Lin, allowing the Houston Rockets to take the point guard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015512/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/houston_wants_linsanity_rockets_use.php">in a $31 million poison pill deal</a>. Since then, Lin&apos;s bounced around with the Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets, averaging 11 points per game.</p>

<p>Lin comes with pluses and minuses. He&apos;s excellent in the pick and roll, which should benefit Brook Lopez, and can be a streaky scorer. But he&apos;s prone to turnovers when he starts playing too fast and out of control, and is a liability in on-ball defense. Ideally, he&apos;s the leader of the second unit, and gets the occasional start when your starting point guard is hurt or needs a rest.</p>

<p>He could also increase the Nets&apos; appeal to the Asian community, especially with the new Nets practice facility in Sunset Park.</p>

<p>However, Jarrett Jack, the Nets point guard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015512/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16650769/brooklyn-nets-waive-point-guard-jarrett-jack">who was placed on waivers</a>, has a different opinion about Lin&apos;s signing:</p>

<p>Over at MSG, the Knicks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015512/http://nypost.com/2016/06/22/knicks-acquire-derrick-rose-from-bulls/">who now have Derrick Rose</a>, are reportedly circling Joakim Noah <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015512/http://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/30/joakim-noah-new-york-knicks-nba-free-agency-rumors-derrick-rose">in a four-year, $72 million deal</a>. </p>
