His pay package needs to approved by the MTA board and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070015/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/nyregion/16mta.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;At the urging of City Hall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg&#x2019;s representatives at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are set to abstain from supporting a generous compensation package for&quot; Walder.&quot;  Even though Bloomberg likes Walder, apparently the mayor &quot;<strong>considered the package to be outsize for a state employee, particularly given the current financial climate</strong>, two people familiar with his view said. They said the mayor also believed that if Gov. David A. Paterson was not re-elected, the severance award would limit the ability of a new governor to install a director.&quot;  Paterson&apos;s office has positioned the generous pay as &quot;in line with that of his predecessor and those who lead large transit systems across the country and around the world.&quot;  Walder, who worked with the MTA in the 1980s, recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070015/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/14/paterson_set_to_nominate_jay_walder.php">ran London&apos;s transit system</a> before leaving for Kinsey.  </p>
