The video&apos;s uploader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427151111/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/street_justice_good_samaritans_drag_yiWqFSGJgtJd16WHVM1DdI">told the Post</a>, &quot;This is the first time I saw a stranger actually carry an alleged perpetrator off of a train and responsibly wait until the police arrived...
