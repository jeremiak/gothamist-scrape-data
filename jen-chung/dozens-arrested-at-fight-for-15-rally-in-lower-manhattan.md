<p>Hundreds of fast food workers, airport workers and living wage activists, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070218/https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/803574533923938304">elected officials</a>, gathered this morning in lower Manhattan to protest unfair labor practices and demand better wages and job conditions in a &quot;Fight for 15&quot; rally. Following a dawn rally in Zuccotti Park, protesters marched up Broadway to a McDonald&apos;s location:</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson says that about two dozen people were arrested, mostly for disorderly conduct (for blocking the traffic). Those arrested include City Council Members Brad Lander and Antonio Reynoso:</p>

<p>Protesters are planning to stage a march at Newark Airport at noon. Today is a National Day of Action for Fight for $15, with walkouts and rallies planned across the country. The &quot;Fight for 15&quot; movement started in 2012, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070218/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/fast_food_workers_walk_out_want_mor.php">fast food workers walked off the job in NYC</a>; last year, the NY State Fast Food Wage Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070218/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/fast_food_workers_raise.php">voted in favor of raising the wage</a> to $15/hour, and, a few months later, Governor Cuomo said the statewide minimum wage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070218/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/11/cuomo_announces_state-wide_15_minim.php">would slowly be raised to $15/hour</a>. </p>

<p>A press release said, &quot;In addition to the strikes demanding $15 and union rights, the workers will wage their most disruptive protests yet to show they will not back down in the face of newly-elected politicians and newly-empowered corporate special interests who threaten an extremist agenda to move the country to the right. The protests, at 20 major airports, which serve 2 million passengers a day, and outside McDonald&#x2019;s restaurants from Durham to Denver, will underscore that any efforts to block wage increases, gut workers&#x2019; rights or healthcare, deport immigrants, or support racism or racist policies, will be met with unrelenting opposition by workers in the Fight for $15. &quot;</p>
