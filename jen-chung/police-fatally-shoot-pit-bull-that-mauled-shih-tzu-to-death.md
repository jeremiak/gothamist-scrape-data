<p>A pit bull that was mauling a smaller dog in Inwood was shot and killed by a police officer yesterday. The other dog, a Shih Tzu, also died as a result of the mauling. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174315/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/05/5/inwood-dog-fight-turns-fatal.html">Its owner told NY1</a>,&quot;I don&apos;t think those dogs should be allowed, they can harm people. So I don&apos;t even think they should be allowed. I love every type of dog, but you need to know how to handle your pets.&quot;</p>

<p>The Shih Tzu, Jada, was being walked near Nagle and Hillside Avenues in the Inwood section of Manhattan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174315/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/blasts-pit-bull-murder-mode-kills-smaller-dog-article-1.2625618">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The raging hound bound out of a basement and went after the smaller dog like it was a piece of meat, a witness said.&quot; The witness added, &quot;The cops just ran up, shot the dog. That&#x2019;s justifiable though. That dog was in murder rage. It was going to attack. That thing, once it was in murder mode, it was in murder mode.&quot;</p>

<p>Jada&apos;s walker, Rafale Alvarez, tried to save the dog, but the pit bull attacked him too, &quot;I still have blood, look. I got blood here, I got blood on my feet. I have blood all over. I kicked him, I hit him, with everything I hit him.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174315/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Pit-Bull-Shot-Killed-NYPD-Cops-Manhattan-378197331.html">investigating the shooting</a>. The pit bull was not on a leash, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174315/http://nypost.com/2016/05/05/cops-fatally-shoot-pit-bull-that-mauled-shih-tzu-to-death/">Post reports</a> that its &quot;owner wasn&#x2019;t charged because he was trying to put a leash on the dog at the time.&quot;</p>
