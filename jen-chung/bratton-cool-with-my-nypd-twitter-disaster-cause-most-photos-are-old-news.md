<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427172717/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/22/mynypd_hashtag_lol.php">NYPD&apos;s social media team got a bad taste of trending</a> with its call for the public&apos;s photos with a member of the NYPD to be tagged #myNYPD. Most of the photos tagged were some of the police department&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427172717/https://twitter.com/occbaystreet/status/458795403396141057/photo/1">lowest moments</a>&#x2014;brutality during Occupy Wall Street or other protests or when a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427172717/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/14/graphic_video_dog_shot_in_east_vill.php">cop shot a homeless man&apos;s dog</a>. Today, Police Commissioner Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427172717/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/blamed-mynypd-debacle-sources-article-1.1766121">said he wasn&apos;t too upset</a>, telling reporters, &quot;Most of the pictures I looked at, they&#x2019;re old news. They&#x2019;ve been out there for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>Bratton, who has his own Twitter account, @CommissBratton, added, &quot;Often times police activities are lawful, but look awful.&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427172717/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/blamed-mynypd-debacle-sources-article-1.1766121"> He found the bright side</a>, insisting, &quot;I kind of welcome the attention. We really broke the numbers yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>No one is being fired, and the NYPD had responded last night with a comment from Deputy Chief Kim Y. Royster: &quot;The NYPD is creating new ways to communicate effectively with the community.  Twitter provides an open forum for an uncensored exchange and this is an open dialogue good for our city.&quot; However, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427172717/http://nypost.com/2014/04/22/nypds-twitter-outreach-completely-backfired/">law enforcement source snarked to the Post</a>, &quot;Good intentions by the NYPD, but... who uses Twitter? The younger generation who have had bad interactions with the Police Department.&quot;</p>
