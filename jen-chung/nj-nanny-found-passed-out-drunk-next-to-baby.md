<p>Toms River police say that the mother hired Susan Porfido, 50, through care.com, and left her son in her care around 10 a.m. this week. According to the Asbury Park-Press, &quot;The mother returned at 1:45 p.m. to find Porfido passed out drunk on the floor. Her son was crying and had a very soiled diaper. Porfido woke up and fled out the front door, stumbling and mumbling unintelligibly, according to police.&quot;</p>

<p>Then she drove off, only to crash into a fire hydrant. Police say they found three empty bottles of alcohol in the car. Porfido&apos;s blood alcohol was reportedly three times over the legal limit. </p>

<p>Porfido is currently in custody, facing charges including child endangerment and DWI. She has not made the $50,000 bail. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015111/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/boozy-babysitter-passed-floor-crash-cops-article-1.1889722">Care.com told the Daily News</a>, &quot;We are disheartened by this news. As this is an active investigation we are working with local authorities and cannot comment further.&quot;</p>
