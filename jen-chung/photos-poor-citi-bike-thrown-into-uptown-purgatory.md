<p>There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622165631/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/citi_bike_like_all_whatever.php">abandoned Citi Bikes who have found companionship</a> on the Upper West Side, miles from the nearest docking station. There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622165631/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/24/photo_ues_resident_discovers_hidden.php">secret nests of them</a> discovered Upper East Side basements. Now, a lone Citi Bike has been thrown into a rather inaccessible part of Riverside Park.</p>

<p>Two readers sent us photographs of this sad fellow yesterday. Reader Nancy tells us she spotted it by the &quot;rail tracks in Riverside Park this morning near the Sanitation Station at about 135th... was still there on my way home.&quot;</p>

<p>Either someone tossed it from Riverside Drive or had the Hulk-like strength to heave it over the fence. <em>But what did the Citi Bike ever do to that someone?</em></p>

<p>Users of the service who don&apos;t return bikes are charged $1,200, but Citi Bike is probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622165631/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/02/citi_bike_to_be_bailed_out_by_real.php">worried about other things right now</a>.</p>
