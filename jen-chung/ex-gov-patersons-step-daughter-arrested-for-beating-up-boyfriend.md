The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021103205/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/paterson_kid_clocked_beau_cops_M4Tcx66wJJApc2YY9ZLZGO">Post reports</a> that Ashley Dennis, 23, &quot;smash[ed] a bottle and a frying pan over her boyfriend&#x2019;s head during an early morning brawl in Greenwich Village, authorities said... When cops arrived they found McGuinness, who was charged with choking Dennis, lying on the floor, semi-conscious and bleeding, officials said. &quot;</p>

<p>Apparently neighbors heard the commotion in the MacDougal Street apartment.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021103205/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/10/02/2011-10-02_daves_stepkid_in_bloody_battle.html?r=news">Neighbors spoke to the Daily News</a>:  &quot;Super Pearl DiGeronimo, 60, said she thought somebody had been stabbed at the five-story walkup near Washington Square Park. &apos;There was blood on the floor, on the door handle, all over the hallway,&apos; she said. &apos;I thought it was a murder.&apos;&quot; She added, &quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman&apos;s scorn. The man must have done something to provoke that reaction.&quot;</p>

<p>Another neighbor said, &quot;I heard a guy saying, &apos;Help me, help me,.&apos; hen he started saying, &apos;Fire, fire,&apos; to get someone&apos;s attention. I knew it was serious.&quot; The News also reports, &quot;McGuinness told police Dennis broke a bottle over his head, knocking him to the floor, and then repeatedly slammed his leg in the door until he lost consciousness, according to the criminal complaint.&quot;  Dennis, who was hit with felony assault, was arraigned and released without bail.  McGuinness faces a charge of misdemeanor choking.  </p>

<p>Last year, Paterson&apos;s son was taken into custody for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021103205/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/breaking_governor_patersons_son_arr.php">holding a debit card that didn&apos;t belong to him</a>.  And back when she was in high school, Dennis apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021103205/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/17/its_10_oclock_d.php">went on a public school class trip to Cuba</a>&#x2014;that the Department of Education didn&apos;t know about.</p>
