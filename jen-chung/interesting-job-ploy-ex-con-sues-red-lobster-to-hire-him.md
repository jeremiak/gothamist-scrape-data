<p>A man who has been in state prison twice for at least three counts of robbery really wants to work at Red Lobster.  So much so that he&apos;s suing the seafood chain to hire him, alleging that the manager at the Times Square branch rejected his application because of his criminal history which is discrimination. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704092116/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/ex_con_claw_suit_XoDfklYG0NWL4Q2KHLR4WI">the Post&apos;s experts</a> &quot;say he has a case.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert Smith applied for a &quot;kitchen help&quot; position in February by completing an application online and &quot;honestly answered the form&apos;s question about prior convictions.&quot;  He never heard from them, so when he called (and got through on his fifth try), manager Nicole McVaughn allegedly told him, &quot;I&apos;m sorry to have to give you this info, but in my position as manager I don&apos;t hire convicted felons.&quot; At which point, the Post explains, &quot;The robster saw red.&quot;</p>

<p>Smith, who worked at an Applebee&apos;s for six years after leaving prison in 2000, is seeking &quot;unspecified damages retroactive to the time Red Lobster gave him the bum&apos;s rush&quot; and his lawyer says, &quot;If former convicts are prevented from getting jobs and integrating productively into society, then what choices are we leaving them?&quot; Apparently NY State law says that employers need to prove that hiring an ex-con poses &quot;an unreasonable risk to property or to public or to individiual safety&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704092116/http://www.lac.org/toolkits/standards/Fourteen_State_Laws.pdf">PDF</a>). Employers are also liable if the ex-con hire breaks the law.</p>

<p>Red Lobster told the Post, &quot;First, our hiring standards will always follow the law. Second, we have no record of ever receiving this gentleman&apos;s application. We&apos;ve invited this gentleman to interview and submit an application and that offer is still available.&quot;</p>
