<p>The former NYPD detective who was found guilty of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/subway_jerk_off_gun_flash.php">manipulating his penis outside of his pants</a>&quot; at a Manhattan subway station while making hissing noises at a woman has been sentenced to a year in prison. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211/http://nypost.com/2017/02/07/ex-cop-who-pulled-out-penis-on-subway-gets-1-year-jail-sentence/">The NY Post reports</a> that Judge Ann Scherzer told Steven Esposito that subway riders should &quot;be free of public masturbators and to be free of former police officers just taking out a gun and pointing it at innocent people because they&#x2019;re upset they got caught.&quot;  </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2015_10_subcm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_subcm.jpg" width="300" height="296" class="image-right"> </span>In 2015, the NYPD released surveillance footage of a man who allegedly masturbated at the Fifth Avenue N/R station and threatened the victim, as well as a good Samaritan assisting her. The police report noted that the victim &quot;heard a hissing noise beside her. When she looked to see what the noise was, she observed the suspect manipulating his penis outside of his pants.&quot;</p>

<p>After she explained what had happened, the good Samaritan took out his cellphone and followed Esposito and filmed him. When Esposito reached the exit, he allegedly &quot;pulled out a black handgun, pointed [it at the good Samaritan]&quot; and told him to mind his own business.</p>

<p>Right after the NYPD released the footage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/ex-cop_arrested_for_flashing_his_pe.php">Esposito was arrested</a>.</p>

<p>During his trial, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/woman-testifies-ex-cop-was-playing-with-his-penis-on-subway/">the victim testified</a>, &quot;He was playing with his penis, and I was scared... He was looking at my face, and smiling, and making sexual noises, like he was going to force me to give him a blow job or something,&quot; and said of being threatened with the gun, &quot;We thought he was going to kill us, or try to intimidate us or something.&quot;</p>

<p>But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/13/jerk_off_cop_pee_plea.php">Esposito&apos;s defense was that he was merely urinating</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211/http://nypost.com/2017/02/07/ex-cop-who-pulled-out-penis-on-subway-gets-1-year-jail-sentence/">his attorney at the time claimed</a> the his noises were &quot;consistent with urination... He either pees in his pants or pees in the subway station. And then this woman comes upon him and starts screaming hysterically.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>At sentencing, the defense tried a different approach. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170210044211/http://nypost.com/2017/02/07/ex-cop-who-pulled-out-penis-on-subway-gets-1-year-jail-sentence/">From the Post:</a></p><blockquote>Defense lawyers urged the judge to give Esposito no jail time, arguing that he lost his wife in 2009 and that the crime was &#x201C;an illicit expression of pent-up sexual desire.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Put yourself in this man&#x2019;s shoes,&#x201D; attorney Marc Fernich said in Manhattan Criminal Court.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I cannot,&#x201D; Scherzer interrupted.</p>

<p>The lawyer persisted, adding that Esposito simply became &#x201C;flustered and spontaneously panicked in the heat of the moment&#x201D; when he pulled out his firearm on the victim and a good Samaritan who came to her aid at the 59th Street Station.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m very sorry for him&#x201D; said Scherzer, dryly. &#x201C;But I would have hoped that he would have found a way to tend to his sexual needs other than masturbating on a subway platform, staring at a young woman while making hissing sounds.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>When Fernich tried to get the conviction tossed because one of the lawyers apparently didn&apos;t realize that there would be a possibility of prison time, Scherzer said, &quot;This is a detective who has served with the NYPD for 20 years &#x2014; he obviously knows how this works.&quot;<p></p>
