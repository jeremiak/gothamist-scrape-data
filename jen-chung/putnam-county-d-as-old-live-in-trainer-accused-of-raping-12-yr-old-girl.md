	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2012_03_hossnu.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325000818im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_03_hossnu.jpg" width="300" height="274"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Alexandru Hossu</i></div> Putnam County police arrested a personal trainer for allegedly raping a 12-year-old girl in 2010 on two occasions. But what makes the arrest especially interesting is that the trainer, Alexandru Hossu, used to be the live-in personal trainer to Putnam County DA Adam Levy. And Hossu is an illegal immigrant!<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325000818/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130322/NEWS04/303220034/Putnam-D-s-ex-trainer-accused-raping-girl-DA-statement-2?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage">The Journal News reports</a>, &quot;The criminal complaint alleges Hossu forcibly raped the child twice between 7 and 10 p.m. Oct. 24, 2010, when she was 12. &apos;(Hossu) did place his hand on the victim&#x2019;s neck and squeeze, then pulled her down onto the bed,&apos; the felony complaint from the Putnam Sheriff&#x2019;s Office said. &apos;The defendant did forcibly engage in sexual intercourse without the victim&#x2019;s implied consent.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>A school counselor recently alerted the authorities about the girl&apos;s claim. The girl, who is now 15, is not Levy&apos;s 15-year-old daughter. Levy&apos;s office also confirmed that Hossu lived in Levy&apos;s home until six months ago. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325000818/http://www.putnamcountyda.org/PutnamCountyDA/Biography.aspx">In his official bio</a>, Levy, the son of Judge Judy Sheindlin, has a &quot;&apos;without fear or favor&apos; approach to crime fighting focused on investigating and prosecuting crimes committed against women and children,&quot; but in this case, the Westchester County DA will be prosecuting the case in Putnam County.</p>

<p>Hossu, who is being held on $50,000 bash or $100,000, is an illegal immigrant because his work visa expired 12 years ago. </p>
