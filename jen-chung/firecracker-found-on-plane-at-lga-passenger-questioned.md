Port Authority officials contacted FBI agents, and the passenger from that seat location, identified as 67-year-old Thomas Ouelette, of Bonita Springs, Fla., was tracked down and taken into custody.&quot; While terrorism is not suspected (at this point!), &quot;Ouelette already had two outstanding warrants in Florida for &apos;unlawful flight.&apos;&quot;</p>
