<p>The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221912/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/19/omg_the_snow_is_coming_for_us.php"> winter storm</a> roared into the city a little later than expected but still left its mark: 11 inches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221912/http://wcbstv.com/local/tristate.winter.storm.2.1381614.html">fell in Central Park,</a> while 13 inches were measured in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221912/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/bloomberg.snowfall.storm.2.1381784.html">Mayor Bloomberg said</a> that roads will be cleared today, thanks to the 2,400 Department of Sanitation employees manning over 2,000 pieces of equipment, &quot;Even though the first day of winter isn&apos;t until tomorrow, something you would not know if you were outside, we were hit by a major snowstorm. In some places people will be digging out from a foot of snow all morning. I&apos;m happy to say men and women of the sanitation department have been out all morning plowing the streets.&quot;  He also expects schools to be open tomorrow&#x2014;sorry, kiddies!</p>
