</div></div>					<p><em>Saturday Night Live</em> returned from a two week break last night with its eyes back on the White House, this time turning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/02/bigly_little_lies.php">beleaguered Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> into Forrest Gump. Riffing off the 1994 film&apos;s bus stop scene, Kate McKinnon reprised her portrayal of the Alabama native and told another bus passenger, &quot;Hello, my name&apos;s Jeff &#x2014; Jeff Sessions. Would you like a chocolate? I&apos;m the Attorney General of the whole United States. I got to meet the president and everything.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZM3jvlvgVw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>&quot;Sessions&quot; also held up a photograph of Kellyanne Conway (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/28/the-kellyanne-on-the-couch-controversy-is-so-incredibly-dumb/?utm_term=.c60f2655e881">yes, that photo</a>) and proclaimed, &quot;Being in the government is so fun. You meet so many nice people. This is my best good friend Kellyanne. She ain&apos;t got no legs. We&apos;re about as close as peas and carrots. She&apos;s the best talker you&apos;ve ever heard. They say she could sell stink to a skunk.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;This is my best good friend Kellyanne.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNL?src=hash">#SNL</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/https://t.co/wPrT3ym4oU">pic.twitter.com/wPrT3ym4oU</a></p>&#x2014; Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/838247362216792064">March 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>There wasn&apos;t a President Trump-focused segment&#x2014;perhaps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/02/alec_baldwin_trump_clash.php">Alec Baldwin was busy</a>, or maybe the show wanted to continue to hammer at Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/trump_spicer_mccarthy_snl.php">alleged unhappiness about his male officials being played by women</a>&#x2014;so the Forrest Gump segment served as a lens into Sessions&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/02/trump_loves_jeff.php">dealings with the Russian ambassador</a>. &quot;Sessions&quot; explained:</p><blockquote>I had a bad week. It started out real good. The president made a great speech; folks were thrilled on account of it was real words in a row for a whole hour. We were all as happy as a monkey with a peanut machine, then I went to bed and got 800 messages and phone alerts saying I was a sneaky little liar. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do, so my lawyers said, &quot;Run, Jeffy! Run!&quot;</blockquote>Others waiting for the bus got the rundown of his woes, and there was even a cameo from shirtless Vladimir Putin. <p></p>

<p>At the end, there&apos;s a visit from SNL host Octavia Spencer, reprising her own Oscar-winning role, Minny from <em>The Help</em>, who offers Sessions her famous pie (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627152641/http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/thehelp">spoiler</a>).</p>
