<p>Two sets of parents welcomed impatient babies into the world alongside very busy NYC roadways yesterday. </p>

<p>The first baby was born in Brooklyn, early in the morning: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062323/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/woman-birth-cross-bronx-expressway-article-1.2649584">The Daily New reports</a> that Latoya Prince gave birth to a baby girl on Atlantic Avenue, near Fourth Avenue; Prince&apos;s husband flagged down Police Officer Lorraine Bowden, who is part of the K-9 Unit:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;He said his wife was in labor,&#x201D; Bowden said. &#x201C;I thought they needed an escort to the hospital, but he wanted me to come out and come to the passenger side door.&#x201D;

<p>Once Bowden went over and knelt down to lend assistance, she discovered that the baby, little 5-pound, 4-ounce Briella &#x2014; had already been born. </p>

<p>&#x201C;The umbilical cord was wrapped around her, so I untangled her, made sure that nothing was in her nose or mouth and held her until EMS would come,&#x201D; Bowden said. &#x201C;She wasn&#x2019;t crying or anything, so I rubbed her butt until she gave out a little cry.&quot;</p></blockquote>The baby is named Briella. <p></p>

<p>Then, around 11:40 a.m., a pregnant woman had labor pains on the Cross Bronx Expressway near Rosedale Avenue. The police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062323/http://abc7ny.com/news/woman-goes-into-labor-on-the-side-of-the-cross-bronx/1355392/">shut down the westbound lanes</a> and she delivered a baby boy, the first of twins.</p>

<p>Then, EMS took her to Jacobi Hospital, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062323/http://nypost.com/2016/05/25/new-mom-delivers-one-of-her-twins-on-side-of-highway/">where she had a baby girl</a>. The children are named Tavon and Talia. A Jacobi Hospital spokesperson said, &quot;We&#x2019;re pleased to report both the mother and her babies are doing well,&quot; while the mother told the News, &quot;I&#x2019;m fine. I&#x2019;m in a little pain, but everything is OK.&quot;</p>
