</div></div><p>This morning, a tree fell from Central Park onto Fifth Avenue at 93rd Street&#x2014;and it looks like, fortunately, that no one was injured.  Reader and Flickr contributor ennuipoet writes:</p><blockquote>A few minutes after 10:00 this morning, I watched a huge tree fall onto 5th Avenue and 93rd Street from about 200 feet away. The traffic light at 93rd went green shortly before and the vehicles at the light were clear from the area when the tree uprooted and fell. NYPD Officers were on the scene, having noted the danger and radioed for assistance. No one was injured, however one vehicle was underneath the tree and destroyed and least one other damaged. I can now speak with authority, when a tree falls on 5th Avenue, it makes a sound.&#xA0; </blockquote><br>
Reader Ethan suggests the tree was over 100 years old.  Earlier this year, a man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123027/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/25/reports_man_killed_by_falling_tree.php">killed by a falling tree</a> in Central Park and, last July, a man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123027/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/30/man_hit_by_central_park_tree_branch.php">seriously injured</a> by a falling tree branch.  Numerous trees in the park were also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123027/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/central_parks_post-storm_damage_hea.php">damaged after a sudden August storm</a>.  The Parks Department has said in the past that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123027/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/31/man_critically_injured_by_tree_bran.php">it checks on trees</a> but &quot;It&apos;s an impossible task to know the status of every single tree.&quot;<p></p>
