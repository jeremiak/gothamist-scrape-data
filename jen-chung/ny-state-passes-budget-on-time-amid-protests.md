</div></div><p>Yesterday, the NY State <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402133044/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/03/wake-up-call-we-have-a-budget-edition">passed a budget</a> before the deadline, the first on-time budget in five years.  So Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402133044/http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/after-budget-cuomo-praises-legislators-they-performed-admirably?utm_medium=partial-text&amp;utm_campaign=home">gave his fellow lawmakers a round of applause</a>&#x2014;for freakin&apos; doing their jobs!&#x2014;&quot;I applaud the State Senate, and the Assembly. They performed admirably and the government worked as it should.&quot; Of course, the austere $132 billion budget that includes lots of cuts to Medicaid and education also meant protesters were at the State Capitol building.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402133044/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/amazing_state_pols_ok_budget_on_9YH2yhLjFuFxF0ATtTcSII#ixzz1ICekwIyq">Post says</a> 300 protesters were on the scene, &quot;mustered by tenant advocates and union-backed groups.&quot;  Besides chanting, &quot;Protect the kids, not millionaires!&quot; the paper explains, &quot;The group was lured with promises of 70 pizzas and &apos;many S&apos;mores.&apos; They raged when state troopers attempted to block the mass food delivery and launched a chant of &apos;Pizza busting is disgusting!&apos; One person was arrested, for (maybe accidentally) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402133044/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/62656/is-a-cymbal-a-weapon/">hitting a staffer with a cymbal</a>. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402133044/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/amazing_state_pols_ok_budget_on_9YH2yhLjFuFxF0ATtTcSII?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">spite of some restorations</a>, NYC will end up losing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402133044/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/03/city-loses-nearly-half-a-billion-in-school-aid">under $500 million in school aid</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402133044/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/nyregion/31nybudget-albany.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;The budget restores about $230 million of the $1.5 billion reduction in education financing that Mr. Cuomo proposed. A majority of that restoration, $134 million, will go to counties north of New York City. Another $53 million will go to New York City, and $43 million will go to Long Island,&quot; which made NYC official Micah Lasher complain, &quot;We are dividing up crumbs, and to make matters worse, the crumbs have been divided unfairly.&quot;</p>
