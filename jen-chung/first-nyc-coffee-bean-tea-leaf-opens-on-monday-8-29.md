The location at 1412 Broadway (at 39th Street) in Times Square will makes its debut on Monday, August 29 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813122129/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/05/nycs_first_coffee_bean_tea_leaf_poi.php">as promised!</a>).  And doors will be open at 6:30 a.m.!  Its press release says, &quot;&apos;The Bean,&apos; as it is affectionately referred to by its loyal fan following, intends to add a handcrafted and customized touch to the Manhattan coffee landscape and fill a noticeable void between the coffee conglomerates and the independent &#x2018;mom and pop&#x2019; shops.&quot;  </p>

<p>The chain was started in California and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813122129/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/beloved_la_chain_the_coffee_bean_te.php">beloved for its Ice Blendeds</a>. New Amsterdam Coffee &amp; Tea Co. CEO Jeffrey Srulowitz (who is developing the brand in Manhattan) said, &quot;New Yorkers are a discerning group, and we think they&#x2019;ll be able to taste the passion we have for our product in every beverage we serve,&quot; while Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf executive Bob Kaufman is pretty thrilled, &quot;Thank you to our very vocal and supportive New York fans for years of encouragement. The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&#xAE; has finally arrived in the Big Apple!  We are thrilled to team up with New Amsterdam Coffee &amp; Tea Co., LLC, on our expansion in Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p>The store will offer &quot;a wide variety of the finest grades of Arabica coffee from specially selected estates around the world that are custom roasted, in small batches, at The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&#xAE; facility in Camarillo, California,&quot; and &quot;hand-plucked whole leaf teas sourced from the most exclusive growing regions, as well as fresh baked goods and a full line of complementary coffee and tea merchandise.&quot;  And, yes, the NYC Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813122129/http://www.facebook.com/CoffeeBeanNY">is on Facebook</a>.</p>
