<p>A defense lawyer for the man seen on video kicking a young cat high up into the air is attempting to get the case dismissed. Risa Procton says that it&apos;s unclear that the cat, later named King, actually suffered injuries.</p>

<p>After video of Robinson&apos;s cruel act was posted on Facebook in May, animal lovers rushed into action, helping identify a phone number seen on scaffolding&#x2014;leading the police to find the suspect in Brooklyn&#x2014;and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011952/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/07/kicked_cat_found.php">finding the cat</a>. The cat, named King, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011952/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/photos_king_the_cat_kicked_by_brook.php">recovered from his injuries</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011952/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/09/purrfect_king_the_abused_cat_has_be.php#photo-1">was later adopted</a>. Robinson, 21, now faces up to a year in jail if found guilty; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011952/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-man-kicked-cat-apologizes-court-appearance-article-1.1948344?cid=bitly">he said last week</a>, &quot;It was just a spur of the moment, it just happened. I shouldn&#x2019;t have done it.&quot; He did seem to enjoy it a lot, though:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011952/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/accused-brooklyn-cat-kicker-lawyer-injuries-unproven-article-1.2006036">According to the Daily News</a>, lawyer Risa Procton wrote in a motion, &quot;The accusatory instrument fails to allege any injury or pain experienced by the cat.&quot; </p><blockquote>She pointed to the criminal complaint, which quoted a veterinarian who watched the disturbing Facebook clip from last May and opined that it showed actions that &#x201C;would cause serious physical injury to the above described cat&#x201D; &#x2014; instead of stating that an injury had actually taken place...<p></p>

<p>Robinson, who has said in an interview that he was sorry while downplaying his deed, faces up to a year in jail for a charge of overdriving, torturing and injuring animals &#x2014; a misdemeanor that doesn&#x2019;t require proof of significant wounds.</p></blockquote>A Brooklyn DA&apos;s office spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011952/http://nypost.com/2014/11/11/cat-kickers-attorney-gets-case-dismissed/">told the Post,</a> &quot;Defense attorney filed a &#x2026; facial insufficiency motion.&quot; Some other defense groups question whether Robinson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011952/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/30/brooklyn_cat_kicker_jail.php">deserves a harsh punishment.</a><p></p>

<p>A judge will rule on the motion in January.</p>
