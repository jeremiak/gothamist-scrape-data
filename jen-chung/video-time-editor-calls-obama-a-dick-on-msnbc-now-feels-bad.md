<p>Halperin and the other Morning Joe folks were discussing Obama&apos;s remarks on the economy yesterday. The Washington Post noted that president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701225955/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-likely-to-focus-on-economy-at-press-conference/2011/06/29/AGfTAhqH_story.html?hpid=z2">used a &quot;combative tone&quot; when referring to Republicans</a>, &quot;They&#x2019;re in one week, they&#x2019;re out one week. And then they&#x2019;re saying, &#x2018;Obama has got to step in.&#x2019;.. You need to be here. I&#x2019;ve been here. I&#x2019;ve been doing Afghanistan and bin Laden and the Greek crisis. You stay here. Let&#x2019;s get it done.&quot; So the talking heads of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701225955/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/06/30/2011-06-30_mark_halperin_time_editoratlarge_calls_president_obama_a_dick_live_on_msnbcs_mor.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">asked Halperin what he thought</a>:</p><blockquote>Halperin: &quot;Do we have the seven-second delay today? I want to characterize how I thought the President behaved?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Brzezinski: &quot;We have it. [To producer] We can use it, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Scarborough: &quot;Yeah, sure, come one, take a chance. Have faith.&quot;</p>

<p>Brzezinski: &quot;Let&apos;s see what happens.&quot;</p>

<p>Scarborough: &quot;I&apos;m behind you. You fall down. I&apos;m gonna catch you.&quot;</p>

<p>Brzezinski:&quot; And the precedent has been set on the show, so you&apos;re good&quot;, [referring to his 2008 F-bomb on the air, which resulted in MSNBC instituting the seven second delay].</p>

<p>Halperin: &quot;I thought he was kind of a d--- yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>Scarborough: &quot;Oh my God. Delay that! Delay that! What are you doing? I can&apos;t believe you. I was joking! Don&apos;t do that! Did we delay that?&quot;</p></blockquote>As you can see from this clip, Scarborough was really shocked!<p></p>

<p>Later, Halperin apologized on air.  </p>

<p>Gawker, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701225955/http://gawker.com/5210981/movie-deal-for-staggeringly-wrong-political-journalist">made fun of Halperin</a> before, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701225955/http://gawker.com/5817018/mark-halperin-calls-obama-a-dick">opines</a>, &quot;Now: we&apos;re of the opinion that if you&apos;re the type of person who likes to call people &quot;dicks&quot; in public (as we are), you should be sure not to hold a job in which it would be problematic for you to call someone a &apos;dick.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Now MSNBC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701225955/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/30/mark-halperin-obama/">has suspended Halperin</a>! This is the cable news station&apos;s statement,  &quot;Mark Halperin&#x2019;s comments this morning were completely inappropriate and unacceptable. We apologize to the President, The White House and all of our viewers. We strive for a high level of discourse and comments like these have no place on our air. Therefore, Mark will be suspended indefinitely from his role as an analyst.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Halperin then said, &quot;I completely agree with everything in MSNBC&#x2019;s statement about my remark. I believe that the step they are taking in response is totally appropriate. Again, I want to offer a heartfelt and profound apology to the President, to my MSNBC colleagues, and to the viewers. My remark was unacceptable, and I deeply regret it.&quot; </p>
