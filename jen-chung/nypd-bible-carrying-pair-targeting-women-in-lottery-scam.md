<p>Cops are looking for a man and a woman who are preying on unsuspecting ladies&apos; hopes for some easy money. The pair claim that they have a winning lottery ticket but can&apos;t cash it in&#x2014;so they ask victims to &quot;cash&quot; it in for them.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, there have been nine incidents in Manhattan and Brooklyn since March of this year. The police outlined the M.O.:</p><blockquote>During the commission of these incidents the suspects run a &quot;lottery scam&quot; on their victims. The scams consist of one of the suspects approaching the victim and claiming to be an undocumented person with a winning lottery ticket. The suspect asks the victim if they could help them cash the winning ticket in, while this is going on a second suspect approaches and offers some assistance. The second suspect is well dressed and sometimes carries a Bible. The second suspect claims to know a lawyer who could help but he would require money.  The suspects convince the victim to give them some money in order to pay the lawyer and then split the winnings from the lottery ticket.</blockquote>This is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121090245/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/20/pigeon_drop_con.php">variation on the timeless &quot;pigeon drop&quot;</a> scam, wherein the perpetrators make someone believe there&apos;s value in something&#x2014;and then get the victim to fork over cash.<p></p>
