<p>It&apos;s bad enough seeing another bus passenger masturbate during your commute&#x2014;but seeing your <em>bus driver</em> in the act? And while driving the bus through traffic <strong><em>and into the Lincoln Tunnel</em></strong>? That&apos;s what one NJ Transit passenger saw and she was so upset that she filmed driver George Simpson to bring the matter to the agency&apos;s attention.</p>

<p>Attorney Patrick Metz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013955/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9169649">shared the video with WABC 7</a>, explaining, &quot;She noticed he was performing a sex act on himself... The outrage, the danger he was putting the other passengers in and the other commuters, it is unspeakable.&quot;</p>

<p>He said, &quot;She was sitting directly opposite the bus driver in the first row of seats,&quot; and noted how she filmed &quot;other cars around. As you can see the walls of the tunnel are on the left side. And he&apos;s continuing all the way through the tunnel totally exposed.&quot;</p>

<p>At one point, the driver reaches for something that seems like a handkerchief or cloth to wipe his head and then his lower area; Metz said, &quot;Now you can see what appears to be him, uh, address the situation.&quot;</p>

<p>Metz said, &quot;We don&apos;t know what happened before and we want to make sure it never happens again.&quot; </p>

<p>Simpson was suspended and charged with causing or risking widespread injury or damage,  lewdness and reckless driving. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013955/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/nj_man_accused_of_lewd_act_while_driving_bus_in_lincoln_tunnel.html#incart_m-rpt-1">The Star-Ledger reports</a>, &quot;According to the arrest warrant, Simpson on June 24 created a &apos;risk of (serious) bodily injury to the passengers onboard New Jersey Transit Bus 8097, specifically by removing his hands from the wheel and masturbating while continuing to drive in traffic.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>NJ Transit issued a statement, &quot;The bus operator in question was immediately removed from service without pay, as a result of this disturbing and grossly irresponsible conduct. The incident was also promptly brought to the attention of NJ Transit Police, who immediately launched a criminal investigation. As a result, the operator has been charged with three separate criminal offenses &#x2014; including one for risking widespread injury,&quot; adding, &quot;We offer our sincere apologies to anyone who may have witnessed this disturbing episode.&quot;</p>
