title: It's Chametz Burning Time!

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:190px; "> <img alt="2010_03_chametz.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225857im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_chametz.jpg" width="190" height="248"> <br> <i>Photo: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225857/http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamlawrence/443776541/in/photostream/">Adam Lawrence on Flickr</a></i></div> The Fire Department is reportedly responding to numerous calls about rubbish fires in Williamsburg and Borough Park, because it&apos;s time for the pre-Passover tradition of burning all leavened bread products.  A few years ago, the FDNY reminded those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225857/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/events/2009/040309b.shtml">burning chametz to be careful</a>, because &quot;In 2004, five people were seriously burned when a man poured paint thinner on a ceremonial fire in Borough Park, Brooklyn.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>The right way to burn chametz? According to the FDNY, it&apos;s &quot;using a metal can, a screen to prevent stray embers and newspaper instead of dangerous accelerants like lighter fluid.&quot;  </p>

<p>There are other dangers associated with ridding the home of chametz:  A doctor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225857/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/18/passover_causin.php">told the Post a few years ago</a>, &quot;We see a little bit of everything. Dizziness from fumes, slips from highly buffed floors or wet bathroom tiles,&quot; (another said that Passover injuries include &quot;knife wounds from cutting food, burns from stovetops, and even fingers chopped up in blenders&quot;). One<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225857/http://www.hchinc.net/new-york-carpet-cleaning.html"> local cleaning service</a> not only touts pre-Passover chametz-cleansing skills but also their convenience after Passover&#x2014;&quot;Once Pesach has drawn to a close, you may notice that the influx of extra traffic from family and friends has left an undesirable mark on your flooring.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Chabad.org has been offering a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225857/http://www.vosizneias.com/52118/2010/03/26/new-york-mechiras-chometz-through-cyberspace-a-halachic-analysis">service to let people sell their chametz online</a>, but it&apos;s unclear whether it&apos;s a Kosher arrangement.</p>
