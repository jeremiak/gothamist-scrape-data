Police have closed several streets surrounding the site of the shooting and at least two bus routes, M20 and M34A, are being detoured as police investigate the triple shooting.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151150/http://nypost.com/2015/11/09/shooter-opens-fire-near-penn-station/">The Post says</a> three suspects were spotted running from the scene. </p>

<p>&quot;They were cool cats,&quot; one member of the clinic tells the News. &quot;They would just come down, get their methadone, a coffee and chill. I don&apos;t know what happened. It&apos;s crazy. It&apos;s a whole new world down here at night.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said at a press conferenced this morning that it &quot;doesn&apos;t look like [the shooting] has anything to do with the methadone clinic.&quot;</p>
