<p>As if hearing about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123458/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/07/kitten_rescued_after_getting_tossed.php">kitten thrown from a car on the Verrazano Bridge</a> wasn&apos;t enough, now there&apos;s this terrible story about animal cruelty:  Some jerk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123458/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=8239762">hammered a rusty nail into a box turtle</a>, through its shell and into its body.  </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_07_turtle3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123458im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_turtle3.jpg" width="300" height="193" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123458/http://www.wildliferescuecenter.org/index.html"> Wildlife Rescue Center</a> of Hampton Bays turtle expert Karen Testa told WABC 7, &quot;[The nail] was sticking out... the bottom of the turtle. And this is how he walked around until this neighbor found him. It was going to be a slow death for the turtle.&quot; </p>

<p>Luckily, X-rays showed that the nail missed the turtle&apos;s spine and major organs.  The doctors put dental adhesive where the hole once was; Testa says, &quot;It&apos;s horrible, horrible that someone can do this to a living creature that cannot run away and defend itself at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Sag Harbor residents Patty Burns and her daughter Arlena, who found the wounded animal, say that the turtle has lived in their backyard for 15 years.  Arlena said, &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe someone would do that to an animal. You see this little creature a couple times a year so it&apos;s like family, and oh my gosh. How could somebody actually do this?&quot; </p>

<p>WABC 7 says that the SPCA is looking into the case and is offering a $1,000 reward.</p>
