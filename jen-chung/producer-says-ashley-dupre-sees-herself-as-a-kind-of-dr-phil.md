David Krieff, the reality show producer &quot;who brought together Amy Fisher and the Buttafuocos for a TV special and did a similar pairing of rival ice queens Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811131424/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07272008/news/regionalnews/kristen_mulls_2m_tube_job_121828.htm">tells the NY Post</a> he&apos;s offered Dupre $2 million for an entertainment deal. Krieff would like an interview with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811131424/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/12/spitzers_kriste.php">infamous escort</a>, but he suggests that there could be a reality show which would include her &quot;life as the stepdaughter of a wealthy oral surgeon.&quot;  Dupre is also apparently interested in journalism, lounge singing and helping people; Krieff says, &quot;She&apos;s very analytical...She sees herself as a kind of Dr. Phil.&quot;</p>
