                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_05_egban.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109072541im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_05_egban.jpg" width="365" height="271"> <br> <i> Mahmoud Abdel-Salam Omar being escorted by the police (WCBS 2)</i></div> Last night, police questioned the former chairman of one of Egypt&apos;s biggest banks for hours because a maid at the Pierre Hotel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109072541/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/31/high-profile-egyptian-banker-awaits-arraignment-in-alleged-sex-assault-on-housekeeper/">accused him of sexually abusing her</a>.  According to WCBS 2, Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar is now &quot;awaiting arraignment Tuesday on charges of sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment, forcible touching and harassment.&quot;  The alleged attack comes two weeks after IMF head <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109072541/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiquestrausskahn">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a> was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a maid at the Sofitel in Times Square.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109072541/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/nd_banker_in_hotel_sex_bust_5t8SbxVPtY026XJSdsJPJM">Post reports</a> that Omar had asked for a box of tissues on Sunday around 6 p.m.: He &quot;quickly locked the door behind her, according to police. Then, the elderly banker&quot;&#x2014;who was either wearing a robe or pajamas at the time&#x2014;&quot;allegedly grabbed her breasts and began kissing her on the lips and neck.&quot;  The maid said, &quot;I&apos;m not up here for that.&quot; Then Omar allegedly asked her for her phone number, and the maid supplied a fake one.</p>

<p>The maid went to the hotel manager to report the incident, but the manager apparently told her she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109072541/http://abcnews.go.com/US/egyptian-banker-mahmoud-abdel-salam-omar-arrested-sex/story?id=13721680">needed to report it to a supervisor</a>...who wasn&apos;t working on Sunday. So the maid had to wait until Monday to report the incident to the police.  Police spokesman Paul Browne said, &quot;Experienced NYPD detectives found the complainant to be credible.&quot; The NYPD said more details would be released upon the arraignment.</p>

<p>A friend of Omar&apos;s, spotted checking in on him, told the Post, &quot;We are friends of his and just wanted to check up on him. We wanted to make sure he was alive. He&apos;s an old man but a good man, a family man. He&apos;s a grandfather. We just wanted to be sure he was alright.&quot;</p>
