The AP spoke to one of the organizers,  Shaik Ubaid of the Islamic Leadership Council of Metropolitan New York, who said, at first, some Muslim Americans weren&apos;t supporting the Park 51 project,  but &#x201C;Once it became a rallying cry for extremists, we had no choice but to stand with Feisal Rauf.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Imam Feisel Abdul Rauf, the imam for the mosque, has said that if the project moves from its current proposed location at 45-47 Park Place&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163425/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/16/other_things_two_blocks_from_ground.php?gallery0Pic=6#gallery">two blocks from Ground Zero</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163425/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/09/ground_zero_imam_moving_mosque_woul.php">then the radicals will win</a>.  Of course, the project has become a pawn in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163425/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/11/florida_pastor_stops_playing_footsi.php">some radicals&apos; media moves</a>.  Interestingly, Ubaid also added that Rauf &quot;was not that involved with the local Muslim community&quot; and didn&apos;t get enough local support for the project, &quot;Had we consulted us, we probably would have told him, gently, no.&quot;</p>

<p>The proposed building would have two floors for a mosque; Community Board 1 chairwoman Julie Menin, who supported the project, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163425/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/30/2010-08-30_better_mosque_compromise_chair_of_community_board_wants_interfaith_center_inside.html">now wants there to be a floor for nondenominational interfaith space</a>, said, &quot;[Park 51 developers] had always talked about giving the center an interfaith concept like having classes in Buddhism... It&#x2019;s one thing to have panel discussions, but if you really want to bring these factions together &#x2026; have a nondenominational interfaith space, like the chapel at the Pentagon, where local rabbis and priests could hold services on different days of the week.&quot;  </p>
