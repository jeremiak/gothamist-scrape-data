<p>Police have released surveillance video of a man suspected of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822140123/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/13/police_looking_for_man_who_sexually.php">sexually assaulting a woman</a> in the lobby of her Brooklyn apartment building on Saturday night.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at about 11:45 p.m. on March 12th. The 29-year-old victim was inside the lobby of her 50th Street building when the suspect &quot;displayed a knife and placed it to her neck. The individual touched the victim&apos;s buttocks and removed the victim&apos;s pants and undergarments and touched the victim in her midsection.  The individual proceeded to sexually assault the victim and fled to parts unknown.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to a nearby hospital and released in stable condition. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822140123/http://abc7ny.com/news/police-man-attempts-to-rape-woman-in-lobby-of-her-brooklyn-apartment-/1244334/">Her family told WABC 7</a> that she had just returned from a date: &quot;Her family is understandably &apos;very upset&apos;, &apos;scared&apos;, and is in a state of shock. The family moved here 15 years ago from China, and made a life for themselves in Brooklyn only to have the daughter&apos;s sense of safety crushed.&quot;</p>

<p>The police describe the suspect, who is wanted for attempted rape, as being about 5&apos;9&quot; to 5&apos;10&quot; with a slim build. He was last seen wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans.  </p>
