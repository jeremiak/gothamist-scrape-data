<p>Fantasy sports betting sites FanDuel and DraftKings have reached an agreement with NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to stop operating in New York State&#x2014;for now.</p>

<p>Schneiderman sent the sites <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225122848/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/11/online_sports_betting_crackdown.php">cease-and-desists orders in November</a> and a state judge ordered them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225122848/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/no_sports_fantasy_why_god.php">shut down in December</a>. According to the Times Union, today&apos;s &quot;agreement provides that if New York does not legalize paid contests by June 30, the companies will refrain from taking bets until appeals of injunctions against them are decided in court. Even if the preliminary injunctions sought by Schneiderman are upheld or the state legalizes paid daily fantasy sports games, the attorney general would be under no obligation to end his false advertising claims against the company under the terms of the agreement. The attorney general would stop seeking restitution for New York players.&quot;</p>

<p>New York is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225122848/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/21/471289879/draftkings-fanduel-shut-down-paid-contests-in-new-york-for-now">second biggest sports fantasy betting market</a> in the country (California is #1).</p>

<p>In a statement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225122848/https://newsroom.fanduel.com/2016/03/21/fanduel-in-new-york/">FanDuel says</a>, &quot;New York is a critical state for FanDuel. FanDuel is headquartered in Manhattan, where we employ more than 170 young, smart, passionate fans who are committed to innovating and providing the best fantasy experience possible. We are proud to be one of New York&#x2019;s largest startup companies, and while it is disheartening for us to restrict access to paid contests in our home state, we believe this is in the best interest of our company, the fantasy industry and our players while we continue to pursue legal clarity in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>Schneiderman said, &quot;I&#x2019;m pleased to announce that both FanDuel and DraftKings will stop taking bets in New York State, consistent with New York State law and the cease-and-desist orders my office issued at the outset of this matter. As I&apos;ve said from the start, my job is to enforce the  law, and starting today, DraftKings and FanDuel will abide by it.  Today&apos;s agreement also creates an expedited path to resolve this litigation should that law change or upon a decision by the appellate division.  Regardless, our key claims against the companies for false advertising and consumer fraud are not affected by the agreement and will continue.&quot;</p>

<p>For a look at how un-lucrative betting on fantasy sports sites is, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225122848/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/30/daily_fantasy_sports.php">check out this feature by David Vecsey</a>: &quot;I used my debit card to plunk down $25 on FanDuel and immediately started researching Finnish hockey players and NFL run-defense rankings. About three hours later, I had won my first big pot&#x2014;not $700, but $2.50 for finishing 929th in an NHL tournament.&quot;</p>
