Previously, Obama&apos;s lead was 18 points in June and 13 points in July.  </p>

<p>Respondents believe that Obama is the best candidate on issues economy, Iraq, health care and education, while they seem to prefer McCain on terrorism and &quot;Enhancing America&apos;s strength in the world.&quot; But for personal attributes, McCain gets the nod on patriotism, experience, integrity and leadership, while Obama is considered more compassionate and intelligent. And while they find McCain (79%) more qualified than Obama (67%), Sarah Palin is considered even less qualified than Obama with 47% (Joe Biden got 70%).  </p>

<p>Siena New York Poll spokesman Steve Greenberg said, &#x201C;The conventions are over.  The running mates are set.  And as voters begin to focus on the race, New York&#x2019;s overwhelming Democratic enrollment advantage is not reflected in how voters tell Siena they plan to vote.&#x201D;  And in Long Island, the Dowling Institute found Obama just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122418/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/politics/ny-stpoll0916,0,964790.story">leads by 5 points on Long Island as well</a>.  Dowling&apos;s Michael Dawidziak believes that the selection of Palin after the DNC &quot;squelched&quot; Obama&apos;s bounce and that McCain got a bigger bounce and benefited from the RNC being near Labor Day (more people watching).</p>
