<p>An already hilarious <em>Saturday Night Live</em> filmed sketch about a never-ending cast of guest rappers on a new song from Big Chris (Kenan Thompson) got a sweet kicker: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030515/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/23/americas_dad_tom_hanks_hosts_snl_fo.php#photo-7">David S. Pumpkins</a>, played by Tom Hanks. ANY QUESTIONS?</p>

<p>Big Chris is introducing the latest song from Cash Stack Records, with guest rappers Shantasia and Young Bitch (Pete Davidson)... but then Prinsexxxy (Leslie Jones), Sno&apos;Cone (Mikey Day), Sloppy Moses (Kyle Mooney), King Keef (Dwayne Johnson), Lil&apos; Nitwit (Alex Moffat), Skiffle (Bobby Moynihan), Marci Jams (Melissa Villasenor), 2 Black Guyz, Hawt Clown (Cecily Strong), Pregnasty (Kate McKinnon) Kathleen Bell (Aidy Bryant) and Katy Perry and Essentially Simon (Beck Bennett) join in. Then... it&apos;s time for David S. Pimpkins:</p>

<p>Of course, Dat Snatch (Vanessa Bayer) also had to try to join the song as well.</p>

<p>The David S. Pumpkins character was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030515/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/23/americas_dad_tom_hanks_hosts_snl_fo.php#photo-7">introduced in the pre-Halloween show last year</a>, which was so odd and ultimately funny that it prompted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030515/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/snls-david-pumpkins-is-supposed-to-be-confusing.html">long think pieces</a> (&quot;Despite its random-seeming parts, the sketch makes sense on enough levels for it to succeed&quot;) and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030515/http://www.brooklyndaily.com/stories/2016/45/mm-david-s-pumpkins-ruins-marine-parkers-halloween-2016-11-04-bk.html">ruined one man&apos;s Halloween</a>.</p>

<p>For some people, last night was the first time they got to see David S. Pumpkins... to have that experience again:</p>
