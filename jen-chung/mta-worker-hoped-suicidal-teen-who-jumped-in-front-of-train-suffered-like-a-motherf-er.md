<p>A 16-year-old boy committed suicide by jumping in front of a Metro-North train in the Bronx on Monday afternoon. Shortly after the incident, an unidentified MTA employee aboard the train was allegedly heard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163355/https://twitter.com/Katweeta/status/694302003472830464">remarking</a> &quot;Someone got killed! I hope he suffered like a motherfucker.&quot; Passengers say the worker&apos;s comment was transmitted via an open mic throughout the train.</p>

<p>The teen, who was a sophomore at Fordham Prep, was killed after jumping in front of a northbound train near the Botanical Garden station <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163355/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/person-dead-struck-metro-north-train-bronx-article-1.2516692">around 3:30 p.m.</a> The incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163355/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/01/grand-central-shut-down/">caused extensive delays</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163355/https://www.instagram.com/p/BBQwt84xAs5/">extreme over-crowding</a> at Grand Central Terminal&#x2014;the MTA initially shut down all four Metro-North tracks along the line, then restored limited service to just two of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163355/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/transit/2016/02/02/fordham-prep-sophomore-killed-train/79711922/">The Journal News reports</a>, &quot;The student is the second to die on Metro-North tracks in the past few weeks. On Jan. 18, a 16-year-old Fordham Prep student from Sleepy Hollow was struck and killed near the Phillpse Manor station after authorities said he deliberately stepped in front of a train.&quot;</p>

<p>The school&apos;s president, Rev. Christopher J. Devron, said in a statement:</p><blockquote>The sudden and tragic death of a member of our sophomore class last evening has deeply shocked and saddened the entire Fordham Prep community. We are in close contact with the young man&#x2019;s family and have assured them that our prayers, sympathy and support are with them in their time of need. <p></p>

<p>In order to support and care for our community during this difficult time, Fordham Prep will be providing trained experts and grief counselors to meet with students, faculty, staff, and parents. </p>

<p>We will also host a parent meeting at which specialists and members of the Prep&#x2019;s Crisis Team will address their concerns and questions.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163355/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Contagion-May-Have-Contributed-to-Fordham-Prep-Students-Death-Psychologist-367398711.html">A psychiatrist told NBC New York</a> that the teen&apos;s death &quot;may have been a case of &apos;suicide contagion&apos; spurred by another student who killed himself in a similar manner... Suicide contagion is a known phenomenon where people considering ending their life are influenced by other people taking their own lives. There is evidence that suggests such suicides may happen in &apos;clusters&apos; or &apos;outbreaks&apos; amid media coverage.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Dr. Moira Rynn said parents need to talk to their kids, &quot;Sometimes parents are afraid to ask. They almost feel like if they ask those hard questions, that maybe it will cause something to happen or make something get worse. And we really know that it doesn&apos;t.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The parent of a Fordham Prep student added, &quot;For two kids in two weeks, something&apos;s not right. Maybe there&apos;s too much pressure on their activities... I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding the callous train employee, an MTA spokeswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163355/http://nypost.com/2016/02/03/mta-worker-after-teens-suicide-i-hope-the-motherf-ker-suffered/">said in a statement</a>, &#x201C;Such language and sentiment has no place on Metro-North Railroad. We are aware of these allegations and are looking into them.&quot; </p>
