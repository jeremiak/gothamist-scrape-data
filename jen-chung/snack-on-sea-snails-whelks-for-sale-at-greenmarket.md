Seafood today. <p></p>

<p>Sietsema, who really enjoyed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130310060648/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/2012/01/whelks_bowery_d.php">raw whelk dish at Bowery Diner</a>, says they ones for sale &quot;are cold and sweet, and would be especially good in a seafood salad. They&apos;re chewy in a pleasant sort of way, and would probably go well with a number of sauces. Imagine the delight of your foodie friends if you served them in spaghetti with a garlic butter sauce and parsley, for example.&quot;</p>

Seafood</a>, which is based in Riverhead: &quot;PE &amp; DD Seafood is one of a handful of local seafood companies that sell their catch to customers at the NYC Greenmarkets, supplying a variety of fin fish, lobsters, shellfish and conch. By supporting local fishermen, you can help keep these hard-working, small family-run fishing businesses alive; in addition, you are also supporting a form or fishing that Phil believes does minimal damage to the environment.&quot;</p>
