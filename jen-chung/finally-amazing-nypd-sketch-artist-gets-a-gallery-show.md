					<p>If you follow New York City crime news, then you&apos;re probably familiar with Detective Jason Harvey&apos;s incredible work&#x2014;you just might not realize it. Harvey is one of three NYPD sketch artists, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/23/williamsburg_hate_crime.php">his sketches</a> of suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/anti_muslim_hate_crime.php">bring dimension</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/nypd_releases_sketch_of_suspect_who.php">witness details</a>. Now, he is displaying some of his non-NYPD drawings, which utilize the same crosshatch technique, at a gallery in the Meatpacking District.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Composites</em> is on view at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://www.fortgansevoort.com/">Fort Gansevoort</a> through January 10, 2016. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://www.fortgansevoort.com/about-1/">The show</a>, organized by Fort Gansevoort founder Adam Shopkorn and filmmaker Josh Safdie, features renderings of fictional subjects, but the technique he applied is rooted in his profession. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_11_harveygall.jpg"> <img alt="2015_11_harveygall.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2015/11/2015_11_harveygall-thumb-1000x400-921221.jpg" width="640" height="256" class="image-none"> </a> </span><br>

<p>A press release for the exhibition described how Harvey approaches developing a police sketch. &quot;Beginning with a description of a suspect&#x2019;s face provided by the victim, he then constructs a forensic image based on various facial attributes.&quot; Harvey said, &quot;It&#x2019;s not a creative process, it&#x2019;s a skill that I have.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="72315sketch.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_chrisrobbins/72315sketch.jpg" width="300" height="377"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> A police sketch by Harvey for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/23/williamsburg_hate_crime.php">hate crime in Williamsburg</a></i></div> He added, &quot;You have to be a good listener, and have a certain candor when working with an eyewitness... [T]he process itself is therapeutic; it&#x2019;s a step in the right direction.&quot;<p></p>

<p>For the <em>Fantasy Composites</em>, Harvey &quot;organically and intuitively evolves the profile, incorporating both real and imaginary facial features. He begins with a specific feature then quickly builds on it, adding a distinct jawbone or hairstyle.&quot; </p>

<p>Safide revealed, &quot;I was obsessed with Jason&apos;s sketches back when he was elusively known only for his stamp/signature &apos;HARVEY&apos; that I would see on NYCALERTS twitter handle. I regularly made calls to police plaza and did research on this for years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jason is an artist who does not consider himself to be an artist in his workplace. There&apos;s no creative freedom when doing a sketch for the NYPD. I wanted to let Jason step out of his comfort zone and show his sketch work in a completely different context,&quot; Shopkorn explained. &quot;I conceived <em>Fantasy Composites</em> for our show. Many of the works are rooted in reality and many seem to skew fantasy. The complete body of works strikes a healthy balance between these two worlds. With these works, Jason has unfettered artistic freedom and can improvise and do as he chooses. I trust this must be quite liberating for him.&quot;</p>

<p>At the show&apos;s opening, Harvey confirmed that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-sketch-artist-debuts-collection-gallery-show-article-1.2431760">telling the Daily News</a>, &quot;Here, I get to sketch the faces I&#x2019;m really interested in making.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Fort Gansevoort is located at 5 Ninth Avenue in the Meatpacking District. It&apos;s open Wednesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. FYI, around the corner is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809225624/http://www.fgbbq.com/#home-1">Fort Gansevoort BBQ</a>.</em></p>
