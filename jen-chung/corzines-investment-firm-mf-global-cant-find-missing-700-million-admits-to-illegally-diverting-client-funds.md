After a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130306092039/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/corzine_may_consider_sale_of_mf_4pXtxXedtphtvxvDxp00RK">shaky week last week</a>, the company filed for bankruptcy yesterday as MF Global couldn&apos;t find $700 million.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130306092039/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/regulators-investigating-mf-global/?ref=business">Dealbook explains</a>, &quot;The discovery that money could not be located might simply reflect sloppy internal controls at MF Global.  At first, as much as $950 million was believed to be missing, but as the firm sorted through its bankruptcy, that figure fell to less than $700 million by late Monday, the people briefed on the matter said. Additional funds are expected to trickle in over the coming days.&quot;  And now MF Global admits it mixed client and company funds (a big no-no) and diverted client funds as well.</p>

<p>According to the CME Group, the world&apos;s largest futures exchange, MF Global &quot;<a href="&lt;a href=" http:="" www.bloomberg.com="" news="" 2011-11-01="" mf-global-probe-said-to-involve-hundreds-of-millions-in-funds.html"="">isn&#x2019;t in compliance with the rules of the exchange and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a>.&quot; CME Group head Craig Donohue said, <br>
&quot;While we are unable to determine the precise scope of the firm&#x2019;s violation at this time, we are investigating the circumstances of the firm&#x2019;s failure.&quot;  </p>

<p>Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130306092039/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204394804577012061970129588.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;Regulators still don&apos;t know where the customer funds went, who directed the move or how widespread the practice was, the official said. <strong>Regulators are still working to determine whether MF Global had a continuing problem with handling customer funds or if executives diverted funds as the company&apos;s financial situation deteriorated and grew more desperate, the official said</strong>.&quot;  </p>
