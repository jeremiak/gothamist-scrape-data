<p>Anti-crime officers responding to a tip about a possible &quot;retaliatory gang shooting&quot; ended up killing a man who allegedly fired at them yesterday afternoon in East New York. One local resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505224647/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Suspect-Dies-Police-Involved-Shooting-Brooklyn-413999353.html">estimated that</a> &quot;it must have been 13, 14 shots.&quot;</p>

<p>An NYPD source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505224647/http://abc7ny.com/news/up-to-20-shots-fired-in-fatal-nypd-shooting-in-brooklyn/1758358/">told WABC 7</a> that as many as &quot;20 shots were fired before the suspect was struck and killed at the end of an alley.&quot;</p>

<p>At a press conference, NYPD Chief Terence Monahan said that the three-person anti-crime unit, a sergeant and two officers, &quot;were in the vicinity of Fountain and Blake Avenues based on information of a potential retaliatory gang shooting in the area of the Cypress Housing development in the East New York Section of Brooklyn&quot; around 4 p.m.</p><blockquote> They observed a male running from the Cypress Houses and they began to follow him in their vehicle. After approximately two blocks, on Logan Street, the officers approached the suspect. When the sergeant and one officer exited the vehicle, the suspect drew a revolver and fired it at them.<p></p>

<p> The officers returned fire and the subject fled on foot with officers in pursuit.<br>
 <br>
The suspect ran two blocks and entered a rear yard at 890 Belmont Avenue. One officer followed the suspect into the rear alley and confronted the suspect, who was still armed.  The officer fired at the suspect again at this time.  The suspect was struck and pronounced dead at the scene.</p></blockquote>Police found a .32 caliber revolver by the suspect, who has not been identified at this time.<p></p>

<p>The neighborhood has been, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505224647/http://nypost.com/2017/02/16/suspect-fatally-shot-after-exchanging-gunfire-with-cops/">as the Post puts it</a>, &quot;plagued by an ongoing feud between two groups at one of the project&#x2019;s buildings that go by the names &apos;Frontside&apos; and &apos;Backside.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505224647/http://nypost.com/2017/02/16/suspect-fatally-shot-after-exchanging-gunfire-with-cops/">A deli owner said of shootings,</a> &quot;This happens a lot here... We&#x2019;re terrified. What if it would&#x2019;ve happened in front of my store and someone would&#x2019;ve gotten hurt?!&quot;</p>

<p>Resident Mitchell Pendleton told WABC 7, &quot;I was walking down Belmont and I heard shots fired, and I believe as a result the police responded back. I think they did what the community would want, somebody else could have gotten hurt, they didn&apos;t, and we appreciate that.&quot; </p>
