<p>The three-day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013249/http://dumboartsfestival.com/">DUMBO Arts Festival</a> kicked off last night, and there are full days of fun and gorgeous spectacles today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest pieces might be a colorful glass house sculpture by Tom Fruin, which is part of a poetic performance installation called <em>Reflection/Kolonihavehus</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013249/http://dumboartsfestival.com/art/reflection_kolonihavehus/">According to the description</a>, it &quot;can be experienced on several levels; as an intimate performance and/or a sculptural intervention in an urban space, 24 hours a day.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Reflection is a poetic interpretation concerning our daily choices or lack of choices and their consequences to our common future. The colorful glass house is inhabited by two performers, who portray everyday dilemmas and lifestyle paradoxes in a subtle manner. They have lost the ability to meaningfully discriminate, and are trapped in a long chain of procrastination, mirroring our current social patterns. As an audience you can wonder in and out of the performance as you like. You get to make a choice.</blockquote>

<p>It will be performed today at 1-3 p.m. and 7-9 p.m. and tomorrow (Sunday) at 12-2 p.m. and 4-6 p.m.</p>
