Now, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110191421/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/strauss_kahn_admits_trying_to_kiss_Wtkxx6goeK6hWGLHy47YyK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">French newspaper claims</a> that Strauss-Kahn has admitted to trying to come on to the young woman.  <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110191421/http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/justice/dsk-admet-qu-il-a-voulu-embrasser-tristane-banon_1030974.html">L&apos;Express reports</a> that the former IMF head was interviewed by police and said (per English translation) that &quot;he tried to kiss her thinking she was consenting.&quot; Tristane Banon then rejected him and Strauss-Kahn claims he dropped his advance.  </p>

<p>Banon told L&apos;Express over the summer, &quot;When I wanted to leave, he grabbed my hand and then arms, I asked him to let me go, and that&apos;s where part of the fight. He pulled me toward him, we came down and we fought.&quot; She also mentioned &quot;his fingers in my mouth, his hands in my pants after blowing up the jeans and the bra under my turtleneck.&quot;  </p>

<p>Banon&apos;s mother, Anne Mansouret, who is a Socialist politician, like Strauss-Kahn, claimed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110191421/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/08/french_prosecutors_investigate_dsks.php">she told her daughter not to press charges</a> against DSK, &quot;Listen, you know, if he had raped you, I wouldn&#x2019;t have any hesitation, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case. He sexually assaulted you, there wasn&#x2019;t any rape per se; so until the end of your life, you&#x2019;re going to have on your r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, you know, Tristane Banon is the girl who...&quot; Mansouret later admitted to having <a href="dsk_had_sex_with_mother_of_journali.php">an affair with Strauss-Kahn</a>.</p>
