The smoke has been so heavy that all westbound Long Island Expressway lanes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165328/http://wcbstv.com/cbs2crew/queens.fire.three.2.1169513.html">were shut down temporarily</a>&#x2014;they have since reopened but there are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165328/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7003690">delays near the Queens Midtown Tunnel</a>. According to MyFoxNY, &quot;NY Traffic Authority Ines Rosales recommends drivers in the area take the 59th Street Bridge or get off on Queens Boulevard and take the Queens Borough Bridge.&quot;  And firefighters are still working to get the fire under control.</p>
