<p>The NYPD is hoping the public can help them identify a man suspected of multiple arson incidents in Queens yesterday. And there&apos;s video of the alleged assailant:</p>

<p>The police say that at 5 a.m. yesterday morning, a 2007 Mercury Mariner SUV was found on fire at 49th Street and 39th Avenue. That SUV happened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825033503/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ex_pol_suv_set_ablaze_szw4PQREUG7tNMO5nXB9XO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">to be former City Councilman Eric Gioia&apos;s</a> (it was parked outside his house in Sunnyside) and he told the Post, &quot;I&#x2019;m very grateful that my family is safe. It could have been far worse. The goal now is to catch the guy.&quot;</p>

<p>Then there were four other rubbish fires after the SUV caught fire. The incidents were at 1) 50th Street and 39th Avenue; 2) 50th Street and 39th Avenue; 3) 49th Street and 39th Avenue; and 4) 49th Street and 39th Avenue.<br>
