<p>After the Medical Examiner&apos;s office determined that the death of a two-year-old girl was homicide, the police have arrested her mother. </p>

<p>The little girl, Melody Pheng, died after drowning in her bathtub on Sunday night. Police responded to a 911 call at 652 47th Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn and found Melody&apos;s father performing CPR on the unconscious and unresponsive girl.</p>

<p>Lin Li, 24, was charged with murder, manslaughter and acting in a manner injurious to a child. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062523/http://abc7ny.com/news/mom-arraigned-in-bathtub-death-was-apparently-punishing-girl-for-wetting-herself/1248302/">According to WABC 7</a>, Li was allegedly punishing the girl for wetting herself. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062523/http://nypost.com/2016/03/15/mom-accused-of-drowning-2-year-old-daughter-in-bathtub/">Post details</a>, &quot;Li disciplined her daughter... by making her stand up facing a wall for several hours on Sunday night... When the toddler peed on herself, her mom took her to a filled bathtub and submerged her, the sources said. A short time later, the mom noticed the air bubbles had stopped.&quot;</p>

<p>Neighbors were shocked at Li&apos;s arrest, with one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062523/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-girl-2-drowned-death-ruled-homicide-article-1.2565122">telling the Daily News</a>, &quot;I never seen her do nothing wrong. I&apos;ve never seen them even yell at their kids... They were playing in the front yard on Chinese New Year [Feb. 8]. They had them dressed in gold and red. They were throwing confetti having a good time. You would of never imagined. They were out there having a blast.&quot;</p>

<p>Melody&apos;s four-year-old brother is in custody of the Administration for Children&apos;s Services, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062523/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/nyregion/brooklyn-mother-is-charged-in-drowning-of-daughter-2.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">which is also investigating</a> the household.</p>
