<p>Police have arrested a man they believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223163537/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/12/man_shot_after_moving_traffic_cone.php">shot another man outside</a> the Hells Angels East Village clubhouse earlier this month. The violence was sparked when the victim tried to move one of the motorcycle club&apos;s traffic cones so that his friend&apos;s car could make its way down the street.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred on Sunday, December 11th, around 1:20 a.m. on East 3rd Street. David Martinez, a 25-year-old Valley Stream resident, had exited his friend&apos;s Mercedes to move one of the traffic cones because a livery cab was blocking their way. The Hells Angels have long used the cones to block off parking spaces for its members&apos; bikes. </p>

<p>Suspect Anthony Iovenitti, 52, is apparently a &quot;prospect&quot; hoping to become a full member. Police say he objected to the cone move, and his confrontation with Martinez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223163537/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/2-dead-6-wounded-mayhem-bronx-brooklyn-article-1.2907418">turned into an &quot;all-out brawl,&quot;</a> ending with Martinez shot in the stomach. Martinez is still hospitalized but is stable and expected to recover, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223163537/http://nypost.com/2016/12/20/cops-arrest-shooter-in-hells-angels-parking-spot-brawl/">the NY Post reports</a>.</p>

<p>Iovenitti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223163537/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-busted-shooting-hells-angels-nyc-clubhouse-article-1.2917870">was in police custody</a> yesterday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223163537/http://nypost.com/2016/12/20/cops-arrest-shooter-in-hells-angels-parking-spot-brawl/">Sources tell the Post</a> that Iovenitti &quot;threw the first punch and was shoved the ground by Martinez. He then whipped out a gun and shot the younger man in the stomach.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Hells Angels have refused to cooperate with police, so the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223163537/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/14/nypd_raids_hells_angels_hq_and_leav.php">NYPD &quot;raided&quot; their headquarters last week</a>, removing their planters, benches and a ramp, claiming they were obstructing the sidewalk. Police also removed the bikers&apos; precious traffic cones.</p>

<p>&quot;It was done just to fuck with them,&quot; one police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223163537/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/hells-angels-refusing-to-help-cops-with-shooting-investigation/">told the Post</a>. &quot;They&#x2019;re not cooperating with the investigation. If they&#x2019;re gonna give us a hard time, we&#x2019;re gonna give them a hard time.&quot;</p>
