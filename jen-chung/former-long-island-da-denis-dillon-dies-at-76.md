He had been battling lymphoma.  His daughter<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054549/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/nyregion/16dillon.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss"> told the NY Times</a>, &quot;My father had a passion for justice and public service, and he believed in a professional prosecutor&#x2019;s office. He strove for fairness, and I guess one of the things is that he was a voice for those that didn&#x2019;t have one.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A former NYC cop and federal prosecutor, Dillon was elected at the Nassau County DA as a Democrat in 1974. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054549/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/longtime-former-nassau-da-denis-dillon-76-dies-1.2211678">Newsday report</a>s, &quot;It was his unapologetic activism against abortion that elevated his profile in the public eye. A devout Catholic, Dillon marched in anti-abortion protests, drawing criticism for mixing politics with religious beliefs. The issue ultimately forced his switch from the Democratic Party to the Nassau GOP and in 1986, it prompted a losing bid for governor as the Right to Life candidate.&quot; He lost in 2005 to Kathleen Rice (a current Attorney General candidate). </p>

<p>His close friend and former ADA, NY State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Diamond, told the Times that Dillon &quot;&apos;revolutionized&apos; the county&#x2019;s justice system by allowing felons to plead guilty before they were indicted, while eliminating most post-indictment plea bargains. &apos;He was a big, big believer when he came here in swift and certain punishment,&apos; Judge Diamond recalled.&quot; </p>
