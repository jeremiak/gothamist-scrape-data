<p>The tranquility of some Connecticut farm stands has been shattered after two corn thefts. At one farm, 153 ears were taken, while another farm was missing 2,400 ears of corn.</p>

<p>Whit Betts, sales manager of the Green Acres Farm in Bristol, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014130/http://wtnh.com/2014/08/05/corn-thieves-pick-two-local-farms-clean-of-corn/">told WTNH that on Sunday, August 3</a>, his staff went to pick corn to sell that day, but found it &quot;picked clean.&quot; He said, &quot;They started looking to get the ears of corn and there was nothing there. I mean absolutely no ears at all... We think it was done by somebody who has the ability to pick corn... It was done at night. It was a lot of corn. I don&#x2019;t think the average person would be able to come through here.&quot; The value of the 2400 ears of sugar corn was about $1,200.</p>

<p>The Anderson Farms in Wethersfield was hit on July 31. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014130/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/nyregion/connecticut-farmers-are-on-guard-after-corn-thefts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>The Andersons&#x2019; main plot is safeguarded by a locked gate to discourage trespassers from helping themselves to ears of corn. That did not stop two outsiders, though, from targeting 40 acres the family sows outside the gate. &#x201C;One was holding the bag,&#x201D; said Christopher Anderson, the fourth-generation farmer who confronted the pillagers, &#x201C;and the other was filling it up.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>He caught up with them just ahead of the police at a neighbor&#x2019;s house. &#x201C;They had corn tassels in their hair,&#x201D; Mr. Anderson said. &#x201C;A dead giveaway.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Efrain Pacheco, 60, and Carlos Pacheco, 32, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014130/http://articles.courant.com/2014-08-07/news/hc-wethersfield-corn-arrest-20140805_1_picked-corn-stealing-corn-father-and-son">were charged</a> with sixth-degree larceny for stealing the 153 ears (value: just under $100). Farmers believe the corn is being resold (corn black market)<p></p>

<p>Apparently the Pachecos offered to pay for the corn, but Anderson wanted to press charges, telling the Times, &quot;If someone needs a dozen ears, or if you need food, hey, I&#x2019;ll even pick it for you. But don&#x2019;t take advantage of someone else&#x2019;s hard work to steal stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>Betts had an idea for corn thieves, &quot;Heck, I don&#x2019;t want these guys to go to jail. I want them to pick weeds on farms for two summers in a row. See how much of an appetite they have for stealing corn after that.&quot;</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014130/https://www.facebook.com/greenacresfarmbristol?rf=104892072909795">Green Acres Farm</a> currently has a special on butter-and-sugar corn and is also selling Kandy corn, which is known for its sweet flavor. </p>
