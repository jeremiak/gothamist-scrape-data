					<p>It happened: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, also known as Prince William and Kate Middleton, met America&apos;s royalty, Jay Z and Beyonce, at last night&apos;s Brooklyn Nets game at the Barclays Center. (Cue all the &quot;royals holding court&quot; puns.) But after the game&#x2014;a Nets loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers&#x2014;there was an international incident: Cavaliers star LeBron James <em>put his sweaty post-game arm on the Duchess&apos;s shoulder</em>.</p>

<p>James, who wore an &quot;I Can&apos;t Breathe&quot; t-shirt during warm-up, had presented the couple with Cavaliers jerseys&#x2014;a toddler-sized one for Prince George and an adult one with &quot;Cambridge&quot; on the back. The Brits are in vapors: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160527181608/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/11281726/Watch-LeBron-James-breaks-royal-protocol-with-Kate-Duchess-of-Cambridge.html">The Telegraph wrote</a>, &quot;While posing for photographs, LeBron James appeared to surprise the Duchess of Cambridge by breaking royal protocol and placing his arm around her. The breach of protocol echoed the time when Michelle Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160527181608/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/g20-summit/5091915/Michelle-Obama-hugs-the-Queen.html">caused a stir by putting her arm</a> around the Queen in 2009.&quot; The Guardian said, &quot;Kate held the yellow and William the maroon, as James posed for pictures withe couple, putting his arm around the Duchess&#x2019;s shoulder - something of a breach of royal etiquette.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160527181608/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2866696/The-moment-basketball-s-King-James-risked-spell-royal-sin-bin-NBA-star-LeBron-James-breaches-protocol-putting-arm-Kate-s-shoulder-post-match-meeting.html">And the Daily Mail</a>...</p><blockquote>Etiquette expert William Hanson told MailOnline: &apos;Although I am sure the Duchess of Cambridge won&#x2019;t have worried about it, Mr James should not have put his arm around her. <p></p>

<p>&apos;Americans are much more tactile than we Brits and this is another example of an American being too touchy feely with British royalty. You&#x2019;d have think they&#x2019;d have learned by now...</p>

<p>&apos;A shower would have been preferable but he had just finished a game - so even more reason for him not have opened his pits by lifting his arm and placing it around Her Royal Highness!&apos; </p></blockquote>Well, that&apos;s true&#x2014;you can see James&apos; sweat seeping through the shirt. Thank goodness Bey and Jay weren&apos;t so handsy:<p></p>
