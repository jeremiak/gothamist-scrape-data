Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160509180251/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/once-on-ice-riunite-goes-for-a-chill/">Media Decoder reports</a> its parent company Banfi Vintners is rebooting the brand, &quot;This time chasing digitally adept younger women. Its new slogan: &apos;Just Chill.&apos;&quot; We don&apos;t know&#x2014;doesn&apos;t seem young enough. Why not &quot;OMG Just Chill&quot;?</p>

<p>Banfi Vinters&apos; marketing and communications director Mark Lyle explained that the new branding is supposed to make wine attractive in &quot;a friendly, unpretentious way... As much as wine has grown over the last 15 to 20 years, there still continues to be folks who come into wine 25 and older who aren&#x2019;t quite ready for an aged Brunello.&quot; Yeah, those folks are too young to remember the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160509180251/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3LkWVqYecE">Bartles and Jaymes ads</a>, too.  Media Decoder adds:</p><blockquote>Unlike the &#x201C;On Ice, So Nice&#x201D; campaign, the &#x201C;Just Chill&#x201D; campaign will not be on television. The campaign strategy, which reaches consumers on other devices, includes a Web site where women can learn more about the wines, watch short videos, and play a question game called Chill Chatter. The game is meant to &#x201C;inspire juicy conversation&#x201D; with questions like, &#x201C;Would you rather be overweight and pretty or skinny and ugly?&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>The videos show 20-something women sitting on a rooftop, talking about dating and updating their Facebook statuses and, of course, drinking wine.</p></blockquote>Wait, they&apos;re not talking about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160509180251/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGw_ekbxj5M&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLD12161E052A19321">skiing AND drinking</a>?<p></p>
