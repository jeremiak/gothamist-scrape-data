<p><strong>[VITAL CELEBRITY TROUBLE UPDATE BELOW] </strong>Mercurial and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144953/http://laist.com/2009/07/20/chris_brown_publicly_apologizes_for.php">admitted girlfriend beater</a> Chris Brown Tweeted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144953/http://www.tmz.com/2012/06/14/chris-brown-drake-fight-injured-rihanna/">photograph of his gashed chin early this morning</a>, saying, &quot;How u party wit rich n**** that hate? Lol... Throwing bottles like girls? #shameonya!&quot;  Then it was deleted... and now it&apos;s suggested that his entourage and Drake&apos;s entourage got into a bottle attack at WIP in Soho. And it may have been over Rihanna! Because when dudes fight, it&apos;s gotta be over a girl.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, it &quot;confirmed with the NYPD that the two singers&apos; crews got into a fight at WIP nightclub -- 5 people were injured in the melee.  NYPD arrived on the scene after receiving a call between 4 and 5am. Chris and Drake were not present when cops arrived.&quot;  No one there had critical injuries (&quot;just bumps, bruises and lacerations&quot;) and no one was arrested.</p>

<p>Rihanna had an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144953/http://laist.com/2009/02/09/rihanna_named_victim_in_chris_brown.php">infamous and tumultuous relationship with Brown</a> and she later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144953/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/chris_brown_injured_rihanna_bar_xVPvdF4q1rudKWQ7udnnQO?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">dated Drake briefly</a>.  Recently, Brown was seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144953/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/chris_minus_riri_dbXjhmaBKtbE1MHmkUqZ2M">with Rihanna&apos;s relatives at a NYC club</a> and Rihanna allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144953/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/gatecrasher/rihanna-upset-chris-brown-dating-karrueche-tran-insiders-article-1.1095216?localLinksEnabled=false">wants Brown to dump his girlfriend</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Update 1:04 p.m.: </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144953/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/06/14/nypd-to-question-hip-hop-stars-chris-brown-drake-after-manhattan-bar-brawl/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">CBS 2 reports </a>that police want to question both Brown and Drake about the brawl. That could be complicated for Drake, because he&apos;s scheduled to perform at SPAC upstate tonight. Brown, you may recall, is also on probation after pleading guilty to assaulting Rihanna at a pre-Grammy party in 2009. And though the injuries were minor, they were serious enough that four women and one man were taken to the hospital to treat their lacerations. </p>

<p><strong>Update 2:07 p.m.:</strong> A celebrity image service says this right here is a photo of Chris Brown&apos;s blood soaked car, seen parked outside his hotel in New York. (Up next: EXCLUSIVE photos of crumpled tissues that someone who saw Brown in concert once MAY have recently used to blow his nose.)</p>
