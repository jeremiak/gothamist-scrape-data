<p>The lavish 15 Central Park West apartment that former Citigroup chairman Sanford Weill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430042705/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/ex-citi_chair_lists_15_cpw_apartmen.php">put on the market for $88 million</a>&#x2014;with proceeds going to charity&#x2014;was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430042705/http://www.observer.com/2011/12/na-zdarovia-dmitry-rybolovlev-fertilizer-kingpin-buys-sandy-weills-88-m-penthouse/">purchased by Russian fertilizer billionaire</a> Dmitry Rybolovlev.  And now it seems that the four-bedroom, 6,437-square foot apartment is for his 22-year-old daughter.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430042705/http://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2011/12/19/billionaires-daughter-pays-record-sum-for-nyc-pad/">According to Forbes</a>, Ekaterina Rybolovleva is that one who bought it:</p><blockquote>Rybolovleva is currently studying at an undisclosed U.S. university and plans to stay in the apartment when visiting New York. According to a source familiar with the sale, she paid the full asking price of $88 million setting a record for highest individual transation in New York City history.<p></p>

<p>Here is the official statement from her representatives: &quot;A company associated with Ekaterina Rybolovleva, daughter of a well-known businessman Dmitriy Rybolovlev, has signed a contract to purchase an apartment at 15 Central Park West, New York. The apartment is a condominium currently owned by the Sanford Weill Family. Ms. Rybolovleva is currently studying at a US university. She plans to stay in the apartment when visiting New York. Ms. Rybolovleva was born in Russia, is a resident of Monaco and has resided in Monaco and Switzerland for the past 15 years.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Real estate attorney Stuart Saft told the Observer that Dmitry Rybolovlev could have bought the apartment as a divorce-proceeding move, &#x201C;It gets the money out of his estate involved in his fight with his wife,&quot; but suspects, &quot;I think its related to taxes. I think it is his daughter&apos;s apartment that he will be staying at when he&#x2019;s in New York. And he&#x2019;s concerned about New York income tax liability. It&#x2019;s a real problem in a high tax city, in a high tax state.&quot;<p></p>
