With the government <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131752/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/23/15_of_top_20_aig_bonus_takers_will.php">cracking down</a> on the multi-million dollar bonuses given to employees of bailed out financial firms, some top executives are thinking maybe they don&apos;t want to work for the big firms.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131752/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/business/12wall.html">NY Times reports</a> on the exodus of &quot;top talent...leaving Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and others in rising numbers to join banks that do not face tighter regulation, including foreign banks, or start-up companies eager to build themselves into tomorrow&#x2019;s financial powerhouses.&quot;  They&apos;re also heading to firms that didn&apos;t take bailout money, like Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.

Still, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Matthew Richardson says, &quot;<strong>If the risk-taking spreads out to these smaller institutions, it is no longer a systemic threat. And innovation is spreading out too. This is a good thing</strong>.&#x201D;</p>
