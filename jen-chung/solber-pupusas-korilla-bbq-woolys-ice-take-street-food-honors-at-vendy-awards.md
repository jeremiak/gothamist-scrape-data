</div></div>					<p>With only a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/who_makes_the_best_street_food_in_n.php">few days to contemplate the finalists</a> battling for top honors at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://streetvendor.org/vendys">this year&apos;s Vendy Awards</a>, crowds of foodies descended on Govenors Island yesterday to feast on the vendors vying.  In the top category, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://twitter.com/#!/solberpupusas">Solber Pupusas</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://midtownlunch.com/category/eggs-travaganza-cart/">Eggstravaganza</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://twitter.com/#!/chimielmalecon">Chimichury el Malecon</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://www.souvlakigr.com/">Souvlaki GR</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://midtownlunch.com/category/trini-paki-boys-cart/">Trini-Paki Boys Halal Food</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://www.yelp.com/biz/sams-falafel-stand-new-york">Sam&apos;s Falafel</a> were all vying for the Vendy Cup.  And the winner?  Solber Pupusas!</p>

<p>Cesar Fuentas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/147812/street-pupusas-maker-takes-top--vendy-award-">said Solber Pupusas was</a> &quot;Representing anyone who has tried hard and started from, I guess, the very bottom, literally with an old van, with a table with second, third-hand wares. And coming up to this and being loved like this it&apos;s human, it&apos;s history.&quot;</p>

<p>Rookie of the Year was Korilla BBQ, which avenged getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/12/korilla_bbq_truck_kicked_off_food_n.php">kicked off The Great Food Truck Race</a>. The Queens and Long Island natives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://twitter.com/#!/urbanoyster/status/117705532722266112">said</a>, &quot;We&apos;re all winners here!&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://twitter.com/#!/woolysice">Wooly&apos;s Ice</a> won best dessert&#x2014;the shaved ice operation, which located 79 Elizabeth in Chinatown&#x2014;thanks supporters last night and Tweeted this morning, &quot;Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king. #vendyawards #bestdessert #bessert?&quot;  It wasn&apos;t a dream&#x2014;for many people, it was their introduction to Woolys and, as one happy customer put it, their epic desserts, like Maker&apos;s Mark ice, nutmeg, and bourbon maple syrup.</p>

<p>Some additional notes, from our own Jamie Feldmar: </p><ul>	<li>Vendy Cup finalist Sam&apos;s Falafel revealed, &quot;I&apos;ve been up since 1am to prep for today. Everything is made fresh. The babaganoush alone takes 4 hours!&quot;</li><br>
	<li>Paty&apos;s Tacos, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143425/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/taco-truck-operator-honored-as-most-heroic-vendor/">honored as the Most Heroic Vendor</a>, said a difference with their tacos was that &quot;Ours is a family owned business. Our Tacos made with love.&quot; </li><br>
	<li>Korilla BBQ had one of the longest lines of the day. When asked why a Korean-taco fusion, they said, &quot;We like to think of ourselves as more of a Korean BBQ truck. The tortilla is a vehicle for the BBQ. The salsa and cheese are just compliments.&quot; Indeed&#x2014;the BBQ beef had a nice marinade.  </li><br>
	<li>Souvlaki GR had a man from Greece playing bazouki, a Greek guitar, for people waiting in the also-very-long line, &quot;In Greece, there&apos;s a whole culture around souvlaki shops&#x2014;one on every corner. Here, people thnnk it&apos;s just meat on a stick&#x2014;but so much more than that.&quot; </li><br>
	<li>Judges were wearing red sashes&#x2014; Gayle King looked fab, Colon Quinn looked a little haggard (as in, the way he usually looks!). </li><br>
	<li>Personal favorites: Taim falafel&#x2014;great spicy sauce. Pupusas&#x2014;lovely crispy corn crust giving way to creamy, cheesy middle. Souvlaki&apos;s Greek fries, coated in Feta and herbs were also memorable.</li><br>
