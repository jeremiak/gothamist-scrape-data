<p>The police released photographs of a woman who is accused of stealing $500,000 in uncut diamonds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120427015416/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/18/a_gems_dealer_from_forest.php">from a gem dealer earlier this month</a>.  Police say Erika Cooper is the hooker that Kurt Kaiser met at a Central Park South bar and who eventually stole his property after their Cosmopolitan Hotel hook-up on April 17.</p>

<p>Kaiser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120427015416/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cops_hunting_hooker_who_stole_in_iz5bZFuqMBIAm0mZ31wFQK">told the Post</a> &quot;he had been drinking heavily and drowning his sorrows after losing out on a deal to sell the uncut stones.&quot;  Enter Cooper (who also goes by the name of Bianca Williams), who asked if she could keep him company. One thing led to another and next thing you know, Cooper&apos;s asking him to buy her a $500 gift card AND a box of condoms on their way to the hotel.  Kaiser claims that after he fell asleep, Cooper absconded with the (uninsured) diamonds, which were in a suitcase that he put in a drawer.</p>

<p>The NYPD describe the 34-year-old Cooper, who lives in Manhattan, as approximately 5&apos;9&quot;, 120 lbs., small build, with brown eyes and black hair. Anyone with information in regard to this crime is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).&#xA0; The public can also submit tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120427015416/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.&#xA0; </p>

<p>As for the diamonds, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120427015416/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hooker_ice_thief_fenced_in_ldGz30OshzgGIaadDFeo5M">Diamond District dealers say</a> no one there would buy uncut diamonds from a stranger, but they could end up in a foreign market.</p>
