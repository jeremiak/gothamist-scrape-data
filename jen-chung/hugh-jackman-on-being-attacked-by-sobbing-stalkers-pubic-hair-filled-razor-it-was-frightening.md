                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_04_hughwvillage.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907074841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_hughwvillage.jpg" width="640" height="634"> <br> <i> Hugh Jackman and wife Deborra Lee-Furness in the West VIllage last week (Pacific Coast News)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>On Saturday, Hollywood and Broadway dreamboat (and man&apos;s man!) Hugh Jackman was the victim of a truly bizarre attack at his West Village gym: A stalker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907074841/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/sobbing_stalker_throws_pubic_hair_a.php">threw an electric razor, apparently filled with pubic hair</a>, at him. Yesterday, Jackman spoke to 1010 WINS, confirming, &quot;It was frightening,&quot; and also expressed his concern for the disturbed woman, &quot;Here&#x2019;s a woman who obviously needs help so I just hope she gets the help she needs.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_04_stalker1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907074841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_stalker1.jpg" width="365" height="275"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Kathleen Thurston (WCBS 2)</i></div> Jackman had been working out at his gym, Gotham Gym, at 600 Washington Street at 8 a.m. when Kathleen Thurston stormed in. She had asked him &quot;We&#x2019;re getting married, right?&quot; outside the gym, but once inside, she said, &#x201C;I love you!&quot; <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907074841/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/14/woman-arrested-for-stalking-hugh-jackman-in-west-village/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;Police said Jackman tried to defuse the situation with the stalker. He told Thurston not to touch him. But police said she followed crying and screaming. A gym employee grabbed Thurston, but not before she pulled an electric razor filled with hair out of her waistband and tossed it at Jackman.&quot;</p>

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907074841/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/stalk_down_the_aisle_EXYZh7z7I7wxoN216mgZRO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Post says</a> that Thurston had also approached Jackman&apos;s wife and daughter at his daughter&apos;s school last month, saying, &quot;I am going to marry your husband.&quot;</p>

<p>It also turns out that Thurston, a California native who has three grown children, has been on probation for stalking Jackman in San Francisco (according to the Post, &quot;Jackman took out a restraining order against Thurston after that, and Saturday&#x2019;s arrest is a violation of that order, sources said&quot;). Thurston told police, per the criminal complaint, &quot;I was at his daughter&#x2019;s school. I went to his gym this morning. I want to marry him. This is not against the law. <strong>It is not against the law to have two wives.</strong>... &#x201C;I was very impressed with &#x2018;X-Men 2,&#x2019; so I started e-mailing him.&quot; Thurston&apos;s 21-year-old daughter Kalianna spoke to the Post:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;The first time was last fall, I think. She got in trouble for hanging out outside of his apartment. They hospitalized her &#x2014; I do know that &#x2014; and then they sent her back here [to California],&#x201D; Kalianna said.<p></p>

<p>She said her mom denied that the reason she was going to New York &#x2014; most recently by bus &#x2014; was to search for Jackman.</p>

<p>&#x201C;About two months ago, my mom announced she was going back to New York. We got in a huge argument &#x2014; I said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re going back to stalk Hugh Jackman! &#x2018;And she looked me dead in the eye and said, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know that,&#x2019;&#x201D; Kalianna recalled.</p>

<p>&#x201C;My mother has a very high IQ and is very manipulative. But she is sick and she doesn&#x2019;t listen to the doctors. She can go from being completely lucid to totally crazy in seconds.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Jackman also told 1010 WINS, &quot;I suppose for me, the primary concern is my family, obviously,&quot;and his neighbors hope for the best for him, &quot;They are very nice, him and his wife. They&#x2019;re just really nice. I can&#x2019;t say enough.&#x201D;<p></p>
