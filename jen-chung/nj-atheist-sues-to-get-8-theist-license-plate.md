<p>A NJ woman who wants her car license plate to reflect her atheist beliefs is taking the state&apos;s Motor Vehicle Commission to court. Shannon Morgan, of Maurice River Township, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420200422/http://www.nj.com/cumberland/index.ssf/2014/04/new_jersey_woman_files_lawsuit_over_atheist_license_plate.html">claims that the MVC&apos;s website rejected her proposed</a> license plate combination, &quot;8THEIST&quot; as &quot;objectionable.&quot; </p>

<p>However, when Morgan typed in &quot;BAPTIST,&quot; that was totally cool. Morgan said, &quot;There is nothing offensive about being atheist. I should be able to express my sincerely held beliefs with a license plate just like everyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420200422/https://www.au.org/">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a> is representing Morgan in the First Amendment lawsuit. The DC-based group explains it is &quot;dedicated to preserving the constitutional principle of church-state separation as the only way to ensure religious freedom for all Americans.&quot;</p>

<p>The lawsuit claims that Morgan contacted the MVC about the license plate, but a NJ MVC spokesperson pointed out that an atheist-themed plate has been issued before. Last year, another NJ atheist, David Silverman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420200422/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/29/n-j-to-allow-athe1st-license-plate-after-worker-labeled-it-offensive/">fought to get a his &quot;ATHE1ST&quot; plate</a>. </p>

<p>The suit does refer to Silverman&apos;s struggle: &quot;&#x201C;he commission thus has a practice of denying personalized license plates that identify vehicle owners as atheists, thereby discriminating against atheist viewpoints and expressing a preference for theism over non-theism... Although the commission eventually relented and granted Mr. Silverman his requested license plate, it refuses to allow Ms. Morgan&#x2019;s requested plate.&quot;</p>
