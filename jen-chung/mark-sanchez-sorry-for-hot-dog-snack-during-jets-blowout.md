										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_sanchezhotd.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022193703im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_sanchezhotd.jpg" width="200" height="152" class="image-right"> </span>Just because you&apos;re the 22-year-old quarterback of the New York Jets and your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022193703/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/26/last_nights_action_40.php?gallery0Pic=4#gallery">team is dominating</a> the (terrible) Oakland Raiders, it doesn&apos;t mean you can eat a hot dog because you&apos;re HUNGRY! Mark Sanchez found out yesterday when he was caught sitting on the sidelines eating a hot dog during the fourth quarter. Critics said he was being disrespectful to the Raiders as well as his teammates who were out on the field playing.  So Sanchez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022193703/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/jets/hot_dog_jets_sanchez_rip_raiders_eCmcID08SAKKOsWcDsvk4M">addressed the matter</a> during the post-game press conference:</p><blockquote>&quot;I want to apologize for that. I wasn&apos;t feeling very good and didn&apos;t eat much before the game, so I was feeling a little queasy. Toward the end of the game, I probably should have eaten one of those bars or something, but someone offered (a hot dog), so I grabbed it and tried to be discreet about it, but obviously not discreet enough. So I shouldn&apos;t have done that, and it won&apos;t happen again.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>

<p>And here&apos;s his (tacit) admission that he likes mustard on hot dogs&#x2014;plus admitting it was stupid to eat during the game:</p>
