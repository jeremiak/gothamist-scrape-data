<p>As a hacker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124226/http://gawker.com/5051974/hacker-from-that-times-story-on-palin-emails-i-wish-theyd-done-it-properly">tells Gawker</a>,  &quot;Passwords should not be real words. they should include at least three digits and at least one non-alphanumeric character. Example: foo&amp;&amp;b;@x7978.&quot;  However, PCMagazine.com editor Lane Ulanoff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124226/http://wcbstv.com/consumer/e.mail.hacking.2.820768.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;In this case it didn&apos;t matter how strong the password was because they didn&apos;t need to know the password. They only had to know bits and pieces of info about you and then they could reset the password.  How hard is it if you&apos;re the governor of Alaska to find her birth date and zip code?&quot; </p>
