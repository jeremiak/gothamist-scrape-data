<p>Last night at around 6:30 p.m., some graffiti was found on the sidewalk outside a home in Sheepshead Bay. Someone spray painted on Avenue Z, &quot;Dumb Muslims Die.&quot;</p>

<p>The police confirmed they are investigating the matter. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509003411/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/181577/police-investigate-anti-muslim-graffiti-on-brooklyn-sidewalk">A resident told NY1</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve been here for 12 years, I&apos;ve never seen something like this. I mean I heard words here and there, you know, I hear the kids you know screaming and yelling and throwing words here and there but this is, this is nervewracking. It&apos;s an eye opener. If they have the nerve to do it in the bright daylight i can imagine what they can do in the dark.&quot;</p>

We won&#x2019;t stand for anti-Muslim bigotry - not in Sheepshead Bay, not in Brooklyn, not anywhere in our city.&quot;</p>
