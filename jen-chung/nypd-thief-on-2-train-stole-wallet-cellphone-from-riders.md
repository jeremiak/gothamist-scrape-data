<p>According to the NYPD, both incidents happened on a Manhattan-bound 2 train in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307223217/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_070.shtml">Brooklyn&apos;s 70th Precinct</a>, at around 3:30 a.m. on Thursday. Police say the first victim, a 27-year-old man, was sleeping when the thief filched his wallet. The sneak then snagged a Samsung cellphone from the pocket of a second victim, according to cops. That victim purportedly chased the pickpocket as the train stopped, but couldn&apos;t catch up to him.<br>
 <br>
The authorities describe the suspect as about  6-foot-2 and 160 pounds with brown eyes and black hair. He was last seen wearing a blue baseball hat, black sneakers, blue jeans and a blue waist-length jacket.<br>
 <em><br>
Police ask people with information about the incident to call the Crime Stoppers Hotline at (800) 577-TIPS, visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307223217/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">www.nypdcrimestoppers.com</a>, or text tips to 274637, then enter &quot;TIP577&quot;.</em></p>
