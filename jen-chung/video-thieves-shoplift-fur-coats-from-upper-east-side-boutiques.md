<p>Police searching for a pair of thieves who are stealing fur coats from Manhattan stores.</p>

<p>According to investigators, both incidents occurred last month on the Upper East Side, once at the Loro Piana Fur store at 748 Madison Avenue on November 8th at 3 p.m. and once at the J Mendel sable store at 787 Madison Avenue on November 13th at 5:40 p.m. From the NYPD&apos;s statement: </p><blockquote>In both cases, the suspects walk into the store and, while pretending to look at coats, the female suspect blocks the male suspect while he removes a coat form the rack and puts it under his jacket. The two suspects then flee the location.</blockquote>Police released footage of the suspects:<p></p>
