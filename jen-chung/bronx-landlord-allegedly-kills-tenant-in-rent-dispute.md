<p>A 44-year-old man was fatally stabbed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226023929/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Landlord-Stabbed-Tenant-to-Death-Over-Unpaid-Rent-NYPD-Family-414590123.html">reportedly in front of his 12-year-old son</a>, in the Bronx last night. Police have now arrested the victim&apos;s landlord.</p>

<p>The NYPD says that officers arrived at 1001 Logan Avenue around 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday night after receiving a 911 call about a stabbing. When they arrived they found Zakir Khan &quot;with multiple stab wounds to the torso unconscious and unresponsive.&quot; Khan was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>Khan&apos;s landlord, Taha Mahran, 51, &quot;walked into the 45th Precinct stationhouse, two blocks away, covered in blood, and investigators recovered a knife,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226023929/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/crazed-bronx-landlord-fatally-stabs-tenant-owed-rent-article-1.2979941">according to the Daily News</a>. He was later charged with murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226023929/http://nypost.com/2017/02/23/landlord-stabbed-to-death-by-angry-tenant-in-rent-dispute/">The NY Post reports</a> that &quot;neighbors said Khan was renting his $1,500-a-month apartment at 1001 Logan Ave. in hopes of buying it, but had apparently not paid the rent for as long as nine months.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226023929/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Landlord-Stabbed-Tenant-to-Death-Over-Unpaid-Rent-NYPD-Family-414590123.html">Police sources confirmed</a> that Khan had been telling Mahran that he would purchase the apartment. </p>

<p>A neighbor told the Post, &quot;[The landlord] was very stressed about not getting any rent and I guess he lost it. He felt like the tenant was playing games with him.&quot;</p>

<p>The News, which says Mahran was trying to evict Khan, has more details:</p><blockquote> Khan, who has deep ties to the Bronx Bangladeshi community, befriended Mahran and offered to help him rent the Logan Ave. apartment, but soon moved in himself with his family, without a lease, the source said.<p></p>

<p>The property is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226023929/http://www.parkchesterrealestate.com/listing/110144523-150206767/1001-logan-ave-bronx-ny-10465/">still listed on the web site</a> for Khan&#x2019;s firm, Parkchester Real Estate. Mahran bought the home in 2003.</p>

<p>Mahran was paying the utility bills, and whenever he called the police, Khan would call with complaints of his own, the source said. He spread garbage in front of the houses, and parked in front of the driveway to block the landlord in, the source said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He was basically gaming the system and the courts. This guy was basically the tenant from hell.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226023929/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Landlord-Stabbed-Tenant-to-Death-Over-Unpaid-Rent-NYPD-Family-414590123.html">A friend of Khan&apos;s said</a>, &quot;The landlord just came out, and from the car he pulled the gentleman who got killed, and he stabbed him multiple times. And within two hours, he was gone. It&apos;s shocking.&quot;<p></p>
