<p>Former WCBS 2 news anchor Rob Morrison had his 2013 criminal record&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620232418/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/19/cbs_2_anchor_rob_morrison_arrested.php">he was arrested for allegedly choking his wife</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620232418/http://www.ctpost.com/default/article/CBS-News-anchor-from-Darien-walks-with-no-5427803.php">vacated in April</a>, after he completed a family violence program and underwent &quot;psychological and substance evaluation and treatment&quot;. However, now he&apos;s been arrested again, this time for calling his now estranged wife over 120 times in three days.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620232418/http://blog.ctnews.com/stamford411/2014/06/17/former-new-york-news-anchor-rearrested/">Connecticut Post reports</a> that a &quot;physically shaking&quot; Jennifer Morrison went to Darien police on May 25 to say that Morrison had been violating a protective order:</p><blockquote>A subsequent search of Rob Morrison&#x2019;s cell phone records indicated that over the course of the Memorial Day weekend, he placed 121 calls to Ashley&#x2019;s cell phone and home phone. Most of the calls were made on May 25 when he allegedly called 109 times and &#x201C;would hang up and call right back for approximately 14 hours,&#x201D; police said.<p></p>

<p>Ashley Morrison told Darien police Sgt. Keri Isaac she was scared and &#x201C;she thinks Rob Morrison could kill her if she has him arrested.&#x201D; She said Rob Morrison told her that &#x201C;she will never get rid of him&#x201D; and she had fled to a friend&#x2019;s house with her son because she was afraid that he would show up at her home.</p>

<p>When Ashley Morrison was later informed that Darien police were pursuing her husband&#x2019;s arrest following an investigation, she allegedly &#x201C;became irate&#x201D; and told Isaac &#x201C;things are fine and she does not want to pursue any charges.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Ashley Morrison has an order of protection against her husband, but he&apos;s still allowed to see their nine-year-old son. Morrison told the court that he and his wife were discussing plans to move and they got into an argument about whether to discuss it in front of their son (who doesn&apos;t know about the moving plans). As for the calls, he was trying to get in touch with his son, &quot;We had long-term plans to go golfing the next day being broken. All he may be thinking is, &apos;Daddy&apos;s gone and he isn&apos;t coming back.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>Morrison was released on $50,000 bond; he and his wife had reconciled earlier, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620232418/http://pagesix.com/2014/06/18/ex-cbs-anchor-arrested-for-calling-his-wife-against-court-order/">reportedly separated again two months ago</a>.</p>
