</div></div>					<p>The Space Shuttle Enterprise <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528130202/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/03/photos_space_shuttle_enterprise_is.php#photo-1">made its trip</a> from JFK Airport to NJ yesterday.  But thanks to the annoying weather, its trip from NJ to its final home at the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528130202/http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/Shuttle/News/JUNE-5-JOURNEY-OF-SPACE-SHUTTLE-ENTERPRISE-TO-INTR.aspx">has been postponed to Wednesday</a> (June 6). And the Wednesday voyage will only happen if the weather is cooperative! </p>

<p>Many people watched the shuttle, which actually never went in space, travel on a barge along the shores of Queens and Brooklyn.  Of course, the journey was not without some bumps: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528130202/http://www.newyorkology.com/archives/2012/06/enterprise_1.php">Per NewYorkology</a>, a press release says, &quot;While approaching the Railroad Bridge, a sudden microburst of wind, measured at 35 knots, caused the rub panel foam protective layer of the wingtip of the Enterprise to graze the protective wood piling bumpers in the water designed to bumper vessels. The bridge was not involved. According to a spokesperson for the Intrepid, there was no damage to the bridge and light cosmetic damage to the protective layer.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Enterprise will remain in NJ until further notice. While the schedule for Wednesday&apos;s tentative travels hasn&apos;t been released, we imagine it&apos;ll be similar to what was planned for Tuesday : &quot;At 9:15 a.m., the barge and shuttle will leave Weeks Marine, passing the Statue of Liberty at 9:50 a.m.; the World Trade Center at 10:40 a.m.; and travel up the Hudson River, completing its journey at the Intrepid Museum at 11:30 a.m. where it will be lifted by crane onto the flight deck and put into position facing the Hudson River.&quot;</p>
