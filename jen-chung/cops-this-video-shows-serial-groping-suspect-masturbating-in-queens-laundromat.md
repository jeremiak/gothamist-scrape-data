The police are looking for a man who was caught on video masturbating at a laundromat in the North Corona section of Queens&#x2014;and they say he molested a woman there as well, before allegedly walking a few blocks to grope another woman while masturbating.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred yesterday, June 17, at 6:30 a.m.: &quot;[T]he male entered a laundromat, located at 37-57 108 Street, where he approached a 52 year-old female, touched her buttocks and masturbated. The victim moved away and the male fled the location. Approximately 10 minutes later, the male approached a 30 year-old female, in the vicinity of 111 Street and 39 Avenue, where he reached his arm under the victim&#x2019;s skirt and touched her buttocks while masturbating. The suspect then fled the location.&quot;</p>
