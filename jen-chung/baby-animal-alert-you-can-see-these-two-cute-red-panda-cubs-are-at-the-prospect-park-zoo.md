</div></div>					<p>Hoorah! Two baby red pandas born over the summer are now on view in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The Wildlife Conservation Society announced that the red panda cubs, one male and one female, &quot;have made their public debut&quot; at the Prospect Park Zoo and offered this description of the wee ones:</p><blockquote>Red panda cubs are born with a very soft, plush light brown coat that eventually becomes more coarse. They reach adulthood at around 18 months. Adult red pandas have reddish-brown and black coats. They have an adaptation on their wrists that acts much like a thumb and enables them to grasp food items like bamboo as well as tree branches.</blockquote>But really, JUST LOOK AT THEIR ADORABLE FUZZY FACES!<p></p>

<p>Further, the WCS notes its &quot;successful history breeding red pandas at the Bronx, Central Park, and Prospect Park Zoos as part of the Species Survival Plan, a cooperative breeding program administered by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums designed to enhance the genetic viability and demographic stability of animal populations in accredited zoos.&quot; Bonus facts: The Brooklyn red pandas are a subspecies from the eastern portion of the Himalayas, while the ones at the Bronx Zoo and Central Park zoo are a subspecies from the western part of their Himalayan range.  </p>
