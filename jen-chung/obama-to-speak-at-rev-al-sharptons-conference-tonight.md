</div></div><p>President Obama is going to be speaking at the Rev. Al Sharpton&apos;s National Action Network Conference at 6 p.m. (NY1 will have live coverage) in what will be a homecoming of sorts&#x2014;he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021615/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/22/obama_at_the_sh.php">appeared at the 2007 NAN Conference</a>, which is sometimes called the &quot;Sharpton primary&quot; because of its importance among Democratic candidates.  While the White House claims that this is not a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021615/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/04/barack_obama_officially_announces_h.php">reelection campaign appearance</a>, everyone basically knows it it.  Assemblyman Keith Wright (D-Harlem), who is the chair of the Manhattan Democratic Committee, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021615/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703712504576245200708462040.html">told the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;Anytime you run for re-election, the first places you go are your base and your foundation of support&#x2014;you try to make sure that&apos;s tight. If your base and foundation are not solid, there&apos;s a chance there could be some chinks in the armor.&quot;</p>

<p>Sharpton, who has become more mainstream though still somewhat controversial, has been called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021615/http://www.nj.com/opinion/times/oped/index.ssf?/base/news-1/1302068711309870.xml&amp;coll=5">&quot;the lightning rod in moving Obama&apos;s agenda forward&quot;</a> by Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree. Sharpton told the WSJhe believed Obama could count on support from African-Americans, &quot;Are there people that are concerned and want to see more? Yes. But [they] always are.&quot; Yet Nellie Bailey, an activist who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021615/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/obamas_harlem_visit_rankles_a_few.php">upset</a> about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021615/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/obama_meets_science_nerds_at_museum.php">Obama&apos;s visit to Harlem last week</a>, declared, &quot;The blinders are off. Black America is no longer willing to accept the president symbolically without any substantial platform and programs to address the crisis of rising homelessness and joblessness.&quot;</p>

<p>At a NAN conference panel this morning, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021615/http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/sharpton-opens-his-conference-politics?utm_medium=partial-text&amp;utm_campaign=home">discussion about the biggest issues in 2012</a>; jobs, immigration, economy were all mentioned and Kirsten Foy, who works for the Public Advocate&apos;s office, said the 2012 election is about &quot;stopping our ability to organize forever, in this country...it&apos;s about attacking all people of color in this country forever... it&apos;s us versus them, rich versus poor.&quot; </p>
