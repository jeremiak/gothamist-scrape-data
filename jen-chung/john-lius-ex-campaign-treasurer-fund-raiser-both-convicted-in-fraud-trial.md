	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2012_02_jennyhou.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_jennyhou.jpg" width="300" height="400"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Jenny Hou (Facebook)</i></div> A jury found the 26-year-old former campaign treasurer for City Comptroller John Liu&apos;s mayoral campaign, as well as a one of Liu&apos;s fundraisers, guilty of today. <p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/nyregion/former-liu-associates-convicted-in-fund-raising-case.html?_r=1&amp;">NY Times reports</a> that Xing Wu Pan &quot;was found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and attempted wire fraud,&quot; while Jia &quot;Jenny&quot; Hou &quot;was acquitted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, but was convicted of lying to federal agents and failing to fully respond to a grand jury subpoena that sought e-mails and other documents in what prosecutors said was an effort to cover-up her role in the scheme.&quot;</p>

<p>Donations to candidates from individuals are limited to $4,950 each. Pan was charged with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/feds_arrest_lius_mayoral_campaign_t.php">trying to mask large donations</a> by way of enlisting people to pose as donors. Hou was also accused of trying to hide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/feds_arrest_lius_mayoral_campaign_t.php">larger donations</a> and an ex-boyfriend testified saying she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650/http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/17/houpancourt_all_2013_04_26_q.html">offered to reimburse him $500</a>.</p>

<p>An undercover FBI agent, who posed as the donor of $16,000 to Liu&apos;s campaign, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/john-liu-caught-tape-toasting-undercover-agent-made-illegal-contributions-mayoral-campaign-article-1.1324790">testified and had video</a> of Liu thanking him for his donation. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/guilty_verdicts_for_former_associates_WU1nOx9i9JP8swscHEosdP">U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said</a>, &quot;As the jury found, Jia Hou and Oliver Pan stuck a knife into the heart of New York City&apos;s campaign finance law by violating the prohibition against illegal campaign contributions, all to corruptly advantage the campaign of a candidate for city-wide office.&quot; The pair&apos;s lawyers still insist their innocence.</p>

<p>Liu himself has not been charged with any wrongdoing. A few months ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035650/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/nyregion/liu-calls-for-end-to-us-investigation-of-his-fund-raising.html">he had a strong statement</a> for federal prosecutors during a mayoral forum, &quot;Three years of investigating. They wiretapped my phones for 18 months. They reviewed a million documents and messages. They interrogated thousands of my supporters. And yet, what do they have to show for it? It&#x2019;s time to put up or shut up already. Because I have an election to win!&#x201D;</p>
