Madoff (pictured, with his Park Avenue apartment building at right) was arrested after he admitted to employees (including his sons) that his successful investment firm was a &quot;big lie&quot; that he had used investments from clients to pay returns to earlier clients.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927061416/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/sports/baseball/14wilpon.html?scp=6&amp;sq=bernard%20madoff&amp;st=cse">NY Times reports</a> that Mets owner and real estate investor Fred Wilpon, through his firm, &quot;entrusted Madoff with hundreds of millions of dollars to invest... <strong>Although it is unclear how much money Wilpon may recoup, any significant financial loss by a team owner raises questions about how those losses may affect the franchise</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>On the other hand, there&apos;s retired carpet salesman Arnold Sinkin, who, with his wife Joan, saved their money and had invested with Madoff.  The couple, in their 70s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927061416/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/12/14/2008-12-14_arnold_and_joan_sinkin_open_up_about_bei.html">told the Daily News</a> they lost 85% of their life savings; Joan Sinkin said, &quot;<strong>Nobody in our lives gave us anything. We worked hard for every penny that we had.</strong>&quot;  Another victim, Joyce Greenberg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927061416/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12142008/news/nationalnews/victim__he_showed_us_the_money_144061.htm">told the Post</a> that she received official-looking statements from Madoff detailing stock transactions, &quot;The point with him was that I always got every document.<strong> If you get all the documents, you are not suspicious.</strong>&quot;</p>
