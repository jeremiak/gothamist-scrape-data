The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145106/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04112009/news/regionalnews/jealous_ex_cops_gun_rage_163982.htm">NY Post reports</a> that Cecil Ramsay, 51, confronted wife Dady Belfort, 47, and Edwin Chittick, 40, when the pair arrived at Belfort and Ramsay&apos;s home in North Babylon, Long Island.  According to Suffolk County police, the pair denied an affair and Chittick said, &quot;I&apos;m not here to have an argument with you. I&apos;m leaving.&quot; Belfort and Chittick fled in her car; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145106/http://www.newsday.com/news/printedition/longisland/ny-licops1212644212apr11,0,7687381.story">from Newsday,</a> &quot;Ramsay fired at least three times at the moving vehicle. One of the bullets hit Chittick&apos;s hand. Neither Chittick nor Belfort returned fire.&quot;  Ramsay then shot himself; Belfort reportedly didn&apos;t realize her husband turned the gun on himself and kept driving to take Chittck to the hospital.  The altercation and shooting was apparently witnessed by a construction crew.  </p>
