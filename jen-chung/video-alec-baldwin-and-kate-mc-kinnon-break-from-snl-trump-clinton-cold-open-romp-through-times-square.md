At the end of the cold open featuring Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump and Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton, Baldwin stopped himself mid-Trump rant, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this. I just feel gross all the time.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This whole election has been so mean,&quot; McKinnon said, before the pair ran out of 30 Rock and headed to Times Square as Arcade Fire&apos;s &quot;Wake Up&quot; blasted around them.</p>

<p>During the sketch, Trump&apos;s apparently close relationships with the FBI, Vladimir Putin and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041946/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/02/kkk_trump_great_just_great.php">well, racists</a>, were shown, but CNN&apos;s Erin Burnett, played by Cecily Strong, was uninterested. Instead, she focused on Clinton&apos;s email problems, prompting Baldwin-as-Trump to say, &quot;That&apos;s why I never ever use email. It&apos;s too risky. Instead, I used a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever that want to and no one will read it. It&apos;s called Twitter.&quot;</p>

<p>When told that everyone can read his Tweets, he replied, &quot;Really? And I&apos;m still in this thing? America, you must really hate this lady!&quot;</p>

<p>In Times Square, Baldwin and McKinnon approached random people and embraced them&#x2014;this included a moment where &quot;Clinton&quot; reluctantly hugs a man in a &quot;Trump That Bitch&quot; shirt. They also passed out balloons, ate street cart pretzels and formed a circle to dance. </p>

<p>Back in Studio 8H, Baldwin told the audience, &quot;It&apos;s time to get out there and vote. None of this would have mattered if you don&apos;t vote.&quot; McKinnon added, &quot;We can&apos;t tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in.&quot;</p>

<p>Two days.</p>
