About two-thirds of the 59 high-poverty schools in the Sparks program -- which pays seventh-graders up to $500 and fourth-graders as much as $250 for their performance on a total of 10 assessments -- improved their scores since last year&apos;s state tests by margins above the citywide average.&quot; It&apos;s part of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142653/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/19/details_on_nycs.php">cash incentives-for-the-poor program</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142653/http://opportunitynyc.org/">OpportunityNYC</a>.
