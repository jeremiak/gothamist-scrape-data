<p>However, others have felt Dustin Hoffman would be better suited to play the secretive fraudster, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014104/http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20110414/casting-the-bernie-madoff-movie">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014104/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr8fuR-RL7Y">Marketwatch&apos;s Jon Friedman</a> (Hoffman does have that nebbishy quality).  As for others in the movie, what about Jessica Walter or Tovah Feldshuh as Ruth Madoff?  Maybe Greg Kinnear as Mark Madoff and, as suggested in Bloomberg Businessweek, Patrick Wilson as Andrew Madoff?  And celebrity victims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014104/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/11/kyra_sedgwick_madoff_didnt_wipe_us.php">Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014104/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/02/malkovich_mad_over_madoff_investmen.php">John Malkovich</a> can play themselves!</p>
