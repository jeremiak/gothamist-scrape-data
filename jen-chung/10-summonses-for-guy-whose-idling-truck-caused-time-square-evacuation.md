<p>The truck driver whose idling vehicle&#x2014;with exposed wires and gas canisters in plain view&#x2014;prompted a sudden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904051337/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/03/nypd_evacuates_times_square_over_su.php">evacuation of Times Square on Saturday night</a> was officially hit with multiple summonses. </p>

<p>Just before 8 p.m., members of the NYPD&#x2019;s Critical Response Command noticed an idling Chevrolet 3500 truck on West 46th Street, near the Marriott Marquis. Police said officers discovered that the address on the side of the truck was in Brooklyn but the vehicle was registered in Georgia, and then: &quot;When the officers looked into the cabin portion of the truck, they observed wires extending out from the dash board towards the rear of the truck and gas canisters behind the seat.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD Bomb Squad and Emergency Services Unit gave the all clear by 9 p.m. when they found the canisters empty. But that&apos;s not before Times Square was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904051337/https://twitter.com/CeFaanKim/status/716422865445371904">evacuated for a few blocks</a>. Some businesses shut down and theatergoers were delayed in getting to their shows.</p>

<p>The driver, Ryan Frasier, was located and taken into questioning. He was given 10 traffic summons, and the Post reports, &quot;They were for violations that ranged from a lack of brake lights and proper inspection to having no fire extinguisher or warning devices.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904051337/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/man-caused-times-square-evacuation-10-summonses-article-1.2586914?utm_content=buffere6e97&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">The Daily News adds</a> another was for &quot;failing to register the truck. He is due back in court on June 3.&quot; <br>
