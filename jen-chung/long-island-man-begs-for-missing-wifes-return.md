Her purse was on the road.</p>

<p>Walsh had been on her way to work in Glen Cove, teaching autistic children.  When she didn&apos;t arrive at the school, the school called her family, who then called the police.  Her husband William Walsh said to reporters, as he gave them copies of her picture outside his in-laws&apos; house, &quot;Please get the picture out. We just want her back. You can have my cars. You can have everything. I just want my wife back.&quot;</p>

<p>Newsday adds that William Walsh, who apparently received a text from his wife early in the morning but didn&apos;t know where she was, is cooperating with the police.

She was in the car with him texting to me so that was Sunday night and they were in a huge fight.&quot;</p>

<p>Police are asking people with any information to call 800-244-TIPS.</p>
