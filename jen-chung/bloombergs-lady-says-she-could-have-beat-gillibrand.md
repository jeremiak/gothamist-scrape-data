<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:220px; "> <img alt="2010_07_dtaylor.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180357im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_dtaylor.jpg" width="220" height="202"> <br> <i>Prince Philip, Diana Taylor and Mayor Bloomberg (NYC Mayor&apos;s Office)</i></div> Diana Taylor is best known to New Yorkers as Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s girlfriend, but she&apos;s raising her public profile as a political contender. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180357/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/04/bloombergs_girlfriend_did_consider.php">recently confirmed</a> that, yes, she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180357/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/mayors-companion-wanted-to-run-for-senate/">considering running against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand</a> this fall, but decided not to, because &quot;My significant other is the mayor of New York City, so that would be really complicated.&quot;  And now, she tells NBC New York, &quot;I think I could have&quot; won over Gillibrand.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180357/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/07/the-diana-taylor-rollout-conti.html">Taylor admited</a> (video after the jump), &quot;I think it would have been a very difficult race. It would have been a lot of work, which I&apos;m not afraid of.&quot; Taylor, the former state banking superintendent under Governor George Pataki, now serves on over a dozen boards plus works at a private equity firm. Noting how critics would have accused her of a pro-NYC bias, she said she could see a &quot;cartoon Chuck Schumer with a Kirsten Gillibrand puppet and Mike Bloomberg with a Diana Taylor puppet&#x2014;you could see that in the Post!&quot; though &quot;it would not have been fair for me. I don&apos;t know about Kirsten but it would not have been fair for me.&quot;</p>

<p>Taylor says of Gillibrand, &quot;I don&apos;t know what she really believes in,&quot; and seems to be considering a possible 2012 challenge,  &quot;I&apos;m not old.&quot;  Currently, Taylor&apos;s political work these days is supporting candidates like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180357/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/07/AR2010070705333.html">Reshma Saujani</a> in her primary challenge against Rep. Carolyn Maloney, or Republican Senate hopeful<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180357/http://www.politico.com/blogs/maggiehaberman/0610/Diana_Taylor_for_Malpass_.html"> David Malpass</a>.  She doesn&apos;t want to be mayor of NYC...though, &quot;I&apos;m not gonna rule anything out. Never say never.&quot;  </p>
