<p>According to the NYPD, at around 7:40 a.m. yesterday, the girl was walking along 81st Street in Jackson Heights, &quot;when an unknown male Hispanic, who was walking on the opposite side of the street saw the victim and motioned for her to come to him. Ignoring the suspect the victim continued walking on 81 Street and that&apos;s when the suspect crossed the street.  The suspect continued to follow her and reached his hand out to her.
