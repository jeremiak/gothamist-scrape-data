Builder John Galarza said, &quot;They did $16,000 [of damage] to collect a thousand to 12 hundred (dollars),&quot; and offered a $5,000 reward.  Another house was robbed of its copper (its builder suspects the thief knows &quot;plumbing, because they did a clean job of taking it off&quot;), and Galarza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003712/http://www.silive.com/siadvance/stories/index.ssf?/base/news/1219317308183830.xml&amp;coll=1">raised the reward to $10,000</a>.  Copper thefts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003712/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/21/copper.php">aren&apos;t new</a>--the Greenpoint Warehouse Terminal fire was allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003712/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/08/desperate_quest.php">started by a homeless copper thief</a>--but now construction sites are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003712/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/28/garden/28theft.html?ref=garden">being targeted more often</a>. A third S.I. builder whose sites have been plundered said, &quot;I wish [thieves] had touched one of the valves when it had 350 pounds of pressure on it. That would&apos;ve been a nice little surprise.&quot;</p>
