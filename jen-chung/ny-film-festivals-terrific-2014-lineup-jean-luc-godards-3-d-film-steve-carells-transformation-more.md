</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://www.filmlinc.com/nyff2014/blog/new-york-film-festival-2014-main-slate-lineup">New York Film Festival&apos;s 52nd main slate is set</a>&#x2014;and it is pretty great. In addition to previously announced Opening Night, Centerpiece and Closing Night films&#x2014;David Fincher&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/gone_girl_will_open_the_nyff_this_y.php"><em>Gone Girl</em></a>, Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/19/paul_thomas_andersons_inherent_vice.php"><em>Inherent Vice</em></a> and Alejandro I&#xF1;&#xE1;rritu&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/21/alejandro_g_inarritus_birdman_with.php"><em>Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance</em></a> respectively&#x2014;there will be a number North American and U.S. premieres, like Bennett Miller&apos;s lauded <em>Foxcatcher</em> with Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo and <em>Maps to the Stars</em> from David Cronenberg. And there is Jean Luc Godard.</p>

<p>The festival, which runs September 26 through October 12, picks and chooses from numerous festivals and submissions to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/kent_jones.php">bring the world&apos;s best movies to New York</a>. Godard&apos;s <em>Goodbye to Language</em> made a splash earlier this year at Cannes, and will have its New York premiere at the NYFF. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/movies/godards-goodbye-to-language-enlivens-cannes.html?_r=0">NY Times&apos; Manohla Dhargis said</a> it was a &quot;thrilling cinematic experience&quot; and &quot;is, like much of the director&#x2019;s work, deeply, excitingly challenging. The thickly layered movie offers up generous, easy pleasures with jolts of visual beauty, bursts of humor, swells of song and many shots of a dog, Roxy, but it will provide other satisfactions with repeat viewings.&quot; </p>

<p>Here are some other films we&apos;re excited for:</p>

<p>- Another film festival favorite, but from a new filmmaker, is <em>Whiplash</em>. Damien Chazelle turned his short film into a feature length film about a Juilliard student (Miles Teller) and his demanding teacher, played by J.K. Simmons. It won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at Sundance.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20161016210608if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/9AXzPN8slsk?list=PLdLHQX1t7hV1NE29CfYenI0eWGhzw0LGr" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>- Steve Carell sheds his comedic chops to play John E. du Pont in <em>Foxcatcher</em>, Bennett Miller&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20102757,00.html">telling of the billionaire&apos;s fatal dream</a> to build a national wrestling team. Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum play brothers who are keys to du Pont&apos;s vision, as well as his downfall. </p>

<p>- Kristen Stewart gets to subvert her celebrity somewhat as the assistant to a famous actress in Olivier Assayas&apos;s <em>Clouds of Sils Maria </em>. Juliette Binoche is the actress who becomes unnerved by her younger co-star, Chlo&#xEB; Grace Moretz.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20161016210608if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/CYBgifQOaVA?list=UUOzFilLNcgrGzAeECAbUFCQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>- The Dardenne brothers take on worker solidarity in <em>Two Days, One Night</em>. Marion Cotillard plays an employee who fights for her job, after her company tells everyone they&apos;ll get a bonus if she&apos;s laid off.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20161016210608if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/Sm4eetAl6g0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>- David Cronenberg turns to Hollywood for a satire about the industry with <em>Maps to the Stars</em>. Julianne Moore plays an aging actress whose assistant (Mia Wasikowska) was just released from a psychiatric asylum (others in the assistant&apos;s family are John Cusack as her TV psychologist dad, Olivia Williams as an overbearing mother).</p>

<p>- Richard Gere in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/oren-moverman-to-direct-time-out-of-mind-starring-richard-gere-20140129">Oren Moverman&apos;s <em>Time Out Of Mind</em></a>. This is the film where Gere plays a homeless man&#x2014;so convincing that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://www.today.com/entertainment/tourist-gives-homeless-richard-gere-her-leftover-pizza-2D79591395">a New Yorker gave him her pizza</a>.</p>

<p>- The South Korean film <em>Hill of Freedom</em> by Hong Sang-soo involves two would-be lovers and a packet of letters. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20161016210608if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/EVfxymMqN8g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>- <em>Listen Up Philip</em> is Alex Ross Perry&apos;s film about a literary star (Jason Schwartzman) on the eve of the publication of his new novel. His girlfriend (Elisabeth Moss) takes the brunt of his narcissism. IndieWire, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210608/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/sundance-review-listen-up-philip-starring-jason-schwartzman-elisabeth-moss-jonathan-pryce-20140122">which calls it one of the best films of the year, says</a>, &quot;A deeply misanthropic portrait of narcissism, the brittle nature of artistic talent and the struggles of living in New York City, this toxic comedy pulls very few punches when it needs to get really nasty.&quot;</p>
