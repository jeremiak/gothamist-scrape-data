</div></div>					<p>A tipster in Queens sent us this photograph of what she believes to be the newest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231055907/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> piece. Heidi Trenholm said this morning that the stencil is in Woodside, <strong>at 69th Street and 38th Avenue</strong>, &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure I saw him leaving and it still smells like fresh paint.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked to describe the artist, she said, &quot;I saw a man wearing construction gear loading something into a rental truck as I was walking to the train, which I thought was a little odd because there wasn&apos;t any construction going on there. I looked at the wall and immediately recognized it, so I looked at the driver and <strong>he was a middle aged white man wearing glasses</strong>. He smiled and nodded and drove away pretty quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s own Jake Dobkin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231055907/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/ask_a_native_new_yorker_has_nyc_gra.php">Native New Yorker and street art documentarian</a>, declares, &quot;It&apos;s definitely a Banksy; you can recognize it from three things: The hand-style on the quote, the quality of the stencil, and the presence of the blue tarp. Also it&apos;s got that certain stupid Banksy <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. Like it&apos;s a joke about graffiti. He loves meta.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone: <strong><em>BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR BIG BLUE TARPS</em></strong>. Because that&apos;s more of a giveaway than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231055907/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/13/video_banksy_set_up_a_pop_up_booth.php">stealth street vendor pop-ups in Central Park</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231055907/http://www.wayiseethings.com/">Photographer Nic Garcia</a> is there and says the blue tarp is gone. No one was there at 69th Street and 39th Avenue initially and then four people showed up. Also, he thinks, &quot;It&apos;s gotta be&quot; Banksy. Plus, the &quot;The letters are oil stick and still wet!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update 2</b>: Banksy confirmed the piece. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231055907/http://www.banksy.co.uk/2013/10/14/queens">On his website, he wrote</a>, &quot;Some people criticize me for using sources that are a bit low brow (this quote is from &apos;Gladiator&apos;) but you know what? &apos;I&apos;m just going to use that hostility to make me stronger, not weaker&apos; as Kelly Rowland said on the X Factor.&quot;</p>
