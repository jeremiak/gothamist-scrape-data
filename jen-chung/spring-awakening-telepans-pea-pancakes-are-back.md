<p>Upper West Side restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904053501/http://telepan-ny.com/">Telepan</a> has brought back its wonderful seasonal dish of pea pancakes. And they&apos;ll only be on the menu for about a month.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a celebration of peas: Two pea pancakes are served on pea puree and spinach, and then atop the pancakes are saut&#xE9;ed peas (English, sugar snap and shell) and mushrooms. On the side are pea agnolotti with mascarpone cheese inside. </p>

<p>The savory pancakes are light and bursting with pea flavor, and the peas and mushrooms are hearty but not heavy. Overall, it&apos;s a filling and delicious ode to spring. A server said last night that the dish should be on the menu into May, but it all depends on what the farmers have.</p>

<p>Chef Bill Telepan has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904053501/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bringing-out-the-best-in-spring-peas/">shared his recipe</a> for the pancakes, even demonstrating from his kitchen:</p>
