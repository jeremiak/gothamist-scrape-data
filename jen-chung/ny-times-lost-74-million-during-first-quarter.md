The Times reports this &quot;compare[s] with a loss of $335,000 in the period a year ago, as it joined the roster of newspaper companies recording the steepest advertising declines in generations.&quot; Advertising revenue dropped 28% (including online advertising drop of 8%), but the &quot;worst drop, 31.4%, hit the New England Media Group, which consists primarily of The Boston Globe and its site, Boston.com. The company has told unions at The Globe that the paper is on track to lose $85 million this year, and that unless deep cuts are made, the paper will be sold or closed.&quot;  The fate of the Boston Globe has prompted Senate John Kerry (D-Mass) to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083124/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/apr/21/john-kerry-senate-us-newspapers">hold Senate hearings</a> about the newspaper industry next month. <b>Update</b>: Henry Blodget thinks the Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083124/http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-new-york-times-cash-situation-still-a-crisis-2009-4">will run out of cash in 12 months</a>.  <span class="photo_caption">Photo: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083124/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2259318046/">wallyg on Flickr</a></span></p>
