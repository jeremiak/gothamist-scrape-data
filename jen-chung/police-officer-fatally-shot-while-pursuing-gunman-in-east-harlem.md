<p>A police officer died last night after being shot in the head by a robbery suspect in Manhattan. Speaking to the press at Harlem Hospital, police Commissioner Bill Bratton said, &quot;Tonight, I regret to inform you that New York City Police Officer Randolph Holder, 33 years of age, Badge Number 13340, a five-year veteran of the New York City Police Department, was killed in the line of duty - murdered. He was pronounced dead at 10:22 this evening in this hospital. He is the fourth New York City police officer murdered in this city in the last 11 months.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2015_10_randolphholder.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326181430im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_randolphholder.jpg" width="275" height="376"> <br> <i style=" width:275px; ;display:block"> Police Officer Randolph Holder</i></div> The suspect, who was wounded by gunfire from others officers, is in custody while being treated at a hospital.<p></p>

<p>Bratton explained that Holder and other officers were responding to a report of gunshots fired near East 102nd Street and First Avenue at around 8:30 p.m.:</p><blockquote>Witnesses reported that several males had fled along the footpath heading north on the FDR Drive. That&#x2019;s the footpath adjacent to the river. Responding officers were informed by a male victim that his bike had been stolen at gunpoint by one of the individuals, the suspects.<p></p>

<p>Officers from the Housing Bureau Ant-Crime Unit in plainclothes encountered a male on a bicycle northbound at East 120th Street along the FDR Drive&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a pedestrian overpass over the FDR Drive.</p>

<p>There was an exchange of gunfire between the male suspect and the two officers. During this exchange, Officer Holder was struck in the head.</p>

<p>The suspect continued to run north along the FDR Drive promenade on foot. He was apprehended at 124th Street by responding officers. He had suffered gunshot wounds to his leg. He was taken into custody and transported to Cornell Medical Center, where I understand he will be released later this morning and certainly taken into custody by us.</p>

<p>Three other males were taken into custody in the vicinity of East 111th Street and the FDR Drive. They are being questioned now as to their possible participation in the events of this evening.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326181430/http://nypost.com/2015/10/20/nypd-cop-shot-in-east-harlem/">A witness told the Post</a>, &quot;I heard so many gunshots. It sounded like there was a shootout outside my building. It&#x2019;s really scary.&quot;<p></p>

All of a sudden there were shots, you could hear the shells kick back as they hit the cement. I had my whole family on the floor. I thought they were going to shoot outside of my window. There was a gun on the sidewalk outside my building.&quot;</p>

<p>Part of the FDR Drive remains closed for the investigation:</p>

<p>Holder was an immigrant from Guyana and joined the NYPD in 2010. Bratton said, &quot;His father was a police officer in Guyana, and his grandfather was also a police officer in Guyana. So three generations of police in this family, and now the latest generation served here with us in the New York City Police Department, and tonight did what every other officer in the NYPD does when the call comes&#x2014;he ran toward danger. It was the last time he will respond to that call.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio said, &quot;We&#x2019;re all in mourning tonight. This whole city is in mourning. We&#x2019;re mourning a man who gave his life as a guardian for all of us. And we&#x2019;re humbled by Officer Randolph Holder&#x2019;s example&#x2014;an example of service and courage and sacrifice. Our hearts are heavy, and we offer our thoughts and our prayers to his family, who are experiencing unimaginable pain, as we saw earlier when we gathered with them. Our thoughts and prayers are also with his fellow officers from PSA 5 and his larger NYPD family.&quot;</p>

<p>A number of elected officials were present at the press conference, including City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, and Public Advocate Tish James, as well as Patrolman&apos;s Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch. He said, &quot;I just had the unfortunate responsibility to tell a father his son is not coming home today. A father that understands what it is to wear a uniform&#x2014;and he knows what it means. That emptiness will never go away for him. New York City police officers, every day, go out and carry themselves like superheroes on the street. But the reality is, when we&#x2019;re attacked we bleed, when we bleed we die, and when we die we cry.&quot;</p>

<p>Lynch pleaded, &quot;We need your support. We need your support. These police officers need your support as we bury our brother police officer. But it can&#x2019;t end there. We need your support every day, on every corner, in every neighborhood, so we can continue to carry ourselves like superheroes. So we can save you and protect you.&quot;</p>

He was a very disciplined, fun-loving, caring young man, always with a smile on his face... He was well loved by his fellow officer. I&#x2019;m feeling sad for my son.&quot;</p>
