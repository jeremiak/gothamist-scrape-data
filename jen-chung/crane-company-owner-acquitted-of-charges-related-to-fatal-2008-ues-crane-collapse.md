<p>Nearly four years ago, a crane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/30/breaking_manhat.php#photo-12">collapsed at the corner of First Avenue and East 91st Street</a>, killing two construction workers.  The crane company owner James Lomma was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/06/crane_company_to_face_manslaughter.php">indicted for manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide</a>, among other charges.  Now, Lomma is walking free&#x2014;Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Daniel Conviser acquitted him of the charges.</p>

<p>Crane operator Donald Leo Jr. was killed when the crane&apos;s cab <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/judge-clears-crane-magnate-joseph-lomma-manslaughter-deaths-article-1.1067912">fell 200 feet to the ground</a> while Ramadan Kurtaj, who was at street level, was crushed by debris.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/nyregion/james-lomma-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-crane-collapse.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">NY Times reports</a> that Lomma&apos;s defense &quot;had contended that the collapse was not the result of shoddy welding by the Chinese company. Rather, it happened because of a heavy load hoisted by the crane&#x2019;s operator. That load caused the crane&#x2019;s line to snap and sent the crane into imbalance.&quot; </p>

<p>Prosecutors had argued that Lomma&apos;s companies, which were also acquitted, agreed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/03/crane_company_d.php">use the damaged piece of equipment</a>.  And one of Lomma&apos;s employees wasn&apos;t good at math and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/nyregion/before-crane-fell-worker-couldnt-measure-key-part.html">couldn&apos;t measure a critical part</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://manhattanda.org/press-release/statement-manhattan-district-attorney-cyrus-r-vance-jr-91st-street-crane-collapse-tria">Manhattan DA Cy Vance issued a statement saying</a>, &quot;Although we are disappointed with the judge&#x2019;s verdict, each case we have brought in this area has put increased scrutiny on the construction industry as a whole, and has had a cascading effect on safety practices.&quot; And Leo&apos;s grieving mother said, &quot;I am in shock. How did this happen. How did this judge come to this conclusion on every single count? It&apos;s disgraceful... My son is not back today and I miss him. He died and more people will continue to die because of this judge. He failed every single crane operator today.&quot;</p>

<p>This crane collapse happened less than two months after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150647/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/15/midtown_crane_c.php">another crane fell in Manhattan, killing seven people</a>.</p>
