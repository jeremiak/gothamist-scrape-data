So is the New York Stock Exchange.  But given these times, was it appropriate for Grandma the Clown to ring the opening bell?  (Video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083451/http://www.nyse.com/events/1226489149067.html">here</a>.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083451/http://dealbreaker.com/2008/11/caption-contest-friday-wall-st.php">Dealbreaker says yes</a>, &quot;<strong>Granted, it probably would&apos;ve been more fitting for a manufacturer of ball gags and executioner&apos;s masks to ring the bell, but this works, too.</strong>&quot;  In other news, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083451/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122661650122026201.html">Wall Street Journal report</a>s, &quot;Citigroup is handing out pink slips to at least 10,000 employees&quot; in another round of layoffs--plus raise interest rates on credit cards.  T.G.I.F.!</p>
