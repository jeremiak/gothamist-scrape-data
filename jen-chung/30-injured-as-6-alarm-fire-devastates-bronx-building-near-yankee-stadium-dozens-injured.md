<p>Just after midnight, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150902/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Bronx-Fire-Six-Alarm-Firefighters-Hurt-162840546.html">FDNY responded to a fire</a> at a landmark Bronx apartment building near Yankee Stadium.  The fire at 975 Walton Avenue was initially a two-alarm fire but grew to six alarms right before 4 a.m. The FDNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150902/https://twitter.com/FDNY/status/225500058743865344">had it under control by then</a>, too, with 200 firefighters responding.  Twenty-eight firefighters in total were injured, as were two civilians.  None of the injuries were considered serious.</p>

<p>The fire was in the fifth and sixth floors as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150902/http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-158/issue-8/departments/the-ol-professor/cockloft-vs-attic.html">cockloft</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150902/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/07/18/dozens-injured-in-six-alarm-bronx-blaze-near-yankee-stadium/">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The location of the flames inside and the brutal heat outside was a serious challenge.&quot;  Fire chief Edward Kilduff explained, &quot;By the time we stretch lines up to the sixth floor rear of this building, we probably stretched 200 feet of hoseline. That in itself is an exhaustive task. Then to move in and start putting out the fire just compounds the challenge.&quot; A wall also partially collapsed.

<p>The Gronenberg &amp; Leuchtag-designed building, which was completed in 1930 and named in the Grand Concourse historic district last year, has about 185 apartments. About a third of the residents&apos; apartments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150902/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8740118">were &quot;permanently damaged&quot;</a> with other units suffering lesser damage.</p>
