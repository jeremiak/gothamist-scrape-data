                            <p>Art and commerce are now communing in nature: The Zaha Hadid-designed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044725/http://www.chanel-mobileart.com/">Chanel Mobile Art</a> is now open in Central Park.  Situated in Rumsey Playfield, the 7,500-square foot orb is filled with art inspired by elements of the famous quilted Chanel bag and visitors can also listen to an audio guide, narrated by Jeanne Moreau (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044725/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/arts/design/24zaha.html">NY Times described</a> the audio as &quot;discussing everything from sex and love to the secrets at the bottom of a woman&#x2019;s handbag&quot;).  Chanel, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044725/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/25/chanel_brings_giant_adart_to_rumsey.php?gallery8137Pic=2">previously displayed the orb</a> in other cities around the world, donated a low seven-figure sum to Central Park, plus will pay a $400,000 use fee to the city.</p>

<p>The exhibit is free and open seven days a week:  Monday-Thursday, 8:30 a.m.-6:00 p.m. (last admission is 5:15 p.m.); Friday-Saturday, 8:30 a.m.-9:00 p.m. (last admission is 8:15 p.m.); and Sunday, 8:30 a.m.-8:00 p.m. (last admission is 7:15 p.m.).  Tickets are available at the box office, which opens 30 minutes before the opening (and closes at the time of last admission), in Rumsey Playfield.  The exhibit will run through November 9.  </p>
