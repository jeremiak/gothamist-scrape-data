<p>Yesterday morning around 9 a.m., a fire swept through a three-story brownstone in Bedford Stuyvesant, injuring 12 residents (including five who had more critical injuries). Now a corrections officer has been arrested setting the blaze.</p>

<p>Yvette Randolph, 43, was charged with second-degree arson for the blaze that required over 100 firefighters to control. Apparently Randolph&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901221924/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/30/correction-officer-arrested-in-brooklyn-brownstone-fire-that-injured-12/">ex-boyfriend had once lived in the building</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901221924/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130829/bed-stuy/fire-erupts-bed-stuy-apartment-row-house-fdny-says">According to DNAinfo</a>, &quot;Witnesses said they saw a suspicious person lurking near the building before the fire who had been at the building several times over the past month looking for a man who no longer lived there.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed the fire was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901221924/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/nyregion/brooklyn-fire-injures-11.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">set with gasoline</a> in the hall, possibly to trap residents. A witness said he saw Randolph <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901221924/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/30/correction-officer-arrested-in-brooklyn-brownstone-fire-that-injured-12/">walking out of the building in her Corrections uniform</a>, &quot;How could you come out of a house like that and you&#x2019;re just walking around calm? I thought she was a security guard to be honest, that&#x2019;s what really caught my eye because it looked like she was dressed for work coming out of an apartment building that was on fire.&quot;</p>

<p>Another witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901221924/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/arson_nightmare_KY0t9Ta1GxbtKW7Yr4mCpI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">told the Post</a>, &quot;I watched the firefighters resuscitating people right there on the ground. They were putting their own lives in jeopardy... [Firefighters] were even trying to save the animals&quot;&#x2014;a cat required oxygen and is expected to survive&#x2014;&quot;They were just running in there to save lives. You need a lot more people like that.&quot; </p>
