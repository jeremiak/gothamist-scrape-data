Infantino&apos;s other business, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194521/http://www.infantinoproductions.com/">Infantino Productions</a> offers &quot;Family Photography, Modeling, Headshots, and more&quot; and adds &quot;If you&apos;d like a FREE photo shoot...contact me and we&apos;ll go over the details of what you&apos;re interested in doing (family, fashion, headshots, glamour, etc).&quot;    Apparently the woman and her girls, ages 10 and 14, took him up on the offer but then noticed a &quot;camera hidden in a box in a changing room&quot; where they had been changing outfits.  Newsday says he was charged with three counts of second-degree unlawful surveillance.</p>
