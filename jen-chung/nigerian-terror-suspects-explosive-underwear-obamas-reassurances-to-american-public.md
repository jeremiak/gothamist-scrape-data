                            <p>ABC News showed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/northwest-airlines-bomb-photos/story?id=9436297">photographs of the underwear</a> worn by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab while he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/26/us_charges_nigerian_man_with_attemp.php">allegedly tried to destroy a Northwest Airlines flight</a> landing in Detroit last week. ABC News explains, &quot;The first photo... shows the slightly charred underpants with the bomb packet still in place... The bomb packet is a six-inch long container of the high-explosive chemical PETN, less than a half cup in volume, weighing about 80 grams.  A government test with 50 grams of PETN blew a hole in the side of an airliner. That was the amount in the bomb carried by the so-called shoe bomber Richard Reid over Christmas 2001. <strong>The underpants bomb would have been one and a half times as powerful.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>A court hearing for Abdulmutallab, now dubbed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/air_bomber_shorts_fuse_GeBaGmubs9fkAIZnzXY8oJ">&quot;crotch bomber&quot; by the NY Post</a>, was postponed yesterday; the arraignment is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jX29sXXlGELZcLYlbQTH9cxbMJVA">now scheduled for January 8</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/28/AR2009122802492.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post reports</a> that the 23-year-old Nigerian national &quot;apparently turned to the Internet for counseling and companionship, writing in an online forum that he was &apos;lonely&apos; and had &apos;never found a true Muslim friend.&apos;&quot; While the authenticity of the postings has yet to be concerned, the Post details them:</p><blockquote>&quot;I have no one to speak too [sic],&apos; read a posting from January 2005, when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was attending boarding school. &quot;No one to consult, no one to support me and I feel depressed and lonely. I do not know what to do. And then I think this loneliness leads me to other problems.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The Washington Post reviewed 300 online postings under the name &quot;farouk1986&quot; (a combination of Abdulmutallab&apos;s middle name and birth year). The postings mused openly about love and marriage, his college ambitions and angst over standardized testing, as well as his inner struggle as a devout Muslim between liberalism and extremism. In often-intimate writings, posted between 2005 and 2007, he sought friends online, through Facebook and in Islamic chat rooms: &quot;My name is Umar but you can call me Farouk.&quot; He often invited readers to &quot;have your say&quot; and once wrote, &quot;May Allah reward you for reading and reward you more for helping.&quot; </p></blockquote><br>
In the meantime, President Obama, currently on vacation in Hawaii, spoke about the incident for the first time yesterday, &quot;A full investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable... Since I was first notified of this incident, I&apos;ve ordered the following actions to be taken to protect the American people and to secure air travel.&quot; (You can read his<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/12/28/president-addresses-public-attempted-terrorist-attack"> full remarks here</a>, including the actions he&apos;s mentioned.) <br><br>

But it&apos;s still given the GOP an opportunity to go after him and his administration, especially after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano&apos;s apparent initial assessment of the situation as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/29/us/29terror.html?hp">&quot;the system worked.&quot;</a> On the heels of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/28/rep_king_upset_with_white_houses_la.php">Rep. Peter King&apos;s criticism</a>, Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Michigan) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120345/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/31016.html">told Politico</a>, &#x201C;In the past six weeks, you&#x2019;ve had the Fort Hood attack, the D.C. Five and now the attempted attack on the plane in Detroit &#x2026; and they all underscored the clear philosophical difference between the administration and us.... I think Secretary Napolitano and the rest of the Obama administration view their role as law enforcement, first responders dealing with the aftermath of an attack. And we believe in a forward-looking approach to stopping these attacks before they happen.&#x201D; <p></p>
