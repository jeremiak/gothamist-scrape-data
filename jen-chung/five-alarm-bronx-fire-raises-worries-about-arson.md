The fire, on East 204th Street near Bainbridge Avenue, is the second in two months for the neighborhood&#x2014;a five-alarm fire on Bainbridge near East 204th Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063447/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/31/5-alarm_fire_rips_through_bronx_bui.php">also destroyed businesses</a>. One resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063447/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7181431">told WABC 7</a>, &quot;The first time it was the bakery and now again, it doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063447/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/31/5-alarm_fire_rips_through_bronx_bui.php">October 31 fire</a>, which started at a bakery, on Bainbridge Avenue was actually the <em>second</em> since April for that strip of stores. City Councilman Oliver Koppell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063447/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/nyregion/22fire.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;adxnnlx=1261491711-EAg62Gt/wT9HA94MU9Nb9Q">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;This is just a devastating blow to a beleaguered neighborhood. And to me it looks very suspicious.&quot; Another resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063447/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/12/22/2009-12-22_2nd_fire_in_bx_nabe_sparks_arson_talk.html">opined to the Daily News</a>, &quot;When you burn up stuff, the property value goes down. It&apos;s got to be an arsonist.&quot;</p>

<p>Fire Department Assistant Chief Edward Baggot s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063447/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7181431">aid</a>, &quot;Right now it&apos;s under investigation by the bureau of fire investigation due to the amount of fire that was here on arrival.&quot;</p>
