<p>Francis, who was off-duty at the time, was found around 2:30 a.m. on Sunday. Sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330070245/http://nypost.com/2017/03/26/detective-busted-for-masturbating-in-strangers-backyard/">tell the NY Post</a> that Francis had allegedly creeped into the back yards of multiple homes and shined a flashlight into various rooms until getting someone&apos;s attention. &quot;Then, as the person was looking at him, Francis shined the light on himself to show he was fondling himself,&quot; the Post&apos;s sources said.</p>

<p>There were three similar incidents in February involving a man uses a flashlight or headlamp to get someone&apos;s&#x2014;usually a child&apos;s or teen&apos;s&#x2014;attention and then masturbating. Earlier this month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330070245/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/01/rockville-centre-flasher/">WCBS 2 reported</a> that &quot;[T]wo teenage girls inside were drawn to a light outside or a knock on the window. They were startled to see a naked man in the backyard performing an obscene act... A parent of one victim told CBS2 her daughter is traumatized.&quot;</p>

<p>Francis, who was also charged with endangering the welfare of a child, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330070245/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Public-Lewdness-NYPD-Officer-Rockville-Centre-Arrest-417131033.html">works at the 71st Precinct</a>, which covers Crown Heights. He has been suspended without pay from the NYPD. </p>
