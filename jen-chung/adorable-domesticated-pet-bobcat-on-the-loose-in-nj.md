(Ginny Fine/1010 WINS)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>FYI: If you see a 38-pound bobcat wandering around southern NJ, it *might* be domesticated. But don&apos;t take any chances&#x2014;let the Stafford Township police know, because they&apos;ve been searching for Ginny Fine&apos;s bobcat, Rocky, for the past week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411164006/http://www.app.com/interactive/article/20140404/NJNEWS14/304040123/Bobcat-loose-Stafford-traps-set?nclick_check=1">Fine explained</a>, &quot;He was playing with my dog and they ran through the house, banged into the storm door and it popped open.&quot;</p>

<p>Fine got Rocky from Montana three years ago and he&apos;s escaped before, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411164006/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/05/new-jersey-town-on-alert-after-pet-bobcat-gets-loose/">prompting the township to fine her</a> for the &quot;bobcat hybrid.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411164006/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Neighbors-Fearful-of-Pet-Bobcat-on-the-Loose-253803991.html">But Fine insisted</a>, &quot;He&apos;s sweet, he&apos;s nice, he&apos;s super affectionate with me... He is a house pet... He is third generation captivity. He&#x2019;s never been wild, his parents have never been wild. He has no aggression at all. He has never hurt anybody... His inclination is to be more timid with a stranger.&quot; Plus he&apos;s declawed!</p>

<p>Animal control is hoping to trap Rocky. The local police captain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411164006/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Neighbors-Fearful-of-Pet-Bobcat-on-the-Loose-253803991.html">told NBC 10</a> that Fine could be &quot;be subject to immediate impoundment of the animal until such time as there was a further court hearing to determine what would be done with it.&quot; Fine does have a permit for Rocky.</p>

<p>Bobcats are native to New Jersey; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411164006/http://www.nj.com/sussex-county/index.ssf/2014/04/video_watch_elusive_bobcat_find_its_way_to_sussex_backyard.html">state authorities call them &quot;elusive.&quot;</a></p>
