</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made his annual controversial speech at the United Nations General Assembly.  This year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307095512/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/sep/23/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-un-september-11-attacks">he said there was a theory</a> &quot;that some segments within the US government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining American economy, and its grips on the Middle East, in order to save the Zionist regime.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307095512/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jad_spew_shoo_kRLwMVRrQ6n9jiOSDS9koN">Ahmadinejad said</a>, &quot;It is said that 3,000 people died,&quot; but hundreds of thousands died in Iraq and Afghanistatn...and that no suicide attackers were found in the 9/11 attacks. And when he said, &quot;The majority of the American people as well as most nations and politicians around the world agree with this view,&quot; the U.S. delegation left.  The delegation later issued the statement, &quot;Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people, Mr Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable.&quot;</p>

<p>President Obama, who had earlier offered to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307095512/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iZfgLuKrg3QBRltJ0qQMIzgIohdQD9IECJNG1">addressed the comments today</a>, &quot;For him to make a statement like that was inexcusable. It was offensive. It was hateful. And particularly for him to make the statement here in Manhattan, just a little north of Ground Zero, where families lost their loved ones, people of all faiths, all ethnicities who see this as the seminal tragedy of this generation.&quot;</p>

<p>As it happens, the mayor of 9/11, former mayor Rudy Giuliani, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307095512/http://manhattan.ny1.com/content/top_stories/125929/iranian-president-s-appearance-at-u-n--brings-protests">was at an anti-Mahmoud protest</a> during Ahmadinejad&apos;s speech, &quot;For too long, the world has acquiesced a regime in Iran that through mass murder, violence and intimidation has denied basic rights to your brothers and sisters and friends and relatives.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307095512/http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/247658/iran-contra-ahmadinejad-matthew-shaffer">According to the National Review</a>, he was &quot;animated and loud,&quot; rallying the crowd with, &quot;Where&#x2019;s our Ronald Reagan when we need him?... Ronald Reagan would have stood with the people of Iran&#x2026;when they sought to protest the illegitimacies of the elections&#x2026;as he did with the Solidarity movement in Poland.&quot;  He </p>
