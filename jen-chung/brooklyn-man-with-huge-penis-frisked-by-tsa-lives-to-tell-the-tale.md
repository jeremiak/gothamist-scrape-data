Jonah Falcon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203710/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/16/jonah-falcon-largest-penis-frisked-by-tsa_n_1675767.html#slide=1232039">told the Huffington Post</a> that one &quot;guard stopped me and asked me if I had some sort of growth.&quot;</p>

<p>Falcon explained, &quot;I had my &apos;stuff&apos; strapped to the left. I wasn&apos;t erect at the time. One of the guards asked if my pockets were empty and I said, &apos;Yes.&apos;&quot;  Then he was taken to an X-ray scanner and metal detector. While that sucks and everything, we feel worse for the grannies made to get naked and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203710/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/05/tsa_to_grandma_get_naked_and_show_u.php">show the TSA their colostomy bags</a>.  </p>

<p>Anyway, here&apos;s Falcon on the Daily Show:</p>
