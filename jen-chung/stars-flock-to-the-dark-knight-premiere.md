										<p>The black carpet was rolled out at the AMC Loews Lincoln Square cinemas for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001507/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/dark_knight_coming_bat_signal_light.php">the feverishly-anticipated</a> premiere of <em>The Dark Knight.</em>  The film&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001507/http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-14-dark-knight-premiere_N.htm">cast and crew appeared</a> at the premiere, but most talk, as it has been for the past since months, was about missing cast member Heath Ledger, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001507/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/22/heath_ledger_fo.php">sudden death in January</a> shocked Hollywood and the public.  The film&apos;s star, Christian Bale, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001507/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/15/earlyshow/main4261829.shtml">said Ledger &quot;steals the movie</a>, I&apos;m quite happy to say that he absolutely does.&quot;</p>

<p>Michael Caine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001507/http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-14-dark-knight-premiere_N.htm">predicted Ledger would be nominated for a Oscar</a> for his turn as the Joker, and said, &quot;When you see this movie, you&apos;ll see one of the best performances not from him &#x2014; but ever.&quot;  And Ledger&apos;s parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001507/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,382443,00.html">issued a statement to Roger Friedman</a> after they attended the premiere, &quot;<em>The Dark Knight</em> is everything we hoped it would be and more. Heath loved the experience of creating this character and working on the film. We are so proud of our boy.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Director Christopher Nolan said of the splashy premiere, which featured the Batcycle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001507/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/14/dark_knight_week_begins_with_batmob.php">and Batmobile outside the theater</a>, &quot;I feel very excited that there&apos;s so much anticipation around the film but obviously, that in itself is somewhat daunting.  The film has a lot to live up to now so hopefully we&apos;ve done it right.&quot;</p>
