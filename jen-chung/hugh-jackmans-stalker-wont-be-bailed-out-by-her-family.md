	<p>Days after a woman followed movie star Hugh Jackman into his West Village gym and allegedly threw a pubic hair-filled razor at him, her family says they&apos;re relieved she&apos;s behind bars. A relative told the NY Post that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002328/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/stalker_kin_hail_jackman_mercy_7IHUzqUPGQtV5Tqr7FYPGP">stalker Katherine Thurston won&apos;t be bailed out</a>: &quot;We kept waiting to hear on the news that she had been arrested or that he had taken out a restraining order.&quot;</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, Jackman was working out at his gym, Gotham Gym, at 600 Washington Street&#x2014;Thurston had asked him outside, &quot;We&#x2019;re getting married, right?&quot; and then inside the gym, she said, &#x201C;I love you!&quot; After crying and screaming, she apparently threw an electric razor at Jackman and a trainer at the gym restrained her. </p>

<p>Thurston, 47, has a history of following Jackman: He took a restraining order out on the California resident after she stalked in San Francisco, but he didn&apos;t have one out on her in New York. Thurston reportedly admitted to police that in March she approached Jackman&apos;s wife and daughter, saying, &quot;I am going to marry your husband.&quot;</p>

<p>Thurston&apos;s ex-mother-in-law <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002328/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/accused-hugh-jackman-stalker-history-hounding-celebrities-kin-article-1.1317913">told the Daily News</a> that bothering celebrities was nothing new, &#x201C;When she was in New York, she had done some stalking. She&#x2019;s had issues for a long time. I believe they diagnosed her as bipolar.&quot;</p>

<p>The relative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002328/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/stalker_kin_hail_jackman_mercy_7IHUzqUPGQtV5Tqr7FYPGP">confirmed that Thurston has mental issues</a>, &quot;We are so thankful to [Jackman] for keeping the focus on her mental health and not criticizing her or making fun of her. He seems like he is trying to help... We are relieved she is in custody, because she will get the help she needs and they will make her take her medications.&quot;</p>

<p>Jackman was back at Gotham Gym yesterday; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002328/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/stalker_kin_hail_jackman_mercy_7IHUzqUPGQtV5Tqr7FYPGP">told reporters</a>, &quot;I feel unsettled/ My main concern is for my family, [and] I hope she gets the help she needs.&quot;</p>
