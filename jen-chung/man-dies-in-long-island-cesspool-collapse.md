<p>A 59-year-old man was killed after he fell into a cesspool he was helping install at a Long Island home on Wednesday. Edward Sinnott was buried under &quot;as much as 15 feet of dirt,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170525171831/http://abc7ny.com/news/workers-body-recovered-after-cesspool-collapse-in-huntington/2031510/">reports WABC 7</a>.</p>

<p>Sinnott and other workers from Antorino &amp; Sons were outside a home on Beech Place in Huntington when the cesspool suddenly collapsed around 1 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170525171831/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/officials-man-s-body-recovered-at-site-of-cesspool-collapse-in-huntington-1.13661109">According to Newsday</a>, the cesspool &quot;[left] a gaping hole that consumed the entire front yard and ate the top half of the driveway.&quot; </p>

<p>Sinnott apparently slipped in the hole. Another employee also fell, but managed to get out by &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170525171831/http://pix11.com/2017/05/24/cesspool-on-long-island-swallows-worker-alive/">by grabbing the bucket used to scoop and dig in the area</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>From Newsday:</p><blockquote>Crews used a crane and other equipment, including a tractor-size device designed to suck up large amounts of dirt. By about 2 p.m., as many at the scene realized the likelihood Sinnott had survived faded, residents appeared visibly despondent.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never heard of anything like this,&#x201D; said Regina Sineno, 51, who lives nearby. &#x201C;This is very sad.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Sinnott&apos;s body was recovered at 7 p.m. <p></p>

<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating the incident. The stability of the house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170525171831/http://pix11.com/2017/05/24/cesspool-on-long-island-swallows-worker-alive/">was also compromised</a> and is reportedly unsafe.</p>
