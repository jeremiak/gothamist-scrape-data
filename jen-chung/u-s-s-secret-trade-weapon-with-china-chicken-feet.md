However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211252/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/business/global/16chickens.html?ref=business">NY Times suggests</a> there&apos;s a secret weapon that Chicken Little might appreciate (or might not). A poultry economist and consultant, Paul Aho, tells the Times, &quot;<strong>We have these jumbo, juicy paws the Chinese really love so I don&#x2019;t think they are going to cut us off.</strong>&quot; While exports of U.S. chicken to China and Hong Kong only amount to 2% of the total poultry export revenue, it&apos;s very profitable: &quot;About half of the chicken parts sold to China are wings and feet, which are worth only a few cents a pound in the United States. As delicacies in China, they fetch 60 cents to 80 cents a pound, a price that no other foreign market comes close to matching.&quot; And apparently U.S. poultry companies are the &quot;world&#x2019;s leading supplier of king-size chicken feet.&quot; Cato Institute trade expert Daniel Griswold said there&apos;s some risk, &quot;If we are playing a game of chicken with China we are going to be big losers.&quot; In the meantime, China <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211252/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125292818818208401.html">wants talks with the U.S. at the WTO</a>.</p>
