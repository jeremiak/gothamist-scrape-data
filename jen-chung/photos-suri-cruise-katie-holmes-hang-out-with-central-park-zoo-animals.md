</div></div>					<p>Katie Holmes is continuing to enjoy her life as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://laist.com/2012/07/09/tom_cruise_katie_holmes_release_joi.php">soon-to-be-single mom</a> in New York.  After taking daughter Suri Cruise to the East Village <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/04/katie_holmes_celebrates_independenc.php">for ice cream, Whole Foods for groceries</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/katie_holmes_takes_suriand_lots_of.php">Children&apos;s Museum of Arts</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20609982,00.html">Alice&apos;s Tea Cup</a>  in the past few weeks, the former Dawson&apos;s Creek starlet headed to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://www.centralparkzoo.com/">Central Park Zoo</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Photographs show Holmes, Suri and Holmes&apos; mother Kathleen checking out the seals as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://www.centralparkzoo.com/animals-and-exhibits/exhibits/tisch-childrens-zoo.aspx">Tisch Children&apos;s Zoo</a>, where visitors can feed and pet farm animals like goats, sheep, pigs and llamas (there&apos;s hand sanitizer!).  The trio also saw the penguins; another zoo-goer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-holmes-suri-head-to-central-park-zoo-2012117">told US Weekly</a> that Suri &quot;was standing on the ledge with her face pressed to the glass. When a penguin swam up, Suri screamed playfully, and she and Katie laughed.&quot; AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED, US WEEKLY?!</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that as part of Holmes&apos; divorce settlement with Tom Cruise, she will have custody of their daughter and that Suri will attend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/07/10/suri-cruise-school-spoiled-brat-private-homeschooled/">private school in Manhattan</a>.  Apparently the couple can&apos;t really talk about religion without restriction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://www.tmz.com/2012/07/09/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-divorce-settlement-suri-custody-scientology-nanny/">when Suri is young</a> but Holmes has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/09/katie-holmes-catholic-church_n_1659466.html">reportedly joined</a> a LGBT-inclusive Catholic church in Chelsea.  </p>

<p>Expect to see more of Holmes&#x2014;she&apos;s going to be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020037/http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2012/07/06/katie-holmes-fashion-week/">Fashion Week in September</a>.</p>
