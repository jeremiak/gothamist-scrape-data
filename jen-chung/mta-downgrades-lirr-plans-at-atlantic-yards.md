                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_05_vanyard.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141536im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_05_vanyard.jpg" width="140" height="113" class="image-right"> </span>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141536/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/22/ratner_may_scale_back_atlantic_yard.php">months of speculation</a>, the MTA announced that the Long Island Rail Road improvements proposed at the Atlantic Yards development <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141536/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05302009/news/regionalnews/ratner_a_rail_loser_171687.htm">will be less grand than planned</a>.  Instead of nine rails, there will be seven, and the MTA is also expecting less money from developer Bruce Ratner. The Post reports that the MTA &quot;allowed Ratner to renegotiate because the national credit crunch was making it difficult to finance the 22-acre plan to build an NBA arena and 16 office and residential towers in Prospect Heights.&quot;  To refresh your memory, back in 2005, Ratner won the MTA&apos;s land&#x2014;called the Vanderbilt Rail Yard&#x2014;after bidding $100 million, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141536/http://gothamist.com/2005/07/07/unexpected_bid_for_atlantic_railyards.php">$50 million less than a rival bid</a> (the land is appraised at over $200 million). It&apos;s unclear how much Ratner will end up paying the MTA (rumor is $50 million!); Atlantic Yards Report has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141536/http://atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com/2009/05/senate-hearing-no-tough-questions-for.html">details of the State Senate meeting</a> where MTA interim CEO Helena Williams spoke.  And Ratner, who hopes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141536/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/16/ratner_relieved_court_dismisses_atl.php">break ground later this year</a>, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141536/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/08/brooklyn_nets_arena_no_longer_appea.php">downsizing other parts of his plan</a>.</p>
