<p>Today, many candidates for public office bragged about all the signatures they had collected to get onto the ballot. For instance, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105200/https://twitter.com/deBlasioNYC/status/354693844069138433">announced he would submit</a> 60,000 signatures to get on the Democratic mayoral ballot&#x2014;well above the 3,750 needed. And Republican mayoral candidate John Catsimatidis posted an amazing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105200/https://twitter.com/JCats2013/status/354649362506326016/photo/1">photograph of his 25,000 signatures</a>. He also took another with his daughter:</p>

<p>Other Democrats running for mayor announced their hauls: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105200/http://politicker.com/2013/07/mayoral-candidates-tout-petitioning-totals/">will turn over over 46,000 signatures</a> while City Comptroller John Liu says he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105200/https://twitter.com/JohnLiu2013/status/354717949740855297">has a stunning 65,000</a>. But why do candidates over collect? As Politicker explains, &quot;While the mayoral candidates only need to collect 3,750 valid signatures to appear on the ballot, they typically collect many, many more-both as a symbol of operational strength as well as to stave off lawsuits filed by challengers who can try to invalidate many names they collect.&quot;</p>

<p>Candidates for other citywide office must collect 3,750 signatures as well, and much attention has been put on the fact that former Governor Eliot Spitzer, the new entrant in the NYC Comptroller race, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105200/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/is_spitzer_just_making_nyc_democrat.php">needs to collect 3,750 by Thursday</a>, the filing deadline. </p>

<p>Hunter College Political Science Professor Kenneth Sherrill says, &quot;Spitzer has to be very careful about petitioning. The rule of thumb is that you need two or three times the minimum number to get the required number of signatures. Trying to get 10,000 signatures in four days will mean a lot of work for unemployed actors and college students, but it also will mean a lot of errors. Petitions that are alleged to be permeated with fraud will be very embarrassing to the &#x2018;Sherriff of Wall Street&#x2019; and there may be many people willing to finance an effort to challenge his petitions.&quot;</p>

<p>And how many has Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, the other Democrat running for Comptroller, collected? Oh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105200/https://twitter.com/colvinj/status/354726898733039618">just 100,000</a>.</p>
