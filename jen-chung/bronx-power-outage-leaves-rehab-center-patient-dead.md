Sources said there had been an order not to resuscitate her. 12 FDNY units took 37 patients, all in critical condition on ventilators, to area hospitals, with the last patient being moved shortly before 4 a.m.</p>

<p>About 4,000 customers were affected by the outage; power was back after four hours later at 5 a.m.  Con Ed is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161129/http://bronx.ny1.com/content/top_stories/151456/con-ed-works-to-restore-power-following-bronx-blackout">investigating the outage</a>.</p>
