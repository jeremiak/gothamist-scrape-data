<p>The woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170902141559/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/27/woman_sexually_assaulted_in_uws_apa.php">who was sexually assaulted</a> in her Manhattan apartment on Friday night appeared on WCBS 2 to share her struggle. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170902141559/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/27/police-seek-suspect-in-upper-west-side-attack/">She said that during the attack</a>, &quot;The last time I had fought back was with a mirror. I had a hand held mirror and he basically got hold of my neck again for the third time&#x2026;[he] wouldn&#x2019;t let go until I almost passed out and I thought I was going to die.&quot;</p>

<p>On September 26th, the woman was entering her building near 105th Street and Central Park West at around 10:30 p.m. The suspect allegedly followed her down the street, then forced his way into her apartment, where he sexually assaulted her. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170902141559/http://nypost.com/2014/09/27/man-follows-woman-into-apartment-forces-oral-sex/">The Post reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>On the third floor, the woman confronted the man as he stood in front of a neighbor&#x2019;s door and pretended to look for some keys.

<p>She told the man she knew he didn&#x2019;t belong in the building &#x2014; and he answered he was waiting for a friend.</p>

<p>The woman entered her apartment but didn&#x2019;t immediately lock the door behind her.</p>

<p>Moments later, the man walked into her apartment and put her into a chokehold.</p>

<p>Then he forced her to her knees and demanded she perform oral sex, said the sources. He also fondled her, the sources said.</p>

<p>But the pervert couldn&#x2019;t perform. He soon zipped up his pants and fled the scene.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The 36-year-old went public to make other victims feel empowered.</p>

<p>She also told WCBS 2 that she&apos;s going to take a self-defense class and she&apos;s happy to testify against him: &quot;I know exactly how he looked. I know exactly. He made the mistake of leaving his hat in my apartment.... I&#x2019;m not afraid and I&#x2019;m still not going to be afraid and this man is not going to make me afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a man standing around 6 foot 2, around 35 to 40 years of age. </p>
