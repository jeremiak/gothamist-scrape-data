<p>In a televised meeting that could be subtitled &quot;Death by a Thousand Paper Cuts,&quot; the Democratic Party&apos;s Rules &amp; Bylaws Committee is meeting today to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-05-31-dnc-rules_N.htm">discuss and hear testimony on the dilemma</a> of Florida&apos;s and Michigan&apos;s delegates.  </p>

<p>The controversy over the states&apos; delegates is due to the fact they essentially violated DNC rules by holding their primaries too early, so the DNC stripped them of their delegates.  Clinton&apos;s campaign is especially eager to fight the decision, since Clinton won both primaries, though Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards and other Democratic candidates all agreed <i>not to campaign</i> in those states.  Obama even took his name off Michigan&apos;s ballot, but things are a little messy when it comes to Florida, because its Republican-controlled State Legislature partly had a hand in pushing up the primary, leaving some Dems to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/broward/blog/2008/03/democrats_blame_republicans_for_their_primary_delegate_mess.html">accuse the GOP of sabotaging them</a>.  Obama&apos;s campaign has suggested it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10717.html">would be open to a compromise</a>.</p>

<p>The RBC (details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://www.democrats.org/page/content/RBCMeeting2008/">about the meeting here</a>) has heard testimony from Florida and Michigan DNC members, as well as Clinton and Obama supporters and campaign staffers.  It&apos;s unclear when a decision will be made (a partial resolution end of the weekend?), so it remains to be seen if DNC chairman Howard Dean&apos;s opening remarks will be heeded: &quot;It has got to stop. We have got to come together and unite our party.  Every one of us has the responsibility to help ensure that our party is united.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/">Politico</a>, the Times&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/">Caucus blog</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/">Talking Points Memo</a> are all liveblogging the meeting.  </p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  Ten hours after the meeting started, the committee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/31/the-dnc-deliberates/index.html?hp">decided to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates</a>, but the delegates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132739/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/31/dems.delegates/index.html">will only get half votes</a>.  That way, all delegates get to go to Denver.  The numbers break down this way, per CNN:</p><blockquote> The committee&apos;s ruling gave Clinton 105 pledged delegates from Florida and 69 from Michigan, with a total of 87 votes.<p></p>

<p>Obama received 67 pledged delegates from Florida and 59 from Michigan, casting a total of 63 votes.</p>

<p>That tally leaves Obama ahead by the equivalent of 174 delegates.</p></blockquote>Obama said, &quot;This results in Sen. Clinton obtaining a substantial number of additional pledged delegates, but I also understand that many members of the Florida and Michigan delegations feel satisfied that the decision was fair. This results in Sen. Clinton obtaining a substantial number of additional pledged delegates, but I also understand that many members of the Florida and Michigan delegations feel satisfied that the decision was fair.&quot;<p></p>

<p>However, Clinton&apos;s camp had a mixed reaction, with its statement, &quot;Today&apos;s results are a victory for the people of Florida, who will have a voice in selecting our party&apos;s nominee and will see its delegates seated at our party&apos;s convention. [But] we strongly object to the committee&apos;s decision to undercut its own rules in seating Michigan&apos;s delegates without reflecting the votes of the people of Michigan.&quot;  In fact, when the motions were voted on and the announcement made around 7:15p.m. (the committee voted in public), Clinton adviser Harold Ickes was sharp in his criticism and pro-Clinton supporters disrupted the proceedings, yelling, &quot;Denver!&quot;  </p>
