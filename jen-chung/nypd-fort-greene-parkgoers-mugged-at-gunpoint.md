<p>According to the NYPD, at 1 a.m. on June 18th, a 20-year-old man and 21-year-old woman were in Fort Greene Park when they were approached by a man who had a gun. The gun-wielding man told them to stand up and give him all their property, and the victims complied, giving him &quot;an Apple iPhone, debit &amp; credit cards, metro cards and an undetermined amount of money.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released a photo of the suspect, who is described as being about 20 years old. Anyone with information in regards to this robbery is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012143/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
