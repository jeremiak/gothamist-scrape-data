Seventeen-year-old Allan Swafford, of the Bronx, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120402000339/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2012/03/police-catch-queens-playground-vandal.html">was arrested yesterday</a>, based on a tip to CrimeStoppers.</p>

This playground will be completed and will open, so that our children will always have a safe place to play and enjoy the great outdoors. Our community refuses to let a senseless and idiotic act of vandalism prevent the residents of B. 29th street from enjoying a playground they deserve.&quot;</p>
