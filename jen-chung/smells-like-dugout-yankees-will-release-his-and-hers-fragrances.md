<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002124/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/yankees-additions-lineup-fragrances-smell-victory-article-1.1024500?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News</a>, the Yankees will be selling his-and-her fragrances in April: &quot;The men&#x2019;s fragrance captures &apos;a sporty and confident attitude, creating a timeless masculine&apos; scent, redolent with &apos;fresh wood tones, an invigorating blend of sparkling bergamont, coriander and cool blue sage,&apos; the manufacturer says. The ladies&#x2019; scent is described as an &apos;alluring and fruity&apos; melange that blends &apos;guava, succulent plum and sun-kiss apricot nectar.&apos;&quot; In other words, it won&apos;t smell like locker room or an equipment bag.  </p>

<p>A Yankees vice president explained that this &quot;will strengthen brand awareness for its fragrances and be an exciting new addition to Yankees prestige and lifestyle products.&quot; Did you realize that there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002124/http://shop.mlb.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4047766&amp;cp=1452360.1452534">Yankee toaster</a>, too? Imagine, spraying on some Yankees perfume while making Yankees toast before you eat it on your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002124/http://shop.mlb.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2787444&amp;cp=1452360.1452534.710009">Yankees pub sofa</a>.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether Derek Jeter will include this in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002124/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/after_you_sleep_with_derek_jeter_yo.php">parting basket to one-night-stands</a>.</p>
