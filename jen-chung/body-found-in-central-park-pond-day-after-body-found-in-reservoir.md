<p>A body was discovered in the pond in Central Park this morning. The corpse was discovered near 59th Street and 5th Avenue around 7:30 a.m.</p>

<p>The police are investigating the circumstances of the person&apos;s death.  </p>

<p>The grisly discovery was made one day after a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510193433/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170509/upper-west-side/central-park-dead-body-reservoir-nypd">badly decomposed</a>&quot; body was found in the reservoir near East 87th Street and East Drive on Tuesday. The male body was apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510193433/http://abc7ny.com/news/body-discovered-in-water-in-central-park;-2nd-in-2-days/1975532/">found by maintenance workers</a> around 12:30 p.m. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510193433/http://nypost.com/2017/05/09/body-found-floating-in-central-park-reservoir/">A witness told the NY Post</a>, &quot;I saw something out there earlier today that looked like a potato sack floating. Couldn&#x2019;t tell if it was a human, it looked like litter to me.&quot; Authorities are also probing the circumstances of his death.</p>

<p>Human remains found in bodies of water are referred to as &quot;floaters&quot; by the police. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510193433/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/nyregion/24floaters.html?ref=nyregion">The NY Times once</a> spoke to the head of the NYPD&apos;s Harbor Unit, who explained that in the winter, &quot;the cold water temperature slows the decomposition of a body. As the temperature rises in the spring, decomposition speeds up, producing gases that make the body buoyant and bring it to the surface.&quot; </p>
