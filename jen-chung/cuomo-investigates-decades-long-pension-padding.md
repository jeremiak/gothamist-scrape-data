										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="031110cuomo1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626004559im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/031110cuomo1.jpg" width="200" height="249" class="image-left"> </span>Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced yesterday that his office would investigate &quot;the manipulation of salary and overtime payments that leads to inflated pensions at the expense of taxpayers,&quot; citing various cases of state employees who managed to increase their salaries by 30-167%.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626004559/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/19/2010-03-19_ag_well_get_pension_cheats.html">Cuomo said</a>, &quot;There is a possibility that it&apos;s gaming of the system.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626004559/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/andy_rocks_the_bloat_pMD64QLibsykw6vhTXJHfO">Post explains</a>, &quot;Lifetime pension payments are generally based on the average of an employee&apos;s final three years of pay before retirement.&quot;  And some employees then work more overtime&#x2014;an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626004559/http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2010/mar/mar18a_10.html">example from Cuomo&apos;s office</a>, &quot;A police officer earning a base salary of $74,000 took in $125,277 in overtime in his final year, bringing his total income to almost $200,000.  Based on this inflated final year&#x2019;s salary, he then received a $101,333 annual pension.&quot;  </p>

<p>Therefore, besides the higher salary, Cuomo, who says this pension padding has been going on for &quot;decades,&quot; says taxpayers are on the hook for the higher pension payouts as well.  The spokeswoman for the state Public Employees Federation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626004559/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/19/2010-03-19_ag_well_get_pension_cheats.html">told the Daily News</a>,  &quot;Accountability lies with the supervisors.&quot;</p>
