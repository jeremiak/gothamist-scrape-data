<p>The Queens Aqueduct Racino, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150814045002/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/29/uplifting_photos_of_happy_gamblers.php#photo-1">opened nearly two years ago</a>, is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150814045002/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/13/racino_gamblers_literally_cant_stop.php">big success story</a>.

Ruth Liberal, 29, allegedly left her daughter and two sons (4 and 9) plus her l13-year-old brother in the vehicle while she was having fun: &quot;Earlier, Liberal had taken the kids to eat at the casino. She then allegedly brought them back out to the car, locked them inside and went back inside to gamble, the sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>Liberal was arrested for failure to exercise control of a minor.
