										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2012_01_wusare.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142924im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_01_wusare.jpg" width="365" height="246"> <br> <i>Xiao Xu Wu</i></div> Connecticut police arrested a 38-year-old woman for risk of injury to a minor for leaving her five-year-old son in a casino hotel room so she could gamble.  And police found out what happened because her son called 911.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142924/http://articles.courant.com/2012-01-25/news/hc-mohegan-sun-arrest-0125-20120124_1_child-care-arrest-warrant-mom">According to the Courant</a>, the boy dialed 911 and when a dispatcher answered, he said, &quot;Who are you?&quot; and &quot;What&apos;s your name?&quot;:</p><blockquote>The dispatcher spent more than four minutes engaging in a friendly conversation with the child and asking him questions, which led to the discovery that he was alone in a hotel room.<p></p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s a kid alone up there, a young kid,&quot; the dispatcher is heard saying in a muffled tone after the child told her his mom said not to open the door for anybody.</p>

<p>At one point, the dispatcher asks the child&apos;s age.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, 1,&quot; he answers.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not 1,&quot; the dispatcher responds.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe 2?&quot; the child says.</p>

<p>&quot;I think you&apos;re older than 2. Maybe 3?&quot; the dispatcher says.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; says the child.</p></blockquote>The child was taken into Connecticut&apos;s children&apos;s protective services.  Wu, who lives in New York City, is being held on $150,000 bail and &quot;Police said a search of the mother&apos;s fingerprints found outstanding immigration charges and an arrest warrant in Rocky Mount, N.C., police said.&quot;  <p></p>
