<p>Joey Boots, who was known for interrupting TV reporters by yelling &quot;baba booey,&quot; has died at age 49. Police responded to a 911 call at a Bronx apartment and found him unconscious and unresponsive. EMS pronounced him dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Boots, whose real name was Joseph Bassolino, was part of Howard Stern&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084857/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wack_Pack">Wack Pack</a>. He also co-hosted a podcast, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084857/http://www.tmz.com/2016/12/23/howard-stern-joey-boots-dead-wack-pack/">TMZ reports</a> that &quot;[f]ellow Wack Packer High Pitch Erik went to check on Boots after his podcast co-hosts became worried that he didn&apos;t show up for his regular gig. According to a Facebook post from people associated with the podcast, Boots didn&apos;t answer the door, so Erik got the building manager to do a wellness check and found Joey, &apos;sitting in a chair, cold to the touch and with no pulse.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Besides &quot;baba booey&quot;-bombing reporters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084857/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/spitzer_heckled_at_first_petitionin.php">he also bothered other public figures</a>, like when he shouted, &quot;What&apos;s the going rate for a hooker?&quot; during former Governor Spitzer&apos;s first event when he was running for NYC Comptroller. </p>

<p>Boots also spent a lot of time roaming the city,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084857/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/no_your_city_joey_boots.php">talking to and filming people</a>.</p>
