<p>Angela Raiola, the flamboyant star of the VH1 reality series &quot;Mob Wives,&quot; died earlier this morning at age 55. The Staten Island resident had stage 4 brain and lung cancer. In a statement posted online, her friend Vinnie Medugno said that Raiola &quot;peacefully ended her battle with cancer, and was called home. She was surrounded by nothing but love from her immediate family, and closest friends.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the full statement:</p>

She was surrounded by nothing but love from her immediate family, and closest friends. YOU, (Her fans) were some of the most special people in her world, and she loved you immensely. Thank you for your love, prayers, and unconditional support of Angela right to the very end. She truly went out richer than any monetary value could ever amount to. The family asks for privacy, and peace during this most difficult time. In typical Big Ang fashion, we know she would say &quot;Love you my babies!&quot; This page will remain open as a celebration of who she was and will always be. It has been my esteemed privilege, and honor to represent her in the highest regard via social media. -Vinnie Medugno (@vinniemedugno)</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A photo posted by biggangvh1 (@biggangvh1) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2016-02-18T09:37:41+00:00">Feb 18, 2016 at 1:37am PST</time></p></div></blockquote>

<p><br>A few hours earlier, it was rumored that Raiola had died, leading to a statement issued at 10 p.m. saying that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050612/https://twitter.com/biggangVH1/status/700153245755404288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">she was still in the hospital, &quot;fighting&quot;</a> while surrounded by loved ones. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_02_bigangw1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050612im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_02_bigangw1.jpg" width="300" height="428"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Raiola in 2015 (Getty Images)</i></div> Raiola&apos;s connection to the Mafia was her uncle, Salvatore &quot;Sally Dogs&quot; Lombardi, an alleged capo in the Genovese crime family. She had two children, a daughter and son, and six grandchildren. During an emotional interview with Dr. Oz recently, she said, &quot;I look at my kids and my grandchildren and I know how much they need me. My kids, my daughter lives with me with her kids and her husband so I&apos;m very close to my grandchildren. My son&apos;s kids always sleep over.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Staten Island Advance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050612/http://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/02/big_ang_mob_wives_raiola_dies.html#incart_big-photo">notes her criminal history</a>:</p><blockquote>In 2001, Raiola was arrested and convicted for selling cocaine in a New York City drug ring. She wrote in her book that, as a single mother raising her kids, it was a way for her to make money, but that she would never do it again.<p></p>

<p>In 2009, she married Neil Murphy, a sanitation worker also from Staten Island. The two went on to appear together in two reality television shows: ABC&apos;s &quot;Wife Swap&quot; and VH1&apos;s &quot;Couple&apos;s Therapy,&quot; both of which painted the picture of a rocky but largely appreciative marriage. Neil said he liked that the shows shined a different light on his wife.</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re all seeing a little more of the real Ang, and I think people see that and they like her,&quot; Murphy said at the time. &quot;She&apos;s more than just a mob wife.&quot;</p></blockquote>Raiola became a favorite of the VH1 show &quot;Mob Wives&quot; as she bartended at the bar Drunken Monkey. However, it was revealed that she actually owned the bar, which convicted felons cannot do, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050612/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/03/after_state_shuts_it_down_big.html">bar was shut down in 2015</a>. In 2014, Raiola <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050612/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/photos_opening_night_at_big_angs_br.php#photo-2">opened the Brooklyn Monkey</a> in DUMBO, but it closed a month later. <p></p>

<p>Doctors also told Raiola that the cancer was caused with her lifetime of smoking.</p>
