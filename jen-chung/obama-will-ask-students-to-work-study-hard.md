<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2009_09_dreambig.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501022837im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_dreambig.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i>Photograph of President Barack Obama&apos;s signature on a wall in a health classroom at Southwest High School in Green Bay, Wisconsin by Pete Souza/White House. Obama was at the school for a town hall meeting on health care in June; the school&apos;s phys ed and health staff asked the President to sign the wall.</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501022837/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/26744.html">criticism of President Obama&apos;s plan to speak</a> about education to schoolchildren, the White House <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501022837/http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/">released the text of the speech yesterday</a>.  Last week, one parent in Texas, apparently concerned that his school district hadn&apos;t approved the speech, t<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501022837/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/us/04school.html?ref=politics">old the NY Times</a>, <strong>&quot;I don&#x2019;t want our schools turned over to some socialist movement.</strong>&quot;  Fortunately, the &quot;socialist movement&quot; seems limited to &quot;If you quit on school - you&#x2019;re not just quitting on yourself, you&#x2019;re quitting on your country&quot; and &quot;<strong>I hope you&#x2019;ll all wash your hands a lot, and stay home from school when you don&#x2019;t feel well, so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The speech emphasizes hard work and responsibility, with Obama referring to his and First Lady Michelle Obama&apos;s own childhood challenges: &quot;I was raised by a single mother who struggled at times to pay the bills and wasn&#x2019;t always able to give us things the other kids had&quot;; &quot;Neither of [Michelle&apos;s] parents had gone to college, and they didn&#x2019;t have much. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country&quot;. In the &quot;if at first you don&apos;t succeed&quot; vein, the president mentions how JK Rowling was initially rejected by many book publishers. Obama also gives examples of American students who overcame obstacles&#x2014;language barriers, brain cancer, bouncing between foster homes&#x2014;and are now succeeding.</p>

<p>Some excerpts follow; you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501022837/http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/">read the full text here</a>. The speech will air on C-SPAN and stream live on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501022837/http://www.whitehouse.gov/mediaresources/">White House website</a> at 12 p.m.</p>

<blockquote>I know that sometimes, you get the sense from TV that you can be rich and successful without any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality TV star, when chances are, you&#x2019;re not going to be any of those things. 

<p>But the truth is, being successful is hard. You won&#x2019;t love every subject you study. You won&#x2019;t click with every teacher. Not every homework assignment will seem completely relevant to your life right this minute. And you won&#x2019;t necessarily succeed at everything the first time you try.</p></blockquote><p></p>
