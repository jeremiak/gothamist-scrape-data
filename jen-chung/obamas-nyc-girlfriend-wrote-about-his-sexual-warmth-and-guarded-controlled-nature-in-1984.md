<p>David Maraniss, who wrote the great Bill Clinton biography, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503215153/http://www.amazon.com/First-In-His-Class-Biography/dp/0684818906">First In His Class</a>, has a biography about President Barak Obama, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503215153/http://www.amazon.com/Barack-Obama-Story-David-Maraniss/dp/1439160406/ref=lp_B000APJ88U_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335993420&amp;sr=1-1">Barack Obama: The Story</a>, coming out in July, but Vanity Fair has an excerpt now. And perhaps timed for Obama&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503215153/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/president_obama_to_speak_at_barnard.php">address to Barnard College on May 14</a>, it focuses on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503215153/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/06/young-barack-obama-in-love-david-maraniss">his years in New York... and in love</a>.</p>

<p>Maraniss mentions a student from Occidental College (where Obama studied before transferring to Columbia), Alex McNear, &quot;with whom he reconnected when she spent the summer of 1982 in New York. Alex had always been fond of Barry, as she called him, and &apos;thought he was interesting in a very particular way. He really worked his way through an idea or question, turned it over, looked at it from all sides, and then he came to a precise and elegant conclusion.&apos;&quot; McNear mentioned they met at an Italian restaurant on Lexington Avenue: &quot;It was one of those dark, old Italian restaurants that don&#x2019;t exist in New York anymore. It was the kind of place where they leave you alone. I remember thinking how happy I felt just talking to him, that I could talk to him for hours.&quot;</p>

<p>Months after graduating from Columbia, in December 1983, at a party on East 13th Street, Obama met an Australian transplant, Genevieve Cook, who was an assistant teacher (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503215153/http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/barack-obamas-new-york-girlfriend">see a picture</a>), who had also lived in Indonesia as a child.  Maraniss printed passages from Cook&apos;s journal:</p><blockquote>Saturday, February 25, 1984<br>
The sexual warmth is definitely there&#x2014;but the rest of it has sharp edges and I&#x2019;m finding it all unsettling and finding myself wanting to withdraw from it all. I have to admit that I am feeling anger at him for some reason, multi-stranded reasons. His warmth can be deceptive. Tho he speaks sweet words and can be open and trusting, there is also that coolness&#x2014;and I begin to have an inkling of some things about him that could get to me.<p></p>

<p>Friday, March 9, 1984<br>
It&#x2019;s not a question of my wanting to probe ancient pools of emotional trauma &#x2026; but more a sense of you [Barack] biding your time and drawing others&#x2019; cards out of their hands for careful inspection&#x2014;without giving too much of your own away&#x2014;played with a good poker face. And as you say, it&#x2019;s not a question of intent on your part&#x2014;or deliberate withholding&#x2014;you feel accessible, and you are, in disarming ways. But I feel that you carefully filter everything in your mind and heart&#x2014;legitimate, admirable, really&#x2014;a strength, a necessity in terms of some kind of integrity. But there&#x2019;s something also there of smoothed veneer, of guardedness &#x2026; but I&#x2019;m still left with this feeling of &#x2026; a bit of a wall&#x2014;the veil.</p>

Barack&#x2014;still intrigues me, but so much going on beneath the surface, out of reach. Guarded, controlled.<br>

He grew up without a father, with a loving and intelligent mother who was often gone, with white grandparents who did the best they could. He had his missing father&#x2019;s voice and self-confidence, his mother&#x2019;s will and adventurousness, the face of his grandfather, and the coolness and matter-of-factness of his grandmother. Because of the circumstances of his young life, and of his racial composition&#x2014;part white, part black, what was known in native Hawaiian as hapa&#x2014;he had to find his own way and his own home. That is the arc of my book.&quot; The book ends with [SPOILER ALERT!] Obama attending Harvard Law School.</p>
