</div></div>					<p>Last night was Citi Field&apos;s time to shine during the All Star Game. And of course there was an idiot who decided that if his Tweet got 1000 retweets, he&apos;d run out onto the field. His Tweet gained enough traction that 18-year-old Dylan McCue-Masone of Long Island JUST HAD TO DO IT (while wearing a Robinson Cano shirt): </p>

<p>Naturally, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150336/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/twitter-dare-results-fan-running-field-all-star-game-article-1.1400666">stopped by security near second base</a>.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150336/http://storify.com/bubbaprog/idiot?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_medium=publisher&amp;utm_campaign=embed-header">the amusing/depressing Storify</a> of McCue-Masone&apos;s Tweets that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150336/http://deadspin.com/all-star-game-idiot-on-the-field-did-it-because-twitter-808296195">Deadspin put together</a>. He was charged with interfering with a professional sporting event. This means he&apos;ll be likely banned from Citi Field&#x2014;and since this was an All Star Game, does that ban extend to all MLB stadiums? Anyway, McCue-Masone is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150336/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/02/video_mets_fan_in_jorts_carter_jers.php">no Jorts Guy</a>.</p>
