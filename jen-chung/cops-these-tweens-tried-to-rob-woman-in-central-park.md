<p>The NYPD says that a 38-year-old woman was inside the park at 8 p.m&#x2014;near Fifth Avenue and East 107th Street&#x2014;when she was approached by a young girl who demanded her cellphone. When the woman refused,a young boy tried to grab her purse. She managed to hold onto her purse as the suspects fled. </p>

<p>The first suspect is described as a black female, about 12-14 years old, 4&apos;10&quot; and wearing a black jacket with a red hood. Her hair was in a braided ponytail. The second suspect is described as a black male, 10-11 years old, 4&apos;5&quot; and wearing a beige striped fleece.  A third person seen with the pair&#x2014;described as a black female around 14 years old wearing a purple shirt&#x2014;is wanted for questioning.</p>
