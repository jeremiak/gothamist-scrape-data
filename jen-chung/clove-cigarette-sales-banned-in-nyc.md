City Room <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520002839/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/ban-on-tobacco-flavored-products-becomes-city-law/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">reports</a>, &quot;The new law is more extensive than the federal Food and Drug Administration&#x2019;s ban on candy- and fruit-flavored cigarettes, which took effect last month,&quot; as it covers &quot;chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic beverage, herb or spice flavors&quot; and includes cigars and smokeless tobacco (the federal law bans only cigarettes).  However, &quot;tobacco, menthol, mint or wintergreen flavors&quot; are still for sale!</p>
