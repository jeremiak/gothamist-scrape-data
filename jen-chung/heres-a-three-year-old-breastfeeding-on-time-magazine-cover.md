The practice encourages parents to closely bond with children by wearing slings (instead of putting them in bouncers), co-sleeping (versus putting the kid in a crib) and breastfeeding until the child is ready for college&#x2014;and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529155824/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/09/blossom_still_breastfeeds_her_toddl.php">Blossom has written a book about it</a>.  But now Time Magazine is jumping into the bourgie parenting debate with a cover featuring a three-year-old boy suckling on his 26-year-old mother&apos;s breast. <em>Suck it, </em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529155824/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/newsweek_devotes_cover_to_mommy_por.php">Newsweek&apos;s rape fantasy cover</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529155824/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2114427,00.html">Time&apos;s cover piece is mainly about the guru of attachment parenting</a>, Dr. William Sears, the avuncular pediatrician whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529155824/http://www.amazon.com/The-Baby-Book-Everything-Revised/dp/0316778001">The Baby Book</a> is a go-to for many new parents. Sears&#x2014;and his wife Martha&#x2014;have been promoting attachment parenting for decades, and how women have embraced it... or not:</p>

<blockquote>Mothers seem divided into several camps. Some, like Joanne Beauregard, fully commit to the Sears model, attend to every whimper, stay home and happily cuddle their babies 24 hours a day. Sears has become a hero to this set. Jamie Lynne Grumet, a 26-year-old mother of two in Los Angeles who breast-feeds her 3-year-old son, says of Sears, &quot;He has a very gentle spirit, and I find what he&apos;s saying to be nonjudgmental and relevant.&quot; Other mothers &#x2014; particularly those who work or have multiple children &#x2014; endorse the idea of maternal closeness (who doesn&apos;t?) but think Sears is out of his mind. Modern parenting literature, after all, is full of advice about getting babies on manageable schedules, a Sears no-no, and baby stores are brimming with devices in which parents can park their babies to get much needed breaks.

<p>A third category includes mothers caught in the middle. These parents try to achieve Sears&apos; ideal of nursing, baby wearing and co-sleeping but fall short for some reason and find themselves immobilized by their seeming parental inadequacy. They suffer from what two New York City parenting consultants call &quot;posttraumatic Sears disorder.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe these parents just take Sears too literally. &quot;When somebody says attachment parenting, what comes into my mind is a mother with a newborn on one hip, a 2-year-old on the other hip and a 3-year-old on her back. And she hasn&apos;t taken a shower in a week and a half,&quot; says Jim Sears, the Searses&apos; oldest son. &quot;My parents really didn&apos;t do that, even though a lot of their readers ended up doing that.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>It&apos;s also questionable whether Sears supports working mothers. Sears, who is evangelical, wrote an evangelical version of the book, <em>The Complete Book of Christian Parenting &amp; Child Care</em>, which has a chapter, &quot;Going Back to Work?&quot; that says, &quot;[Some] mothers choose to go back to their jobs quickly simply because they don&apos;t understand how disruptive that is to the well-being of their babies. So many babies in our culture are not being cared for in the way God designed, and we as a nation are paying the price.&quot;</p>

<p>Sears tells Time that his thinking has evolved since then, but the magazine reports, &quot;the Searses also suggest mothers quit their jobs and borrow money to make up the difference. The couple subsidized their sons&apos; wives so they could stay home with the Sears grandchildren.&quot; So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529155824/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/14/ann_romney_in_1994_mitt_thought_it.php">he&apos;s like Mitt Romney&apos;s dad</a>?</p>

<p>Grumet, the mother shown on the cover (who is also a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529155824/http://iamnotthebabysitter.com/">mommy blogger</a>&quot;), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529155824/http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/10/q-a-with-jamie-lynne-grumet/">has a Q&amp;A; with Time</a>, explaining that she was breastfed until she was six (&quot;It&apos;s really warm... You feel comforted, nurtured and really, really loved. I had so much self-confidence as a child&quot;) and that she also breastfed her adopted son, which helped with bonding. As for people who might be critical of her approach:</p>

<blockquote>They are people who tell me they&#x2019;re going to call social services on me or that it&#x2019;s child molestation. I really don&#x2019;t think I can reason with those people. But as far as someone who says they&#x2019;re uncomfortable with this, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s wrong to admit this. But people have to realize this is biologically normal. It&#x2019;s not socially normal. The more people see it, the more it&#x2019;ll become normal in our culture. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m hoping. I want people to see it. 

<p>There seems to be a war going on between conventional parenting and attachment parenting, and that&#x2019;s what I want to avoid. I want everyone to be encouraging. We&#x2019;re not on opposing teams. We all need to be encouraging to each other, and I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re doing a very good job at that.</p></blockquote><p></p>
