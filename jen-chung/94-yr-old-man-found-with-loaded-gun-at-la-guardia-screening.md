<p>Last week, the Transportation Security Administration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151212182900/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/19/fake_chainsaw_tsa_photos.php">reminded travelers not to travel with items</a> like nunchuks, grenades, concealed knives and, yes, loaded guns in their carry-on. But people never learn&#x2014;like the 94-year-old man from Brooklyn who got caught with his loaded gun.</p>

<p>TSA officers say they found the .38 caliber handgun &quot;clipped to his belt as he entered a checkpoint at LaGuardia Airport.&quot; The gun had six rounds on it, and it was detected when &quot;the man entered the checkpoint body scanner.  It was attached to his belt at the small of his back.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The TSA contacted the Port Authority Police. PA spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said that the man was not arrested: &quot;The firearm was legally possessed, however he was not allowed to travel with it.&quot; The man headed to Florida, where his scores will go unsettled.</p>

<p>The elderly man will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151212182900/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/94-year-old-man-stopped-la-guardia-loaded-gun-article-1.2025269">have a hearing</a> about the matter later. </p>
