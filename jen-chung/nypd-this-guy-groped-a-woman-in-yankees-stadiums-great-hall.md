<p>A man attending a Yankees home game last month is accused of groping a woman.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred around 7 p.m. during the September 25th game which featured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228234354/http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=350925110">the White Sox vs. the Bombers</a>. A 23-year-old woman &quot;was inside the Great Hall of Yankee Stadium when the suspect approached her and grabbed her buttocks. The suspect then fled the scene.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was not injured and police say the investigation later revealed &quot;that the suspect was a guest in one of the boxes at the stadium and it was determined that the suspect is known to frequent Milton, New Jersey.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released images of the suspects, who is described as a man in his 30s and about 5&apos;7&quot;. </p>
