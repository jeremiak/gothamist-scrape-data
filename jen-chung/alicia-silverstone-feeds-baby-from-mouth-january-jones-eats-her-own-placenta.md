They wear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125357/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/super-pregnant-jessica-simpson-wears-blue-snakeskin-dress-at-baby-shower-2012193">unflattering maternity wear</a>. They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125357/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2012/02/jennifer-garner-baby-name-ben-affleck-samuel-garner-affleck.html">don&apos;t give their kids weird names</a>. And they are eating vitamins made from their placentas and/or feeding their tots with their mouths, the way January Jones and Alicia Silverstone do!<p></p>

<p>Silverstone, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125357/http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Alicia-Silverstone-on-Becoming-Vegan">touted her vegan lifestyle</a> on Oprah, wrote on her own website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125357/http://www.thekindlife.com/post/home-video-breakfast-with-baby-bear">The Kind Life</a>, &quot;I just had a delicious breakfast of miso soup, collards and radish steamed and drizzled with flax oil, cast iron mochi with nori wrapped outside, and some grated daikon. Yum! I fed Bear the mochi and a tiny bit of veggies from the soup&#x2026;from my mouth to his. It&#x2019;s his favorite...and mine. He literally crawls across the room to attack my mouth if I&#x2019;m eating. This video was taken about a month or 2 ago when he was a bit wobbly. Now he is grabbing my mouth to get the food!&quot; And here&apos;s video!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125357/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/03/27/alicia-silverstone-chews-food-for-her-11-month-old-child-bear-blu/">One doctor told Fox News</a>, &quot;There are those who think that a mom chewing a baby&#x2019;s food provides helpful enzymes from her mouth but it doesn&#x2019;t seem like a hygienic practice. Various viruses and bacteria, but especially herpes virus, may be passed from mother to baby. These microbes present a challenge that the infant&#x2019;s immune system may not be ready for. So the practice is questionable for safety, and then, there&#x2019;s a certain ick factor here that needs to be considered.&quot;</p>

<p>More potential ick factor: January Jones told People that she keeps her energy up with her baby son by &quot;eating well, with vitamins and teas, and with placenta capsulation.&#x201D;  Yes, Jones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125357/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/hot_new_trend_mothers_eating_their.php">is eating her placenta, like other moms</a>. Jones matter-of-factly says, &quot;Your placenta gets dehydrated and made into vitamins. It&#x2019;s something I was very hesitant about, but we&#x2019;re the only mammals who don&#x2019;t ingest our own placentas... It&#x2019;s not witch-crafty or anything! I suggest it to all moms!&quot; But Betty Draper would have slapped her face.</p>
