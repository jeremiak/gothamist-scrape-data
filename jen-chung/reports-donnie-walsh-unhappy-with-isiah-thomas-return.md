The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172057/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/2010/08/08/2010-08-08_donnie_thought_about_quitting.html">Daily News reports</a> that Walsh &quot;considered resigning&quot; over the move while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172057/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/walsh_your_back_AgooDKBkBqzS3vtJDZu7VP">Post says</a> Walsh is &quot;livid.&quot;  And it seems like other Knicks executives were anti-Thomas as well!<p></p>

<p>Both papers say that Knicks owner James Dolan tried to get Walsh to hire Thomas as the team&apos;s general manager, but Walsh refused. According to the Post, &quot;When Walsh told Thomas he objected, Thomas went back to Dolan, who still has a love affair with the Hall of Famer and seemingly is on a mission to rehab Thomas&apos; image. Without Walsh&apos;s knowledge, Dolan and Thomas hatched a scheme in which Thomas could become a part-time consultant.&quot; However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172057/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/2010/08/08/2010-08-08_donnie_thought_about_quitting.html">Daily News explains</a>, &quot;Besides Walsh and Knicks head coach Mike D&apos;Antoni being against the move, Garden vice chairman Hank Ratner and Garden president Scott O&apos;Neil voiced their displeasure but were overruled by Dolan, sources said.&quot;  Also, at the end of the day, it&apos;s expected Thomas will make his way back as the GM.</p>

<p>The News details how Thomas apparently convinced Dolan that &quot;Walsh and D&apos;Antoni don&apos;t have street credibility with today&apos;s young NBA stars, their agents and their entourages.&quot; One source told the Post, &quot;<strong>Donnie doesn&apos;t want him there, nobody wants him there but Dolan. Isiah seems to have Jim wrapped around his finger.</strong>&quot;  </p>
