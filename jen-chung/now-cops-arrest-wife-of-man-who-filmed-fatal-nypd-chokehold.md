<p>On Monday, Ramsey Orta, who filmed the police administering a fatal chokehold during an arrest, said that police were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/05/ramsey_orta_eric_garner.php">gleeful when they arrested him for criminal gun possession</a>, and he accused the police of setting him up. Now Orta&apos;s wife has been arrested. At this point, anyone with the last name &quot;Orta&quot; should probably consider changing it to Torta. Mmmm, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/27/a_torta_grills.php">tortas</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2014/08/chrissie_ortiz_wife_of_ramsey.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Staten Island Advance reports</a> that Chrissie Ortiz, 30, &quot;was arrested on assault charges, an NYPD spokesman said. Ms. Ortiz was arrested at 5:30 p.m.  on Tuesday in front of 206 Bay St. in a dispute with a female.&quot; She was released on a desk appearance ticket.</p>

<p>Police say that Orta, 22, who has a lengthy arrest record, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/04/man_who_filmed_nypds_fatal_chokehol.php">tried to hide a gun </a>on a 17-year-old girl on Saturday. Orta has been in the spotlight since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">Daily News obtained his video</a> documenting the July 17 arrest of Eric Garner, who died while the police were trying to restrain him and put him in a chokehold. Last week, Garner&apos;s death <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/eric_garners_death_ruled_a_homicide.php">was ruled a homicide</a>.</p>

<p>Orta and Ortiz both have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/05/ramsey_orta_eric_garner.php">insisted that he was framed</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014952/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/ramsey_ortas_family_questions.html#incart_m-rpt-1">She said on Sunday</a>, &quot;They park across the street, they follow him. I&apos;m speaking [about] the NYPD. It&apos;s obvious. Once they rule this a homicide, now you all of a sudden find something on him? Come on, let&apos;s be realistic. Even the dumbest criminal would know not to be doing something like that outside. So the whole story doesn&apos;t fit at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Orta remains in police custody on $75,000 bail.</p>
