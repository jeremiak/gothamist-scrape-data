<p>Nikola Tesla was a visionary who, in addition to inventing alternating current&#x2014;the basis for modern day electricity&#x2014;also imagined robots, radio, radar, remote control, transmitting messages and images wirelessly and much more. But he died alone at the New Yorker Hotel, in debt after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033214/http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html">missed opportunities</a>, trying to fund his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033214/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/donate_money_towards_saving_nikola.php">expensive Long Island laboratory</a> and increasingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033214/http://www.ancient-code.com/the-extraterrestrial-messages-of-nikola-tesla/">outlandish ideas</a>. Tomorrow night, PBS&apos;s <em>American Experience</em> is examining Tesla&apos;s legacy today with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033214/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/tesla/"><em>Tesla</em></a>.</p>

<p>Tesla arrived in NYC from Serbia in 1884, and went to meet his hero, Thomas Edison. As a press release for the one-hour documentary explains: </p>

<blockquote>Tesla was convinced that he had solved the problem that had plagued Edison&#x2019;s plans to electrify the world, not just the tip of lower Manhattan. Edison relied on direct current (DC) to transmit electricity, which was severely limiting. Tesla had found a way to do what had so far stumped everyone: invent a motor that could run on alternating current (AC), making the distribution of electricity across long distances possible. 

<p>Edison immediately hired Tesla, who abruptly quit just six months later, frustrated by Edison&#x2019;s refusal to adopt his idea. After a grim winter of digging ditches, his luck turned. The wealthy inventor and entrepreneur George Westinghouse knew that the future &#x2014; and immense profits &#x2014; would be found in electricity and he quickly bought the young inventor&#x2019;s patents, making Tesla a rich man. But when Westinghouse became overextended, he revised Tesla&#x2019;s deal, stripping him of a royalty that would have made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. Nevertheless, Westinghouse&#x2019;s gamble on Tesla&#x2019;s ideas paid off; the company beat Edison for the contracts to wire the Columbian Exposition in Chicago and to harness Niagara Falls to generate AC current, ending once and for all Edison&#x2019;s hopes for his now antiquated DC technology.<br>
&#xA0;<br>
Tesla was now a celebrity, the new Edison. He moved into the luxurious Astor House, dined at Delmonico&#x2019;s, and became a friend to the rich and famous, including Mark Twain, John Jacob Astor and J.P. Morgan. But he was plagued with a plethora of odd phobias that had followed him since childhood, when he often suffered from inexplicable visions and a difficulty in separating reality from his imagination. Everything he did had to be divisible by three, he had a manic fear of germs, and couldn&#x2019;t bear the sight of earrings or the touch of human hair.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In an exclusive clip from <em>Tesla</em>, this part of the documentary describes how Tesla moved back to NYC after a stint in Colorado. He was living at the Waldorf-Astoria and working in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033214/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2014/01/revisiting-the-history-of-nikola-teslas-lower-east-side-laboratories-on-east-houston-and-grand-street/">Houston Street laboratory</a> as he managed to fund his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033214/http://www.teslasciencecenter.org/wardenclyffe/">200-acre Long Island laboratory, Wardenclyffe</a>, with the help of a famous financier:</p>

<p>&quot;Many people may have heard of Tesla, but have no idea who this fascinating genius was or how influential he continues to be,&quot; said  Mark Samels, executive producer of <em>Tesla</em>. &quot;While researching a previous American Experience film about Thomas Edison [Tesla&apos;s former employer], it was Nikola Tesla who kept drawing our interest. He had an uncanny ability to imagine the world we live in today and his work continues to spur innovation.&quot;</p>
