<p>The cascading revelations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/fox_news_oreilly_allegations.php">alleged sexual harassment</a>&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html">multi-million settlements to suppress them</a>&#x2014;surrounding Bill O&apos;Reilly has led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/oreilly-advertisers-harassment-allegations/521976/">dozens of advertisers fleeing</a> Fox News&apos; ratings-powerhouse program, <em>The O&apos;Reilly Factor</em>. Now, multiple outlets report that the Murdochs, who control Fox News, are considering ending O&apos;Reilly&apos;s tenure at the network.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/https://www.wsj.com/articles/fox-is-preparing-to-cut-ties-with-bill-oreilly-1492566611">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, which is also owned by the Murdochs, &quot;Fox News is preparing to cut ties with star anchor Bill O&#x2019;Reilly, according to people close to the situation, after revelations that he and Fox parent 21st Century Fox settled multiple sexual harassment complaints led to an exodus of advertisers from his show and mounting pressure on the network. A final resolution on the fate of Mr. O&#x2019;Reilly... could come as early as the next several days, the people said.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/business/media/fox-bill-oreilly.html?_r=0">The NY Times adds</a>:</p><blockquote>Mr. O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s fate at the network is expected to be discussed on Thursday at a board meeting for Fox News&#x2019;s parent company, 21st Century Fox. Chief among the considerations is a continuing investigation into Mr. O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s behavior conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.<p></p>

<p>Pressure on the company increased on Tuesday when another woman reported sexual harassment allegations against Mr. O&#x2019;Reilly to 21st Century Fox.</p>

<p>The company recently renewed Mr. O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s contract, and the Murdoch family, which controls the company, has stood by him as allegations piled up. But after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html">New York Times article this month detailed harassment allegations</a> against him, more than 50 companies have pulled their advertising from his show.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The latest allegations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-new-accuser-1202033504/">involved an African-American woman</a> who says she worked near O&apos;Reilly; attorney Lisa Bloom said, &quot;She did not work directly for Bill O&#x2019;Reilly, but she worked near him and she alleges that he engaged in a campaign for months of sexual harassment against her. He wouldn&#x2019;t speak to her, other than to say things like, &#x2018;Mmm Hmm,&#x2019; make grunting noises like an animal, she alleges, leering at her, looking at her cleavage and her legs, and he would call her &#x2018;hot chocolate,&#x2019; which she found to be very offensive.&quot;</p>

<p>O&apos;Reilly has been on what he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/is-bill-oreilly-going-off-the-air.html">called a previously-planned vacation</a> this week. New York magazine&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/sources-the-murdochs-are-turning-against-bill-oreilly.html">Gabriel Sherman reported yesterday</a> that James and Lachlan Murdoch, sons of News Corp. and 21st Century Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, were turning against O&apos;Reilly: &quot;Sons James and Lachlan have been arguing that O&#x2019;Reilly needs to go, say these sources, though their father, Rupert, has resisted that outcome. The prospect of dumping O&#x2019;Reilly &#x2014; once unimaginable &#x2014; has gained steam this week due in part to street protests outside Fox News headquarters and advertiser boycotts on O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s air. One network insider said Fox executives are alarmed by the severity of the ad-revenue decline. &apos;It&#x2019;s worse than Glenn Beck,&apos; the insider said, referring to the advertiser revolt that helped derail Beck&#x2019;s Fox News career in 2011.&quot;</p>

<p>Fox News has been reeling from Roger Ailes&apos;s departure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/06/fox_news_gretchen_carlson_20.php">amid numerous claims of sexual harassment by female employees</a>. O&apos;Reilly&apos;s lawyer has blamed the &quot;far-left&quot; for coordinating a &#x201C;brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America&quot;:</p>

<p>CNN reports that another issue is that, ratings and advertising revenue aside, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/19/media/fox-news-bill-oreilly-disliked/index.html">O&apos;Reilly is simply not very well-liked at Fox News</a>. Hard to believe...</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Douglas Wigdor, who is representing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007211258/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/29/fox_news_racism_lawsuit.php">two women who are suing former Fox News finance chief</a> Judith Slater for racial discrimination, issued a rebuttal to O&apos;Reilly&apos;s attorney&apos;s remarks:</p><blockquote>Yesterday, Marc Kasowitz issued a statement on behalf of Bill O&#x2019;Reilly that stated that, &#x201C;Bill O&#x2019;Reilly has been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America. This law firm has uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying O&#x2019;Reilly for political and financial reasons.&#x201D;  As someone who supported and contributed to the Trump campaign and who routinely watches Fox News, I can categorically deny, and find it offensive, that my Firm is being accused of being controlled by far-left organizations.  To the contrary, we have and will continue to vindicate the rights of all employees to ensure that they are treated fairly and lawfully regardless of who they work for or what political beliefs such employer may support.  In the coming days, we will be filing additional complaints and allegations against Fox News that will shed further light on the abhorrent, intolerable, and unlawful working conditions that our clients have been forced to endure.  </blockquote><p></p>
