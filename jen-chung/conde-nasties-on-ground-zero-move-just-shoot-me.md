<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="2010_07_andreleontalley.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608074442im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_andreleontalley.jpg" width="240" height="196"> <br> <i>Doesn&apos;t everyone have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608074442/http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2009/08/another_september_issue_clip_a.html">Louis Vuitton towel</a> for tennis lessons?</i></div> Yesterday, Cond&#xE9; Nast sent a memo to its employees alerting them that it was negotiating a move from Times Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608074442/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/03/conde_nast_is_moving_way_downtownto.php">to the World Trade Center</a> in 2014.  One &quot;insider&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608074442/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/down_town_country_qHgatUxqyezQ4GW39xMq1O?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t think they would have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608074442/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/08/conde_nast_officially_in_talks.html">sent the memo</a> if it wasn&apos;t a done deal,&quot; and many staffers were upset enough to say things like, &quot;It&apos;s just depressing. Everybody is pretty bummed out about it. Nobody wants to move down there,&quot; and &quot;<strong>If I&apos;m still here by then, just shoot me.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>Currently, the publisher of glossies such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, and The New Yorker occupies 800,000 square feet in 4 Times Square; at <strike>Freedom Tower</strike> 1 World Trade Center, Cond&#xE9; Nast would get 1 million square feet.  The Observer talked to some staffers as well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608074442/http://www.observer.com/2010/media/conde-staffers-one-world-trade">with one noting</a>, &quot;Basically everyone wants to get out of Times Square officially anyway. I did have a flash of concern. Of all the addresses in the world, do I really want mine to be One World Trade Center? ... <strong>Could you really pick a better target than Cond&#xE9; Nast? Literally everything that&apos;s wrong with the West.</strong>&#x201D;</p>
