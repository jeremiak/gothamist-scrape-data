But now, armed with a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308192439/http://gothamist.com/tags/ipad">iPad</a>, he&apos;s asking Apple innovator Steve Jobs to bring an Apple Store to Brooklyn, explaining, &#x201C;I like to call Brooklyn the &#x2018;Creative Capital of New York City,&#x2019; and we have Mac-lovers everywhere&#x2014;from Williamsburg&#x2019;s indie musicians and the poets of Fort Greene to the artists and tech startups of DUMBO and the more than 30,000 visitors who attend our internationally renowned Brooklyn Book Festival. If there&#x2019;s one thing we know, it&#x2019;s that where trendsetting artists live and thrive, economies improve. Brooklyn&#x2019;s got the creative energy and activity every city competes for&#x2014;and we need tech retailers like Apple to meet that market demand.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Markowitz e-mail:</p><blockquote>Dear Mr. Jobs:  <br>
 <br>
As you surely know, in the creative world, there&#x2019;s no place hotter than Brooklyn, USA. Just like &#x201C;Apple,&#x201D; Brooklyn is now an international &#x201C;brand,&#x201D; signifying the coolest place on earth to live, work, play and create.   <br>
 <br>
I know you&#x2019;re always dreaming up the next big thing&#x2014;here&#x2019;s a suggestion: Hit the big time and bring an Apple store to Brooklyn!   </blockquote><p></p>
