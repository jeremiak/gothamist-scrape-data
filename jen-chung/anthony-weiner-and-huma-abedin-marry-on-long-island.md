Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn, Queens) married Huma Abedin, the longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604221833/http://www.politico.com/blogs/maggiehaberman/0710/WeinerAbedin_wedded_bliss.html?showall">Via Politico</a>, Weiner&apos;s office released these details:<blockquote>Today, Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, surrounded by their family and friends, were married in the garden at Oheka Castle in Huntington, L.I. <p></p>

<p>The bride wore a gown designed by her good friend Oscar de la Renta. </p>

<p>Bryan Rafanelli oversaw the design and plan of the wedding celebration. The ceremony was officiated by President William Jefferson Clinton.</p></blockquote><br>

<p>Noting how Weiner is Jewish and Abdein is Muslim, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604221833/http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=65211">Yeshiva World News headline</a> was &quot;Christian President Marries Jewish Congressman to Moslem Political Aide on Shabbos.&quot; And, for you to file away as useless information, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604221833/http://www.oheka.com/">Oheka Castle</a> is where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604221833/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20332050_20717228,00.html">Kevin Jonas got married</a> last December.</p>
