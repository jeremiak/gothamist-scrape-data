<p>White collar perp walk time: WNBC is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162636/http://www.wnbc.com/news/16645621/detail.html?dl=mainclick">reporting that the FBI arrested former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers</a> Ralph Cioffi Jr. and Matthew Tannin this morning.  Why?  Because they allegedly reassured investors the hedge fund was a-okay &quot;before the funds lost more than $1.5 billion in value.&quot;  </p>

<p>The WSJ&apos;s Law Blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162636/http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/06/19/guilty-or-innocent-pre-gaming-the-bear-fund-manager-indictments/">breaks it down</a>:  On April 22, 2007, Tannin emailed Cioffi, fearing &quot;the market for complex bond securities was &apos;toast.&apos;&quot;  Then &quot;Cioffi and a third colleague persuaded Tannin that he was overreacting,&quot; and a few days later, Tannin and Cioffi promised investors all was well.  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162636/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aZjI.EgNDuFQ&amp;refer=home">Bloomberg News writes</a>, &quot;The charges would be the first from a federal investigation of possible fraud by banks and mortgage companies whose investments in subprime loans and securities plunged in value, causing losses that now total $396.6 billion.&quot; </p>

<p>The two were arrested at their homes--Cioffi in NYC, Tannin in New Jersey.  The authorities will release more details later, but Tannin&apos;s attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162636/http://www.amny.com/news/local/sns-ap-bear-stearns-investigation,0,6551841.story">says her client is innocent</a>, &quot;He is being made a scapegoat for a widespread market crisis. He looks forward to his acquittal.&quot;  This year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162636/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/16/jp_morgan_chase_2.php">JP Morgan bailed out Bear Stearns</a> by buying it as a bargain basement price.  </p>
