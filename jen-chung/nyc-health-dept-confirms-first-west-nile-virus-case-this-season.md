<p>Today, the NYC Health Department announced the discovery of the first case of West Nile virus this season. Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett said, &quot;This season&#x2019;s first case of West Nile virus is a reminder to protect ourselves against mosquito bites. Wearing mosquito repellent when you are outdoors, getting rid of standing water, and installing window screens will reduce your risk of getting bitten.&quot;</p>

<p>The Health Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130652/http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2046/mosquito-spraying-schedule">has been</a> spraying pesticides (nine times) and aerial larviciding (seven times) this summer, given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130652/http://gothamist.com/tags/zika">worries about Zika</a> as well as West Nile virus, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130652/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/mosquito_beat.php">detected in June</a>. The confirmed case of West Nile is a Brooklyn man who has encephalitis; he is over 40 and has underlying health conditions. </p>

<p>Commissioner Bassett added, &quot;New Yorkers age 60 and older or people with weakened immune systems should be especially careful as they are more likely to become seriously ill, and in rare cases die, if infected.&quot; This in the DOH&apos;s description of West Nile:</p><blockquote>West Nile virus infection can cause a mild or moderate flu-like illness, or sometimes no symptoms at all. In some people, particularly those 60 and older, West Nile virus can cause a serious and potentially fatal infection of the brain and spinal cord. The most common symptoms are headache, fever, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. Symptoms of more severe illness can also include changes in mental status and muscle weakness. If you think you have symptoms of West Nile virus, see your doctor right away. </blockquote>There have been 319 cases of West Nile in NYC since it was first found in the U.S. in 1999; for comparison, by this time in 2014, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130652/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/09/mosquitos_viral.php">five cases of West Nile</a>.<p></p>
