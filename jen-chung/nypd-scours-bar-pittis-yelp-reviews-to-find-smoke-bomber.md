<p>Police are still trying to find the mysterious suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012658/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/10/breaking_smoke_bomb_thrown_into_gre.php">threw a smoke bomb into Greenwich Village restaurant Bar Pitti</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012658/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/14/bar_pitti_smoke_bomb_video.php">disappeared back into a subway grate</a>. And now the search has gone... online.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012658/http://nypost.com/2014/10/15/restaurant-smoke-bomb-probers-eye-bad-yelp-reviews/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;NYPD detectives are scouring Web sites like Yelp to see if the guy who smoke-bombed a posh Greenwich Village eatery is a disgruntled online critic who took his anger too far... &apos;They&#x2019;re looking at negative restaurant reviews,&apos; a law-enforcement source said. &apos;They&#x2019;re looking for stuff like, &#x2018;This place sucks and I&#x2019;m going to blow this f-king place up.&#x2019; They&#x2019;re looking for particularly nasty reviews.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>One Yelper who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012658/http://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-pitti-new-york?hrid=aTMT2LylGGdSFcWLRPcACQ">only gave one star to Bar Pitti</a> wrote, &quot;Unbelievably rude service. Four of us spent $309 to have the menus snatched away from us after ordering... to top it off, we had to go across the street to the ATM to get out THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CASH because they don&apos;t accept cards. Who doesn&apos;t accept credit cards in 2014??? A shady restaurant trying to scam IRS!!! That&apos;s who!!!!!&quot; while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012658/http://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-pitti-new-york?hrid=Id_JGz_WDAcM6_vvHNrWRg">another concurs</a> with the IRS conspiracy, &quot;Watch out for your bill! These guys are cheaters. They pull that italian charm and overcharge and add 22% to tables for 2 people. I should call the IRS for this place. I am sure their books are super cooked given cash only and all the cheating and stealing going on. Oh btw: food is mediocre at best. There is no such a thing as good italian food that is prepared under 1min.&quot; </p>

<p>The suspect can be seen<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012658/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/11/cops_release_video_of_suspect_throw.php"> emerging from a yellow emergency subway hatch</a> (which connects to the West 4th Street station), so the Post adds, &quot;[Police] are also talking to homeless people who roam the subway tunnels along with MTA workers as they seek potential witnesses.&quot; </p>

<p>MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012658/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/nyregion/smoke-bomb-raises-concerns-for-mta.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;We take security of our system very seriously, and we will take all necessary steps to secure our system,&quot; but the Times reports, &quot;The emergency exits are supposed to be locked from the street but are designed to be opened from beneath street level in case of an emergency, according to an authority police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to talk about the case. &apos;It&#x2019;s pretty much just a push bar,&apos; the officer said.&quot;</p>
