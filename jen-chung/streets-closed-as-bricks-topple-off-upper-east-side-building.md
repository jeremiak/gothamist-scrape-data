<p>A five-block stretch of First Avenue remains closed this morning after bricks fell from a 34-story apartment building&apos;s facade onto the sidewalk. One person said it sounded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202414/http://www.fox5ny.com/news/56313149-story">like a &quot;hail storm.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202414/http://streeteasy.com/building/st-tropez">building</a>, on East 64th Street and First Avenue, has been undergoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202414/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repointing">repointing</a>, and bricks fell away from the facade around 10:30 p.m. Some of the bricks fell onto a setback. Others fell into the street. </p>

<p>One man told NBC New York, &quot;All of sudden it sounded like there was an incredible hailstorm. I saw huge chunks of what I thought was hail, but then that didn&apos;t make sense. And huge noises.&quot;<br>

<p> Another woman said, &quot;The first brick hit the ground, all of a sudden there was some dust and smoke. It sounded like fireworks or gunshots, and the next thing I know, I saw four people running in all different directions.&quot;</p>
