<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_11_seanharris.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111449im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_seanharris.jpg" width="230" height="268" class="image-left"> </span>The Nassau County DA&apos;s office has charged a NYC teacher with loan sharking, claiming that Queens ISI 141 gym instructor Sean Harris &quot;lent a third party $40,000 at an annual interest rate more than four times the legal limit.&quot;</p>

<p>Harris, 36, allegedly &quot;agreed to lend $40,000 to a third party at an interest rate of 2% per week, amounting to an annual interest rate of 104%.&quot;  The legal limit is 25%.  </p>

<p>When he&apos;s not teaching, Harris is a professional bodybuilder and has a pending case for &quot;Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Seventh Degree for steroid possession.&quot; His new charge is &quot;Criminal Usury in the Second Degree,&quot; and DA Kathleen Rice said, &quot;This defendant was trusted to educate children and serve as a positive role model in their lives, but instead he conducted himself like a common criminal.&quot; The NYC Department of Education <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111449/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/hunk_teach_is_hark_da_VOVFBpJUyeeIodD59nEjjJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">tells the Post</a> that Harris has been removed from teaching since earlier this year.</p>

<p>His lawyer declined to give a statement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111449/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/east-meadow-man-accused-of-loan-sharking-1.3373251">telling Newsday</a> Harris will &quot;fight this charge in court, not in the press.&quot;</p>
