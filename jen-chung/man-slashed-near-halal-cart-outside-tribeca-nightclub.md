<p>A 55-year-old man was slashed in the neck on a lower Manhattan sidewalk earlier this morning. </p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson says the incident took place at 3:12 a.m., outside 285 West Broadway, the home of &quot;Tribeca&apos;s newest hotspot&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061515/http://www.haus-nyc.com/">Haus Nightclub</a> (according to its website). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061515/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-slashed-in-west-village/1399623/">WABC 7 reports</a> that this is where a halal truck was parked, &quot;[T]he victim got into a dispute with another man, who slashed him in the neck near the truck on Canal Street and ran away.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim may have also pushed the suspect. Food car worker Khaled Mahmoud believes the slasher was following the victim and intended to rob him. &quot;He came close to him, very close to him,&quot; Mahmoud <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061515/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/24/slashing-soho/">told WCBS 2</a>. &quot;He said, &apos;Please go back, what do you want from me?&apos; And then he slash him.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital and has been released. The investigation is ongoing. This morning&apos;s incident comes two days after a halal food truck owner allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061515/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/food-vendor-slashes-rival-back-west-side-turf-feud-article-1.2683855">slashed another</a> in a turf feud in Chelsea.</p>
