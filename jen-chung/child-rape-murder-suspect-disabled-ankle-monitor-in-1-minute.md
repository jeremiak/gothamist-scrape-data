<p>Authorities in upstate NY wondered how a man under GPS monitoring for child pornography possession was able to deactivate the monitor, enabling him to carjack a woman and her 10-year-old daughter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604133000/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/16/upstate_man_rapes_10-yr-old_girl_ki.php">raping the girl and then killing the mother</a>, last week. But now they know how David Renz managed to elude police detection: He successfully dismantled the ankle monitor and put it back together in an minute, exploiting a flaw with the monitoring company.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604133000/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/it_took_less_than_one_minute_f.html#incart_most-comments">According to Syracuse.com</a>, at 7:08 p.m. last Thursday, Renz &quot;took apart his GPS ankle monitor, removed it from his ankle, reassembled it and set it down, off of his body&quot; in less than 60 seconds.:</p><blockquote>At 7:09 p.m., Renz was a free man. When Renz took the bracelet apart, a company in Colorado that makes the electronic monitors received an alert. But the company, BI Inc., didn&#x2019;t notify the court officers in Syracuse who are responsible for making sure that Renz stayed away from children and obeyed a 9 p.m. curfew.<p></p>

<p>In the past, court officers were getting alerts telling them the bracelets had been tampered with when they&#x2019;d simply been knocked against bathtubs or walls, momentarily interrupting the signal, [Chief U.S. Probation Officer Matt] Brown said.</p>

<p>Because of this, they asked BI not to notify them when a bracelet&#x2019;s signal was interrupted for a short period of time, he said. Brown wouldn&#x2019;t say exactly how long that window is, but it is more than a minute.</p></blockquote>Brown said, &quot;We finally figured out that the circuit can be interrupted because of something as simple and innocent as that,&quot; and apparently BI has admitted that this has happened before. Now the U.S. Office of Probation and Pretrial Services is reviewing its contract with BI. <p></p>

<p>Authorities say that Renz, 27, carjacked elementary school librarian Lori Bresnahan, 47, as she was leaving a gymnastics class at a mall in the Syracuse suburb of Clay with her 10-year-old daughter around 8:30 p.m. last Thursday night. He allegedly tied up the woman while he raped the young girl in a deserted part of the parking lot.  The girl escaped as Renz was stabbing Bresnahan to death. Police eventually found him in a wooded area near the parking lot.</p>

<p>Renz was facing charges related to child pornography possession&#x2014;he admitted to downloading about 100 gigabytes of child porn, made up of more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images. He had a 9 p.m. curfew and was told to stay away from children.</p>

<p>Police still think the attack was random, though Renz and Bresnahan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604133000/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/accused_killer_victim_both_at.html">overlapped for over two years</a> while he was a student at SUNY Oswego and she worked as an instructor there.</p>
