<p>John Oliver has pounced on that story about the Port Authority pressuring housewares store <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133200/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/29/port_authority_wants_fishs_eddy_to.php">Fishs Eddy to stop selling items with drawings of Port Authority-controlled structures</a>, like the Lincoln Tunnel and the old Twin Towers. The Port Authority claims that the use of the drawings harms the agency&apos;s reputation, but last night Oliver used his HBO program to humorously state the obvious: &quot;Its reputation is terrible. <strong>Because the only thing people think of when they hear its name is the Port Authority Bus Terminal</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Oliver continued, &quot;The Port Authority Bus Terminal, also known as the single worst place on Planet Earth. It is a place where cockroaches run up to people yelling, &apos;Please get me out of here.&apos;&quot; His crew also asked New Yorkers for their impressions of it: Answers included, &quot;Pretty gross,&quot; &quot;Really creeps me out&quot; and &quot;Fucking disgusting.&quot;</p>

<p>Last Week Tonight also reminded viewers of an excellent <em>Everybody Hates Chris</em> episode called &quot;Everybody Hates The Port Authority&quot;&#x2014;Chris&apos; mom warns the family there are &quot;pickpockets, pimps, murders, child molesters and thieves&quot; there:</p>
