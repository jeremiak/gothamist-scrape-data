<p>Twitter founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151226215520/http://twitter.com/jack">Jack Dorsey</a> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151226215520/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57574758/the-innovator-jack-dorsey/">profiled on 60 Minutes last night</a> and talked about starting Twitter and his credit card payment startup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151226215520/https://squareup.com/">Square</a>. And, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151226215520/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-25/twitter-dorsey-becomes-billionaire-as-square-value-soars.html">any billionaire</a>, he discussed his interest in politics&#x2014;specifically being mayor of New York City.</p>

<p>As befitting someone who was fascinated with trains as a child, Dorsey walked around the Times Square subway station with 60 Minutes correspondent Lara Logan discussing how much he loves the Big Apple, &quot;What I love about New York is just the electricity I feel right away. I mean just look at us in this station. There&apos;s just people walking everywhere and everyone.&quot; Logan said, &quot;Chaos?&quot; to which he replied, &quot;It&apos;s chaos. It&apos;s kinda like being in a car in the middle of a thunderstorm, right. Everything is raging around you, but you&apos;re safe inside that car. So New York feels very much to me like that.&quot; </p>

<p>Logan said in a voiceover, &quot;Jack Dorsey knows it helps to be a billionaire if you run for mayor in New York. It&apos;s worked before. But if he&apos;s serious about running, and he says he is, it will be interesting to see just how he communicates with the voters,&quot; and asked him how he feels about communicating with people&#x2014;face-to-face or texts? </p>

<blockquote>Jack Dorsey: I guess my natural state would be through mediation of letters or through texts, all those mediums, I definitely find ease with. But do I appreciate as much as face-to-face communication? No. Do I feel like I&apos;m an expert in having a normal conversation face-to-face? Absolutely not. That&apos;s just not my natural state. I would rather be walking Land&apos;s End and thinking about things.

<p>Lara Logan: And tweeting.</p>

<p>Jack Dorsey: And tweeting.</p></blockquote>Well, Dorsey <em>is</em> pals with Mayor Blomberg&#x2014;they&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151226215520/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/11/mike_bloomberg_tweets_his_day_away.php">been Twitter buddies since 2009</a>&#x2014;but Bloomberg has totally gotten the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151226215520/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/watch_live_now_bloombergs_latest_up.php">hang of lots of face-to-face time with New Yorkers</a>. <p></p>

Well, Dorsey&apos;s gotta figure out if he really wants to be mayor of NYC because he lives in San Francisco now!</p>
