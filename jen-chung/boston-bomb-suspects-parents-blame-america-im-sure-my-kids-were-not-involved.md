<p>As details continue to emerge about Boston bomb suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/21/officials_believe_boston_bombers_li.php">Tamerlan</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/alleged_boston_bomber_blames_his_ji.php">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a> (like their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/25/boston_bombers_had_aspirational_pla.php">alleged desire to hit NYC next</a>), their parents spoke at a press conference today&#x2014;and decried the investigation, accusing U.S. authorities of setting their sons up. Their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, also regretted their time in the U.S., &quot;Yes, I would prefer not to live in America now. Like, why did I even go there &#x2014; why?&quot;</p>

<p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/20/fbi_investigated_bomb_suspect_tamer.php">accused of planting bombs</a> near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php">April 15 incident killed three</a> and injured at over 200 people. The brothers, who moved to the United States as children from Chechnya, were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/one_boston_bomb_suspect_is_dead_as.php">chased by police last Thursday</a>, resulting in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/massachusetts_authorities_give_upda.php">apprehended on Friday night</a> after a day-long manhunt. </p>

<p>Zubeidat Tsarnaeva spoke at a press conference in Dagestan, a southern Russian province, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/world/europe/parents-say-boston-bombing-suspects-are-innocent.html?hp&amp;_r=0">was emotional while discussing</a> what she claimed was video of her older son&apos;s capture, &quot;He was alive. Why did they need to kill him? Why not send him to Guant&#xE1;namo or whatever? Why did they kill him? Why did they have to kill him? They got him alive. He was in their hands.&quot;</p>

<p>She also said that her family should have stayed in their native Dagestan, &quot;You know, my kids would be with us, and we would be, like, fine... I thought America is going to, like, protect us, our kids, it&apos;s going to be safe... America took my children away from me.&quot;</p>

<p>Father Anzor Tsarnaev is coming to the United States soon, explaining, &quot;I am going there to see my son and bury my older one. I have no bad thoughts, I&apos;m not planning any bombings, I don&apos;t want to do anything. I&apos;m not offended by anyone. I want to know the truth, what happened. I want to work it out.&quot;</p>

<p>Tsarnaeva also wondered if the bombings were real, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/25/boston-marathon-bombing-suspects-father-says-will-return-to-us/">suggesting that the blood at the finish line was paint</a>, &quot;That&apos;s what I want to know, because everybody&apos;s talking about it &#x2014; that this is a show, that&apos;s what I want to know... There is a lot that is unexplained.&quot;</p>

<p>The grieving mother also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161140/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/boston-marathon-bombings-suspects-mother-speaks-out/2013/04/25/d9842f96-ada9-11e2-98ef-d1072ed3cc27_story.html?hpid=z2">said she told the FBI</a>, when they questioned her about Tamerlan Tsarnaev&apos;s possible radicalization, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t see any reason to worry.&quot; As for authorities&apos; claims that her sons were responsible for the tragedy, she said, &quot;<strong>I don&#x2019;t believe it, and I won&#x2019;t believe it.</strong>&quot; She emphasized, &quot;I am sure that my kids were not involved in anything.&quot;</p>
