<p>A 26-year-old woman was sexually assaulted during a violent home invasion robbery yesterday in the Bronx, police say.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at around 1:19 p.m., officers responded to an apartment building on Magenta Street. Hours earlier, the victim had opened her door to two men who claimed they were Con Edison workers and who then shoved their way into her apartment.</p>

<p>Police say that one of the men went into the kitchen to get a knife and the pair tied the woman to a coffee table. Then one man sexually assaulted her before the pair fled with $50.</p>

The neighbor said she had no idea what was happening until she walked out of her apartment and heard the woman&apos;s pleading for help in a whisper. &quot; </p>

<p>The neighbor said, &quot;I said, &apos;I&apos;m here, mami, come to the door, open.&apos; And she was like, &apos;That&apos;s the problem, I can&apos;t. I&apos;m bound, I was tied up.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing. </p>
