</div></div>					<p>Finally, we get the money shot: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a>, everyone&apos;s favorite idiot crotch-shot ex-Congressman AND self-proclaimed warrior for the middle-class, has released the campaign video that <em>finally</em> officially announces his entry into the crowded 2013 mayoral race. (You know, in case you missed this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/its_official_anthony_weiner_wants_t.php#photo-1">NY Times magazine feature</a>.) In the two minute video, he addresses his love of taking pictures of his schlong and sending it to his social media lady pals at the 1:43 mark, &quot;Look, I made some big mistakes and I know I let a lot of people down. But I&#x2019;ve also learned some tough lessons. I hope I get a second chance to work for you.&quot; Anthony Weiner 2013: He Keeps Coming!</p>

<p>Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/https://twitter.com/lisafleisher/status/337162361322479617">professes his love of stickball</a> (oh, is that what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/12/as_weiner_heads_to_sexting_rehab_hi.php">they&apos;re calling this now</a>?) and the Mets, but the video begins with the most innocent Weiner of all: His young son Jordan. Shown in his Manhattan apartment with Jordan and wife Huma Abedin, Weiner coos that this is the &quot;best part of his day.&quot;</p>

<p>The 48-year-old Democrat was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/weiner_hard_at_work_filming_campaig.php">spotted in Park Slope last week</a>, filming part of the video, and while he was going to announce his candidacy today, it seems that this video &quot;accidentally&quot; found its way online. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/leaky_weiner_now_in_5rwSPjIpvnz1MqWOwIw3XO">Post reports</a>, &quot;Anthony Weiner announced his campaign for mayor early this morning with &#x2014; what else? &#x2014; a leak. Shortly after midnight, the disgraced ex-congressman&#x2019;s campaign accidentally posted online a 2-minute, 16-second video in which he throws his hat into the ring, lays out his platform &#x2014; and even acknowledges the scandal that ended his days in DC.&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner says, &quot;I am running for mayor because I have been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it my entire life, and I hope I get a second chance to work for you.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/anthony-weiner-finally-official-running-mayor-article-1.1351265">Daily News notes</a> that he uses the phrase &quot;middle class&quot; four times and the fact that he has over $4 million in campaign funds.</p>

<p>What are Weiner&apos;s chances? Well, he&apos;s currently polling second after Christine Quinn. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173319/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/nyregion/anthony-weiner-new-york-city-mayor.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;His nascent campaign has struggled to attract marquee political strategists, as it has faced the rejection of many potential recruits and instead hired Danny Kedem, a 30-year-old with little experience in New York as a campaign manager. But Mr. Weiner&#x2019;s raw talents, as a tireless political tactician and verbal jouster, are hard to discount, making him a formidable opponent even in light of his troubles.&quot; Weiner 2013: IN THE RAW.<br>
