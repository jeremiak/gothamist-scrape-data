										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_04_eastnightwil.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023243im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_eastnightwil.jpg" width="365" height="245"> <br> <i>The scene last year (WABC 7)</i></div> Tomorrow is Easter, which means the NYPD is getting ready for a different kind of tradition: The so-called gang initiation rites.  Last year, there were<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023243/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/05/easter_night_violence_in_times_squa.php"> multiple brawls, shootings and arrests</a> in and near Penn Station and Times Square, which was enough violence for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023243/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/06/bloomberg_calls_midtown_violence_wi.php">Mayor Bloomberg to call it &quot;wilding&quot;</a>.  Now, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023243/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cops_target_easter_wilding_5EP6Q5CrFvK41aHqLimfCM">Post reports</a>, &quot;The NYPD and Midtown merchants are bracing for another Easter Sunday (or &apos;Gang Initiation Day&apos;) wilding session -- with extra patrols and boosted security ready to take on marauding gangs looking to terrorize Times Square and nearby businesses&quot;<p></p>

<p>The police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023243/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/nyregion/06timessq.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">started noticing the Easter night violence</a> back in 2003.  Another attraction is apparently the NY Auto Show at the Javits Center, though the Auto Show spokesman said last year that the gangs didn&apos;t seem to be there.  As for tomorrow, a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023243/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110422/midtown/police-prep-for-possible-repeat-of-easter-sunday-wilding">told DNAinfo</a>, &quot;We&apos;ve anticipated a large influx of kids again.&quot;</p>

<p>Police have metal barricades on the streets, but one Times Square restaurant manager spoke wistfully to the Post, &quot;Easter used to be all about bunnies and chocolate.&quot;</p>
