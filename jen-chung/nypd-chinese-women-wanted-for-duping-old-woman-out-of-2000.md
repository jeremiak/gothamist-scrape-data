<p>The police say that last week, on the morning of May 9, two women befriended the elderly woman and started chatting her up near Prince and Elizabeth Streets. A third woman joined the conversation and told the older woman to pay them or else the evil spirits would harm her and her family. According to the NYPD, &quot;The victim returned to her home and placed money in a bag. The victim is instructed not to open the bag for several days to chase away the evil spirits. When the victim opened the bag a couple of hours later she found newspapers and a water bottle.&quot;</p>

The NYPD even distributed this pamphlet (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710032655/http://www.chinatownpartnership.org/pdf/nypd.pdf">PDF</a>) to warn residents.</p>
