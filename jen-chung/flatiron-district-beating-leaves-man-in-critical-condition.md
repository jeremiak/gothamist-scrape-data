Fifth Avenue between 22nd and 23rd Streets is roped off.</p>

<p>Cops say the victim, who is in critical condition at Bellevue, &quot;was beaten by a group of five to six other men after some kind of dispute.&quot; And the victim may have known his attacks.  A witness says the attackers got out of a car and assaulted him.</p>
