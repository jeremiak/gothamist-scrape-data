Don&apos;t deny it!&quot;<p></p>

<p>Santiago&apos;s family, who adopted him when he was three, said they didn&apos;t approve of his actions and begged him to turn himself in.  Instead, the teen, who has &quot;prior arrests for sexual abuse and theft of services,&quot; left and the police arrested him last night.</p>

<p>His mugging victim, Catalina Mateo said she&apos;s still frightened of him, &quot;He didn&apos;t even respect the fact that I was in a wheelchair. I&apos;m still afraid of this guy.&quot;  Her purse contained $15 and her medication.  </p>
