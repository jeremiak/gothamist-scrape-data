<p>Last night, a construction worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424125224/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/tunnel-worker-dies-under-grand-central-terminal/">died after being hit by falling concrete</a> while working in a tunnel under Grand Central Terminal.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424125224/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/son-dies-lirr-tunnel-collapse-father-efforts-save-article-1.979611">According to the Daily News</a>, Michael O&apos;Brien &quot;was killed Thursday night in the collapse of a railroad tunnel deep under Park Ave., despite his father&#x2019;s heroic efforts to save him... The young worker&#x2019;s father, who was working alongside him, frantically tried to revive his son with CPR as workers rushed him through a network of tunnels to a waiting ambulance at E. 48th St. and Park Ave., the source said.&quot;</p>

<p>O&apos;Brien, was a &quot;sandhog&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424125224/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/09/ryan_mcginty_sandhog.php">think &quot;urban miner&quot;)</a> helping clear away bedrock for the big East Side Access project which will put a LIRR terminal under Grand Central. Apparently the tunnel collapsed around 7:30 p.m.  </p>

<p>The MTA, which has suspended work at the site of the accident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424125224/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111118/murray-hill-gramercy/falling-concrete-kills-worker-at-grand-central-tunnel-project">issued a statement</a>, &quot;The Metropolitan Transportation Authority wishes to extend its deepest condolences to Mr. O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s family and his fellow workers.&quot;</p>
