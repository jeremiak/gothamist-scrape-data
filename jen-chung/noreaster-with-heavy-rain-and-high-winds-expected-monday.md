<p>A big coastal storm is expected to land Sunday night with rainfall becoming more intense on Monday, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126160852/http://abc7ny.com/weather/accuweather-alert-strong-noreaster-headed-our-way-sunday-night/1714288/">1.5-3 inches of rain</a> as well as coastal flooding expected. NYC OEM Commissioner Joseph Esposito said, &quot;We&#x2019;re urging New Yorkers to use extra caution when outdoors Monday and allow for extra travel time during tomorrow&#x2019;s commutes. Coastal residents in vulnerable neighborhoods should take steps to protect their property ahead of this storm.&#x201D; So wear your rain boots.</p>

<p>There is a <strong>High Wind Warning </strong>from 1:00 a.m. Monday through 1:00 a.m. Tuesday and a <strong>Flood Watch</strong> for New York City from 1:00 p.m. Monday through 5:00 a.m. Tuesday. There is also a <strong>Coastal Flood Warning</strong> from 3 p.m. thru 9 p.m. Monday from rising water for Staten Island for moderate flooding; a <strong>Coastal Flood Advisory</strong> 3 p.m. through 8 p.m. Monday from rising water for Manhattan, Brooklyn and Southern Queens for minor flooding; and a <strong>Coastal Flood Advisory</strong> 5 p.m. through 10 p.m. Monday from rising water for Northern Queens and Bronx for minor flooding.

<p>NYC OEM explains:</p><blockquote>A weak area of low pressure is expected to bring heavy rain and high winds to the New York City area through Monday. Light rain accompanied by high winds is forecast to begin Sunday evening, increasing overnight into Monday. The heaviest rain and strongest winds are forecast Monday afternoon through Monday night, with sustained winds of 30 mph to 40 mph and gusts of 60 mph to 70 mph predicted. <p></p>

<p>The rain is expected to subside Monday night and winds are expected to decrease early Tuesday morning. A total of two to three inches of rain is forecast, but locally higher amounts are possible. Urban flooding may occur in low-lying and poor drainage areas. Flash flooding cannot be ruled out during the periods of heaviest rain. NYC residents living in coastal areas expected to experience minor to moderate coastal flooding should take action to protect their property.</p></blockquote>The NYC Department of Buildings has also asked property owners, contractors and crane operators &quot;to take precautionary measures to secure their construction sites, buildings and equipment.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo also said, &quot;I am directing all relevant state agencies to be on alert and ready to respond to whatever Mother Nature throws our way.&quot;</p>
