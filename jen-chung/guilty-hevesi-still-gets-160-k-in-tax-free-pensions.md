He may face jail time, but guess what: He<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044744/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/plea_bargain_for_comptroller_who_vmkcWArresPAJ1eT7Nf5SK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME="> still gets his tax-free comptroller pension</a> of $106,000/year, plus a tax-free $62,000/year pension for being a former CUNY professor. <p></p>

<p>Hevesi admitted in court to accepting six trips for his family plus $500,000 in campaign donations from venture capitalist Elliott Broidy.  In return, Broidy got $250 million of state pension fund dollars.  The Post adds, &quot;Broidy also arranged for a lobbyist -- identified by sources as Frank Sanzillo, whose brother worked for Hevesi -- to receive $380,000 in bogus consulting fees from Hevesi&apos;s office.&quot;  Broidy pleaded guilty last year.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044744/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/nyregion/08hevesi.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion"> NY Times looked at the plea</a> through a depressing lens of Albany&apos;s dysfunction:</p><blockquote>In some ways, the day was also a fitting coda to four extraordinary years of corruption spanning a single statewide election cycle. <p></p>

<p>In December 2006, just after his re-election, Mr. Hevesi pleaded guilty to a felony and resigned after admitting he had used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044744/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/24/state_ethics_co.php">state workers to chauffeur his ailing wife</a>. </p>

<p>His guilty plea, shocking as it was at the time because of Mr. Hevesi&#x2019;s previously robust reputation as a state assemblyman, city comptroller and state comptroller, was only the first domino to fall in a remarkable tumult of scandal: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044744/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/governor_spitze_1.php">resignation of Gov. Eliot Spitzer</a>; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044744/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/joe_bruno_sentenced_to_2_years_in_p.php">federal prosecution of Joseph L. Bruno</a>, the former Senate majority leader; and many investigations encircling the current Senate majority leader, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044744/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/05/criminal_charges_against_sen_pedro.php">Pedro Espada Jr</a>., and the current governor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044744/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/27/state_police_repeatedly_contacted_p.php">David A. Paterson</a>, among other officials.</p></blockquote>Sigh, doesn&apos;t it feel like we need to powerwash the state?<p></p>
