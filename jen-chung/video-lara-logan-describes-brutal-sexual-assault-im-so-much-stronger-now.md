Besides having her clothes torn to shreds and feeling &quot;hands raping me over and over,&quot; Logan said they were pulling out her hair, &quot;holding big wads of it, literally trying to tear my scalp off my skull. And I thought, when I thought I am going to die here, my next thought was I can&apos;t believe I just let them kill me, that that was as much fight as I had. That I just gave in and I gave up on my children so easily, how could you do that?&quot;  <p></p>

<p>Logan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150716232251/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/15/cbs_news_lara_logan_sexually_assaul.php">had been reporting</a> from Tahrir Square on Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak&apos;s February resignation. Her young children, ages one and two, were her inspiration to pull through, &quot;I had to fight for them. And that&apos;s when I said, &apos;Okay, it&apos;s about staying alive now. I have to just surrender to the sexual assault. What more can they do now? They&apos;re inside you everywhere.&quot; So the only thing to fight for, left to fight for, was my life.&quot; </p>

<p>The segment is pretty harrowing: Logan described losing contact with the bodyguard, Ray, and others in her crew, &quot;I have one arm on Ray. I&apos;ve lost the fixer, I&apos;ve lost the drivers. I&apos;ve lost everybody except him. And I feel them tearing at my clothing. I think my shirt, my sweater was torn off completely. My shirt was around my neck. I felt the moment that my bra tore. They tore the metal clips of my bra. They tore those open. And I felt that because the air, I felt the air on my chest, on my skin. And I felt them tear out, they literally just tore my pants to shreds. And then I felt my underwear go. And I remember looking up, when my clothes gave way, I remember looking up and seeing them taking pictures with their cell phones, the flashes of their cell phone cameras.&quot; She was rescued by a group of women and soldiers.</p>

<p>After the assault, Logan called her husband&#x2014;she thought was explaining what happened clearly, but her husband only heard her hysterically screaming.  She was flown back to the United States and was admitted to a hospital for four days.  Logan said that nurse, who specialized in dealing with victims of sexual violence, was folding up her clothes for evidence and said, &quot;Oh my God&quot; when she saw Logan&apos;s tattered pants. </p>

<p>Logan, who says she doesn&apos;t want the attack to define her, said the kind words of colleagues and strangers has helped heal her&#x2014; &quot;I&apos;m so much stronger&quot; now&#x2014;and added that she&apos;s speaking out to tell people that this kind of horror happens to women &quot;and it&apos;s wrong.&quot;</p>
