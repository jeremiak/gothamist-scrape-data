<p>The woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/26/mother_and_child_found_dead_in_harl.php">found dead in her Manhattan apartment</a> yesterday was a NYC high school teacher who had been fired after having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student. Her four-year-old son, who was apparently the student&apos;s child, was also found dead in the home. [<b>UPDATE</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://nypost.com/2016/12/27/student-admits-to-killing-teacher-and-their-love-child/">The Post is now reporting</a> that the student has admitted to murdering his ex and his son. More below.]</p>

<p>Police were called to a third floor apartment at 640 West 153 Street at 8:15 a.m. yesterday morning, and when they arrived, they found Felicia Barahona, 36, unconscious and unresponsive on the living room floor, with an electric cord around her neck. Her son, Miguel, was in the bathroom, submerged in a bathtub, and was unconscious and unresponsive. EMS pronounced mother and son dead at the scene.</p>

<p>The NYPD is investigating the deaths&#x2014;it&apos;s unclear if it was a murder-suicide or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://pix11.com/2016/12/26/woman-child-found-dead-in-harlem-apartment/">double murder</a>&#x2014;and the medical examiner will determine cause of death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://nypost.com/2016/12/26/fired-teacher-and-son-fathered-by-student-both-found-dead/">The Post reports</a> that the &quot;building super smelled a foul odor&quot; yesterday, and &quot;called 911 after he went on the fire escape and saw the mother lying on the floor through the window, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed Barahona and her son were dead for some days; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-bronx-teacher-4-year-old-son-found-dead-nyc-apartment-article-1.2924310">Daily News says</a> the super last saw them on Wednesday, and a friend said she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://nypost.com/2016/12/26/fired-teacher-and-son-fathered-by-student-both-found-dead/">heard from Baharona on Thursday</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_12_640w153.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_12_640w153.jpg" width="640" height="430"> <br> <i> 640 West 153rd Street (Google Maps)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>In 2012, Barahona was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/report_teacher_impregnated_by_stude.php">fired from her position as a teacher</a> at DeWitt Clinton High School after an investigation found  she started a relationship with a 17- or 18-year-old student in 2011. The pair were reportedly going to get married and live together <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://nypost.com/2013/03/13/teacher-booted-her-baby-daddy-17/">until Barahona reportedly dumped him</a>.</p>

<p>Baharona, who also had an eight-year-old daughter who lives elsewhere, had been studying at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Neighbors offered differing views of Barahona. The Post spoke to ones who &quot;recalled [her]  as &apos;strange&apos; and unfriendly &#x2014; and little Miguel as a rambunctious but intelligent child who loved to play with his train set in the hallway.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://abc7ny.com/news/ex-teacher-son-fathered-by-student-found-dead-in-apartment/1673501/">Another told WABC 7</a> that Barahona seemed quiet and humble: &quot;She was definitely a good mother, always with the kid.&quot; The neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/26/nyregion/felicia-barahona-dewitt-clinton-high-school-dead.html">mentioned by the NY Times</a> noted she was quiet and &quot;seemed like an engaged mother.&quot;</p>

<p>A relative told the Times, &quot;They were, under the circumstances, a happy family.&quot;</p>

<p>The Administration for Children&apos;s Service released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-bronx-teacher-4-year-old-son-found-dead-nyc-apartment-article-1.2924310">this statement</a>: &quot;We are deeply committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our city&#x2019;s children. We understand the NYPD is currently investigating this matter.&quot;</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://nypost.com/2016/12/27/student-admits-to-killing-teacher-and-their-love-child/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Isaac Duran, 21, admitted to the gruesome double murder of ex-Dewitt Clinton High School teacher Felicia Barahona, 36, and their little boy, Miguel, inside her upper Manhattan apartment, law enforcement sources said... Duran described his actions as an evil deed during his confession, referencing the &apos;devil,&apos; sources said.&quot; </p>

<p>Apparently Duran, who paid Baharona child support, was upset about how Miguel was being raised, including how she dressed him (in an earlier article, a neighbor told the Post that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022754/http://nypost.com/2016/12/26/fired-teacher-and-son-fathered-by-student-both-found-dead/">she would dress the boy in girl&apos;s clothing</a>). </p><blockquote>When initially contacted by investigators, Duran put up the front of a grieving father and said he hadn&#x2019;t visited the apartment since 2011, sources said.<p></p>

<p>But police later found out that he lied to them after he was spotted on building surveillance footage several days ago entering the six-story building and leaving hours later wearing different clothes, sources said.</p></blockquote>The NYPD&apos;s press office did not have any information about an arrest or someone in custody for the deaths. &quot;We don&apos;t have anything about what the Post is writing,&quot; a spokesperson said.<p></p>
