Taxi driver Mohammed Hussain, 46, and tourist from Utah Suzanne Nicholson, 60, were killed in the 12:30 a.m. accident while Nicholson&apos;s 11-year-old grandson was critically injured.  It turns out that Nicholson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121225043740/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/03/utah_grandmother_died_saving_grands.php">shielded Gabriel Larsen with her body</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121225043740/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/utah-dad-grateful-son-granny-shielded-crash-article-1.1089294">boy&apos;s father says</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s a miracle if you ask me.&quot;  But the parents, who flew to New York, haven&apos;t told him the terrible news yet.<p></p>

<p>Hussain had picked up Nicholson and Larsen from JFK Airport on Friday and apparently lost control during a rainstorm on the LIE near 66th St. in Elmhurst after midnight. The taxi struck the rear of a 1995 grey Porsche&#x2014;the Porsche rolled onto its driver&apos;s side, while the yellow cab flipped toward the right shoulder. A garbage truck was unable to stop and smacked into the taxi. Gabriel suffered broken ribs, a fractured collarbone, a punctured lung and a concussion.</p>

<p>Nicholson was bringing Gabriel to New York as a special birthday treat: They were going to Yankee Stadium, the Statue of Liberty and the American Museum of Natural History. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121225043740/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cab_crash_kid_loses_grand_pal_cPxLGKO675nphiALkZwgpM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Dean Larsen said his son and Nicholson</a> &quot;were best friends, always texting and calling each other. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll be very devastated. We haven&#x2019;t even thought about when or how to bring it up.&quot; But he added, &quot;He&#x2019;s going to be fine. He was saying he wanted to go to the Yankees game.&quot;</p>

<p>Hussain leaves behind a wife and two sons (ages 9 years and 14 months) and a friend described her as devastated. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121225043740/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/utah-dad-grateful-son-granny-shielded-crash-article-1.1089294">truck driver told the News</a>, &quot;The car on the left kept coming in the lane. I blew the horn and he left. Then, I see this cab in front of me. I hit the brakes and skidded, and after that I lost control... My truck went right into the barrier and hit the barrier wall and stopped. If I was going any faster my truck would have turned over... Two people lost their lives... I don&#x2019;t know if I&apos;ll ever be all right.&#x201D;</p>
