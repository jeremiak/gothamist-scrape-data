After an investigation&#x2014;which included the bomb squad&#x2014;it was determined there was nothing in the truck.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153129/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7425684">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;Police say a UHaul truck with Arizona license plates on the Manhattan span of the bridge was found abandoned on the bridge around 10pm. New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said a worker on the bridge that connects the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx found the vehicle apparently smelling of gas.&quot;</p>

<p>But by midnight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153129/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/traffic/traffic_news/suspicious-truck-on-rfk-bridge-20100505-akd">MyFoxNY reports</a>, &quot;Police officers carefully opened the truck and discovered that it was empty, the NYPD said. Witnesses reported seeing a man flee the vehicle, police said.&quot;  The police, who cut a hole into the side of the truck to determine it was empty, are taking away the truck for a further examination. </p>
