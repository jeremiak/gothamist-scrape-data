Glanz, who was suspended after the unorthodox bar mitzvah (held at the Manhattan Detention Complex&apos;s gym, complete with knives), said, &quot;Yes, I resigned. I decided it was best for everybody.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the Rabbi denied the allegations, telling the Post its series of articles, which mentioned that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125845/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/12/the_tombs_private_club_for_some_ort.php">food was specially brought in</a> for Orthodox Jewish inmates and that a satellite feed of one inmate&apos;s daughter&apos;s wedding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125845/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/rabbi_gave_jewish_prisoners_most_fr.php">was set up</a>, were &quot;uncalled for, totally unjust, pure lies... Whoever gave that information over lied. For 35 years I&apos;ve been in public life. I never did bad for a single creature.&quot; Still, the scandal was enough to prompt Corrections Chief Peter Curcio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125845/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06152009/news/regionalnews/correction_chief_quits_over_kosher_kings_174416.htm">to resign</a>.  Curcio told the Post, &quot;I regret the embarrassment that this event has caused the city of New York. As a three-star bureau chief, I understand that I&apos;m ultimately responsible for everything.&quot;</p>

<p>Curcio, though, laid the blame on approving the bar mitzvah for financial scammer Tuvia Stern&apos;s son on head chaplain Imam Umar Abdul-Jalil,  &quot;However, in this particular instance, I did not approve the bar mitzvah -- it was approved by Umar [Abdul-Jalil].&quot;  The Post says, &quot;Before the scandal, Curcio was being eyed to become the agency&apos;s next chief of department.&quot;</p>
