<p>Authorities say that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153231/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/at_least_20_injured_after_metro-nor.php">last night&apos;s Metro-North train collision</a> between Bridgeport and Fairfield left 70 people injured and three remain in critical condition. Senator Richard Blumenthal said after seeing the scene, &quot;The damage is absolutely staggering.&quot;</p>

<p>The 4:41 p.m. train, with 300 passengers, from Grand Central Central on its way to New Haven derailed at 6:10 p.m. near the I-95 overpass in Bridgeport. It was struck by a train traveling in the opposite direction&#x2014;the 5:30 p.m. from New Haven, which had 400 passengers. Part of the wall and roof of some train cars were ripped away and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153231/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/17/metro-north-trains-involved-in-major-derailment-injuries-reported/">tracks were twisted</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153231/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/18/ntsb-to-probe-connecticut-metro-north-derailment-that-injured-60/">One passenger told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Everything just came to a stop. We went flying. &apos;I thought, &#x2018;This is the end. Brace yourself.&#x2019;&#x201D; Another said, &quot;I saw that one entire compartment was completely ripped open. The whole side was gone, and people there lying in between trains.&quot; </p>

<p>Some passengers thought it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153231/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/nyregion/metro-north-train-collision-in-connecticut.html?ref=nyregion">might have been a bombing</a>. A man on the westbound train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153231/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Metro-North-Trains-Collide-Bridgeport-Connecticut-Several-People-Hurt-207944571.html">said to NBC New York,</a> &quot;We came to a sudden halt. We were jerked. There was smoke. People were screaming; people were really nervous. We were pretty shaken up. They had to smash a window to get us out.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153231/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/northern_suburbs&amp;id=9107111">One woman told the AP</a>, &quot;<strong>All I know was I was in the air, hitting seats, bouncing around, flying down the aisle and finally I came to a stop on one seat</strong>. It happened so fast I had no idea what was going on. All I know is we crashed.&quot;</p>

<p>Most of the injured were treating quickly. An investigation is currently being conducted&#x2014;the National Transportation Safety Board is on the scene, as are Connecticut authorities and the MTA. </p>

<p>The MTA says, &quot;There are four tracks in this segment of the New Haven Line, but two of those tracks are out of service for a long-term project to replace overhead wires. On the remaining two tracks, there was extensive infrastructure damage as a result of the collision. Both the track and the overhead wire have been damaged.  The train cars cannot be removed until the on-scene investigation is complete, and they will need to be removed by crane.&quot;</p>

<p>Metro-North service between South Norwalk and New Haven is indefinitely suspended, as is Amtrak service between New York and New Haven. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153231/http://www.courant.com/community/fairfield/hc-fairfield-train-derailed-0518-20130517,0,1961254.story">Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy said</a>, &quot;You should begin making plans ... for alternate travel.&quot;<br>
