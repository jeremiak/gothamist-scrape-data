Noting the borough&apos;s highest AIDS-related death rate in the city, Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden said, &quot;The Bronx has the opportunity to lead the city in the fight against HIV/AIDS by being the first borough to have all residents tested.&quot;</p>

<p>The health department hopes to make voluntary testing more available in hospitals and clinics, but the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417174523/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/nyregion/26hiv.html?ref=nyregion">details how NY State law has been an obstacle</a>: Essentially, the law has stayed the same since the 1980s and requires patients to &quot;give written permission for testing after being counseled on the process, which many doctors found onerous and time-consuming.&quot;  An oral consent process, many experts agree, would increase the number of people who would be willing to be tested.</p>

<p>Robert Bank, COO of the advocacy group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417174523/http://gmhc.org/">Gay Men&apos;s Health Crisis</a>, told the Times he hoped the program would expand to the rest of the boroughs, &#x201C;Brooklyn is a horribly devastated borough.  Manhattan is a highly impacted borough, Queens is a highly impacted borough.&#x201D;  (The highest incidents of HIV and AIDS is in Manhattan.) And in the past year, the Health Department has revealed cases of HIV among high schoolers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417174523/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/18/hiv_among_high.php">are up nearly 30%</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417174523/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/12/hiv_diagnoses_r.php">cases of HIV among young gay men are also rising</a>.  Here&apos;s information on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417174523/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/std/std2.shtml">where the city offers free HIV testing</a>.</p>
