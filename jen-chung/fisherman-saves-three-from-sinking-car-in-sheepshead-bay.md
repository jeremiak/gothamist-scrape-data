Luckily, a fisherman and some others heard their cries and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521233352/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7058559">jumped into the water</a> to save them.  Keith Gorman, a deckhand at the Sea Queen 7, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521233352/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/10/11/2009-10-11_fisherman_saves_mother_daughters_after_car_falls_into_sheepshead_bay.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I heard a car smash. I ran through the crowd and I realized that a car went on the sidewalk and into the water... <strong>I took my boots off and my jacket and jumped over the rail and into the water.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>According to the News, &quot;driver, Alla Yelizarov, was caught in her seatbelt, and her two daughters were scrambling out of the windows to reach the roof of the car.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521233352/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/fisherman_saves_in_sinking_car_1qyJ5CadtrJA3yKe1K6t8K">Gorman told the Post</a>, &quot;I saw two young ladies screaming for help from on top of a car that was sinking,&quot; so he jumped in. When Gorman got to Yelizarov, she was saying, &quot;I can&apos;t swim! I can&apos;t swim!&quot; He managed to extract her through a window.  </p>

<p>Yeliazarov and her daughters were uninjured but taken to the hospital as a precaution.  Yeliazarov&apos;s husband said, &quot;I&apos;m a lucky father. I want to tell those guys, &apos;Thank you, and God help your children.&apos;&quot;</p>
