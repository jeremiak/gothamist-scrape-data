The Shomrim volunteer Alex &quot;Shaya&quot; Lichtenstein, who allegedly paid off the police for expedited gun licenses, apparently had so much pull with his NYPD connections that the hopeful gun licensors didn&apos;t even need to be interviewed by the police.<p></p>

<p>In April, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923034132/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/a_volunteer_officer_with_the.php">detailed how Lichteinstein allegedly</a> offered a police officer cash for gun licenses: &quot;Lichstenstein told the officer that he charged customers thousands of dollars to help obtain License Division approval for their gun license applications, and that he was able to get the licenses approved using his own connections in the License Division, although those connections had recently cut him out.&quot; </p>

<p>The cop didn&apos;t agree to help him and instead went to Internal Affairs, and then the FBI and IAB helped the officer set up a sting. During that meeting, Lichtenstein allegedly said he could offer him $6,000 per license (Lichtenstein kept $12,000), and that he&apos;d been able to obtain 150 licenses this way in the past. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923034132/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nyc-gun-broker-accused-bribes-cozy-relationships-article-1.2637194">The Daily News reports</a> that all gun license holders in NYC must be interviewed by the police, and now John Chambers, a lawyer representing many of Lichtenstein&apos;s clients whose licenses have been suspended, said the &quot;clients, especially the more recent ones, only had to submit a minimal amount of documentation before they got their licenses.&quot; Chambers explained, &quot;There is a mountain of documentation that&#x2019;s required, but all some of them needed to send in was a few pieces of paper for the permit to go forward.&quot; Some didn&apos;t even need to be interviewed by police.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how the process is supposed to work, according to the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office:</p><blockquote>The NYPD License Division receives approximately 5,000 applications for gun licenses a year.  Most licenses approved by the NYPD License Division are for individuals to keep in their homes or businesses, but a small portion of the approved licenses are for individuals to carry guns for limited work reasons or to carry guns at all times based on a substantial showing of employment-based need.  After receiving an application the NYPD License Division conducts an investigation of the applicant before electing to approve or disapprove the application.  The investigation includes (i) a review of the applicant&#x2019;s criminal history, including summonses, arrests, and convictions; (ii) a review of the applicant&#x2019;s mental health history; (iii) a verification of the details of the application; (iv) an in-person interview of the applicant; and (v) an investigation into the business need for a license to carry a gun. <br>
 <br>
Certain findings, such as a prior felony conviction, result in the automatic disapproval of an applicant.  Pursuant to New York State Law, the NYPD License Division has discretion to reject gun license applications for additional reasons, such as moral character, mental health issues, or substance abuse issues.  On its website, the NYPD License Division indicates that it may reject applications if the investigation reveals a history of arrest, driving infractions, or domestic violence incidents, among other reasons.  Typically, the processing, investigation, and approval or disapproval of an application takes several months and, for licenses to carry guns, at times in excess of one year.</blockquote>A 72-year-old man convicted of a felony told the Post that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923034132/http://nypost.com/2016/04/20/i-paid-fixer-12500-for-gun-license-and-wound-up-with-nothing/">paid Lichtenstein $12,500 for a license</a>, which he did get. When Lichtenstein had accompanied the man to One Police Plaza, he said that all the officers there seemed to know him, saying, &quot;Hi, Shaya!&quot;<p></p>

<p>However, when he tried to buy a gun in Brooklyn, his name had been flagged by the FBI. The man says he needs the gun because he collects cash rents.</p>
