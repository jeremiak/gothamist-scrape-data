<p>With concerns about a pervert who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427151122/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/cops_man_groped_woman_at_16th_4th_a.php">followed then fondled a woman</a> walking on south Park Slope street, the police have released two additional videos of the man suspect in the May 23 attack.</p>

<p>Police say that a 22-year-old woman was walking on 16th Street near 4th Avenue just after 5 a.m. &quot;when the suspect approached her from behind, sexually abused her, and fled the scene. The victim refused medical attention on scene.&quot; However, the victim is speaking out now.  </p>

A neighbor actually caught the suspected pervert; another neighbor, Donald Harrington, said, &quot;So he witnessed the attack and he held the guy until police got there, so it was definitely the right guy. They held him eight minutes cause. They didn&#x2019;t know where the victim was.&quot;  So the cops let the man go.</p>

<p>The victim isn&apos;t upset at the police, &quot;They did the right thing. They followed protocol. I wasn&#x2019;t around... I don&#x2019;t blame that at all if they caught the right person and it was him. That&#x2019;s why people should work with police the best they can.&quot;  She added that the cops are &quot;definitely going to get the guy&quot;</p>
