<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> The pet bobcat who has repeatedly broken free of his Stafford, NJ home is prowling the streets again.

<p>This is the fourth time this year that Rocky, who is declawed, has gotten loose. Rocky&apos;s owner Ginny Fine has been fined in the past, and has also agreed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031060017/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/08/missing_nj_bobcat_found_but_not_ret.php">turn over Rocky to a local zoo</a> if he escapes again.
