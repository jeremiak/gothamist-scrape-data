										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_05_nypostcovercorp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152425im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_nypostcovercorp.jpg" width="640" height="476"> <br> <i> Mark Rosenthal in his office (via NY Post)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152425/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/corpulent_union_leader_makes_150k_t.php">NY Post put Mark Rosenthal on its front page</a>, claiming that the 400-pound union leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152425/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/labor_big_real_heavy_sleeper_jl3C7gI710FI3XqpEl5o3O/0">works only 2-hour work days</a>, when factoring in his lunch and nap. So of course the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152425/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/he_baking_bad_eEVmMBs1kW5U0yxAPhQJMM">had to follow up by finding Rosenthal and showing him</a> the newspaper:</p><blockquote>Shown a copy of yesterday&#x2019;s Post featuring photos of him sleeping at his desk on different days, the 5-foot-7, 400-pound Rosenthal defended his work as the president of the local repping members of District Council 37.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;With everything going on in the world, a picture of a big fat guy sleeping shouldn&#x2019;t be on the front page,&#x201D; Rosenthal said. &#x201C;It hurts. You think I like being so heavy? I&#x2019;m fat, but I have feelings, too.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>He revealed that diets haven&apos;t worked, referred to his naps as &quot;power naps,&quot; blamed sleepiness on medication (from falling through a chair at McDonald&apos;s) and confessed that he can&apos;t get lap-band surgery, &quot;The doctor said I&#x2019;m unable to do the operation because I&#x2019;m too big.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Another weird detail: His apartment was raided years ago because his roommate was arrested for his role in a meth sting. Rosenthal says that he&apos;s not another Walter White, &quot;<strong>Did you ever see a 400-pound meth addict?</strong>... This is ridiculous. I wasn&#x2019;t involved. I wasn&#x2019;t charged with anything.&quot;</p>
