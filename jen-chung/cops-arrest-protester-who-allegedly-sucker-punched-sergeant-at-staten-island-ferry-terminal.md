<p>Police announced they arrested a man who &quot;sucker punched&quot; a police sergeant at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011150/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/05/protest_eric_garner_two.php#photo-23">during one of the Eric Garner grand jury protests</a> last week. According to the NYPD, the suspect also attacked another cop in the Meatpacking District.</p>

<p>Police say the incident occurred during a demonstration at the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, at 8 p.m. on December 8th. The sergeant was &quot;sucker punched by an unknown male who fled the scene. At 2230 on the same night an individual identified as Yotameli Sayer was arrested for assaulting a police officer at 14th Street and 8th Avenue. Information gathered during that arrest led detectives to identify Sayer as the individual who assaulted the sergeant outside of the Staten Island Ferry.&quot;</p>
