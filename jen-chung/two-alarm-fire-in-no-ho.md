<p>Firefighters are currently battling a two-alarm fire on Broadway, just above Houston Street. A reader says the roof of the building with the Urban Outfitters on the ground floor (628 Broadway) caught fire. We also hear that the fire spread to neighboring buildings (or at least the sprinkler system in one was &quot;charged&quot;).  </p>

<p>Here are some photos and a (sideways) video:</p>
