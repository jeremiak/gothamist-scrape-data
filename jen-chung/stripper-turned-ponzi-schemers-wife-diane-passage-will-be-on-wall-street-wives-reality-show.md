<p>If you were once a stripper who became a society fixture after marrying an accountant to the stars&#x2014;only for your husband to turn out to be a Ponzi schemer&#x2014;doesn&apos;t it make sense that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/ponzi_wife_hopes_to_pole_dance_her.php">reality TV is your next move</a>?  Diane Passage, wife of convicted fraudster Kenneth Starr, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/wall-street-wives-says-it-has-landed-kenneth-starrs-wife/">will appear on &quot;Wall Street Wives,&quot;</a> and Pasage told the NY Times that the program will be a &quot;a more intellectual &apos;Real Housewives.&apos;&quot;  </p>

<p>Last year, when feds became suspicious of Starr, whose celebrity clients included Martin Scorsese, Uma Thurman and Al Pacino, they went to his Upper East Side apartment and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/28/alleged_ponzi_scammer_has_celeb_cli.php">found him hiding in a closet under a pile of clothes</a>. He pleaded guilty to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/money_manager_kenneth_starr_pleads_SZBplTh3vAfNkriO9S0J2I">running a $33 million scam over five years</a> and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/fallen_starr_is_forlorn_Bwj1FnXA1Wbk9TlXMIA3TP">sentenced to seven years</a>.</p>

<p>Starr met Passage while she was working at Scores&#x2014; he dumped his third wife, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, for her. A friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/29/stripper_turned_alleged_ponzi_schem.php">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;The story of Ken Starr is simple. He was one of the world&apos;s greatest salesmen whose entire life was turned upside down by his infatuation for a stripper.&quot;  The couple&apos;s divorce is reportedly in the works; Passage only found out that she was Starr&apos;s fourth wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/diane-passage-2011-9/">when he was being sentenced</a>.  The 35-year-old mother lives in a small apartment in Times Square, with her assets frozen due to Starr&apos;s fraud.</p>

<p>&quot;Wall Street Wives&quot; is still working on its cast and is talking to various networks.  Passage says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090015/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/wall-street-wives-says-it-has-landed-kenneth-starrs-wife/">she told Starr about doing the show</a>, &quot;I mentioned it to him. But he doesn&#x2019;t get a say.&quot;</p>
