<p>A teen was duped into giving up his cellphone by a man who pretended to be a police officer at a Washington Heights subway station last month.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 4 p.m. on October 14, a 13-year-old boy &quot;crawled under the turnstile to avoid payment at the subway station at 168th Street and Ft. Washington Avenue stop.&quot; That&apos;s when an adult male stopped the boy, told him he was a cop and asked him for his phone. Why? Police say he said &quot;he needed to borrow his phone to take some photos and that he would be right back.&quot; The impostor took the boy&apos;s HTC-One phone and never returned.</p>

<p>Police released surveillance video of the fake cop:</p>
