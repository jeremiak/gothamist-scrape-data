<p>While Dick Clark&apos;s Rocking New Year&apos;s Eve With Ryan Seacrest is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092920/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/01/photos_video_new_york_rings_in_2012.php#photo-7">establishment choice</a> for TV watching on December 31 (and Carson Daly&apos;s New Year&apos;s show on NBC is actually better than you&apos;d think&#x2014;we appreciate that Daly asked Bloomberg about Occupy Wall Street), the best New Year&apos;s TV hosts are CNN&apos;s brilliant odd couple of Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin.  While some wondered if Griffin would come back after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092920/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/01/video_kathy_griffin_did_say_that_on.php">telling one heckler in 2009</a>, &quot;Screw you. Why don&apos;t you get a job, buddy? You know what? I don&apos;t go to your job and knock the dicks out of your mouth,&quot; her outrageousness works well with Cooper&apos;s tight-laced WASPy personality.  And this year, she stripped down to her panties and bra!</p>

<p>In a press release two weeks before New Year&apos;s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092920/http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/16/anderson-cooper-and-kathy-griffin-co-host-cnns-new-years-eve-celebration/">CNN offered these quotes</a>:</p><blockquote> &quot;Get ready, America.  Pull up a chair and a box of your finest wine, because you&apos;ve never seen a New Year&apos;s Eve show like this,&#x201D; said Griffin. &#x201C;By the time I&apos;m done with him, Anderson&apos;s hair is going to be even more gray.  In fact, the night is going to be so wild, his hair is actually going to turn brown again.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Kathy Griffin scares me. I&#x2019;ve said this often to CNN management directly and through my attorneys,&#x201D; said Cooper &#x201C;She continues to appear by my side on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, so clearly no one is listening to me&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Well, she did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092920/http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2011/12/30/ac-kathy-griffin-cooper-nye-preview.cnn#/video/bestoftv/2011/12/30/ac-kathy-griffin-cooper-nye-preview.cnn">warn him</a>.<p></p>
