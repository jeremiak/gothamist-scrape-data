</div></div>					<p>Starting today, the Brooklyn Library is featuring photographs from 1990s Brooklyn, depicting Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights, from Chie Nishio.</p>

<p>Nishio, who was born in Japan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013120/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141002/prospect-heights/views-of-hasidic-jewish-community-from-1990s-crown-heights-go-on-display">told DNAinfo</a> that she had been &quot;curious&quot; about Orthodox Jews after seeing them in the Diamond District: &quot;When she married a non-observant Jew, she became even more interested in New York&#x2019;s Jewish communities. She tried making contacts in Williamsburg to photograph the Orthodox community there, but had no luck. Then, a friend suggested visiting Crown Heights where, she was told, the Chabad-Lubavitch community was &apos;more open to outsiders.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Nishio, now 84, spent two years documenting the community. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013120/http://www.bklynlibrary.org/events/exhibitions/hasidim-crown-heights-bro">The library says</a>, &quot;This exhibition is part of a portfolio of over 200 prints, beautiful and inviting photos that often capture life of the Hasidim from a distinctly female point of view. The black and white images include thoughtfully composed formal portraits along with lively documentations of a broad range of daily life and ritual. Although the sensibility is distinctly sympathetic and sensitive, one discerns a certain crisp detachment and humor as well.&quot;</p>

<p>The exhibit is at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013120/http://www.bklynlibrary.org/locations/central">Brooklyn Library&apos;s central branch</a> at Grand Army Plaza, right inside the entrance. </p>
