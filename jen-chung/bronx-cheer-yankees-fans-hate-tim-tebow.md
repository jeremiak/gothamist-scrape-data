<p>Tim Tebow, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617150149/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/21/welcome_to_nyc_tim_tebow_everyone_a.php">we warned you that New Yorkers hate you</a>.  But Tim Tebow got his first taste of NYC haterade during the Yankees-Angels game yesterday, when he was at Yankee Stadium.</p>

<p>Tebow was shown on the video board, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617150149/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/te_boo_jets_new_backup_booed_at_aTgc6f9atAOEVJT7Kl6iSM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">was booed by Yankees fans</a>. (The Post reports, &quot;Sitting next to Tebow was Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade, also booed when he was shown on the scoreboard earlier in the game. But those boos quickly turned to cheers when Wade held up his Yankees cap.)  When told of the  fans&apos; reaction to Tebow, Yankees right fielder Nick Swisher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617150149/http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/7817977/yankee-stadium-crowd-boos-tim-tebow-dwyane-wade">said, &quot;Welcome to New York, Tim.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The Yankees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617150149/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_04_15_anamlb_nyamlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=nyy">beat the Angels 11-5</a>.
