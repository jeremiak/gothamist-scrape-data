<p>The NY State Republican Party&apos;s convention begins today, and four men&#x2014;Suffolk County Executive and former Democrat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevelevy">Steve Levy</a>, former Congressman and one-time Senate candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://gothamist.com/tags/ricklazio">Rick Lazio</a>,  real estate entrepreneur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://gothamist.com/tags/myersmermel">Myers Mermel</a>, and Buffalo real estate millionaire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://gothamist.com/tags/carlpaladino">Carl Paladino</a>&#x2014; are hoping for the nomination to challenge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/28/cuomo_we_need_to_restore_the_public.php">Andrew Cuomo</a> for the governor&apos;s seat this November. But the crowded field means one thing: Chaos.  The Post says&#x2014;in a story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gop_rift_over_who_ll_be_cuo_mowed_FnmiJIN4ybKcV5EsBxjqpL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">headlined &quot;GOP rift over who&apos;ll be Cuo-mowed down&quot;</a>&#x2014;a &quot;prominent statewide GOP official said, &quot;<strong>This is an insider fight within our party over leadership and control, and we all recognize that it has nothing to do with the outcome of the November election.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>NY State GOP Chairman Ed Cox (son-in-law of Richard Nixon) recruited Levy to run&#x2014;he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/nyregion/31repubs.html?ref=nyregion">told the Times</a>, &quot;I believe that Steve will be the designated candidate at the convention&quot;&#x2014;which has made some members unhappy.  One complained to the Post, &quot;Ed Cox has been a disaster for the party&quot; and another strategist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/06/01/2010-06-01_gopers_wont_let_shaky_chair_sit.html/">lamented to the Daily News</a>, &quot;There is no bright spot. We don&apos;t have a single statewide candidate who has a chance to win.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704490204575279083055956268.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLEThirdStories">Wall Street Journal explains</a> the challenge that Levy faces: &quot;First, he&apos;ll need to win 25% of the weighted vote of delegates in his bid for governor. Second, he&apos;ll need to win at least 50% of a special vote to be allowed to run in a September primary.&quot; Lazio recently received the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/29/conservative_party_nominates_rick_l.php">endorsement from the Conservative party</a>, which he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011839/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/119581/new-york-republicans-begins-convention">touted to NY1</a>, &quot;I feel great about where we are right now. I picked up the Conservative Party designation on Friday. I&apos;ll pick up the Republican designation this week and we&apos;re on to the general election.&quot;</p>
