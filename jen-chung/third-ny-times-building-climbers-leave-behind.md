<p><img alt="2008_07_timesclimb10.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123739im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_07_timesclimb10.jpg" width="250" height="333" class="right">Earlier this morning, a man was arrested after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123739/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/third_man_climbs_new_york_times_bui.php">climbing on the New York Times Building&apos;s exterior</a>, making him the third person to do so in six weeks.  The man, 29-year-old David Malone, hung a banner over the banner to help promote his book about Osama Bin Laden; while he started up the building at 1:30 a.m., he wasn&apos;t apprehended until 5:20 a.m.</p>

<p>Malone had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123739/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/07/08/2008-07-08_times_climb__again_man_scales_papers_hea.html">called the Daily News</a>, explaining he selected the early morning for the climb/protest because he was &quot;trying to minimize any disturbance - any breach of the peace.&quot;  He did, however, leave behind a flyer on some windows, which were removed by building staff later.  Luckily, someone took photos.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123739/http://www.binladensplan.com/">his  website</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123739/http://www.binladensplan.com/">Bin Laden&apos;s Plan</a>, Malone &quot;successfully predicted some of the major events of Bin Laden&apos;s war, including: the initiation of the 9/11 plot in July 1999, the execution of the 9/11 attack in 2001... the American invasion of Iraq and capture of Saddam Hussein in 2003...&quot;  The News reported that Malone (who spoke in a &quot;detached monotone&quot;) as saying, &quot;I&apos;m trying to help America.&quot;</p>

<p>Now the NY Times Company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123739/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/third-man-climbs-times-building/index.html?ref=nyregion">will remove some of the rods</a> (aka rungs to the climbers) that have made these ascent easy.  </p>
