<p>On Tuesday, December 8, the authorities say that Ovidio Jaramillo, 17, was on his way home from a Flushing funeral home when he was struck by a black Toyota Camry at Northern Boulevard and Junction Boulevard. The car did not remain at the scene and continued west on Northern Boulevard. </p>

<p>Ovidio was pronounced dead at Elmhurst Hospital. A friend said he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404075425/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20151210/elmhurst/funeral-home-owner-picks-up-all-costs-for-student-killed-hit-and-run">been at the wake of his grandmother&apos;s friend</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404075425/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/09/teen-killed-queens-hit-run/">One person told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t see traffic at the moment, but within a second this black car came out of nowhere, I mean he was really traveling very fast. When he hit him instead of slowing down he accelerated&#x2026;He flew across the street and landed over there by the drain. I checked him, he was done. There was nothing I could do.&quot;</p>

<p>Police canvassed the area for videos and last night released images of a &quot;a male who exited from the passenger portion of the vehicle that struck the victim shortly after the incident.&quot; Detectives are interested in speaking to this person:</p>

<p>Lawmakers held a press conference at the intersection where Ovidio&apos;s death occurred to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404075425/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/distracted_walking_crackdown.php">essentially  shame the pedestrians killed</a> or injured by vehicles, claiming they were distracted. While police say there&apos;s no evidence that Ovidio was on his cellphone, State Senator Jose Peralta told us the press conference was to urge Mayor de Blasio to put speed cameras at the location (Albany, not de Blasio, has that power).</p>

<p>He also emphasized, &quot;Because nowadays we have the younger generation really engaged in their mobile phones, whether they&#x2019;re texting or surfing the web, and that&#x2019;s all this was about, was to talk about&#x2014;yes, we&#x2019;re talking about this unfortunate death, we need cameras, and by the way, we also want to talk about how pedestrians also need to pay attention when crossing the street, we have the younger generation are so focused on these phones they&#x2019;re not looking up.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404075425/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/09/teen-killed-queens-hit-run/">A neighbor mourned the loss</a>, &quot;Ovidio was probably, I&#x2019;m going to be honest, one of the most polite young men you could come across.&quot;<br>
