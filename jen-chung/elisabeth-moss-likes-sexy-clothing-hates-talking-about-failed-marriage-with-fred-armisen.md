I think every woman has a sexy, adventurous side.... Sometimes you just wanna wear somethin&apos; real tight and show it all off. Lately I&apos;ve been in that mood.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>But she&apos;s not in the mood to rehash her 11-month marriage to Saturday Night Live&apos;s Fred Armisen: &quot;It&apos;s so hard to talk about... One of the greatest things I heard someone say about him is, &apos;He&apos;s so great at doing impersonations. But the greatest impersonation he does is that of a normal person.&apos; To me, that sums it up... And I think that&apos;s...that&apos;s it. I&apos;ve never told anyone that. And I don&apos;t want to waste any more of my life talking about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, then back to playing Peggy Olsen, who is frumpy relative to glamorous Betty Draper and Joan Holloway.  Moss says, &quot;I would much rather have an interesting character to play. I didn&apos;t get into the business to be a model. I can get dressed up and wear something sexy any night of the week.&quot;  We bet she still gets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145825/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/06/elisabeth_moss.php">&quot;You look much thinner in person&quot; comments </a>from fans.  And, remember, she can act&#x2014;not only has she gotten raves for <em>Mad Men</em>, she also killed it in a revival of <em>The Children&apos;s Hour</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145825/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/elisabeth_moss_keira_knightley_like.php">in London</a> (&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145825/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8315448/The-Childrens-Hour-Comedy-Theatre-London.html">a fascinatingly conflicted performance that is as subtle as it is strong</a>&quot;).</p>
