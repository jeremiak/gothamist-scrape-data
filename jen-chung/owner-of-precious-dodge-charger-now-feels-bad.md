That&apos;s the lesson Maria McCormack, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054459/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/02/owner_of_car_damaged_by_jumper_i_mi.php">complained to the paper about her &quot;baby&quot;</a>&#x2014;a red Dodge Charger&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054459/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/01/man_survives_39-story_fall_after_la.php">being damaged by an apparently suicidal man</a> (she said, &quot;I want to meet [jumper Tom Magill] and say, &apos;Why? Why my car out of all the cars in the city?&apos;&quot;). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054459/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/charger_chick_auto_be_ashamed_SKgJ8ipn5Hgac25gUUxmeN">According to the Post</a>, now McCormack says, &quot;I have not slept since this has happened. My heart and prayers go out to the family. I&apos;ve been praying for Tom. I wish him all the best and a speedy recovery.&quot;</p>

<p>Magill, 22, is believed to have jumped from the 39th floor of 75 West End Avenue near 63rd Street on Tuesday morning.  McCormack&apos;s husband Guy had borrowed the car that day and parked it in a dead end&#x2014;and the vehicle apparently somewhat cushioned Magill&apos;s huge fall (he could have been going more than 100 mph).  The young man, a Fordham graduate who had once lived in the building, was described as looking like a &quot;pretzel&quot; after crashing through the car&apos;s back windshield; he has undergone many surgeries and face a long recovery, if he is able to survive other complications.</p>

<p>McCormack had told the Post in Thursday&apos;s interview, &quot;I wonder how he feels now that he made it. Does he feel like an idiot? I hope he&apos;s OK. But I just want to know why,&quot; which infuriated Magill&apos;s friends. One said, &quot;The damage to the car -- it saved his life, and that&apos;s what you should care about, not your car!&quot; while another  offered, &quot;I think it&apos;s unfortunate that someone would value a material object over someone&apos;s life.&quot;</p>
