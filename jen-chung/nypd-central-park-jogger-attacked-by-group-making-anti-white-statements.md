<p>Police say that the victim told them that she &quot;had been jogging in the park and upon leaving, she was struck by a pellet in the back of her head, causing a minor laceration and pain. She further stated that she observed three male blacks and two female blacks laughing and making anti-white statements towards the victim. The suspects then fled further into the park.&quot; The victim was taken to Roosevelt Hospital for treatment and released.</p>

<p>The NYPD Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident. Police say three suspects are males, approximately 15-20 years old who were last seen wearing dark clothes, while two female suspects are described as being 15-20 years old, also last seen wearing dark clothing. The NYPD released video of three of the suspects leaving the scene and a sketch of a female suspect who yelled at the victim.</p>
