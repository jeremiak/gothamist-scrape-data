</div></div>					<p>The company that runs the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus announced today that it will shut down the 146-year-old show in a few months. Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, wrote in a letter that he and his family &quot;made the difficult business decision that Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey&#xAE; will hold its final performances in May of this year.&quot; And it&apos;s the elephants&apos; fault, partially.</p>

<p>&quot;Ringling Bros. ticket sales have been declining, but following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/11/ringling_bros_circus_elephants.php">transition of the elephants off the road</a>, we saw an even more dramatic drop. This, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus an unsustainable business for the company,&quot; he explained in the letter (the full text of the letter is below).</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">During tonight&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/https://twitter.com/hashtag/CircusXTREME?src=hash">#CircusXTREME</a> show in Orlando, Kristen Michelle Wilson made her debut (and history!) as Ringling&apos;s first female Ringmaster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/https://t.co/MPL73cQp8u">pic.twitter.com/MPL73cQp8u</a></p>&#x2014; Ringling Bros.

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/http://abc7ny.com/entertainment/ringling-bros-circus-to-close-after-146-years/1702900/">The AP reports</a>, &quot;The company broke the news to circus employees Saturday night after shows in Orlando and Miami,&quot; and suggests that the circus has become less of a cultural &quot;must-see&quot; for today&apos;s families:</p><blockquote>But as the 20th century went on, kids became less and less enthralled. Movies, television, video games and the internet captured young minds. The circus didn&apos;t have savvy product merchandising tie-ins or Saturday morning cartoons to shore up its image.<p></p>

<p>&quot;The competitor in many ways is time,&quot; said Feld, adding that transporting the show by rail and other circus quirks - such as providing a traveling school for performers&apos; children- are throwbacks to another era. &quot;It&apos;s a different model that we can&apos;t see how it works in today&apos;s world to justify and maintain an affordable ticket price. So you&apos;ve got all these things working against it.&quot;</p>

<p>The Feld family bought the Ringling circus in 1967. The show was just under 3 hours then. Today, the show is 2 hours and 7 minutes, with the longest segment - a tiger act - clocking in at 12 minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;Try getting a 3- or 4-year-old today to sit for 12 minutes,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote>Elephants were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/11/ringling_bros_circus_elephants.php">removed from the circus last year</a>&#x2014;two years earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/05/ringling_bros_elephants.php">than initially planned</a>&#x2014;after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/16/video_alec_baldwin_joins_peta_to_st.php">years of animal cruelty accusations</a>, which Feld Entertainment denied, though elephants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/peta_protesters_stand_in_shadows_of.php">were still being handled with &quot;bullhooks.&quot;</a><p></p>

It&apos;s been through every kind of economic cycle, political cycle.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, a &quot;visibly emotional&quot; Feld told the AP, &quot;We tried all these different things to see what would work, and supported it with a lot of funding as well, and we weren&apos;t successful in finding the solution.&quot;</p>

<p>The last touring date for Ringling Bros. circus is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001638/http://www.ticketmaster.com/The-New-Coliseum-tickets-Uniondale/venue/75">at the Nassau Coliseum</a> in Uniondale, NY, with the final show on May 21.</p>

<blockquote>A message from the Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, the producer of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey&#xAE;

<p>After much evaluation and deliberation, my family and I have made the difficult business decision that Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey&#xAE; will hold its final performances in May of this year. Ringling Bros. ticket sales have been declining, but following the transition of the elephants off the road, we saw an even more dramatic drop. This, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus an unsustainable business for the company.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 years ago, my father founded our company with the acquisition of Ringling Bros. The circus and its people have continually been a source of inspiration and joy to my family and me, which is why this was such a tough business decision to make. The decision was even more difficult because of the amazing fans that have become part of our extended circus family over the years, and we are extremely grateful to the millions of families who have made Ringling Bros. part of their lives for generations. We know Ringling Bros. isn&#x2019;t only our family business, but also your family tradition.</p>

<p>Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey&#xAE; Presents Circus XTREME will conclude its tour at the Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts Center in Providence, R.I., on May 7, 2017, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey&#xAE; Presents Out Of This World will conclude its tour at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on May 21, 2017. We hope you will come to celebrate this American icon for one last time before our tours conclude.</p>

<p>Our company provides quality, live family entertainment, and we invite you to bring your family to one of our other events, including Marvel Universe LIVE!, Monster Jam, Monster Energy Supercross, AMSOIL Arenacross, Disney On Ice and Disney Live!, as well as future productions.</p>

<p>Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey has served as inspiration for all of the live entertainment produced at Feld Entertainment. We learned from the circus, and applied those learnings to our other productions. Without Ringling Bros., we wouldn&#x2019;t have the vibrant live entertainment company that we have today. Ringling Bros. will always be part of Feld Entertainment, and its spirit will live on in every production and project we do.</p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Kennth Feld</p></blockquote><p></p>

Thirty-six years of PETA protests, of documenting animals left to die, beaten animals, and much more, has reduced attendance to the point of no return.<p></p>

<p>All other animal circuses, roadside zoos, and wild animal exhibitors, including marine amusement parks like SeaWorld and the Miami Seaquarium, must take note: society  has changed, eyes have been opened, people know now who these animals are, and we know it is wrong to capture and exploit them.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has picked up a protest sign, passed out leaflets, written letters, shared videos, called legislators, spoken to family, and been part of this relentless pursuit of freedom for animals. This would not have happened without you.</p></blockquote><p></p>
