<p>Actress Ellen Barkin used her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/http://www.andersoncooper.com/2011/11/21/ellen-barkin-twitter/">filterless</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/http://jezebel.com/5851866/ellen-barkin-curses-her-way-onto-twitter">curse-laden</a> Twitter account to rant about the NYPD today.  In the wee hours of the New Year, Barkin was walking in Manhattan and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/https://twitter.com/#!/EllenBarkin/status/153384546035974144">noted</a>, &quot;Walking home...13th &amp; 6th, police making random arrests of non protesters.Young girl in police van screaming&apos;I&apos;m just trying 2 get home&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Then she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/https://twitter.com/#!/EllenBarkin/status/153385120638828545">Tweeted</a>, &quot;People being thrown in police vans, arrested for &apos;jaywalking&apos;What happened to the NYPD of my youth?Who are u all?Shame shame on u all&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/https://twitter.com/#!/EllenBarkin/status/153387339362734080">and</a> &quot;Just threatened on my street by NYPD,cop shoved me,both hands,onto sidewalk..Is it a crime 2 stand in the street in NY?WTF is going on here?&quot; Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/https://twitter.com/#!/Sam_Levinson/status/153407351918034944">video</a>, shot by Sam Levinson (Barkin&apos;s rumored boyfriend) of Barkin asking cops what&apos;s going on and her reaction to being touched by one:</p>

<p>She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/https://twitter.com/#!/EllenBarkin/status/153411317095600129">explained</a>, &quot;I was trying 2 make my way 2 young girl they had thrown in2 the van.She was not a protester.Was not drunk.She was walking home&quot;  Police arrested a number of people from the Occupy Wall Street protest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/http://authors.gothamistllc.com/mt/mt-static/images/spacer.gif">at Zuccotti Park and other areas</a>.</p>

<p>Then Barkin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/https://twitter.com/#!/EllenBarkin/status/153389141265104896">also said</a>, &quot;NOT MY CITY!

<p>When we contacted the NYPD about Barkin&apos;s claims of random arrests at 13th and 6th Avenue, an officer at the Deputy Commissioner of Information&apos;s Office told us this was the first he&apos;d heard about them and said he had no information there.  TMZ says they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731221416/http://www.tmz.com/2012/01/01/ellen-barkin-nypd-video/#.TwCfuCNSSFc">sent the local precinct the video to review</a>.</p>
