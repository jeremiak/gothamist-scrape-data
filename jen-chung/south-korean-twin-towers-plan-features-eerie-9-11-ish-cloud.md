<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161339/http://www.talkitect.com/2011/12/cloud-2-luxury-residential-towers-in.html">Talkitect reports</a> about a South Korean development plan, &quot;Yongsan Dream Hub corporation presented today the MVRDV designed residential development of the Yongsan Business district: two connected luxury residential high-rises. A 260 meter tall tower and a 300 meter tall tower are connected in the centre by a pixelated cloud of additional program offering amenities and outside spaces with wide views.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161339/http://gawker.com/5866748/south-korea-unveils-new-twin-tower-plans-as-worlds-jaw-hits-floor">Gawker notices that it bears an eerie resemblance</a> to, well, the World Trade Center&apos;s Twin Towers during 9/11 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161339/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,548781,00.html">disturbing images</a>): &quot;AAAAAGH! YOU HAVE ERECTED A TERRIFYING MONUMENT TO THE NIGHTMARES OF 9/11!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Talkitect adds, &quot;The two towers are positioned at the entrance of the Yongsan Dreamhub project, a master plan designed by Studio Libeskind, extending the business district of the South Korean capital Seoul.&quot; You may remember that Daniel Libeskind designed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161339/http://gothamist.com/2003/06/12/wtc_redesign_revisions.php">original &quot;Freedom Tower&quot; plan</a> but then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161339/http://gothamist.com/2003/12/12/more_wtc_drama.php">it was scrapped</a> because power players hated it (there was lots of drama).  Libeskind is still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161339/http://gothamist.com/2003/07/18/libeskind_is_shown_the_money.php">credited with the WTC Master Plan</a>&#x2014;really, it&apos;s even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161339/http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects/ground-zero-master-plan">on the Studio Libeskind website</a>&#x2014;so this design kind of seems like a F-U.</p>
