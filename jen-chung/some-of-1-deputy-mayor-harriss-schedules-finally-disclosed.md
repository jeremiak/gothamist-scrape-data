Now, over a year later, City Hall has released them, just in time for long Yom Kippur and Columbus Day weekend! <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112253/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3661394/whats-deputy-mayor-patti-harriss-schedule-brad-pitt-russell-simmons-">Capital New York&apos;s Azi Paybarah writes</a>, &quot;My first attempt to obtain her schedule through a FOIL request in May 2010 was delayed, then ignored. New York Post reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112253/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hidden_agendas_of_hizzoner_top_aide_ynx2iKzoos96u0npfJSAOM">Annie Karni wrote last week </a>about City Hall &apos;failing to give any explanation&apos; for not releasing Harris&apos;s schedule in response to a FOIL request in January.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112253/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/nyregion/patricia-harris-bloomberg-deputy-has-calendars-released.html?ref=nyregion">The NY Times writes</a>, &quot;The Bloomberg administration, which has long resisted disclosing the calendars of its top officials, took over a year to release copies of Ms. Harris&#x2019;s schedule in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Although The New York Times requested five years of calendar entries, the Bloomberg administration released only two years&#x2019; worth, saying that was all that was ready.&quot;</p>

<p>And what was released is very redacted (see sample, via Azi Paybarah, below), but some observations include her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112253/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/10/08/2011-10-08_top_bloomy_aide_a_star_with_favorseeking_celebrities.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/cultu">many meetings with celebrities</a> (Brad Pitt! Russell Simmons! Edward Norton! Emma Thompson! Bono!), journalists, lawmakers (even former lawmakers, like Bill Clinton) and city officials.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112253/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/09/3535356/harris-has-many-roles-including-bloomberg-understudy-sheekey-reveals">Harris has claimed</a> she works 60 hours a week for the city, and 5 hours a week on the Bloomberg Family Foundation. </p>

<p>The Times points out, &quot;The calendar does not offer a hint that she was deeply involved with what happened on Nov. 9 &#x2014; Mr. Bloomberg&#x2019;s controversial selection of Cathleen P. Black as schools chancellor.&quot; And mayoral press secretary Stu Loeser said, &quot;Most of what we do doesn&#x2019;t end up on the calendar. The mayor will call her up and say: &#x2018;What&#x2019;s the morning look like? Can you meet me at Gracie?&#x2019; And it wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily show up in a calendar.&quot;</p>
