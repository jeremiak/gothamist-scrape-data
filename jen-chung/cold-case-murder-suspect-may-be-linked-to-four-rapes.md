A police source, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511173354/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/killer_eyed_in_rapes_nX0VDHZXuzL1ALxGVsOrZO">while talking to the Post</a>, said of James David Martin, &quot;We&#x2019;re looking at him for at least three, and possibly four other rapes.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Last fall, a Bronx homicide detective working on the 1998 death of Marleny Cruz retrieved evidence from her case and sent scrapings from her nails to a lab.  A DNA hit brought up Martin, who is currently serving a prison sentence for killing his common-law wife (he strangled her) in 2005.  Martin&apos;s murderous past doesn&apos;t stop there: At age 17 he killed a friend for his Air Jordans in 1989. As for Cruz&apos;s death, Martin reportedly admitted to having sex with the teen and allegedly admitted to killing her by accident when he &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511173354/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/suspect-james-martin-arraigned-1998-rape-amp-murder-bronx-teenager-article-1.1075799?localLinksEnabled=false">grabbed her neck for a few minutes</a>.&quot;  Martin&apos;s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511173354/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/pennsylvania-convict-arrested-in-1998-cold-case-slaying-of-bronx-girl-to-be-arraigned/"> lawyer said</a>, &quot;Everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and until proven guilty, he&#x2019;s innocent.&quot;</p>

<p>The detective who broke the case, Malcolm Reiman, described telling Cruz&apos;s foster mother about the arrest, &#x201C;She jumped up and hugged me and she told me God told her one day I&#x2019;d come through her door... These families continue to feel the pain. It doesn&#x2019;t go away... It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether it&#x2019;s 14 minutes old or 14 years old, victims deserve justice.&quot;</p>
