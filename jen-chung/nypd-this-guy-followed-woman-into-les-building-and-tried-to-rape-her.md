<p>A man followed a woman into her Manhattan apartment and tried to rape her early yesterday morning, police say.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at 12:20 a.m. on Friday, March 3. According to the NYPD, the woman was heading back to her building near Norfolk and Rivington Streets when the male suspect followed her, &quot;shoved thorough the door and groped her. He then attempted to remove her clothing but the victim resisted.&quot; </p>

<p>A neighbor overheard the struggle and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307192859/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-follows-woman-home-in-lower-east-side-attempted-rape/1784165/">told WABC 7</a>, &quot;I did hear the commotion that I can say. And I did hear her say &apos;no, no!&apos; But saying somebody&apos;s name as she&apos;s saying &apos;no, no!&apos; I thought it was just a dispute between girlfriend and boyfriend, and he had left. After I heard all the EMS, and now I&apos;m starting to realize what had happened.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect then fled the building. Police released surveillance video and described him as being 28-34 years old, 5&apos;10&quot; to 6&apos; and 170-180 pounds. He was last seen wearing a brown waist length jacket and black jeans.</p>
