<p>Police are hoping the public can help them identify the man who apparently used a needle or another sharp object to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708075930/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/woman_attacked_with_needle_on_midto.php">stab an R train passenger</a> on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 6:50 p.m. at the 49th Street N/Q/R station on 7th Avenue in Manhattan. According to the NYPD, a 37-year-old was &quot;waiting for the &apos;R&apos; train when an unknown male bumped into her from behind at which time she felt pain in her right arm.  The victim went to Astoria General Hospital where, upon medical examination, redness was discovered on her right arm.&quot;</p>

<p>Doctors believe her injury is consistent with a needle attack, though it&apos;s unclear what was used in the assault. The victim was treated and released.</p>

<p>In addition to distributing video of the suspect, police describe him as about 40 years old, 6&apos;, 250 pounds and partially bald with short blonde hair. He was wearing eyeglasses, blue jeans, gray hooded sweatshirt and blue waist length jacket.</p>
