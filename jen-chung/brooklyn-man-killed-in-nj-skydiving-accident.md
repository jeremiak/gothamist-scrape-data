<p>A 49-year-old Brooklyn resident died yesterday while skydiving. Arkady Shenker crashed into a backyard in Washington Township at 2 p.m. and his injuries were fatal.</p>

<p>Shenker was an experienced skydiver, with at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608161456/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/brooklyn-skydiver-dies-n-plunge-parachute-fails-article-1.1763265">350 jumps under his belt</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608161456/http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9510177">According to WPVI</a>, &quot;The Gloucester County Prosecutor&apos;s Office says the experienced diver, who had jumped hundreds of times, wore a specialized parachute called a wing suit. The suit allows a skydiver to move forward while descending. It is unclear whether the suit opened properly.&quot;</p>

<p>A witness, Lamont Dye, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608161456/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Parachute-Doesnt-Open-as-Man-Approaches-Ground-255934631.html">told NBC 10</a>, &quot;We saw him coming down. He was going around and around... I knew he was in trouble.&quot; Anne Marie Dye, who said her family was on an Easter egg hunt, added, &quot;I saw the jumpers. Then I noticed one, and he kind of looked like he was conscious. He was just spinning.&quot; Then ran over to help him.</p>

<p>Shenker had jumped from a plane run by Freefall Adventures in Monroe, NJ. An NBC 10 reporter &quot;saw more skydivers parachuting from the sky hours after the Shenker&apos;s accident.&quot;</p>

<p>The federal authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608161456/http://nypost.com/2014/04/21/brooklyn-man-dies-in-new-jersey-skydiving-accident/">will be investigating</a>.</p>
