Prosecutors say that John Zaubler called 911 on May 30 from a West 72nd Street apartment and said, &quot;<strong>I&apos;m going to kill Judge Sotomayor by blowing her up. I&apos;m going to blow her up. I&apos;m going to do it. I&apos;m going to do it because my girlfriend is not going to federal prison.</strong>&quot; The 48-year-old pleaded not guilty to making terroristic threats; he&apos;s being held at Bellevue for psychiatric evaluation. Prosecutors also said he wanted to turn himself in. Newsday adds that Zaubler previously pleaded guilty to harassment in 2005 for making 25 calls to a person in one week, saying, &quot;There is a New York City police unit called the intelligence department and I have used them before to break into people&apos;s apartments. I had Daniel Patrick Moynihan arrange that for me; a Syrian agent will kill you unless you have your friend Jasmine apologize for insulting my Muslim friend.&quot;</p>
