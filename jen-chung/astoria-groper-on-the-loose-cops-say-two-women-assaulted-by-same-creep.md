<p>Police believe the same person violently groped women in two different incidents in Queens last week. </p>

<p>The first incident occurred just after midnight on July 21st, in front of 30-61 46 Street: The NYPD says the male &quot;suspect approached the 25 year-old female from behind, pushed her up against a car and touched her genitals over her clothing. When the victim yelled out for help the suspect fled the location.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, a few minutes later, just a couple blocks away, near 45 Street and Newton Road, police say that &quot;the suspect approached the 26 year-old female from behind, wrapped his arms around her and touched her genitals over her clothing. The suspect fled southbound on 45 Street when the victim yelled out for help.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Investigators released surveillance footage of the suspect, who is described as being in his 20s and 5&apos;4&quot; to 5&apos;5&quot; with a slim build and last seen wearing a light blue t-shirt, black pants and black sneakers.</p>
