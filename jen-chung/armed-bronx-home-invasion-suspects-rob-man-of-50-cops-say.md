<p>The police are hoping the public can help them identify four suspects wanted in a home invasion that took place earlier this week in the Bronx.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 6:05 p.m. on Tuesday, December 16th in the 43rd Precinct, a female suspect knocked on a door and pretended to be the victim&apos;s sister &quot;while partially covering her face.&quot; The victim opened the door, and &quot;three male suspects forcefully entered the residence, displaying weapons, and demanding money. The suspects then fled with $50 in cash and fled to unknown location.&quot; The male victim was not injured.</p>

<p>Police released photos of the suspects and say the male suspects had Jamaican accents. One suspect had a knife and another had a gun. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011001/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">Crime Stoppers Website</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
