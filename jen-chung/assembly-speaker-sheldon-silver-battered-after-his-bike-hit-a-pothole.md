										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_11_sheldsonsilver.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229222136im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_sheldsonsilver.jpg" width="300" height="257" class="image-left"> </span>Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is considered one of the most powerful men in New York State, but even he doesn&apos;t have power over the conditions of the streets he bikes on.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229222136/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/11/4139108/assembly-speaker-silver-bruised-busy-after-bicycle-accident#.TsFk6jBj4kM.email">Capital New York&apos;s Azi Paybarah reports</a>, &quot;Half of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver&apos;s face is bruised and purple, and there are stitches over his left eyebrow and a scab across his nose and the back of one of his hands. Silver sustained the injuries while riding a bicycle when he hit a pothole and fell, according to a spokesman for the lower Manhattan Democrat.&quot;</p>

<p>Spokesman Michael Whyland said, &quot;The speaker said to me he feels a lot better than he looks,&quot; and that Silver is conducting his regular duties. We&apos;ve called Silver&apos;s office to find out where exactly this dastardly pothole is located (we suspect it&apos;s within the five boroughs, but perhaps Silver was biking in Albany!) and whether he called 311 to complain, but this much we know: It&apos;s super-convenient that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229222136/http://www.weitzlux.com/Sheldon/Silver_93.html">Silver is a lawyer</a> at personal injury law firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229222136/http://www.weitzlux.com/">Weitz &amp; Luxenberg</a>&#x2014;we&apos;re sure they can get a good settlement from the Department of Transportation.  Of course, we&apos;re left with this riddle: If NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229222136/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/07/breaking_silver.php">had congestion pricing</a>, would potholes be filled faster?</p>
