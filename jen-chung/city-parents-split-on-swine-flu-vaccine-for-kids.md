A 9-year-old at PS 157 in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn who received an injection <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325101021/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/28/2009-10-28_city_kicks_off_swine_flu_vaccine_program_.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;My mom told me that the flu would hurt more than the shot...It felt a little bit sharp, and it kind of hurted.&quot; Aww.<p></p>

<p>The vaccine was also available in the nasal spray form; Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said, &quot;This is a safe vaccine. It&apos;s free, and we really encourage people to get it,&quot; but some parents are still wary.  The News says about 30% of the parents at PS 157 signed the consent form and the city officials said it seemed like 5-50% of parents had signed the form.  One PS 157 parent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325101021/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/nyregion/29vaccine.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;<strong>The swine flu vaccine has not been out long enough for me to trust it. They have never gotten a flu shot, and they&#x2019;ve never gotten the flu.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>A principal of another Brooklyn school said, &quot;Parents have a lot of questions, and it&#x2019;s such a personal matter. I don&#x2019;t see it as my role to encourage or discourage people &#x2014; I certainly am not in the business of giving medical advice.&quot; (Some parents are also having their kids go to the doctor for shots.) Wired&apos;s cover story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325101021/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/">is about vaccines</a> and has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325101021/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/a-short-history-of-vaccine-panic/">timeline of &quot;vaccine panic.&quot;</a></p>
