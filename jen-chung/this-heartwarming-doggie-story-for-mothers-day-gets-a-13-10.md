					<p>Get your tissues ready&#x2014;we have an update about the adorable pit bull mix who spent a year (!) recovering from an abusive living situation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/photos_of_extremely_lovable_and_ado.php#photo-1">while looking for a furever home</a>&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300/https://www.aspca.org/news/patrol-adoptable-cruelty-victim-gets-special-outing-nypd-officers">she found it</a>. She was recently reunited with the dog she was rescued with... and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300/http://aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> believes they are mother-and-daughter! </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2017_05_zaza1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_05_zaza1.jpg" width="300" height="349"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300/https://www.aspca.org/news/aspca-pit-bull-joins-nypd-commissioner-take-your-dog-work-day">Zaza and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton</a> (ASPCA)</i></div> The puppers known as Jamie and Zaza were found severely underweight by police officers in Brooklyn&apos;s 63rd Precinct in April 2016. One-year-old Zaza&apos;s ears were both infected and she also had a skin infection between her toes, but by June, she joined then-Police Commissioner Bill Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300/https://www.aspca.org/news/aspca-pit-bull-joins-nypd-commissioner-take-your-dog-work-day">for &quot;Take Your Dog to Work Day&quot;</a> and was adopted right after. <p></p>

<p>Jamie, who was four at time, was more seriously injured: Her coat was paws were &quot;soaked in urine and feces and her nails had grown so long they were curving into her feet,&quot; according to the ASPCA, who looked over her during her six-month road to recovery. </p>

<p>By the time she was healthy and ready to be adopted, police officers from 12 different NYPD precincts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/photos_of_extremely_lovable_and_ado.php">took her for a special day out</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Jamie and Zaza met each other for the first time since being rescued. The ASPCA believes that Zaza is one of Jamie&apos;s daughters, and a spokeswoman said, &quot;It&apos;s remarkable how they recognized each other immediately. Jamie doesn&apos;t like other dogs much, but she seems to love Zaza! She was rolling around in joy (something her adopters said she&apos;s never done) and was giving Zaza lots of ear kisses.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2017_05_jamie1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_05_jamie1.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030300/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/photos_of_extremely_lovable_and_ado.php#photo-1">Jamie at the 20th Precinct</a>, during her special day out (ASPCA)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Zaza was adopted by Stacey Richman&#x2014;who also renamed her Dani&#x2014;after she went with her company to volunteer at the ASPCA. &quot;I wasn&apos;t honestly expecting to adopt... I just saw this dog, and that was all she wrote. I needed her. You could say it was fate. I really believe she and I were meant to find one another. I couldn&apos;t be more grateful for the day if I tried. She&apos;s the best thing to happen to me,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>Einat Lapidot and her husband Matt Winum are Jamie&apos;s new humans and recalled, &quot;We had wanted to adopt for awhile, and when we walked into the ASPCA to look, we knew we wanted to rescue a dog that had the slimmest chances of finding a home. [She] had been in the Adoption Center awhile, and the minute we met her, we knew she was meant to be with us!&quot; </p>

<p>They also renamed Jamie &quot;Lucinda.&quot; Lapidot added, &quot;She&apos;s also completely changed our perceptions of pit bulls. Lucinda is sweet and gentle. We&apos;re so happy to have her in our lives!&quot;</p>

<p>Richman and Lapidot also plan to have Dani and and Lucinda meet up again. Lapidot said, &quot;We were as happy as Lucinda to see her playing and having a good time,&quot; while Richman said, &quot;It would be unfair at this point not to. It&apos;s clear it brings them such joy, and I will do anything to make my baby happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dani and Lucinda&apos;s story is an incredible example of how dogs can overcome past tragedy to become loving companions,&quot; said Howard Lawrence, Vice President, ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement. &quot;Their reunion was made possible through the ASPCA&apos;s partnership with the NYPD and the generosity of adopters opening their homes and hearts to canine cruelty victims. We encourage everyone to always make adoption their first option.&quot;</p>
