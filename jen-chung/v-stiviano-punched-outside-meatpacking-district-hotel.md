<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://laist.com/tags/vstiviano">V. Stiviano</a>, who helped make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://laist.com/2014/04/26/la_clippers_owner_allegedly_tells_g.php">Donald Sterling&apos;s racism too terrible to ignore,</a> was attacked outside the Gansevoort Hotel last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/06/donald-sterling-gal-pal-v-stiviano-brutally-beaten-up/">her lawyer says</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://nypost.com/2014/06/02/v-stiviano-attacked-by-two-men-outside-restaurant/">Attorney Mac Nehoray said</a> that two men &quot;punched her on the right side of her face several times... They were about 5-foot-7 and they knew exactly who she was. They began to hit her and called her the N-word.&quot;</p>

<p>Stiviano made recordings of real estate mogul and L.A. Clippers owner Sterling airing extremely bigoted views about blacks and Mexicans, resulting in Sterling&apos;s ultimate ban from the NBA and the sale of the Clippers. She&apos;s been described as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://laist.com/2014/05/09/sterling_not_a_racist_he_says_but_j.php">his mistress</a>, personal assistant and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://laist.com/2014/05/03/v_stiviano_claims_donald_sterling_i.php">by Stiviano herself as a &quot;silly rabbit.&quot;</a> She is in NYC to appear on Anderson Cooper&apos;s CNN show, after a weekend where an old video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://laist.com/2014/05/31/video_v_stiviano_says_black_people.php">where she mocks black people surfaced</a>.</p>

<p>Nehoray described the men as white, adding, &quot;Other disgusting slurs were made against her. She was able to run away and several onlookers then began attempting to apprehend the two men.&quot; He said she was treated by a doctor and is fine overall, but &quot;one side of her face is extremely red... obviously [she is] very scared&quot; about her wellbeing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151202/http://nypost.com/2014/06/02/v-stiviano-attacked-by-two-men-outside-restaurant/">Post spoke to a bouncer</a>, who &quot;said he saw Stiviano and her crew get involved in the brawl at around 7 p.m.&quot;</p><blockquote>He said Stiviano was with several male and female friends when they got into an argument among themselves. That&#x2019;s when the two strangers got involved.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Eventually, hands started being thrown,&#x201D; the bouncer told The Post. &#x201C; It looks like the guys in the group were defending the girls.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The bouncer said he didn&#x2019;t see Stiviano get hit, and didn&#x2019;t hear the N-word.</p>

<p>&#x201C;In the chaos, I did not see her get popped in the face, but it wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me if she did because it was crazy out there,&#x201D; he said.</p></blockquote>And a manager at a restaurant in the hotel said, &quot;One of the patrons who saw the whole thing said they saw one guy punch her in the face out nowhere,. So they got into a tussle and she tried to get away. Some people tried to break up the fight. One of the guys who was trying to beat her up ended up really bloody.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Stiviano hasn&apos;t filed a police report yet, but Nehoray believes she plans to, telling Radar Online, &quot;[H]er immediate reaction was to run away from the attackers and get to safety.&quot;</p>
