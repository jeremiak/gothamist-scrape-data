</div></div><p>Aside from lawmaker protest over the government&apos;s $700 billion bailout plan, there were a number of protests across the country over the bailout.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104420/http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE48O8KJ20080926">Labor unions organized</a> a protest on Wall Street yesterday. AFL-CIO president John Sweeney said, &quot;The Bush administration wants us to pay the freight for a Wall Street bailout that does not even begin to address the roots of our crisis.  We want our tax dollars used to provide a hand up for the millions of working people who live on Main Street and not a handout to a privileged band of overpaid executives.&quot; </p>

<p>United Federation of Teachers head Randi Weingarten said, &quot;We know that he economic situations has to be solved.  But we want a a responsible rescue, not an opportunistic bailout.&quot;  And Reverend Jesse Jackson said afterward, &quot;The homeowners need long-term, low interest rates and the restructuring of loans, not the repossession of homes.&quot;</p>

<p>dietrich has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104420/http://www.flickr.com/photos/dietrich/sets/72157607498261083/">great Flickr set of protest photographs</a>; a few are above.
