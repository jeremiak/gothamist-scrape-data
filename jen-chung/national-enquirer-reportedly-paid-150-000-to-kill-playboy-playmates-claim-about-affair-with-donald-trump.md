<p>A Playboy Playmate allegedly sold her story about a 2006 affair with Donald Trump to the National Enquirer&apos;s parent company for $150,000&#x2014;but the tabloid never ran it. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108211104/http://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;The tabloid-newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early August with Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. American Media Inc., which owns the Enquirer, hasn&#x2019;t published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to his current wife, Melania. Quashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as &apos;catch and kill.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Further, &quot;Ms. McDougal expected her story about Mr. Trump to be published, people familiar with the matter said. American Media didn&#x2019;t intend to run it, said another person familiar with the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>National Enquirer&apos;s parent company American Media Inc. claims that it paid $150,000 to McDougal for &quot;two years&#x2019; worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man,&quot; according to the WSJ. </p>

<p>The company said in a statement, &quot;AMI has not paid people to kill damaging stories about Mr. Trump.&quot; </p>

<p>AMI&apos;s CEO David Pecker is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108211104/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/trumps-alliance-with-the-national-enquirer.html?mid=twitter-share-di">good friends with Trump</a> and has run unflattering stories about Trump&apos;s opponents as well as featured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108211104/https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-trump-national-enquirer/">first-person essays from Trump</a>. </p>

<p>Trump&apos;s campaign claimed that any reports of an affair were false. His team has also said the numerous accusations that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108211104/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/18/people_writer_trump_assault.php">sexually assaulted women</a> are untrue.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108211104/http://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380">From the WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>A contract reviewed by the Journal gave American Media exclusive rights to Ms. McDougal&#x2019;s story forever, but didn&#x2019;t obligate the company to publish it and allowed the company to transfer those rights. It barred her from telling her story elsewhere. The company said it also would give her monthly columns to write and would put her on magazine covers...<p></p>

<p>[McDougal&apos;s lawyer Keith] Davidson&#x2019;s work for Ms. McDougal was in connection with &#x201C;claims against Donald Trump and or assisting client in negotiating a confidentiality agreement and/or life rights related to interactions with Donald Trump and/or negotiating assignment of exclusive press opportunities regarding same,&#x201D; according to a copy of Mr. Davidson&#x2019;s agreement to represent her, which was reviewed by the Journal.</p></blockquote>McDougal allegedly told friends that she was seeing Trump for 10 months, between 2006 and and 2007, and one friend &quot;recalled attending the Miss Universe pageant at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles as a guest of Mr. Trump in 2006. Mr. Trump&#x2019;s limousine picked up Ms. McDougal and her at Ms. McDougal&#x2019;s Beverly Hills home, and the two women sat in the front row with Mr. Trump and music producers Quincy Jones and David Foster. Mr. Trump escorted them home, the friend said.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Interestingly, Davidson also represents the porn star Stormy Daniels, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108211104/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/donald-trump-and-stormy-daniels-738920">who was &quot;friendly&quot; with Trump</a>, and the WSJ says she &quot;was in discussions with ABC&#x2019;s &apos;Good Morning America&apos; in recent months to publicly disclose what she said was a past relationship with Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the talks&quot; before going silent.</p>
