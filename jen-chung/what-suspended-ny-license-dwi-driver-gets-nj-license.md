The cop, Kenneth Baribault who had just pulled over a different DWI driver, was in his patrol car when Rahiem Griffin plowed into the cruiser with his Merecedes at 75MPH.  </p>

<p>According to Newsday, Griffin&apos;s NY license had been suspended in twice for unpaid tickets and had other citations.  Griffin managed to get a NJ license last year--he dropped his middle initial-- and NJ&apos;s Motor Vehicle Commission didn&apos;t realize he had other suspensions.  The NJ license was suspended in February 2008 for an unpaid ticket.</p>

<p>Griffin&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110701/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05202008/news/regionalnews/li_drunk_prays_for_cop_he_hit_111635.htm">claimed his client had &quot;dozed off&quot;</a> right before the crash, and asked for $2,500 bail, but the judge set it at 200,000 bond or $100,000 cash.  Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi said of DWI-related crashes, &quot;It&apos;s not appropriate to call these accidents,  These are conscious decisions by people to get behind the wheel of the car when they&apos;ve been drinking.&quot;</p>

<p>Baribault&apos;s family is keeping a vigil for him; he suffered massive head trauma and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110701/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-libari0520,0,6730677.story">doctors removed a piece of his skull</a> to relieve pressure from swelling.  The 30-year-old cop had been studying for his BA at Empire State College and would often take on overtime work &quot;to pay for his 6-year-old son&apos;s extracurricular activities.&quot;  </p>
