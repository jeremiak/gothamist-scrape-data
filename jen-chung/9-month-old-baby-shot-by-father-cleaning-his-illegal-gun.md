Apparently Pedro Rosales was cleaning his illegal &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011542/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/11/23/parents-charged-after-brooklyn-baby-struck-by-bullet/">Colt .45 handgun Saturday when it accidentally fired</a>.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011542/http://nypost.com/2014/11/22/police-probing-death-of-toddler-in-nyc/">Post reports</a>, &quot;The mom and dad said they were riding a subway train and when they got off at the Myrtle Avenue station, the baby began to cry. They told police they looked at her, realized she was bleeding, and took her to nearby Woodhull Hos&#xAD;pital.&quot; But it turns out that Rosales was cleaning the gun in their apartment at 580 Sutter Avenue when it went off. </p>

The gun was found inside the apartment. The baby&#x2019;s mother, Jessica Aguilar, 24, told cops she was out for most of the day. When she returned, her child was crying and there was blood on her clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>Baby Jessica Rosales was taken to Bellevue Hospital for surgery. She&apos;s now listed in stable condition. A neighbor told WCBS 2, &quot;I&#x2019;m just praying that the child is OK,&quot; adding, &quot;I never suspected that he would carry any gun because he&#x2019;s a working man. He&#x2019;s a good person.&quot; However, WCBS 2 says that Rosales, 47, has a history of gun arrests.</p>

<p>Rosales has been charged with assault, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon, and acting in a manner injurious to a child,&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011542/http://7online.com/news/parents-charged-after-9-month-old-shot-in-brooklyn/407250/"> WABC 7 reports</a>, while Aguilar is charged with reckless endangerment, and acting in a manner injurious to a child.</p>
