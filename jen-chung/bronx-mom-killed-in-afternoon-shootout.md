<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203153/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7027301">WABC 7 reports</a> that two brothers had opened fire on a man at Willis Avenue and East 146th, &quot;chasing him down the street as he fired back.&quot;  Santiago tried to protect her child (relatives say she ducked behind her laundry cart while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203153/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/bronx_mom_saves_son_before_being_5I1xqkoKlfcFk6sKNb68XJ">Post says</a> she pushed him into a building vestibule), but she was hit in the chest and died in front of the boy.  </p>

<p>Another man was shot&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203153/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/106212/one-dead--one-injured-in-bronx-shooting/Default.aspx">a witness told NY1</a>,  &quot;I seen the guy when he got shot. The guy was laying on the floor. He was gushing blood. I felt so bad. <strong>You know it&apos;s crazy you can&apos;t even stand or walk around cause you gotta watch for a gunshot or something.</strong>&quot;&#x2014;but it&apos;s unclear whether he was a bystander or one of the suspects.  Police are still looking for the shooters.</p>
