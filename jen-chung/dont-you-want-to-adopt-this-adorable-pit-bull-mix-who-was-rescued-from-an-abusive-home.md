					<p>A sweet four-year-old pit bull mix who survived an abusive home is now looking for her furever family. And Jamie is such a special pup that cops from different Manhattan police precincts gave her a playdate to show how she&apos;s a friendly, sweet dog. </p>

<p>Jamie was rescued by officers in the 63rd Precinct in April: She and another dog, Zaza, were found severely underweight in disgusting conditions; the ASPCA says, &quot;Jamie&apos;s coat and paws were soaked in urine and feces and her nails had grown so long they were curving into her feet.&quot;</p>

<p>Zaza recovered from double ear infections and a skin infection to be adopted in June (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022758/http://www.aspca.org/news/aspca-pit-bull-joins-nypd-commissioner-take-your-dog-work-day">she appeared with then-Police Commissioner Bratton</a> at &quot;Take Your Dog To Work Day&quot;). Now, after spending six months healing, Jamie is ready for her new humans. The officers, who were from 12 different precincts in Manhattan North, took her to Riverside Park and the 20th Precinct for a few hours of fun and some cute pictures. </p>

<p>Howard Lawrence, Vice President of ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement, said, &quot;Jamie&#x2019;s story is a great example of a dog&#x2019;s ability to triumph over abuse and neglect to become a loving companion. We&#x2019;re thankful to the NYPD officers for their dedication to helping dogs like Jamie find the safe, loving homes they truly deserve, and we encourage anyone looking to celebrate  Adopt a Shelter Dog Month this October to consider adopting an animal rescued through the ASPCA&#x2019;s partnership with the NYPD.&quot;</p>

<p>Those interested in adopting Jamie can call (646) 291-4500 for more information or visit our Adoption Center at 424 E. 92nd Street, New York, NY. Just think&#x2014;you could have a sweet &quot;happily ever after&quot; story like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022758/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/14/aspca_nypd_adopted_pets.php">these other rescued animals and their families do</a>!</p>
