<p>The source explains, &quot;[Bush] doesn&apos;t feel personally snubbed and appreciates the invitation, but Obama&apos;s claiming all the credit and a lot of other people deserve some of it... Obama gave no credit whatsoever to the intelligence infrastructure the Bush administration set up that is being hailed from the left and right as setting in motion the operation that got Bin Laden. It rubbed Bush the wrong way.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm, let&apos;s flashback to Bush&apos;s thoughts about Bin Laden six months after the 9/11 attacks (and six months after saying Bin Laden was &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110506221356/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-09-17/us/bush.powell.terrorism_1_bin-qaeda-terrorist-attacks?_s=PM:US">wanted dead or alive</a>&quot;, when he was asked why he didn&apos;t mention Bin Laden anymore in speeches. After explaining that the terror network was bigger than just Bin Laden (you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110506221356/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020313-8.html">read the exchange here</a>), he said, &quot;I don&apos;t know where he is.  You know, I just don&apos;t spend that much time on him, Kelly, to be honest with you.&quot; Bush reiterated, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t necessarily say he&apos;s at the center of any command structure.  And, again, I don&apos;t know where he is.  I  --  I&apos;ll repeat what I said.  I truly am not that concerned about him.  I know he is on the run.  I was concerned about him, when he had taken over a country.  I was concerned about the fact that he was basically running Afghanistan and calling the shots for the Taliban.&quot;</p>

<p>Luckily, Rudy Giuliani is out there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110506221356/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/02/giuliani_bush_deserves_credit_for_k.php">giving Bush credit</a>.</p>
