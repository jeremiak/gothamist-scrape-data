<p>Yesterday saw a day of national pride for Brazil, a big win for Mexico and a bet from USMNT&apos;s Kyle Beckerman.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em><br>
 <br>
<strong>Netherlands 2, Chile 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032934/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186470/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Both Netherlands and Chile were assured of advancing into the next round, but what they played for was the chance to avoid playing the eventual winner of the Group A, Brazil. Substitutes Leroy Fer and Memphis Depay both scored.</p>

<p><strong>Cameroon 1, Brazil 4</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032934/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186472/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Neymar scored twice for Brazil, and Fred and Fernandinho got the other goals. Joel Matip scored Cameroon&apos;s lone goal. </p>

<p><strong>Austraila 0, Spain 3</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032934/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186467/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Spain, having already been bounced from the tournament, at least was able to end its 2014 World Cup run with a sound victory over the Socceroos. David Villa, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata all scored.</p>

<p><strong>Croatia 1, Mexico 3</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032934/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186452/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Mexico also punched their ticket for the knockout rounds, sending Croatia home in the process. Rafael Marquez, Andres Guardado and Javier &quot;Chicharito&quot; Hernandez scored for Mexico, all within ten minutes. Ivan Perisic gave Croatia the consolation goal.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>Here&apos;s David Villa&apos;s cheeky backheel goal over Austraila:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Italy vs. Uruguay </strong>(12PM ET, ESPN)<br>
<strong>England vs. Costa Rica</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN2)</p>

<p>Costa Rica are already through to the Round of 16, and England is out, so Italy-Uruguay will be the one to watch here. Italy can advance on a draw, so expect Luis Suarez and Uruguay to take it to the Azzurri.</p>

<p><strong>Japan vs. Colombia</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN)<br>
<strong>Greece vs. Ivory Coast</strong>, (4PM ET, ESPN2)</p>

<p>Colombia have secured their spot to move out of the group, but all three of the other teams still are in contention for second place in Group C. Ivory Coast will need to overcome a painfully defense Greece to move on, while Japan would need to upset the group leaders to have any chance of moving on.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>Kyle Beckerman said he&apos;d <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032934/https://twitter.com/RealSaltLake/status/481434490867183616">shave his famous dreadlocks off</a> if USMNT beat Germany.</p>

<p>Ghana says they want to sue the Daily Telegraph <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032934/http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/jun/24/president-ghana-fa-to-sue-daily-telegraph-match-fixing-allegations-video">over match fixing allegations</a>.</p>

<p>English footballing legend Ian Wright <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032934/http://www.theguardian.com/football/shortcuts/2014/jun/24/ian-wright-punishment-unpatriotic-footballers">weighed in</a> on recent suggestions that not all English footballers want to play for the national team. His solution? Players who don&apos;t play for the Three Lions should &quot;be made to phone the parents of soldiers killed in Afghanistan.&quot;</p>

<p>And Mexico&apos;s coach, Miguel Herrera, knows how to celebrate:</p>
