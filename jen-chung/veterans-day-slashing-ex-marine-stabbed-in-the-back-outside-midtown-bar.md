One of them men had pulled out a blade during the heated exchange, witnesses said.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;They were all boasting and drinking a lot. The biggest guy there had an American flag in his hands,&#x201D; said Jesus Ferrer, 45, a Bronx medical coder. &#x201C;The big dude with the beard (Matos) said he could fight anyone in the place.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>
