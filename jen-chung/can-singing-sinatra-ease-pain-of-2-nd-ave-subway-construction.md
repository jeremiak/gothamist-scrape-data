<p>A reader sent us a photograph of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808001354/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/29/shocking_photos_prove_work_on_secon.php#photo-1">Second Avenue Subway construction</a> worker at 73rd Street and Second Avenue. Reader Mike G said he&apos;s &quot;singing Sinatra with a mic and amp&quot; and received &quot;loud applause from the small gathering.&quot; Aww, that&apos;s a small consolation when area residents and businesses have to listen to this&#x2014;not to mention deal with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808001354/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/26/update_residents_near_2nd_ave_subwa.php">noxious smells and dust plumes</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808001354/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/27/relatives_blame_bicyclists_death_on.php">hazardous road conditions</a>&#x2014;racket every day:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s Ol&apos; Blue Eyes singing &quot;Don&apos;t Sleep in the Subway,&quot; which really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808001354/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&apos;t_Sleep_in_the_Subway">refers to the British subway</a> (a pedestrian underpass) but whatever.</p>
