<p>It&apos;s almost the Lunar New Year 4714&#x2014;the Year of the Rooster officially starts on Saturday, January 28th&#x2014;but the NYC festivities started last night, with a light show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021718/https://twitter.com/EmpireStateBldg/status/824748128003825669">on the Empire State Building</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021718/http://www.nyclunarnewyear.org/events.html">fireworks over the Hudson River</a>. Yes, those &quot;explosions&quot; you may have heard were actually fireworks:</p>

<p>The spectacular display took place across from the Chinese Consulate. The fireworks, which could be heard all the way in Brooklyn, caused some confusion for some who missed the announcement from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021718/https://twitter.com/NotifyNYC/status/824346201629872131">Notify NYC</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021718/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/26/celebrate_lunar_new_year_at_these.php">from here</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021718/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/nyregion/new-york-today-the-year-of-the-rooster-chinese-lunar-new-year-parade.html?_r=0">here</a>).</p>
