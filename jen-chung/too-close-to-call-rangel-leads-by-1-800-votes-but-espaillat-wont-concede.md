Thank you so very much.&quot; However, challenger State Senator Adriano Espaillat, who has 43.6%, wants every vote counted. Espaillat said, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705030300/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/08/rangel_wrangles_990-vote_lead_after.php">As we learned in 2012</a>, every single vote needs to be counted in this race. Given the thousands of votes outstanding, the people of Upper Manhattan and The Bronx deserve a full accounting of every vote to achieve a complete and accurate tally in this race.&quot;</p>

<p>Rangel, 84, is hoping for his 23rd term in Congress, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705030300/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/16/after_walk_out_rangel_awaits_house.php">spite of scandals</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705030300/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/19/rangel_faces_censure_vote_aka_publi.php">very embarrassing 2010 House censure</a> that stripped him of his powerful chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee. Espaillat, 59, who would be the first Dominican-American in the House, seized on the district&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705030300/http://online.wsj.com/articles/rangel-faces-test-as-turfs-demographics-shift-1403479757">increasingly Latino demographics</a> and made his appeal as a fresh face without Rangel&apos;s baggage. </p>

As of Tuesday night, the New York City Board of Elections said it had given out 2,834 absentee ballots, of which 903 were returned so far, and 738 of those deemed valid. Absentee ballots must be received by the board no later than next Tuesday in order to be counted. No count of affidavit ballots was immediately available.&quot;</p>
