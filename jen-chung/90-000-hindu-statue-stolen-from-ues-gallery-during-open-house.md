<p>According to the NYPD, the grand larceny took place on March 16th at 2:30 p.m. at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104354/http://www.nancywiener.com/">Nancy Wiener Gallery</a> on East 74th Street, where &quot;an unidentified person removed a Gilt Bronze statue from the 60-year-old female victim&apos;s residence during an open house art exhibition at her residence.&quot; </p>

<p>Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104354/http://nypost.com/2016/04/04/thief-swipes-90k-tibetan-statue-from-gallery/">tell the NY Post</a> that Wiener &quot;told cops that she saw &apos;nothing unusual&apos; while the $90,000 gilt bronze Sino-Tibetan statue was on display during the event that coincided with Asia Week New York... It wasn&#x2019;t until the next day when Wiener went to move the piece to a more secure location because the statue went up in value during an auction that she noticed it was gone.&quot;</p>

<p>The statue &quot;depicts the Hindu gods Yama &#x2014; known as the Lord of Death &#x2014; Yami and a buffalo,&quot; the Post reported.</p>

<p>The authorities had raided a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104354/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/arts/design/law-enforcement-focuses-on-asia-week-in-inquiry-of-antiquities-smuggling.html">number of galleries during Asia Week</a>&#x2014;including Wiener&apos;s&#x2014;in search of apparently looted works of art.</p>
