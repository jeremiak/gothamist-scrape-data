The girl, who had been playing with her older sisters (the coyotes may have targeted her because she was the smallest), suffered bites on her shoulder and thigh, and maybe her ear. A neighbor told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195950/http://www.lohud.com/article/20106280329">the Journal News</a>, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s really uncommon, and clearly the animals are crossing the line. This is a deliberate attack and I hope something is done about it.</strong> Summer is here, and kids are outside playing much later. We have three kids, and we can&apos;t let them out any more at night until they catch these coyotes.&quot; The NY State DEC has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195950/http://www.dec.ny.gov/environmentdec/19062.html">tips on avoiding coyote conflicts</a>.</p>
