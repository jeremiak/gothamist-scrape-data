<p>A Yale University graduate student who recently returned from Liberia is being treated for Ebola-like symptoms at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012629/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/16/ynhh-admits-patient-with-ebola-like-symptoms/">Yale Daily News reports</a>, &quot;While University administrators have insisted that the patient did not have contact with the disease, Yale Medical School Dean Robert Alpern said that the patient &apos;did have contact with one person who eventually developed ebola.&apos;&quot; <b>Update</b>: The student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012629/http://www.courant.com/health/hc-yale-new-haven-hospital-1017-20141016-story.html#page=1">has tested negative for Ebola</a>. </p>

<p>Further, YDN adds &quot;A source familiar with the patient&#x2019;s travel activities said the patient came in direct contact with NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who was diagnosed with Ebola on Oct. 1. The patient indicated that contact came the day before Mukpo developed symptoms, the source said. NBC declined to comment on the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>The patient, who was in Liberia with another graduate student to study Ebola, was admitted to the hospital last night. Test results are expected today; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012629/http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20141016/yale-grad-student-who-traveled-to-liberia-hospitalized-with-ebola-like-symptoms-in-new-haven">the New Haven Register reports</a>, &quot;officials [said] the patient&#x2019;s condition improved once being admitted to the hospital.&quot; The patient is being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012629/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/nyregion/yale-graduate-student-with-ebola-like-symptoms.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">kept in a negative pressure room</a>, &quot;to prevent the air from circulating to other parts of the hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>Yale President Peter Salovey said, &quot;The doctoral students who visited Liberia are knowledgeable about public health. They have reported that they were not in contact with Ebola patients or caregivers in Liberia, that they carefully followed recommended travel and hygiene precautions during their stay in the country and that they have continued to do so since their return.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Preliminary tests showed the student was negative for Ebola. The Hartford Courant reported, &quot;Shortly after 5 p.m. Thursday, Yale New-Haven doctors confirmed the preliminary results, but said they were waiting for official confirmation from the CDC in &apos;an overabundance of caution,&apos; according to a statement from Dr. Thomas Balcezak, Yale-New Haven&apos;s chief medical officer. &apos;In the meantime we will continue to monitor the patient using all appropriate protocols and precautions in order to ensure the safety of our staff, patients and community,&apos; Balcezak said.&quot;</p>
