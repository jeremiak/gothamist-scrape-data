Well, now they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032718/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/terrible-jobs-report-scares-everybody.html">are freaking out</a>, because only 69,000 jobs were added last month, pushing the unemployment rate up to 8.2%.  <p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032718/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303552104577440023931752902.html?mod=WSJ_Home_largeHeadline">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected a gain of 155,000 in payrolls and for the jobless rate to remain at 8.1% in May.&quot; Hugh Johnson, &quot;whose payrolls projection of 75,000 was the closest to the May reading among economists surveyed by Bloomberg,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032718/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-01/employment-in-u-s-increased-69-000-in-may.html">told Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;The labor market is clearly deteriorating. Confidence in the economy is declining. Businesses are extremely reluctant to add workers when there&#x2019;s so much uncertainty.&quot;  And it&apos;s the global economy that is causing uncertainty&#x2014;Europe is troubled and growth is slowing in China and Brazil.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032718/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/business/economy/us-added-69000-jobs-in-may-jobless-rate-at-8-2.html?_r=1&amp;hp">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;It was the third mediocre performance by the job market in three months, after a period of solid growth over the winter that raised hopes that the recovery was gaining momentum.&quot; One economist told the Times, &quot;In February or March, I thought the labor market had achieved escape velocity. It appears to me now that that was a premature call.&quot;</p>
