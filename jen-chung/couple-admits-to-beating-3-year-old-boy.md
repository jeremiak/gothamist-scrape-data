However, Nymeem Cheatham and Lemar Martin, who are being held without bail, did not confess to killing Kyle Smith, who was found with cigarette burns, bruises all over his body, a torn tongue, a broken pelvis, and signs of sexual abuse.  </p>

<p>Back in 2007, when Cheatham petitioned for custody of Kyle (his mother left him with her), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810095444/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06102008/news/regionalnews/city_blew_chance_to_save_tot_114884.htm">Administration for Children&apos;s Services found Cheatham&apos;s</a> &quot;house in order and the child happy and healthy.&quot;  But it turns out that Cheatham was wanted in Texas for abusing her biological children, ages 4, 5, 9 and 13.  An ACS spokesperson said the agency couldn&apos;t have known, &quot;There is no national child-welfare database.  We can only run records through the New York state child database.&quot; And ACS has no record of a complaint from Smiths&apos; paternal grandmother or the police that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810095444/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/09/more_questions_1.php">allegedly made in February</a>.</p>

<p>Kyle&apos;s father, Elliott Smith, is devastated, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810095444/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/06/10/2008-06-10_dad_crushed_over_death_of_little_kyle_.html">according to his mother who spoke to the Daily News</a>: &quot;He&apos;s in mourning right now.  He&apos;s not doing very well at all, but he&apos;s hanging on.&quot;  The News adds, &quot;it was unclear why Smith did not claim his younger son&quot; and that Smith could not be reached.  </p>
