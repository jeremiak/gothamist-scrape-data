<p>During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142916/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/04/governor_cuomo_gambles_on_gambling.php">his State of the State Address</a> at the beginning of the year, Governor Cuomo announced that the state was planning a $4 billion convention center and hotel/casino complex that would replace the Javits Center on the Upper West Side, &quot;New York needs a larger, state-of-the-art venue to be competitive for the largest tradeshows and conventions.&quot;  Now, less than six months later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142916/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/nyregion/plan-collapses-for-queens-convention-hall-and-casino.html?ref=nyregion">Cuomo says</a>, &quot;The conversations&quot; between the state and the developer &quot;haven&#x2019;t really worked out.&quot;</p>

<p>The proposed convention center would have been bigger than America&apos;s current-largest convention center in Chicago, and Cuomo believed it would &quot;bring to New York the largest events, driving demand for hotel rooms and restaurant meals and creating tax revenues and jobs, jobs, jobs. In addition to the new convention space, up to 3,000 hotel rooms will be developed. We will make New York the No. 1 convention site in the nation.&quot; </p>

<p>The complex would have been built by Genting, a Malaysian company behind the Aqueduct&apos;s electronic gambling facility in Queens, and state officials<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142916/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/queens_convention_center_might_be_w.php"> had pointed out that the costs</a> would be born by Genting, so it wasn&apos;t a big deal to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142916/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/16/we_must_renovate_the_javits_center.php">spend $2 billion to renovate the Jacob Javits Center</a>, only to destroy it when the Queens convention center opens or that trade show attendees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142916/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/nyregion/2-trade-show-guests-travel-to-aqueduct-to-evaluate-cuomos-plan.html">might actually want to be closer to Midtown</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the NY Times points out the new &quot;revelation left a fog of uncertainty over Mr. Cuomo&#x2019;s drive to bring casino gambling to New York City, which his administration views as a key source of jobs and revenue. The Genting proposal alone was expected to create 10,000 construction jobs and 10,000 permanent jobs.&quot; Apparently the roadblocks to a deal included the difficulty Cuomo had in getting more casinos in New York as well as Genting&apos;s desire to be New York City&apos;s sole casino operator.  </p>

<p>Cuomo is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142916/http://www.capitaltonight.com/2012/06/cuomo-says-talks-with-genting-have-stalled/">reportedly &quot;undeterred&quot; and says the state</a> has been talking to other operators. </p>
