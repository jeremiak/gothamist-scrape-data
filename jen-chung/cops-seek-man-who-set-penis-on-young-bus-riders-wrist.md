<p>A teenage girl had the absolute <em>worst</em> bus experience last month.</p>

<p>Police say a sexual assault occurred on a Bx9 bus on Friday, October 23rd, at around 8 a.m., when it was near East Kingsbridge Road and Grand Concourse: A male suspect &quot;exposed himself to a 16-year-old female victim by placing his private part on her wrist.&quot;</p>

<p>What the fuck. </p>
