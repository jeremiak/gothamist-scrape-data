<p>President Obama has <em>finally</em> weighed in on the most important issue of the summer&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110411085956/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosque">mosque and community center</a> proposed at 45-47 Park Place, two blocks away from the World Trade Center Site.  At a White House Ramadan event, Obama supported the plans for the mosque, &quot;Muslims have the right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country,&quot; pointing out that it passed city planning laws and emphasized the founding tenets of the U.S. of A.  Here&apos;s an excerpt of his speech (video below; full text after the jump):</p><blockquote>Recently, attention has been focused on the construction of mosques in certain communities - particularly in New York. Now, we must all recognize and respect the sensitivities surrounding the development of lower Manhattan. The 9/11 attacks were a deeply traumatic event for our country. The pain and suffering experienced by those who lost loved ones is unimaginable. So I understand the emotions that this issue engenders. Ground Zero is, indeed, hallowed ground.<p></p>

<p>But let me be clear: as a citizen, and as President, I believe that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances. This is America, and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakeable. The principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country, and will not be treated differently by their government, is essential to who we are. The writ of our Founders must endure.</p>

<p>We must never forget those who we lost so tragically on 9/11, and we must always honor those who have led our response to that attack - from the firefighters who charged up smoke-filled staircases, to our troops who are serving in Afghanistan today. And let us always remember who we are fighting against, and what we are fighting for. Our enemies respect no freedom of religion. Al Qaeda&#x2019;s cause is not Islam - it is a gross distortion of Islam. These are not religious leaders - these are terrorists who murder innocent men, women and children. In fact, al Qaeda has killed more Muslims than people of any other religion - and that list of victims includes innocent Muslims who were killed on 9/11.</p>

<p>That is who we are fighting against. And the reason that we will win this fight is not simply the strength of our arms - it is the strength of our values. The democracy that we uphold. The freedoms that we cherish. The laws that we apply without regard to race or religion; wealth or status. Our capacity to show not merely tolerance, but respect to those who are different from us - a way of life that stands in stark contrast to the nihilism of those who attacked us on that September morning, and who continue to plot against us today.</p></blockquote><br>
Mayor Bloomberg, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110411085956/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/03/bloomberg_chokes_up_during_ground_z.php">speech at Governors Island</a> were previously the strongest words of support for the project, Park51 (see its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110411085956/http://www.park51.org/">website with mission and vision</a> stated), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110411085956/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38702141/ns/politics-white_house/">praised Obama</a>, &quot;Two hundred and twenty years ago this week, the Father of Our Country penned his famous letter to the Jewish Community of Newport Rhode Island or, as he called them, &apos;the Children of the Stock of Abraham.&apos; President Obama&apos;s words tonight evoked President Washington&apos;s own August reminder that &apos;all possess alike liberty.&apos;... This proposed mosque and community center in Lower Manhattan is as important a test of the separation of church and state as we may see in our lifetime, and I applaud President Obama&#x2019;s clarion defense of the freedom of religion tonight.&quot;  But of course there were dissenters:<p></p>

<p>Republican NY gubernatorial candidate Rick Lazio, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110411085956/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/lazio_clinging_to_ground_zero_mosqu.php">spoken out</a> against the mosque, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110411085956/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/us/politics/14obama.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;With over 100 mosques in New York City, this is not an issue of religion, but one of safety and security.&quot;  And Rep. Peter King (R-Long Island), said, &quot;It is insensitive and uncaring for the Muslim community to build a mosque in the shadow of ground zero. While the Muslim community has the right to build the mosque, they are abusing that right by needlessly offending so many people who have suffered so much. The right and moral thing for President Obama to have done was to urge Muslim leaders to respect the families of those who died and move their mosque away from ground zero. Unfortunately, the president caved into political correctness.&quot;</p>
