Police released the footage, as well as images of two individuals who are wanted in connection of Alastasia Bryan&apos;s murder.<p></p>

<p>Bryan, 25, was off-duty when she was found dead in her car at East 73rd Street and Avenue L in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, on December 4th around 9:15 p.m. NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said that she had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021317/http://www.amny.com/news/nyc-off-duty-correction-officer-fatally-shot-in-brooklyn-nypd-says-1.12706225">left her mother&apos;s house</a> to make a phone call when the shooter walked up to the car and fired five times. </p>

<p>AMNY reports, &quot;The suspect appeared to be waiting for Bryan in another car and got out to shoot her,&quot; Boyce said. &quot;He then got into a tan car and drove off.&quot;</p>

<p>Bryan was found with gunshot wounds to her head and body. </p>

<p>The video shows the shooter walking towards Bryan&apos;s car and firing. Then the shooter flees west on Avenue L and gets into what the police say is a gold or tan colored 4-door Hyundai Elantra. The shooter and another individual are described as males in dark colored clothing.<br>
