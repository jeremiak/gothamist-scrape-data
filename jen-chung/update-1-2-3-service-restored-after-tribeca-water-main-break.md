<p>If you take the 1, 2 or 3 trains, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071023/http://www.mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html">check MTA.info</a> before you go, because a 20&quot; water main break at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071023/http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=murray+street+and+west+broadway&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89c25a192d429e3f:0x2d2e277e560929f5,W+Broadway+%26+Murray+St,+New+York,+NY+10007&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=mX19T_CoB4-C8ASM0_DyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCAQ8gEwAA">Murray Street and West Broadway</a> has caused issues along the line.  Right now, the 1 train is suspended between 14th Street and South Ferry, select 2 trains trains are running on the 5 line between the Nevins Street Station and the 149th Street-Grand Concourse Station in both directions, and the 3 train is suspended between the 14th Street Station and the Atlantic Avenue Station in both directions.</p>

<p>The break burst after 3 a.m. and flooded the street and Chambers Street station, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071023/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/05/water-main-break-in-lower-manhattan-impacting-traffic-transit/">WCBS 2</a>.  The MTA thinks service will be restored once water is pumped out.  Also, there is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071023/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8609160">shuttle service</a> between West Street to Battery Place. For business owners and residents in the area, it&apos;s tough: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071023/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/water-main-break-disrupts-subways-lower-manhattan-20120405-KC">There&apos;s no water for them</a> on West Broadway from Chambers Street to Murray Street.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: According to Notify NYC, &quot; Following a previous flooding condition, normal service has resumed on the 1, 2, and 3 trains in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Expect residual delays.&quot; Still, commuters, good luck!</p>
