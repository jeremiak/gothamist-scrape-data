<p>The super, John Goldsmith, described his ordeal at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325232159/http://www.emporis.com/building/1719unionsquarewest-newyorkcity-ny-usa">17-19 Union Square West </a> in a deposition, &quot;It&#x2019;s like going into a black hole ... I was screaming the whole time in agony. When I came down, I landed on my back and my left side, and I hit the ground and heard everything in my body break, all the bones break...  I bounced up in the air again and came down and hit again and heard everything break all over again. Then I started screaming.&quot;</p>

<p>Goldsmith&apos;s lawyer claimed that Transel &quot;bypassed the elevator&#x2019;s parking device, which would have prevented the doors from opening onto an empty shaft.&quot; </p>

<p>Young &amp; Rubicam new business executive Suzanne Hart had been entering an elevator when it suddenly closed on her and ascended, dragging her body up. Transel reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325232159/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/16/elevator_was_being_repaired_hours_b.php">had been working on the elevator</a> hours before the accident.  Elevator expert Patrick Carrajat  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325232159/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/15/elevator_expert_i_can_think_of_100.php">told us</a> it is a gruesome way to die, &quot;From what I&apos;m hearing, she was basically cut in half. In many ways it&apos;s better to be decapitated because the pain is over immediately.&quot;</p>
