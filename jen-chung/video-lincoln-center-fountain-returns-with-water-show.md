</div></div>					<p>As part of Lincoln Center&apos;s extensive and expensive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161009/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/20/alice_tully_hall_renovations_raptur.php">renovation</a>, the beloved Revson fountain has been reimagined as well.  Instead of the old, low-walled fountain (designed by Philip Johnson), architects Diller, Scofido + Renfro created a &quot;floating granite ring&quot;&#x2014;which acts as seating, if you don&apos;t mind getting a little wet&#x2014;around the water.  From the press release:</p>

<blockquote>The pool of water is lowered and converted to a shallow water surface at Plaza level. New technologies provide automated windspray sensors that adjust water pressure, height, and volume. Special nozzles and lighting systems allow for a multitude of special-effect water and light configurations. In terms of choreography, the fountain can create a wide range of water expressions from slow morphing geometric masses to fast paced chases. At night, the fountain is vibrantly illuminated with white light.</blockquote>The fountain&apos;s effects were designed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161009/http://www.wetdesign.com/">WET</a>, the design firm behind the fountain at Columbus Circe and the famous fountain at Las Vegas&apos; Bellagio Hotel. Here&apos;s a brief clip of the illuminated fountain at night (after the jump, there&apos;s video of the fountain during the day):

<p>Of course the change from the old fountain has upset some: In August, Andrew Dolkart of Columbia&apos;s historic preservation program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161009/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/26/lincoln_center_3.php">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s the thing that upsets me most of all about what&#x2019;s happened at Lincoln Center. They thought that they needed to spend a lot of money ripping out Philip Johnson&#x2019;s fountain and putting in something new instead of restoring something that worked well....&quot;</p>
