<p>Earlier this year, former governor David Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/paterson_joining_the_faculty_at_nyu.php">announced he was joining the faculty of NYU</a>. Now it turns out he&apos;ll be a visiting professor teaching a seminar called, &quot;The Art of Governing,&quot; which might possibly be code for &quot;Being Dysfunctional in Albany&quot; or &quot;Admitting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/25/paterson_did_a.php">Coke Usage</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/18/paterson_wife_e.php">Affairs Days After</a> Becoming Governor.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304803104576428452401997630.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLETopStories">The Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;The new course will meet once a week for 2&#xBD; hours and is open to freshmen students enrolled in the College of Arts and Science&apos;s honors program. Mr. Paterson will offer students a &apos;view into the day-to-day working knowledge of politics,&apos; according to a course guide.&quot; Originally, Paterson wanted to teach history but was convinced to teach about the sausage factory known as Albany; he told the WSJ that usually courses on the government are &quot;either excessively academic or they don&apos;t seem to have any direction at all... It&apos;s not always political horse-trading, or quid pro quos. It&apos;s using creativity to find a way to get people to work on the same page.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if the course will cover &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/13/governor_finally_fires_alleged_woma.php">Waiting to Fire Your Staffer Who Beat Up His Girlfriend</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/21/former_gov_paterson_off_the_hook_in.php">Lying About Free World Series Tickets</a>,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/03/governor_paterson_finishes_vetoing.php#photo-1">Signing 6,709 Line Item Vetoes</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/21/reports_caroline_kennedy_drops_out.php">That Time I Was Maybe Going To Make Caroline Kennedy Senator</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144927/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/23/paterson_aide_claims_late_filing_sy.php">My Aide Couldn&apos;t File His Taxes On Time</a>.&quot;</p>
