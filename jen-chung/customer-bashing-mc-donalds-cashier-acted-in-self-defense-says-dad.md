Let&#x2019;s be real now -- this was self-defense.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the customers slapped McIntosh when he went to check their $50 biill and then they both jumped the counter, prompting reactions like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018083220/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/video_mcdonalds_cashier_beats_custo.php#comment-334894067">this one from our commenters</a>, &quot;i hope this guy beats the charge...  from the description and video it looks like he kept his cool while getting completely harassed and then got slapped in the face and pursued behind the counter by a couple of complete lunatics.  maybe he didn&apos;t have to hit them the 3rd or 4th time but that&apos;s adrenaline.  good luck to him.&quot;</p>

<p>McIntosh&apos;s father said, &quot;We will not be railroaded,&quot; and hopes to hire a good defense lawyer.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018083220/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/2011/10/greenwich_villa_3.php">McDonald&apos;s issued a statement</a>,  &quot;The violence in this video is alarming and reprehensible.
