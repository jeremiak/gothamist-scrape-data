---

	
										<p>The 2008 Olympics in Beijing were officially kicked off, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303142541/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/sports/olympics/09china.html?hp">NY Times reported</a> that the festivities were an &quot;opening ceremony of soaring fireworks, lavish spectacle and a celebration of Chinese culture and international good will.&quot;  The ceremonies were produced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303142541/http://en.beijing2008.cn/culture/ceremonies/n214143744.shtml">director Zhang Yimou</a>, and NBC will be broadcasting the ceremony beginning at 7:30 p.m. EST tonight, but in case you want to get a sense of the highlights to look for, USA Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303142541/http://blogs.usatoday.com/goingforgold/2008/08/live-opening-ce.html">has a liveblog</a>.</p>

<p>As for live reaction, it seems China&apos;s making good on its promise to impress the world:</p>
