<p>The Daily News reports that the MTA has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122906/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/10/11/2008-10-11_mta_seen_near_deal_with_transport_worker.html">meeting with the Transit Workers Union</a>, &quot;holding secret negotiations to hammer out a contract months ahead of schedule - and without the usual rancor.&quot;  Nice, as we all remember what rancor and a lack of a contract meant last time: A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122906/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/20/strike_2.php">three-day transit strike</a> without subway and bus service--the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122906/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/24/transit_strike_7.php">exercise was good</a>.  </p>

<p>While neither the MTA nor union would comment, aside from the union saying the board is allowing union head Roger Toussaint to &quot;seek an early settlement,&quot; the News points out two factors leading to these much more (seemingly) amicable talks. First, the MTA&apos;s new management has &quot;forged a somewhat unprecedented working relationship with the union&quot; (former MTA chairman Peter Kalikow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122906/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/27/kalikow_says_he.php">had terrible relations</a> with the TWU).  Second, the union is also worried that delaying a contract in the faltering economy will hurt them.  </p>
