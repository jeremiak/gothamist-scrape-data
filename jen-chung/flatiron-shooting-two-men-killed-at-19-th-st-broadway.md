According to WABC 7, &quot;The victims, men in their 20s, were gunned down in the silver SUV, parked on East 19th Street, just before 4 a.m.&quot;    Apparently gun fire was heard prior to the discovery of the men&apos;s bodies.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718045303/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/10/04/2010-10-04_flatiron_murders_two_men_shot_to_death_in_parked_suv_near_manhattan_nightclub.html">Daily News spoke</a> to a Verizon field technician, who had been working a block away, &quot;There was a little bit of a brawl at the end of the street on the corner. I just heard someone screaming at the top of their lungs after the shots were fired. People started getting really distraught after they heard who got killed. One guy got really upset and picked up a garbage can and threw it at a cop car.&quot; He also said the SUV&apos;s driver side window was shot out, &quot;There were two other bullet holes in the windshield, one on the driver&apos;s side and one on the passenger side. It was a clear execution. <em>There was one woman losing her mind out there. She was yelling that it was her girlfriend&apos;s son and that she already lost another son</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>The victims, 22 and 26, were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718045303/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/two_men_shot_dead_near_union_square_9Lm4uJjKQmpvaAgG6IvNxJ">in a silver Mercury SUV</a>, and it&apos;s suspected they may have been in a fight at a nearby club. (There was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718045303/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/08/early_morning_flatiron_double_shoot.php">shooting at 21st &amp; Broadway</a> in 2008.)  The News adds, &quot;Both men lived in Coney Island and had multiple past arrests, including at least one each for gun possession.&quot;</p>
