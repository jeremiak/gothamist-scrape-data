<p>The old Mets luck swung in action during a pre-season game against the Detroit Tigers yesterday. Second baseman Jordany Valdespin got hit in the family jewels by a 94 MPH fastball from Tigers ace Justin Verlander. Mets manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040853/http://m.nypost.com/p/sports/mets/plunked_in_the_junk_SGl8HCJWp9vQKWmHIfbmyN">Terry Collins was PISSED</a>, telling the Post, &quot;You would think if you are starting at second base, <strong>you would be smart enough to wear a cup</strong>.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040853/http://m.nypost.com/p/sports/mets/plunked_in_the_junk_SGl8HCJWp9vQKWmHIfbmyN">Valdespin told reporters</a> he was hit &quot;in the dick&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040853/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-insider-nuts-valdespin-hit-junk-ball-article-1.1285802?localLinksEnabled=false">but</a> &quot;Everything is good, working good, normally. Everything is great.&quot; </p>

<p>Verlander felt bad, &#x201C;He took a hack at the first pitch and the next one &#x2014; he already hit one bomb &#x2014; and the next one he totally squared [toward] me. And I&#x2019;m like, &#x2018;Oh God, this isn&#x2019;t going to be good.&#x2019; Right out of the hand it&#x2019;s like, &#x2018;Oh, [bleep]! That is right at his [genitals].&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>Valdespin has a reputation as being &quot;brash&quot; and the Post reports, &quot;Collins has told Valdespin this spring to eliminate some of his antics, warning that he might become a target for pitchers. One such warning came two weeks ago after Valdespin faked a bunt leading off a game against Nationals ace Stephen Strasburg. In the same at-bat, Valdespin singled and received a glare from Strasburg as he ran to first base.&quot; Collins said that he&apos;s &quot;been told a lot in the last couple of years about how to handle himself on the major league field, especially when you are a young player. He understands it, he&#x2019;s adjusting to it and once in a while you always get caught up in the moment.&quot; Like wear a cup, for chrissakes.</p>
