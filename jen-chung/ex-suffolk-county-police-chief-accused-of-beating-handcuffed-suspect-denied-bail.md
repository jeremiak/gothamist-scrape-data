<p>The former chief of the Suffolk County Police Department will remain behind bars, as a judge has refused to grant him bail.  U.S. District Judge Leonard Wexler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405070059/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/james-burke-ex-suffolk-police-chief-denied-bail-friday-1.11217569">said of James Burke</a>, &quot;The corruption of an entire department by this defendant is shocking.&quot; </p>

<p>Burke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405070059/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/ex-suffolk_county_police_chief_arre.php">was arrested on Wednesday</a> and indicted for deprivation of civil rights and conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice. The Eastern District U.S. Attorney&apos;s office alleges that in December 2012, Burke interrupted the interrogation of Christopher Loeb, who had broken into a number of vehicles, including Burke&apos;s department SUV: &quot;Burke entered the interrogation room where Loeb was handcuffed and chained to an eyebolt fastened to the floor. Burke then allegedly punched and kicked Loeb in the head and body.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides stealing Burke&apos;s gun belt, ammunition, some cigars and a humidor, Loeb took a duffel bag that apparently held pornography and sex toys. Loeb thought the porn was kiddie porn, and allegedly called Burke a &quot;pervert,&quot; which prompted the assault. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405070059/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suffolk-police-chief-arrested-alleged-assault-article-1.2460203">Court papers state</a>, &quot;<strong>Knowing Loeb was a heroin addict, Burke threatened to kill Loeb stating that he would make sure Loeb received a &apos;hot shot,&apos;&quot;</strong> a.k.a. a lethal injection. </p>

<p>Loeb was in custody for days and was unable to contact his lawyer.</p>

<p>The feds also say that Burke bragged about beating Loeb and &quot;<strong>regaled a group of officers with his account of the assault, saying it reminded him of his &apos;old days&apos; as a young police officer.</strong>&quot; He is also accused of asking the officers who witnessed the beating to downplay the attack, and prosecutors say, &quot;Knowing Burke&apos;s reputation for violating the law and seeking retribution against those who went against his corrupt orders, the witnesses feared their careers would be destroyed if they did not join Burke&apos;s conspiracy to cover up the assault of Loeb.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405070059/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/suburban-ny-police-chief-federal-custody-35665277">The AP notes</a>, &quot;The Suffolk County Police Department, with more than 2,000 officers, is among the country&apos;s 15 largest departments. It has responsibility for patrolling much of eastern Long Island, although the ritzy Hamptons and several other towns also have local police departments that patrol those areas.&quot;</p>

<p>Burke is being held in protective custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. His attorney said, &quot;We are going to appeal. All the alleged cooperators have a reason to testify against Mr. Burke.&quot;</p>

He was very, very scared and he still is.&quot; Besides the alleged beating from Burke, Loeb has said that Detective Anthony Leto choked him and threatened to rape his mother. Leto and other officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405070059/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/anthony-leto-kenneth-bombace-2-cops-tied-to-james-burke-case-retire-from-suffolk-force-1.11140251">tied to the incident retired last month</a>.</p>
