<p>In an editorial today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201070310/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/editorials/the_dead_we_honor_9mdGlmLNICA9o21NoX2ILO#ixzz1NqLoRwE3">Post printed</a> the St. Crispin&apos;s Day speech from Shakespeare&apos;s Henry V, &quot;If we are marked to die, we are enow/ To do our country loss; and if to live/  The fewer men the greater share of honour/ God&apos;s will! I pray thee wish not one man more.&quot;  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201070310/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2011/05/30/2011-05-30_eighteen_servicemen_from_new_york_have_died_in_afghanistan_and_iraq_since_last_m.html">Daily News pay tribute</a> to the 18 men from New York State who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan since the last Memorial Day and quotes Emerson, &quot;Onward marches the Big Parade, forever into the somber beyond. A column of the young and the brave. Of the dutiful. When Duty whispers low, Thou must, The youth replies, I can!&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201070310/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/opinion/30mon4.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">NY Times&apos; editorial</a> looks at the current grief of families whose loved ones have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the continuing grief of families whose losses were in earlier wars, &quot;Whatever you make of the wars in which those soldiers fought, whatever you make of war itself, their sacrifices are real and permanent. How death came to them, now or then, is something only they can know. We who have not been called to war, or have been lucky enough not to lose anyone dear, still feel the loss. These are things worth remembering here in the last blush of spring, the first flush of summer.&quot;</p>
