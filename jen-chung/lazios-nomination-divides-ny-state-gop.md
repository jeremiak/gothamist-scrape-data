<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:230px; "> <img alt="2010_06_edcox.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085411im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_06_edcox.jpg" width="230" height="236"> <br> <i>NY State GOP Chair Ed Cox (AP)</i></div> Yesterday, the NY State Republican Party <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085411/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/02/republicans_pick_lazio_to_face_cuom.php">nominated Rick Lazio</a> to face off against Andrew Cuomo in this fall&apos;s race for the governor.  However, it seems the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085411/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/02/high_drama_ahead_of_ny_gops_guberna.php">process</a> has caused problems for the GOP, vs. the Democrats.  The Post reports one consultant as saying, &quot;This whole thing was a disaster. Politically, it was a disaster. Organizationally, it was a disaster. It was a train wreck.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Steve Levy, whose transformation from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085411/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/18/li_democrat_to_switch_parties_run_f.php">Democrat to Republican candidate</a> was supported by NY GOP Chairman Ed Cox, was seen as a more potent challenger to Cuomo, because as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085411/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/foes_are_andy_best_friends_aQ0BqJoKg3eKXDEDhCyvlM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz0pnyzjpQ1">Fred Dicker points out</a>, he &quot;has some $4 million in the bank, a track record as a fiscal conservative, and a natural base and proven bipartisan appeal in one of the state&apos;s larger counties.  Had the Republicans granted Levy the right to run in the September primary, the threat of his candidacy would have hung over Cuomo all summer.&quot; </p>

<p>Now it looks like Carl Paladino, the Buffalo developer with millions at his disposal, will try to challenge Lazio in a primary this fall.  Paladino, who is riding Tea Party emotions, said of the Republican convention, &quot;I thought guys in construction were cut-throat but some county chairmen make those guys look like girls scouts... I thought the Republican process would be fair and open but it was not.. One guy even disinvited me to a meeting I was never invited to to begin with. The process was a joke... Rick Lazio is a nice fellow and we have developed a cordial relationship and I think he is a man of his word- but he took a $1.2million dollar bonus as a lobbyist for Wall Street Bank handed $25 Billion in the Federal bail out. That&apos;s our tax money Rick put in his pocket.&quot;</p>
