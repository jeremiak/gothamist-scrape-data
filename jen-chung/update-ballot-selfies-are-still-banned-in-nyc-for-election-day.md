<p>State lawmakers are trying to make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175619/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/29/lawmakers_legalize_ny_state_ballot.php">ballot selfies legal in the future</a>, but what about this coming Election Day? Shouldn&apos;t New Yorkers have the opportunity to document their part in making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175619/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/01/hillary_clintons_already_booked_fir.php">scandal-tinged history</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175619/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/03/president_elect_nightmare.php">opening of the Hellmouth</a>? One Brooklyn lawyer is trying to help, by suing to have the New York ballot selfie ban suspended so we can make sure we have enough social media content on Tuesday.<em> <b>Update</b>: The judge rejected the lawsuit, meaning the ballot selfie ban stands. [More details below]</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175619/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/federal-judge-to-rule-on-allowing-ballot-selfies-this-election-1.12539769">Earlier this week</a>, federal judge Kevin Castel said he&apos;d decide on a lawsuit, filed on behalf of three NYC voters, to overturn the ballot selfie ban. From Newsday:</p><blockquote>Leo Glickman, a Brooklyn attorney representing the voters, argued the snapshots are a protected form of political expression under the First Amendment. &#x201C;In addition to basic free speech rights, we think this is the type of thing that gets people to vote,&#x201D; Glickman said in lower Manhattan&#x2019;s federal courthouse.<p></p>

<p>Attorneys for the state and city boards of elections argued that changing the current restrictions so close to the election would lead to &#x201C;confusion&#x201D; among thousands of poll workers who would need to be notified and retrained before Nov. 8.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Yes, the courts are going to have to iron out&#x201D; ballot-selfie policies, said New York Assistant Attorney General John Schwartz. &#x201C;But to make that change the week before a presidential election is going to cause havoc.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Schwartz and Stephen Kitzinger, an attorney representing the city, also argued that allowing voters to take pictures at the voting booth would lead to delays and long lines in a presidential election year that is expected to draw high turnout.</p></blockquote>Judge Castel also mimicked a voter trying to create Facebook fodder, saying, &quot;OK, I took the photo. Now, I just want to take a very short video,&quot; and worried about people who aren&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175619/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/1/clinton-2009-doesnt-know-how-use-computer-do-email/">in touch with technology</a> struggling to capture the moment.<p></p>

<p>One of the plaintiffs, Jennifer White, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175619/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2016/10/27/ny-law-that-prohibits-voters-from-taking-ballot-pictures-being-challenged-in-court.html">told NY1</a>, &quot;People voting and sharing their ballots on social media is a really great way to encourage people to participate in a system that is direly lacking in participation.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175619/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/can_u_instagramtweetselfiesnap_the_vote.php">It&apos;s illegal to take a photograph of your marked ballot</a>, and it&apos;s apparently punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine, but the law doesn&apos;t seem to be very strongly enforced. Erika Lorshbough, Legislative Counsel at the NYCLU, told us, &quot;The standards for restricting free speech, including ballot selfies, are very high. The First Amendment doesn&apos;t allow broadly banning innocent political speech with the hope that such a sweeping ban will address any underlying problematic conduct.&quot;</p>
