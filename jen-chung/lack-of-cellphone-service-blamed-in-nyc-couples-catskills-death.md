<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823022928/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/elderly-husband-wife-arthur-madeleine-morris-die-crash-catskills-home-cell-phone-signal-article-1.1076172">Daily News published a heartbreaking story</a> about a Manhattan couple, Arthur and Madeleine Morris, who died after getting into a car accident at their Catskills vacation home: &quot;Arthur, 88, was smothered trying to crawl out of the Ford Fusion, while brave wife Madeleine, 89, trekked to a road but died of exposure after a rainy night under a tarp.&quot; And they tried to call from their cellphone&#x2014;nine times&#x2014;but there was no service, seemingly dooming them to their circumstances.  </p>

<p>On May 3, Arthur Morris, Juilliard-educated music teacher, drove down his driveway and, according to the News, &quot;was negotiating a hairpin turn at the end when he slid off the road and into a ditch. The car rolled less than 15 feet down a steep embankment, hit a sapling and came to rest atilt on the driver&#x2019;s side, state police said.&quot;  It&apos;s believed that after the couple tried calling for help five times, Arthur tried to get out, but with the steep angle and the car&apos;s position, he fell and was &quot;wedged in an 8-inch space between the bottom of the door and the ground.&quot; He was asphyxiated.</p>

<p>The family says that Madeleine Morris, who helped Jews escape Nazis when she was a teen in France, tried calling four more times, but then left on foot for help.  She reached the vacation home of a neighbor, a quarter of a mile away, but the neighbor wasn&apos;t home, so she waited outside.  Grandson Jeantet Fields <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823022928/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/11/family-elderly-nyc-couple-dies-after-car-wreck-in-catskills/">told 1010 WINS yesterday</a>, &quot;When [my grandmother] was found the next day around noon, she was found soaked and she had actually pulled a plastic tarp over herself to cover herself. The medical examiner said that she was in excellent health and had a good 10 years left, but on the inside she showed definite signs of exposure.&quot;  He told the News, &quot;She could have smashed a window. There were logs there. But I don&#x2019;t think that ever would have occurred to her.&quot;</p>

<p>Fields added, &quot;None of the calls went through. As best we can surmise, they probably tried to get out of the car because they couldn&#x2019;t get any help on the phone.&quot;  Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823022928/http://www.wireless.att.com/coverageviewer/#?type=voice&amp;lat=42.20025708136768&amp;lon=-74.50505044394265&amp;sci=4">AT&amp;T;&apos;s coverage map</a> with the couple&apos;s location. Capt. James E. Barnes, of the New York State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation, told WCBS 880, &quot;There&#x2019;s been a problem for a long time, but it plagues law enforcement as well as the general public because of the remoteness of it and because the terrain. I don&#x2019;t know what the solution would be,&quot; noting that radio reception was also bad.  </p>

<p>Political officials and local phone companies have tried to encourage big carriers to add more service.  Fields is hopeful, &quot;If anything can come from this tragedy, it&#x2019;s lets actually let people in rural areas have the same type of thorough cell coverage that we have in urban areas.&quot;</p>
