<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425043507/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/jimmy_mcmillan_interview.php">Jimmy McMillan</a> may have captured the hearts and minds of New Yorkers with his &quot;Rent Is Too Damn High&quot; platform <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425043507/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/19/ny_governors_debate_send_in_the_clo.php">during last year&apos;s gubernatorial election</a>, but his rent for a one-bedroom in the East Village is actually a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425043507/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/20/rent_is_too_damn_high_candidates_re.php">Damn Sweet $872/month</a>, thanks to rent stabilization.  Now, the colorful candidate may be evicted, because his landlord wants to make the rent DAMN HIGH.</p>

<p>Last year, it was revealed that McMillan had a one-bedroom in the East Village where his son lived as well as a one-bedroom in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.  But McMillan&apos;s East Village landlord wants him out: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425043507/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jimmy-mcmillan-rent-damn-high-candidate-faces-eviction-article-1.981841?localLinksEnabled=false&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29">Daily News reports</a> that at the Manhattan housing court appearance, &quot;McMillan &#x2014; his distinctive white hair combed back &#x2014; insisted he was living at the Manhattan apartment while using a second address in Brooklyn as an office. But his landlord countered that McMillan is improperly using the Manhattan apartment as an inexpensive residence for his 32-year-old son, Jimmy McMillan IV. <strong>Estimates are that the landlord could rent the apartment for nearly three times as much as McMillan pays.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>McMillan explained he got the Brooklyn apartment (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425043507/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/26/video_jimmy_mcmillan_doesnt_want_to.php">a place McMillan doesn&apos;t like talking about</a>) through doing some odd jobs; the News also reports, &quot;Although he even registered to vote using the Brooklyn address, McMillan insisted that he always lived in Manhattan &#x2014; and produced a driver&#x2019;s license featuring his St. Mark&#x2019;s Place address.&quot; And there&apos;s a simple reason why McMillan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425043507/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/damn_eviction_looming_JzLPsV4hugxQThg5134mjP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">allowed his son to live in the apartment</a>: &quot;I want a grandkid. I stayed away so he could bring a young lady over.&quot;</p>

<p>A judge ordered that McMillan must turn over financial documents to his landlord.</p>
