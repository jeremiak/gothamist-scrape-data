<p>The mystery of the empty kayak that surfaced along the East River in DUMBO this week&#x2014;prompting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134412/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/13/unmanned_kayak_brooklyn.php">concerned response</a> from the NYPD and FDNY&#x2014;has been solved. Turns out the missing kayaker was eating pizza (&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134412/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/30/dtg-dumbo-kayaker-returns-2016-07-22-bk.html">I wanted a piece of pizza from Brooklyn</a>&quot;). Meanwhile, he left his kayak there unattended with all his stuff drifting into the water, panicking passersby who called 911.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134412/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/30/dtg-dumbo-kayaker-returns-2016-07-22-bk.html">reports</a> that Tyler Jordan was visiting New York from Virginia with the express purpose of kayaking around the city:</p><blockquote>[H]e had just docked his ride there at around 1 pm so he could sate his craving for an authentic Kings County pie at Dumbo&#x2019;s best pie joint, Front Street Pizza...Jordan indulged in two hard-earned pepperoni slices...<p></p>

<p>He then walked over the Brooklyn Bridge to check out the 9-11 memorial, planning to make it back within an hour-and-15 minute-window before the tide rose. But as he was walking back over the Brooklyn Bridge, Jordan noticed his kayak parking spot had turned into a crime scene. He thought perhaps someone had gotten into his boat and accidentally injured themselves &#x2014; only to find that he was the man they were searching for.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I saw all of the lights, all of the trucks and boats swirling around while I was going over the Brooklyn Bridge,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I saw tons of people there and thought, &#x2018;Uh-oh, maybe they&#x2019;re actually looking for me&#x2019; &#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="c70f291cfimg_7611-jpg-mobile.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134412im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/c70f291cfimg_7611-jpg-mobile.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> The kayak on ground (Jen Chung / Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Not only were there four boats in the water looking for Jordan, there were also four FDNY vehicles and an ambulance, plus firefighters, Parks Department workers and at least a dozen police officers.  </p>

<p>After setting everyone at ease, Jordan continued on his merry way:</p>

<p>But now a new mystery emerges: Why did Jordan eat at basic Front Street Pizza when he could have enjoyed the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134412/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/30/spoiler_alert_its_julianas.php">far superior pizza from Juliana&apos;s nearby</a>? Sad!</p>
