<p>People, the presidential election is November 6, 2012.  It might sound like a lot of time between now and then, but the Wall Street Journal wants to make sure its man&#x2014;former Massachusetts Governor, lover of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/14/ann_romney_in_1994_mitt_thought_it.php#photo-1">women who stay home with the kids</a> and presumptive Republican candidate, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://gothamist.com/tags/mittromney">Mitt Romney</a>&#x2014;is armed with all the advice he needs.  So in today&apos;s Wall Street Journal, there&apos;s an editorial giving him advice on how to differentiate himself from President Barack Obama, PLUS an op-ed from Karl Rove about choosing running mates.  This is better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://peanuts.wikia.com/wiki/Lucy&apos;s_psychiatry_booth">going to Lucy van Pelt</a>!</p>

<p>First, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304723304577365980491312146.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop">WSJ editorial says</a>, &quot;The temptation will be to assume the public has decided to fire the incumbent and so run a campaign to become the safe alternative. Take no policy risk, stress Mr. Romney&apos;s biography, his attractive family and the seven habits of highly effective businessmen, and then hammer away on the economy.&quot; Not so fast: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303978104577361810529662318.html">Obama is very likable</a>, so Romney has to actually give some <em>actual ideas</em> and not &quot;the gauzy American exceptionalism that Mr. Romney offered in his Tuesday night speech. His remarks had the right tone, the necessary optimism and some nice lines... But the speech was policy-free. To be credible, a reform agenda has to have some reform substance.&quot;</p>

<p>But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304811304577365870484193362.html?mod=opinion_newsreel">Rove&apos;s piece takes the cake</a>. Responding to all the hubbub about who Romney might anoint <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/standing-next-to-rubio-1424361.html">as his vice presidential pick</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/398530/september-29-2011/colbert-super-pac---ham-rove-s-comeback">Ham Rove</a> writes:</p><blockquote>This was brought home to me in 2000, when then-Gov. George W. Bush was strongly leaning toward picking Dick Cheney as his VP. He knew I was opposed and invited me to make the case against his idea. I came to our meeting armed with eight political objections. Mr. Bush heard me out but with a twist: I explained my objections with Mr. Cheney sitting, mute and expressionless, next to the governor.<p></p>

<p>The next day, Mr. Bush called to say I was right. There would be real political problems if he chose Mr. Cheney. So solve them, he said. Politics was my responsibility. His job was different: to select his best partner in the White House and a person the country would have confidence in if something terrible happened to him. The country was better served by Mr. Bush&apos;s decision than by my advice.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a lesson there for Mr. Romney. Choose the best person for the job. Leave the politics to the staff.</p></blockquote> Speaking of Cheney, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/27/dick_cheneys_heart_transplant_went.php">guy&apos;s got a brand new heart</a>, plenty of Vice Presidential experience, <em>zero</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/powell-chief-staff-col-larry-wilkerson-cheney-fears/story?id=14414226#.T5loIcRSTBM">war crimes convictions</a>, and nothing but time on his hands (and yeah, maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174347/http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">a little blood</a>). Think about it, Mitt: <em>Romney/Cheney 2012</em>. It even rhymes!<p></p>
