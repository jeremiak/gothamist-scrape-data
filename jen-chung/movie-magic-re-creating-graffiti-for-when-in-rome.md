<p>Clearly Lafayette Street between Houston and Prince Streets isn&apos;t gritty enough when a movie production crew has to carefully spray paint tags on boarded up store.  And of course the boards were applied to the former Otto Tootsi Plohound location earlier in the morning.  </p>

<p>All this hard work is for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520040916/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185416/">When in Rome</a>, a comedy starring Kristen Bell (aka Veronica Mars, Sara Marshall), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520040916/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/03/21/when-in-rome-josh-duhamel-woos-kristen-bell/">who told MTV</a>, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s about a slightly cynical girl who has no interest in finding love and works as a curator at the Guggenheim in New York City.&quot;  And of course she does find love in Rome, probably with Josh Duhamel&apos;s character, but wacky antics are ensured when there are co-stars like Will Arnett, Jon Heder and Dax Shepard.</p>
