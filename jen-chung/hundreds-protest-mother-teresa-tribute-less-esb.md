</div></div>					<p>Mother Teresa may have died nearly 13 years ago, but her legacy lives on, even if the Empire State Building wouldn&apos;t shine its lights in blue and white for her last night.  But hundreds of protesters still think the iconic building&apos;s owner, Anthony Malkin, was wrong to dismiss the request.  The Catholic League&apos;s William Donohue, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424002729/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/catholic_league_wants_mother_theres.php">raised a ruckus about this &quot;slight&quot; in June</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424002729/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/teresa_fans_curse_dark_empire_st_jm0ZMOOohjFwSs1UGcBWwO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">said</a>, &quot;Why not Mother Teresa? If [she] doesn&apos;t make the cut, nobody [does],&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424002729/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/124415/city-celebrates-mother-teresa-s-100th-birthday--group-urges-esb-to--turn-on-the-lights-">referring to the ESB&apos;s claim</a> that religious figures aren&apos;t honored that way, &quot;They&apos;ve done it in the past for religious figures. They did it for the Salesian Sisters last year, they&apos;ve done it for Pope John Paul II, they&apos;ve done it for Cardinal O&apos;Connor. That&apos;s a lie.&quot;</p>

<p>Donohue also said of Malkin, &quot;Is he that stupid that now he&apos;s known as the anti-Mother Teresa elite in New York City?&quot;   Other commenters from those gathered: &quot;This is going to turn out bigger than it would have been if he&apos;d lit the building. Whether he lights the building or not, she (Mother Teresa) won. We&apos;re all here.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424002729/http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/26/hundreds-rally-at-empire-state-building-to-protest-refusal-to-honor-mother-teresa/">CNN</a>); &quot;I woke up this morning, and there was blue and white skies, so it didn&apos;t matter. She had her own lights right up there.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424002729/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jLUcyVMQU3TkY2MU3BaL7M2Gg8pAD9HRM3I80">AP</a>); and &quot;People assume she is synonymous with the greatest human that ever lived. Billions of dollars she raised is unaccounted for -- she took money from many awful regimes in Central America&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424002729/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/124415/city-celebrates-mother-teresa-s-100th-birthday--group-urges-esb-to--turn-on-the-lights-">NY1</a>, from one person who didn&apos;t think the nun should be honored). </p>

<p>The ESB was red, white and blue in honor of the 90th anniversary of the women&apos;s suffragette movement.</p>
