<p>A man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523205731/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/28/woman_sexually_1.php">raped a 19-year-old woman</a> in her apartment building courtyard while wielding a box cutter was sentenced to 25 years to life. Judge The victim, now 24, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523205731/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rapist_gets_years_for_violent_assault_iPff8oCLIst8z86Ycv8wlM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">said in a statement read at the sentencing</a>, &quot;I am still now, 4 years later, picking up the pieces of myself and trying to put them back together.&quot;</p>

<p>On May 8, 2008 around 3:30 a.m., the young woman had been walking home to her apartment on Prince Street in Soho <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523205731/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/29/soho_rapist_ask.php">when she was asked for a cigarette</a>. Her attacker had been following her from the subway; Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said at the time, &quot;She went into her residence; he followed her upstairs. He then accosted her, dragged her downstairs, and sexually assaulted her.&quot; </p>

<p>Andres Suarez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523205731/http://www.manhattanda.org/node/3400/print">wasn&apos;t picked up until 2011</a>, when his DNA was entered into a state database after he was convicted of an unrelated crime. The DNA matched evidence from the unsolved 2008 rape, and Suarez, 30, was tried and convicted last year. </p>

<p>The victim, who testified last November but was not present at the sentencing (she has moved to Europe), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523205731/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/box-cutter-rapist-25-life-article-1.1293282">also said in her statement</a>, &quot;The aftermath of this attack changed my personality so drastically that many of my friends did not know how to talk to me, so they just stopped.&quot; Suarez asked for forgiveness, but Judge Gregory Carro told him, &quot;You followed her from the train to her home and took her to a dank, dark courtyard and raped her. Growing up poor or even having a drug addiction &#x2026;. certainly is not an excuse for this type of predatory conduct.&quot;</p>
