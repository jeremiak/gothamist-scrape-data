<p>President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s first televised interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015128/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-open-to-amending-obamacare-affordable-care-act/">will be on 60 Minutes</a> tomorrow, but the news program has offered a few tidbits. For instance, Hillary Clinton made a &quot;lovely&quot; concession phone call to him. </p>

<p>The call was made early Wednesday morning. Clinton&apos;s top aide Huma Abedin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015128/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-clinton-shared-gracious-exchange-phone-call-article-1.2865899">apparently reached out</a> to the Trump camp when it became clear the billionaire real estate mogul, whose hateful rhetoric and promise of a better economic future galvanized voters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015128/http://dcist.com/2016/11/election_2016_results.php">would secure the electoral votes</a> from Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. </p>

<p>Trump told 60 Minutes&apos; Lesley Stahl, &quot;[I]t was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her. I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. I mean, for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn&apos;t have been nicer. She just said, &apos;Congratulations, Donald, well done.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>He also mentioned speaking to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015128/http://www.newsweek.com/history-donald-trump-bill-clinton-friendship-464360">his former golf buddy</a>, President Bill Clinton, on Thursday night. &quot;He couldn&#x2019;t have been more gracious,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he&apos;s ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s been amazing all right:</p>
