<p>Hey, Governor Cuomo&apos;s plan to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002814/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/04/cuomo_decriminalize_small_amounts_o.php">decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana </a> has found support at City Hall.  Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement today saying, &quot;The Governor&#x2019;s proposal today is consistent with the Commissioner&#x2019;s directive, and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the NYPD will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety - including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s full statement:<br>
</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Last year, Police Commissioner Kelly issued a policy order directing officers to issue violations, rather than misdemeanors, for small amounts of marijuana that come into open view during a search (on.nyc.gov/KY01fN). The Governor&#x2019;s proposal today is consistent with the Commissioner&#x2019;s directive, and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the NYPD will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety - including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana. Thanks to the NYPD, our city has come a long way from the days when marijuana was routinely sold and smoked on our streets without repercussions. By preventing these crimes, and targeting police resources to where they are needed most, we have cut crime by 35 percent over the past decade. Commissioner Kelly will be attending the Governor&#x2019;s press conference later today to show our support for his proposal, and we look forward to working with legislative leaders to help pass a bill before the end of session.&#x201D;</blockquote>It&apos;s been pointed out that pot arrests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002814/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/23/pot_arrests_soar_under_bloomberg_bu.php">have soared under Bloomberg</a>, and the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002814/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/protest_against_marijuana_arrests_b.php"> majority of those arrests</a> (as high as 86%) are blacks or Latinos. Last year, over 50,000 people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002814/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/nypds_low-level_marijuana_possessio.php">were arrested for pot possession</a>.  <p></p>
