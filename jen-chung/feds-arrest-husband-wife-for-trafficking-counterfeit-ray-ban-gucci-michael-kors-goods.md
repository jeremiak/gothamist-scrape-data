<p>A Long Island couple were busted for allegedly importing counterfeit goods and conspiring to sell them in Manhattan and elsewhere for millions, according to U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara&apos;s office. More than 130,000 items, including fake luxury watches and sunglasses, were found in a storage unit.</p>

<p>The investigation started last November, when federal agents noticed that many packages from China were being sent to postal service businesses in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Staten Island and Long Island. A federal agent said in the criminal complaint that &quot;importers of foreign contraband often direct their shipments to postal service businesses so that the importer does not need to provide a personal address or other identifying information for the contraband to enter the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>Authorities soon discovered that Le Fu Chen, who goes by &quot;Tom Chen&quot; and &quot;Danny Chen,&quot; would pick up the packages at the New York postal service businesses. (The Pennsylvania and Michigan locations were allegedly forwarding packages to a postal service center in Flushing, Queens.) While staking out his home in Roslyn Heights, law enforcement found trash including &quot;a sheet of stickers bearing the &apos;Ray-Ban&#x2019; trademark of the size and design suitable to be places on boxes or tags for sunglasses and a sheet of paper showing the designs&quot; and &quot;types of various designer handbag brands, such as &apos;Gucci&apos; and &apos;Louis Vuitton.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>Chen and his wife, Hai Fan Huang, are also accused of having a Garment District office for &quot;Elegance Eyewear,&quot; where nearly 500 pairs of counterfeit sunglasses were found. And at a Long Island storage facility, agents found 130,000 counterfeit items. </p>

<p>Both Chen and Huang were each charged with one count of conspiring to traffic in counterfeit goods, and one count of trafficking in counterfeit goods. They each face a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison. </p>

<p>The feds estimate the loss associated with the items to be in the millions. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&apos;s Homeland Security Investigation Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Glenn Sorge said, &quot;This couple allegedly conspired to profit from the sale of knock offs.  Fake products that infringe on business owners&#x2019; intellectual property rights cost jobs and hurts the U.S. economy. Today&#x2019;s arrests and seizures embody HSI and its law enforcement partners&#x2019; commitment to disrupt the importation and sale of counterfeit goods.&quot;</p>
