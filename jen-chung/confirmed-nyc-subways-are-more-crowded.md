<p>New data supports what everyone&apos;s been thinking: Ridership for the subway--and almost every other mass transit option--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127195407/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/05/13/2008-05-13_with_gas_prices_up_mta_ridership_goes_th-3.html">is up versus last year</a>.  So far, subway ridership is up almost 5% for the first three months of 2008 versus same period last year, and bus ridership is up 1.1%.  </p>

<p>Metro-North and LIRR both have seen ridership increases of more than 5%, and many riders pointing to gas prices as why they are taking mass transit.  A construction worker who lives in Long Island told the Daily News, &quot;Gas prices are ridiculous - that&apos;s why I&apos;m on the train.  It&apos;s faster, less expensive and less wear and tear on my car.&quot;  </p>

<p>Another interesting stat: The number of drivers going across/through MTA and Port Authority bridges and tunnels has declined 1.5-1.9&amp;.  Question: Would congestion pricing have had a fighting chance if it were up for discussion after a long summer of high gas prices?<br>
