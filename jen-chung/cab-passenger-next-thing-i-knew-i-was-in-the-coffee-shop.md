<p>The Post follows up with some more details about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045625/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/05/cab_crashes_into_coffee_shop_in_eas.php">horrible crash in the East Village</a> early Sunday morning that involved a taxi cab hitting an SUV and ending up in The Bean coffee shop at First Avenue and Third Street.  Five people, including a 71-year-old man sitting on the bench outside, were injured.  Here&apos;s how the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045625/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/05/cab_crashes_into_coffee_shop_in_eas.php?gallery0Pic=10#gallery">explains the incident</a>: </p>

<blockquote>The accident occurred as cabby Syed Nazir, 49, was driving up First Avenue with a passenger, Kristin Kunkel, in the back seat.
He collided with a Jeep Cherokee driven by Robert Batista, 19, who was trying to turn onto the avenue from East Third Street.
Nazir swerved, but hit the Jeep anyway, and then jumped a bike lane and curb.
He hit two men riding bicycles, and finally stopped after smashing through The Bean&apos;s front window.</blockquote>

<p>Kunkel, who lost two front teeth, said, &quot;All I remember is that he was swerving.  I put my hands in front of my face, and the next thing I knew, I was in the coffee shop.&quot;  </p>

<p>Apparently 71-year-old Preston Krupin suffered neck and back injuries: He was &quot;serious but stable condition yesterday morning, but hours later, doctors performed a lengthy operation. He was said to be in recovery last night.&quot;  One witness at the scene, Jordyn Thiessen, who helped one of the injured, told the Post that the new bike lane on First Avenue&#x2014;which has a concrete barrier&#x2014;has been causing a few accidents, &quot;The bicyclists are not following the rules. They are going through red lights. They are just speeding along the way.&quot;  </p>

<p>She also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045625/http://evgrieve.com/2010/09/update-on-yesterdays-early-man-crash-on.html">commented on EV Grieve</a> about being at the scene, &quot;There was one man holding that young man&apos;s head the entire time. There were men and women at each injured person, helping and offering solace and comfort. They all showed a great deal of compassion till the medical units arrived. Makes me proud of New Yorkers all over again.&quot;</p>
