<p>Police are looking for three people suspected in three robberies in Manhattan&apos;s 34th Precinct. Their M.O.: A woman pretends to be a neighbor and describes a problem, like a water leak or that she has the tenant&apos;s mail&#x2014;and when the victim opens the door, two armed men go in.</p>

<p>The robberies started in last year. Here&apos;s how the NYPD describes them:</p><blockquote> <br>
Incident# 1 On September 8, 2012 at approximately 2100 hours, the female suspect knocked on the victim&apos;s door, claimed to be their downstairs neighbor and said that there was a water leak.  Once the victim opened the door, the other 2 suspects entered the location and removed property.<br>
 <br>
Incident# 2 On April 12, 2013 at approximately 1800 hours, the female suspect knocked on the victim&apos;s door, claimed to be a neighbor who had her mail.  As the victim opened the apartment door, the 2 male suspects entered while brandishing a firearm and removed property.<br>
