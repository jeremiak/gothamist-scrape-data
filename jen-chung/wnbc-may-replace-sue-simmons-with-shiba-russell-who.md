                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_02_shibarussell.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804211157im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_shibarussell.jpg" width="640" height="428" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The startling news that Sue Simmons will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804211157/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/channel_4_cuts_sue_simmons_loose_af.php">ending her stint as beloved WNBC anchor this summer</a>&#x2014;apparently due to her $5 million salary, as well as her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804211157/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/so_long_sue_simmons_sources_claim_s.php">rumored unwillingness to be cooperative</a>&#x2014;is now moving into the &quot;what&apos;s next&quot; phase, and attention is on noon and 5 p.m. newscast anchor Shiba Russell.  Well, does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804211157/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/02/video_of_the_da_160.php">she do a groundhog impression</a>? </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804211157/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/fave_to_be_the_new_sue_TTtg4sDtjCM2tLNLScwb2L">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Russell, considered Simmons&#x2019; &apos;heir apparent,&apos; has a clause in her contract that mandates a $600,000 payday if she&#x2019;s passed over for the coveted job, sources said.&quot;  She came over from the Boston NBC affiliate last year, and she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804211157/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-02-08/entertainment/28537011_1_anchor-shiba-russell-weekend-anchor-david-ushery">told the Daily News</a> about rumors she would one day succeed Simmons, &quot;It&apos;s a great compliment. Sue is an icon. She is a legend. I&apos;m a huge fan. I have been for years and I&apos;m looking forward to working with her... I&apos;m not here to replace Sue Simmons. I&apos;m here to be me. I can&apos;t predict the future. I do know I&apos;m going to work my tail off, I&apos;m going to tell great stories and if it leads to more opportunities, that would be great.&quot;</p>

<p>But the Post&apos;s sources claim Russell, a 36-year-old single mom raking in $400,000/year, &quot;is supposedly lobbying hard for the job.&quot;  But some &quot;industry insiders&quot; don&apos;t know if she has what it takes, &quot;A year in New York may not have been enough time to develop the kind of recognition to anchor the flagship newscast. Ask 10 people on the street if they&#x2019;ve ever heard of Sue Simmons and you&#x2019;ll probably get 10 people saying yes. Ask 10 people on the street if they&#x2019;ve ever heard of Shiba Russell and they&#x2019;ll probably look at you funny.&quot; </p>

<p>Another WNBC personality who may be in the running is longtime Today in New York anchor Darlene Rodriguez, but one &quot;insider&quot; suggests, &quot;There&#x2019;s the possibility they might just let Chuck [Scarborough] do [the 11 p.m. news] by himself.&quot;</p>
