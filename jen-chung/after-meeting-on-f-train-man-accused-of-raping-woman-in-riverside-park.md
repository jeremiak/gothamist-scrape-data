<p>A woman was raped in a Manhattan park early Saturday morning, and police say she met her attacker on the subway. </p>

<p>The incident was reported just after midnight on August 27th. According to the NYPD, officers responded to a 911 call about an assault in progress inside Riverside Park near West 70th and Riverside Boulevard. The cops found a 24-year-old woman who said she&apos;d been attacked by a man she just met on a southbound F train. The man had told her a friend could give her a ride&#x2014;but they had to meet him in the park. </p>

<p>Once inside the park, the authorities say, &quot;the suspect placed his hands around the victim&apos;s neck, choked her and forced her to the ground, where he then raped her. The victim screamed for help, and the suspect fled from the location.&quot;</p>
