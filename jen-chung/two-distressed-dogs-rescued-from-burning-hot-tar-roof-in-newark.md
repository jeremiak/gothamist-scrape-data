<p>A pit bull and Yorkie are recovering about being rescued from a scorching hot tar roof in Newark, NJ. The Associated Humane Societies says that their Newark branch&apos;s officers found the canines &quot;frantically &apos;dancing&apos; on the roof in an attempt to stop their feet from burning&quot; on Friday afternoon. </p>

<p>The non-profit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094158/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1105487562831579&amp;id=122122364501442">wrote on their Facebook page</a>:</p><blockquote>This was a flat, tar roof and with the temperature being 96 degrees, the tar was bubbling, boiling, and burning these helpless dogs. The yorkie continuously ran to the edge of the roof to try to find an area that would not burn her further while the pit bull, covered in hot tar, had nearly given up hope. No one was at home at the residence and while there were trays of chicken legs and rice on the roof, there was not a drop of water in sight. Feces covered the roof as well so apparently, this is where these poor dogs live.<p></p>

<p>Our officers carefully removed the overheated and distraught pair and brought them directly to an emergency veterinary hospital. The dogs are severely burned and their condition is guarded at this point. They will stay in the hospital until their condition improves and we are very hopeful for their recovery, but are unsure of the extent of their injuries right now. We will be in touch with the veterinarians there and hope to have an update on the pair soon.<br>

The group said it couldn&apos;t find the caretaker, and hasn&apos;t been able to get back in touch with the person claiming to own the dog.&quot;</p>

<p>The group says, &quot;Please speak up when you see an animal suffering. These two dogs are alive today because someone saw them and decided to make a call instead of ignoring the situation and figuring someone else will deal with it. Animals cannot speak for themselves. Please get involved. Call your local police if you see something like this and please, do not ignore it.&quot;</p>
