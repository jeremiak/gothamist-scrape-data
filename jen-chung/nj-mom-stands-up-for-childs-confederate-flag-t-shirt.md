Jane West told the Times of Trenton that a vice principal asked if she could bring a change of clothes for her daughter, &quot;The Indian kids wear their turbans. The Jewish kids wear their yarmulkes. That&#x2019;s their birthright. I told him that Torri was born in Virginia. That flag is her heritage and I&#x2019;m not telling her to take it off. He said &#x2018;I guess she&#x2019;ll have to suffer the consequences.&#x2019;&quot; And consequences are not fun&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205530/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/19/confederate_fla.php">Staten Island boy who wore a Confederate flag shirt</a> because he loves history was allegedly abused by classmates who thought it was racist.<p></p>

<p>West believes that her daughter, Torri Albrecht, was suspended because of her shirt, but School Superintendent Edward Forsthoffer III says, &quot;No student was suspended for wearing an inappropriate shirt. We cannot comment on why the student was suspended, because of student confidentiality policies.&quot;  Forsthoffer did add, &quot;We&#x2019;d rather be proactive than reactive. Ninety-nine times out of 100, when asked, students say &#x2018;OK, I&#x2019;ll change.&#x2019; Some want to make an issue of it for ulterior motives. If there&#x2019;s defiance involved, if there&#x2019;s profanity involved (in the refusal to change clothing), certainly we&#x2019;d have to respond appropriately.&quot; Still, West insists Torri&apos;s suspension is about the shirt, &quot;They&#x2019;re saying that now because they know they really went too far this time. If there wasn&#x2019;t a problem with the sweatshirt, why did the vice principal call at 10 after 8 on Monday to demand that I bring a change of clothes for my daughter?&quot; </p>

<p>The school district does have an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205530/http://www.eastwindsorregionalschools.com/ewrs/Harassment%2C%20Intimidation%20and%20Bullying/Definitions%20of%20Harassment%2C%20Intimidation%20and%20Bullying%20%28HIB%29/">anti-bullying policy that mentions</a>, &quot;Insulting or demeaning any pupil or group of pupils in such as way as to cause substantial disruption in or substantial interference with the orderly operation of the school.&quot;  The flag is considered a racist hate symbol <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205530/http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/racist_confederate_flag.asp">by the Anti-Defamation League</a>, but some view it as a non-racist symbol of the South (still, Confederate Flag license plates were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205530/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/10/us-confederate-plates-texas-idUSTRE7A954D20111110">rejected by a Texas board</a> and Lexington, Virginia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205530/http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/297591">voted against having the flags on public light poles</a>). In another case in 2008, the ACLU said it was okay for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205530/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/27/nword_shirt_a_nogo_for_2nd_grader.php">Long Island child to wear an N-word shirt</a>.</p>

<p>West also informs the Times, &quot;We are so far from prejudiced. My older daughter is biracial. For Torri this was about expressing herself. It was about saying &#x2018;I&#x2019;m from the South and I&#x2019;m proud of it.&#x2019; She didn&#x2019;t do it to cause hurt feelings.&quot;  </p>
