<p>Chanel fashion design Karl Lagerfeld loves little adorable things, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120609001517/http://www.luxist.com/2008/11/18/karl-lagerfelds-bespoke-vuitton-ipod-case/">iPods</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120609001517/http://www.refinery29.com/lose-90-pounds-with-help-from-karl-lagerfeld-s-three-new-coke-bottles">diet Coke bottles.</a> But now he&apos;s finally gone too far by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120609001517/http://fashionista.com/2012/06/karl-lagerfelds-kitten-has-two-maids-a-600-page-diary-and-refuses-to-eat-on-the-floor/">boasting about his ADORABLE kitten, Choupette</a>: &quot;She is like a kept woman. She has a strong personality. She has lunch and dinner with me on the table, with her own food... She sleeps under a pillow and she even knows how to use an iPad. She has two personal maids, for both night and day. She is beyond spoiled.&quot;</p>

<p>In an interview with WWD, Lagerfeld explained that he essentially stole the kitten from a model, &quot;Baptiste [Giaconi] gave her to me for Christmas to watch for two weeks when he was away but then I refused to give her back. I thought she was too cute.&quot;  And while the manorexic designer has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120609001517/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2155324/Karl-Lagerfelds-kitty-crazy-Chanel-designers-cat-eats-table-iPad--TWO-maids-on.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">explained how he doesn&apos;t want kids</a>, he&apos;s kind of become a crazy cat lady:</p><blockquote>We do keep a diary. When I am not there, the maids take down, in little books, everything she did, from what she ate, to how she behaved, if she was tired, and if she wasn&#x2019;t sleeping. In the nine months, we already have almost 600 pages. Colette had written a lot about cats. I am not Colette, but I think it could be funny to make a little book of Choupette&#x2019;s diary.</blockquote>While we may get Choupette&apos;s Diary (let&apos;s lobby for Twitter in the meantime), he refuses to design clothes for animals, &quot;I don&apos;t like animals in human clothes. I think that&apos;s very circuslike.&quot; This is all very sweet, but we&apos;re worried that Lagerfeld will tire of Choupette when she grows into an adult cat! <p></p>
