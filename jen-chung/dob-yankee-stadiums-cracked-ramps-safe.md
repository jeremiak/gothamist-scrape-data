DOB Commissioner Robert LiMandri issued this statement, &quot;Engineers from the Department of Buildings visited Yankee Stadium today and inspected all of the walking ramps with visual cracks. They determined that the cracks do not affect the structural stability of the ramps and do not present any safety concerns. The Yankees have told the Department that the cracks will be repaired at the end of the season.&quot;</p>
