<p>The Port Authority announced that the package was cleared by the bomb squad just after 6 p.m.</p>

<p>A TSA agent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528175042/http://abc7ny.com/news/pressure-cooker-causes-evacuations-at-newark-airport/2044587/">told WABC 7</a>, &quot;I know it was an old-fashioned pressure cooker it seemed like, I know it wasn&apos;t a newer one.&quot; From WABC 7:</p><blockquote>In an exclusive interview, the TSA agent who found the pressure cooker says it was an alert American Airlines worker doing curbside check-ins who first noticed it. The concern law enforcement workers are facing now is whether this all could have been a dry run.<p></p>

<p>&quot;It was literally like a shocker, you know? Why would an individual actually leave that curbside? Maybe it was a test run, you never know,&quot; adds the TSA agent.</p></blockquote>Pressure cookers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528175042/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/boston_marathon_bomb_were_pressure.php">used in the Boston Marathon bombing</a> as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528175042/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/chelsea_bomb_discovery.php">bombing in Chelsea last September</a>.<p></p>
