<p>The NY State Department of Environmental Conservation announced that the baby black bear, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012900/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/06/bear_cub_central_park.php">found dead in Central Park on Monday</a>, was fatally run over by a motorist.</p>

<p>The DEC performed a necropsy and determined the cub was female. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012900/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/10/07/central-park-bear-cub-was-struck-by-vehicle/">The Wall Street Journal reports</a>: &quot;According to the DEC, the cub was about six months old and weighed about 44 pounds. The cause of death was officially determined to be blunt force trauma consistent with a motor vehicle collision.&quot;</p>

<p>The body of the bear, which did not come from the Central Park Zoo, was discovered in the park by a pair of dog owners. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012900/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/nyregion/baby-bear-is-found-dead-in-central-park.html?_r=0">Florence Slatkin said</a>, &quot;The mouth was open and it looked bloody... At first, I thought it was a raccoon.&quot; The bear was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012900/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/nyregion/bear-cub-found-dead-in-central-park-was-hit-by-a-car-investigators-say.html?_r=0">partly covered by an abandoned bike</a>, under a bush near West 69th Street. </p>

An officer told him the bear appeared to have been dragged to the spot where she was found. &apos;They don&#x2019;t at this moment think the bear wandered there on its own,&apos; Mr. Altman said, suggesting nefarious human involvement.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD&apos;s Animal Cruelty Unit is investigating. The DEC said the bear&apos;s death suggests violations like &quot;the illegal possession, transport and disposal of an untagged bear.&quot;</p>
