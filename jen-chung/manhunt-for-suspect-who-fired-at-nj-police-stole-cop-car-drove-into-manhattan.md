<p>Police officers swarmed Riverside Drive and 125th Street earlier today, responding to reports that a man who had been in a shootout with NJ police had fled in an unmarked police car over the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522095949/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2013/08/police_searching_for_suspect_who_fled_in_stolen_police_car_after_shootout_at_fort_lee_motel.html#incart_river_default">Star-Ledger reports</a>, &quot;According to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the incident, the suspect was involved in an altercation with officers at the Skyview Motel on Bergen Boulevard this morning. Gunfire was exchanged, and the man managed to make off with an unmarked 2005 Audi A6 that belonged to Fort Lee police, the source said. He then fled over the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p>The car was found at 125th and Riverside at 10:45 a.m., and police, including K-9 units, have been looking for the suspect in Riverside Park. Also, there&apos;s some thought he may have taken a bus or is in the subway system&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522095949/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-shoots-nj-cops-sets-wild-chase-nyc-article-1.1434974">according to the Daily News</a>, &quot;MTA &apos;Eagle Team&apos; inspectors were sent to the area to assist in the hunt.&quot;</p>
