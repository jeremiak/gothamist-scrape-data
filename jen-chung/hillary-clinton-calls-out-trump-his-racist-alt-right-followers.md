<p>Hillary Clinton shifted attention from the whole Clinton Foundation mess (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/clinton-foundation-explainer/">there are many</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/http://www.npr.org/2016/08/25/491282347/saving-lives-or-selling-access-explaining-the-clinton-foundation">helpful explainers</a>) today with a speech condemning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton">Donald Trump and his merry band of xenophobes</a>. At an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/hillary-clintons-alt-right-speech-annotated/">appearance in Reno</a>, Nevada, Clinton said, &quot;From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p>The former Secretary of State zeroed in Trump&apos;s hiring of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/17/trump_clown_show.php">Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon</a> to run his campaign. An excerpt from her speech:</p><blockquote>To give you a flavor of [Bannon&apos;s] work, here are a few headlines [Breitbart.com has] published. <p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Gabby Giffords: The Gun Control Movement&#x2019;s Human Shield&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That one came shortly after the Charleston massacre, when Democrats and Republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides. Breitbart tried to enflame them further.</p>

<p>Just imagine - Donald Trump reading that and thinking: &#x201C;this is what I need more of in my campaign.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Appealing to centrist Republican voters, Clinton said, &quot;This is not conservatism as we have known it. This is not Republicanism as we have know it. These are race-baiting ideas, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant ideas, anti-woman&#x2014;all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the &#x2018;Alt-Right.&#x2019;... No one should have any illusions about what&#x2019;s really going on here. The names may have changed. Racists now call themselves &apos;racialists.&apos; White supremacists now call themselves &apos;white nationalists.&apos; The paranoid fringe now calls itself &apos;alt-right.&apos; But the hate burns just as bright.&quot;<p></p>

<p>She also slammed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/trumps-perplexing-play-for-black-voters/496991/">Trump&apos;s tone-deaf speech</a> that tried to show his empathy for African-Americans. &quot;Trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters,&quot; Clinton declared.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The seeming sincerity of Hillary&apos;s contempt for Trump is what makes this speech effective.</p>&#x2014; Isaac Chotiner (@IChotiner) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/https://twitter.com/IChotiner/status/768893380520583172">August 25, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>In response, Trump reassured his supporters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021352/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-pre-empts-hillary-clintons-speech-racists/story?id=41624671">that they are not racists</a>, just in case any of them had their worldviews shattered by a Hillary Clinton speech.</p>
