<p>$85 billion may be able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122031/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/17/aig_saved_with_85_billion_federal_l.php">give AIG a second chance</a>, but it&apos;s not enough to ease investors&apos; worries.  Stocks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122031/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/18markets.html?hp">fell sharply</a>, the Dow plummeting 200 points when the market open and then 338 points at one point.</p>

It&apos;s about the worst I&apos;ve seen it in 25 years. You have to have free-flowing credit to lubricate the system. That&apos;s not happening right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Stocks fell in Asia and Europe, and the NY Times suggested that &quot;government report on Wednesday morning that showed construction of new homes and apartments falling more than expected last month, reaching a 17-year low&quot; may have also worried investors.  John O&apos;Brien, of MKM Partners LL in Cleveland, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122031/http://www.cnbc.com/id/26755041">told CNBC</a>, &quot;The fear is who is next. It almost feels like people scour the books and say who is the next likely target that we can put a short on and that spreads continuous fear.&quot; </p>

<p>Dealbreaker says there&apos;s rumor the Fed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122031/http://dealbreaker.com/2008/09/emergency-rate-cut-1.php">may cut the key lending rate</a>: &quot;We are skeptical because any cut the day after the meeting would be admitting that they were, what&apos;s the word, totally fucking wrong yesterday. However, with the shit hitting the fan today, it has to have at least crossed the Beard&apos;s mind once.&quot;</p>
