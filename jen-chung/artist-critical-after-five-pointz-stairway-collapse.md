<p>The jewelry designer who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135530/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/11/woman_injured_in_five_pointz_stairw.php">injured when an external stairway collapsed</a> at the artists&apos; warehouse Five Pointz is in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135530/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/04/12/2009-04-12_landlords_neglect_nearly_killed_artist.html"> According to the Daily News</a>, Nicole Gagne, 37, is in the trauma unit at the hospital after falling three stories and being buried by concrete steps and metal debris.  A friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135530/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/04/11/2009-04-11_designer_critical_as_staircase_collapses.html">said</a>, &quot;She&apos;s used those stairs for years. We didn&apos;t expect she was rolling the dice with her life.&quot;</p>

<p>The Buildings Department told the News, &quot;<strong>The preliminary investigation revealed the collapse was caused by neglect and failure to maintain the building</strong>.&quot; The paper also notes the Buildings Dept. &quot;cited the owner, G&amp;M; Realty, five times last year for illegally converting the factory to artist studios.&quot;</p>

<p>Five Pointz, located in Long Island City, is famous for the legal graffiti on its exterior and is home to many artists&apos; workspaces. Artists were told on Friday night that they wouldn&apos;t be able to re-enter until a protective scaffolding was built, which might happen tomorrow.  </p>
