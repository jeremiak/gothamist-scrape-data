<p>Sources tell the Post that Sabourin, an actress &quot;flew from Montreal to harass Baldwin at his home in the Hamptons on March 31, the sources said. But she managed to elude Long Island authorities and followed Baldwin back to the city, the sources said. A few days later, she allegedly showed up at an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609071106/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/join_alec_baldwin_and_james_toback.php">event at Lincoln Center where Baldwin was</a>.&quot;  </p>

<p>Then Sabourin headed to Baldwin&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609071106/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2011/12/07/alec_baldwin_has_a_beef_with_young_drunken_new_neighbors.php">Greenwich Village apartment</a>&#x2014;but Baldwin was in the Hamptons at the time.  However, a doorman at his Manhattan apartment contacted him, so Baldwin called the police &quot;who busted her on charges of aggravated harassment and stalking.&quot;  Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609071106/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-canadian-actress-genevieve-sabourin-stalked-alec-baldwin-article-1.1058561?localLinksEnabled=false">has said he wants no contact with her</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609071106/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0754883/">Sabourin worked</a> on the Eddie Murphy flop The Adventures of Pluto Nash, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609071106/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180052/fullcredits#cast">which Baldwin had an uncredited role</a>.</p>
