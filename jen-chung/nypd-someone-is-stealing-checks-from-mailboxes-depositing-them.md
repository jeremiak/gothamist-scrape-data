<p>Checks have been disappearing from some Queens residents&apos; mailboxes. Police say that in eight separate incidents, someone (or someones) has stolen a check from a mailbox and then deposited it.</p>

<p>The police say this has been happening in the 112th Precinct, which covers Forest Hills and Rego Park. Apparently the suspect&apos;s M.O. is to take the check, then alter the amount to be larger and then deposit it into an ATM. Then the suspect&#x2014;or suspects&#x2014;withdraws cash.</p>

<p>The police distributed a photograph from a Bank of America ATM at 248 East Fordham Road. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto Crime Stoppers&apos; website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410202959/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">www.nypdcrimestoppers.com</a> or by texting their tips to CRIMES (274637), then enter TIP577.</p>
