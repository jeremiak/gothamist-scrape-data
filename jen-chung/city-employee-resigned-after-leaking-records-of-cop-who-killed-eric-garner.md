<p>The Civilian Complaint Review Board has confirmed that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/eric_garner_pantaleo_history.php">leaked disciplinary records of the police officer</a> who put a Staten Island man in a fatal chokehold were authentic. The records showed that Officer Daniel Pantaleo had seven pending complaints against him before his fatal arrest of Eric Garner in July 2014.</p>

<p>Garner, who was approached by officers who said he was selling loose cigarettes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">was unarmed</a>. His death, caught on video, captured him telling officers repeatedly, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe,&quot; and contributed to national outrage about authorities&apos; aggressive tactics toward African-Americans. </p>

<p>Pantaleo has been on desk duty since Garner&apos;s death. While a grand jury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/eric_garner_grand_jury.php">did not indict him</a>, the federal Department of Justice is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/25/eric_garner_justice_dept.php">investigating the fatal chokehold</a>. In 2015, a judge ruled that the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/23/manhattan_judge_rules_in_favor_of_r.php">must release his records</a>, but the city then changed its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/27/nypd_disciplinary_records_secret.php">approach on disclosing officers&apos; disciplinary history</a>. </p>

<p>After an investigation into the leak, the CCRB says the employee who leaked the documents has resigned. Unnamed sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ccrb-worker-forced-quit-info-leak-killed-garner-article-1.3007427">told the Daily News </a> that the employee was a &quot;junior staff person&quot; who had worked as an investigator at the CCRB for under a year, and was not involved in any of the complaints against Pantaleo.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/nyregion/ccrb-nypd-daniel-pantaleo-eric-garner.html?_r=0">A statement from the board said</a>, &quot;After a swift and thorough internal investigation, the Civilian Complaint Review Board identified the employee who was the source of the leak. As of today, that individual no longer works at CCRB.&quot;</p>

<p>The documents, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/https://thinkprogress.org/daniel-pantaleo-records-75833e6168f3#.6dv9v599j">which were obtained by ThinkProgress</a>, indicate that Pantaleo was accused of misconduct a total of 14 times, and apparently four incidents&#x2014;two vehicle stop and searches and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160901/civic-center/heres-why-nypd-stopped-releasing-discipline-records-what-it-means">two stop-and-frisks</a>&#x2014;were substantiated. </p>

<p>The other complaints were not substantiated by the CCRB, but Legal Aid attorney, Cynthia Conti-Cook,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/eric_garner_pantaleo_history.php"> told us earlier this week</a> that, based on her experience as a civil rights litigator, &quot;unsubstantiated is not exonerated, it&apos;s &apos;inconclusive.&apos; The finding isn&apos;t enough to trigger discipline but it certainly suggests allegations may have merit.&quot;</p>

<p>Police officers&apos; union head Patrick Lynch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ccrb-worker-forced-quit-info-leak-killed-garner-article-1.3007427">referred to the CCRB employee&apos;s resignation</a> as a &quot;positive first step... The release of a police officer&#x2019;s confidential personnel records is still a crime that should be thoroughly investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.&quot;</p>

<p>Conti-Cook, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162925/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/nyregion/ccrb-nypd-daniel-pantaleo-eric-garner.html">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;They&#x2019;re going to fire a C.C.R.B. leaker before they will fire a man who killed an unarmed man on duty as a police officer. It&#x2019;s pretty troubling.&quot;</p>
