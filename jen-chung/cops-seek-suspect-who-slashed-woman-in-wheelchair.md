<p>A quadriplegic woman was slashed in the face in Manhattan on Sunday, and police hope the public can help them find her attacker.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred around 3:19 a.m. on June 5th, when a man approached the 42 year-old woman in front of 167 East 125 Street and slashed her in the face with an unknown object. EMS subsequently responded to the scene and took her to Lincoln Hospital, where she received stitches for the laceration.</p>

<p>She apparently received 50 stitches; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160606134823/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Woman-in-Wheelchair-Slashed-in-Random-Attack-East-Harlem-381938181.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;Police said the victim and her attacker didn&#x2019;t know each other and that they had no altercation prior to the slashing. They said it appears to be a random attack.&quot;</p>

<p>The authorities released surveillance video of the suspect, describing him as 18 to 25 years-old and wearing a black v-neck t-shirt, black basketball shorts with a white stripe down the side, and white basketball sneakers.<br>
