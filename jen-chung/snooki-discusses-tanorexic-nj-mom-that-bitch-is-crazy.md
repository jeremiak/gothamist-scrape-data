<p>As tanorexic NJ mom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520142545/http://gothamist.com/tags/patriciakrentcil">Patricia Krentcil</a> tries to explain that she never <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520142545/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/nj_tanorexic_mom_accused_of_taking.php">took her young daughter into a tanning booth</a>, one mother-to-be and tanning enthusiast is speaking out.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520142545/http://www.extratv.com/2012/05/02/snooki-reacts-to-tanaholic-mom-you-are-not-suppose-to-take-kids-there/">Snooki told Extra</a>, &quot;That b**** is crazy&#x2026;you are not supposed to take kids there. Everyone knows you are NOT supposed to take kids there.&quot;</p>

<p>Krentcil was arrested for child endangerment after a school nurse noticed that 6-year-old Anna had a severe sunburn on her arm.  When asked about the sunburn, Anna apparently said, &quot;I go tanning with Mommy.&quot;  However, Krentcil and her husband say that the fair-skinned child got it while playing outside&#x2014;and, yes, Anna did <em>go</em> to a Nutley, NJ tanning salon with her mother, Anna never went inside a tanning booth. (In NJ, it&apos;s illegal for children under 14 to tanning in a tanning booth.) </p>

<p>The tanning salon&apos;s owner, Anthony, believes that Krentcil visited his salon about 20 times a month, but that her current extremely-baked look (toasty, says the Post) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520142545/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/tanorexic_nj_mom_tans_about_20_days.php">is due to self-tanner</a>.  Anthony also insisted he would never allow a child into a tanning booth.  </p>

<p>Sophie Balk, an attending pediatrician at The Children&#x2019;s Hospital at Montefiore,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520142545/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/tanorexia_phenomenon_slowly_be.html"> told the Star-Ledger</a> that tanning can be an addiction, &quot;Some tanners describe that they feel more relaxed,&quot; when they don&apos;t tan naturally or at a salon, they &quot;can experience unpleasantness, with depression and anxiety setting in, she said.&quot;  She added, &quot;They may know it&#x2019;s bad but they can&#x2019;t cut back.&quot;  And a NJ dermatologist, Jeanine Downie, said that tanning beds can &quot;transmit 12 to 15 times the ultraviolet radiation that the sun does,&quot; plus, &quot;<strong>Every time you tan chronically your are increasing your chances of getting skin cancer about 75 percent</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Krentcil has admitted to tanning to excess but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520142545/http://abcnews.go.com/US/tanning-mom-jersey-woman-suffer-tanorexia/story?id=16267543#.T6K9z8RYuI0">her lawyer said</a>, &quot;Obviously, she tans. To call her an addict, I think is a real leap. It feels like it&apos;s being exaggerated, to be like, &apos;Well look at her, she must have done this.&apos;&quot;  She has also pleaded not guilty to child endangerment.  </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The paparazzi caught up with Krentcil today as she was going to a hair appointment.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520142545/http://www.tmz.com/2012/05/03/tanning-mom-patricia-krentcil-video/">She says that her critics are &quot;jealous, fat, and ugly.&quot;</a> They are probably paler than she is, too.</p>
