<p>Darius McCollum, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/07/1_subway_fan_darius_mccollum_arrest.php">dozens of arrests</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/1_subway_superfan_darius_mccollum_a.php">related to</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/26/transit_superfan_darius_mccollum_ha.php">stealing various forms</a> of mass transit, was nabbed once again yesterday for allegedly stealing a Greyhound Bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. McCollum and the bus were found in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The missing bus, which arrived from Philadelphia at 11 a.m., was discovered missing at about 1:30 p.m., before its 2:15 p.m. departure to Richmond, Virginia. It was then tracked to Brooklyn via GPS. </p>

<p>Police officers were alerted about the missing bus, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://nypost.com/2015/11/11/serial-transit-thief-caught-driving-stolen-greyhound-bus/">the Post reports</a> two cops from the 78th Precinct &quot;saw a bus barreling north on Third Avenue&quot; near Union Street in Brooklyn &quot;and pulled over the empty vehicle, which had plate numbers matching the ones they&#x2019;d been given.&quot;</p>

<p>Sources told the Daily News that when he was arrested, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/serial-mass-transit-thief-arrested-stealing-bus-n-article-1.2431732">McCollum said, &quot;Next time I&#x2019;m taking a plane.&quot;</a></p>

<p>McCollum&apos;s first brush of the law came in 1981 at age 15, when he commandeered an E train from 34th Street to World Trade Center &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323394504578609752550093808?alg=y">without the conductor or passengers reporting anything amiss.</a>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/30/nyregion/judge-clearly-not-amused-sentences-a-subway-impostor.html">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote> Since then, Mr. McCollum has stolen buses numerous times and, in one instance, dressed as a transit employee and managed to get inside the control room at the 57th Street subway station.<p></p>

<p>His exploits have been well-documented, making him something of a cult figure while also exhausting the good will of friends and supporters who tried to help him seek treatment or redirect his enthusiasm into something lawful. He worked for a time in a train museum but gave up that job. Mr. McCollum has spent about a third of his life in jail or in prison.<br>
</p></blockquote>In 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823031700/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/nyregion/15arrest.html">McCollum&apos;s mother told the NY Times</a> that he was autistic (his lawyers say he has Asperger&apos;s) and said she tried to convince him to stay out of trouble by living in North Carolina, but &quot;he just loves New York. He knows the people in Transportation. And he goes up there to be around them.&quot;<p></p>

<p>McCollum recently wrote on Facebook, &quot;By curiosity, I was wondering if there are any people out there who may like trains or are even just train buffs. Its a passion of mine.&quot;</p>
