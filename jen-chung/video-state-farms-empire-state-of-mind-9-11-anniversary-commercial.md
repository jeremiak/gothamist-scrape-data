<p>Admit it: You got a warm and fuzzy feeling while seeing State Farm&apos;s commercial paying tribute to New York City, with 150 children singing &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot; to FDNY firefighters.  State Farm spokesman Roszell Gadson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913164758/http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2011/09/12/state-farm-teams-with-spike-lee-for-sept-11-tribut?t=personal">said</a> that the Spike Lee-directed spot was a &quot;way to honor and show appreciation for the sacrifices made every day by firefighters and emergency responders&quot; and the company wanted to &quot;find a way to honor these brave men and women as we collectively mark the 9/11 anniversary.&quot; State Farm is selling this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913164758/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/empire-state-of-mind-part/id463918387">version of the song on iTunes for 99 cents</a>, with proceeds going to the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.  One person on iTunes commented, &quot;I can&apos;t even lie. I have seen this State Farm commercial like 5 times today and every time it makes me smile and brings me to the verge of tears. I had to find the song and here it is! Great cover!&quot;</p>

<p>State Farm has also posted additional videos: One features Spike Lee explaining what went into the shoot (he calls &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot; NYC&apos;s new anthem), one shares thoughts from the firefighters and another has interviews with the children, who are ages 8-11 and from the NYC area.  </p>
