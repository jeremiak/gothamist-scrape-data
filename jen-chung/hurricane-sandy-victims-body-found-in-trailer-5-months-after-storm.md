<p>This is a haunting story: A 62-year-old who man who lived in the Rockaways <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175523/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/06/24/with-discover-of-queens-man-sandy-death-toll-rises-to-44/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=WSJ_NY_NY_Blog">died from drowning</a> during Hurricane Sandy. But Keith Lancaster&apos;s body wasn&apos;t found until April, when a pair of friends finally visited his trailer.</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that five feet of water surged into his home (based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175523/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-man-found-dead-months-sandy-drowned-home-article-1.1381711?localLinksEnabled=false">watermark in the home</a>) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175523/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/06/24/with-discover-of-queens-man-sandy-death-toll-rises-to-44/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=WSJ_NY_NY_Blog">Wall Street Journal notes</a>, &quot;A calendar on the wall hadn&#x2019;t been turned since before the storm. Prescriptions and medications were scattered about.&quot; No one ever reported him missing, and the ME&apos;s office said, &quot;It&#x2019;s mind-blowing to everybody&quot; that it took so long.</p>

<p>As for the sad discovery, it seems that Lancaster&apos;s neighbor, Doug Rommeney, was suspicious but a little fearful, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175523/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/nyregion/death-of-rockaways-man-is-linked-to-hurricane-sandy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">telling the NY Times,</a> &quot;I didn&#x2019;t want to just open the door and find him in there. I didn&#x2019;t sign up for that.&#x201D; He and his wife also only returned to the Rockaways occasionally after the storm, and at one point, when he expressed his concerns about Lancaster possible being dead to the cops, &quot;The cops were like, &#x2018;If you don&#x2019;t smell nothing, leave it be.&apos;&quot; </p><blockquote>Eventually, the owner of the property looked inside the trailer but did not see anyone, Mr. Rommeney said. The water had shifted all Mr. Lancaster&#x2019;s belongings, leaving a pile of debris several feet high, obstructing the view from the door.<p></p>

<p>April rolled round. Mr. Rommeney ran into a friend who knew Mr. Lancaster. &#x201C;He says, &#x2018;What&#x2019;s up with Les?&#x2019; and I say, &#x2018;Who knows? He could still be in there,&#x2019;&#x201D; Mr. Rommeney said.</p>

<p>The friend insisted they go and check.</p></blockquote>The friend found Lancaster&apos;s body on a bed. Lancaster has been buried in a potter&apos;s field on Hart Island.<p></p>
