<p>A subway dispute turned violent&#x2014;and now police are looking for a male suspect accused of assaulting a woman.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 9:25 p.m. on Tuesday, October 6, a 22-year-old woman and the suspect got into a verbal argument &quot;when the victim boarded a crowded 6 train at the East 59 Street and Lexington Avenue subway station.&quot; From the NYPD:</p><blockquote> The suspect, who was already on board, complained about the victim over-crowding the subway car. At the East 77 Street and Lexington Avenue subway station, the suspect smacked the victim in her face and then tried to snatch her cell phone from her hand after she used it to take pictures of him for police.</blockquote>The suspect fled and the victim complained of &quot;facial pain,&quot; but police say she refused medical attention at the scene.<br>
  <br>
Police released photos that the victim took of the suspect, describing him as being 6&apos; tall and 170 lbs, with brown eyes and black hair. He was last seen wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, red jeans, black sneakers, and was carrying a black backpack. <br>
