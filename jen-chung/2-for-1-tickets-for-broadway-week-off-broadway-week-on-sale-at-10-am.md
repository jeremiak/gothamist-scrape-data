<p>NYC &amp; Company CEO George Feritta said, &quot;Manhattan&#x2019;s intimate Off-Broadway theaters are offering significant value this fall with two-for-one tickets for more than 25 shows,&quot; and, &quot;With two-for-one tickets to some of the City&#x2019;s most popular shows there is no better time to experience New York City theater and take advantage of the robust Broadway savings.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091800/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/close-out-the-summer-with-2-for-1-broadway-tickets/">Arts Beat points out</a>, &quot;The offer was generated to boost sales during the period after heavy tourist season ends but before the new season ramps up, when Broadway has been known to hit a slump,&quot; and many shows need a little extra help, after Irene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091800/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/08/hurricane-irene-batters-broadway-box-office-receipts.html">caused a big dent to their box offices</a>.</p>
