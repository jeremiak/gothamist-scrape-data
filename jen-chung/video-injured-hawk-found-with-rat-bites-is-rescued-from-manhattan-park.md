<p>An injured hawk with rat bites on its feet was rescued from a park near Lincoln Center. A Manhattan resident and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108175914/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/01/hawk_rescue_queens_video.php" "="">bird of prey lover</a> who goes by the name Yojimbot shared video of the rescue with us. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108175914/https://yojimbot.blogspot.com/2017/01/thelonius-hawk.html">He explained on his blog</a> that this is the time that the &quot;first year birds get into trouble&quot;:</p><blockquote>Whether its starvation, parasites or secondary poisoning, hawk rehabbers are admitting about 1 hawk a day from around the 5 boros. This guy was trapped in Thelonius Monk Circle on West End and 63rd St. It has an injury to its right wing and could barely fly--possibly from chasing prey--and rat bites on its feet. <p></p>

<p>The Park there is heavily infested with rats and many hawks die due to secondary poisoning--in other words ingesting a poisoned rat. Rather than controlling rats by restricting their food sources or using other methods such as live traps and CO2, the City has gone all in with poison, thus condemning many birds of prey to agonizing deaths. If you see a sick or injured hawk, please contact the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108175914/http://www.nycaudubon.org/">Audubon Society</a> who will dispatch a wildlife rescue volunteer.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108175914/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/12/rat_poison_to_blame_in_raptor_raptu.php">other incidents</a> of hawks dying from eating rat poison; the Parks Department has, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108175914/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/adored-manhattan-hawk-dies-eating-rat-poison-article-1.2601428">in some cases</a>, suspended rodenticide use during nesting season.

<p>Yojimbot adds, &quot;The animal was brought to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108175914/http://www.amcny.org/">Animal Medical Center</a> on 62nd and York for evaluation and will be rehabbed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108175914/https://www.facebook.com/WINORR-Wildlife-In-Need-of-Rescue-and-Rehabilitation-113685721999067/">WINORR</a>.
