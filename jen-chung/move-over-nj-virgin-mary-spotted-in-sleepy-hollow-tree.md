<p>West New York, NJ may have had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070130/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/13/do_you_see_the_virgin_mary_in_this.php">&quot;Virgin Mary&quot; in a tree for weeks</a>, but now there&apos;s a new Virgin in town&#x2014;and she&apos;s in New York!</p>

<p>On Sunday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070130/http://pleasantville.patch.com/articles/virgin-mary-seen-on-sleepy-hollow-tree">according to Patch</a>, &quot;a Sleepy Hollow resident suddenly noticed a pattern resembling in the Virgin Mary in about a three-inch indent in the tree bark of a young tree above eye level. The supposed Virgin is best viewed by early morning light, as one man shared his photo of the tree bark compared to a picture of the Virgin on a seven-day candle, and the resemblance is more apparent. &quot;</p>

<p>An Ossining resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070130/http://ossining.dailyvoice.com/news/virgin-mary-image-draws-crowds-sleepy-hollow">told the Daily Voice</a>, &quot;I came over to see it, and it&apos;s actually pretty interesting... At first when I saw it, I actually didn&apos;t see it. I didn&apos;t see the resemblance that much,&quot; but then as she got closer, &quot;I could kind of see the resemblance.&quot;</p>

<p>As with the West New York tree, there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070130/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/njs_virgin_mary_tree_draws_believes.php">shrine set up at the tree&apos;s trunk</a> (accusations of witchcraft to come).  Anyway, we&apos;re waiting for a third sighting, to make this the trend of the summer! </p>
