The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206163450/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/29/meow_cops_seek_cat_mask-wearing_rob.php">police sketch actually featured the mask</a>, complete with whiskers, on the suspect&#x2014;luckily this didn&apos;t happen during Halloween, or the police tipline would be <em>littered</em> with sightings.  </p>

<p>In the video, you can see the woman enter the store wearing the mask, which is odd, but maybe not the weirdest thing (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206163450/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/22/the_brave_person_who_dares_leash_a.php">cats on leashes, on the other hand</a>...).  She looks around the store then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206163450/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/catwoman_burglar_caught_on_tape_a3eRnoriXU6zZtf7ph7ivO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">gives the clerk a note reading</a>, &quot;Give me your money. I have a gun.&quot;  She ultimately lands an $86 bounty.

<p>According to the Post, a woman to believed to be the same suspect has hit two stores in Queens. Last week, &quot;with her head wrapped in a back scarf and only here amber eyes exposed,&quot; she headed to the Austin Street Body Shop, &quot;just five blocks from the 112th Precinct stationhouse in Forest Hills and slipped the same threatening note a cashier. She walked away with $500.&quot; Last year, she robbed a 9 West shore store, also on Austin Street, while wearing a black scarf; she got $500 then, too.  </p>
