</div></div><p>President Obama ended his trip to the city by visiting the World Trade Center site, where he laid a wreath and met with first responders and 9/11 victims&apos; families.  Ten-year-old Christopher Cannizzaro, who was just 10 months old when his father, firefighter Brian Cannizzaro, was killed, &quot;gave the president a fist-bump and handed him a prayer card with a picture of his father,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053046/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/live-blog-obama-visits-new-york/#more-305073">reports CityRoom</a>. The boy said of the meeting, &quot;It means like the world to me. He&apos;s a very nice person.&quot;</p>

<p>Christopher added, &quot;He was asking me about my dad. He asked about my necklace. He was just being so nice to me. He was being open with me. I was just truly honored to be here.&quot;  But he had more complicated feelings about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053046/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/president_obama_about_to_make_annou.php">Osama bin Laden&apos;s death</a>, &quot;I was sort of happy, but they could have did something a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053046/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/03/white_house_clarifies_killing_osama.php">little less harsh</a>. It meant a lot to know that what happened to my dad happened to him.&quot;</p>

<p>Numerous elected officials accompanied Obama to Ground Zero&#x2014;NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, NYC Mayor Bloomberg, NJ Governor Chris Christie, Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Robert Menendez, Senator Frank Lautenberg&#x2014;but there were no public remarks.  It has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053046/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/11/mccain_and_obama_appear_together_fo.php">three years since Obama</a> has been at the site, and since then, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053046/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/the_wtc_phoenix_01zEe5DmKzOAYOWOwAXW3J?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">been a lot of progress</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053046/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/obama_arrives_mark_laden_york_death_Wk8jJU2gsVLrwhodXjPIFI">Port Authority Director Chris Ward said</a>, &quot;It&apos;s a day of incredible pride. His leadership in killing Osama bin Laden brings a real sense of relief. The progress here is symbolic of that effort.&quot;</p>
