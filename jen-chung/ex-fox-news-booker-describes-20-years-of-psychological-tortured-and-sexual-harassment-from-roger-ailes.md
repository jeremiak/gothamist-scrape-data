<p>New York magazine explains, &quot;This is the account of a woman who chose to go along with what Roger Ailes wanted &#x2014; because he was powerful, because she thought he could help her advance her career, because she was professionally adrift and emotionally unmoored.&quot;</p>

<p>Luhn, who was a talent booker for Fox News&apos; Washington D.C. bureau, spoke to New York&apos;s Gabriel Sherman, &quot;in 11 hours of interviews at her Los Angeles home, in the presence of a family friend who first heard her accounts in 2010, long before there was any public discussion of Ailes&#x2019;s alleged harassment of women.&quot; Ailes, who founded Fox News in 1996, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020917/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/roger_ailes_officially_forced_out_o.php">was forced out of his position</a> as CEO and chairman last week after allegations of sexual harassment that escalated after former Fox News star Gretchen Carlson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020917/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/06/gretchen_carlson_roger_ailes.php">sued him for sexual harassment</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020917/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/fmr-fox-booker-harassed-by-ailes-for-20-years.html?mid=full-rss-di">Sherman notes</a>, &quot;In recent years, Luhn had a series of mental breakdowns that she attributes to the stress of her situation, and was even hospitalized for a time... Luhn&#x2019;s struggle with mental illness notwithstanding, New York was able to independently corroborate key details in her account, including that she was sexually involved with Ailes for many years, from sources who worked at Fox at the same time she did. Additionally, I viewed documents Luhn retained, including a copy of the $3.15 million severance agreement she signed in 2011 that includes iron-clad nondisclosure provisions.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s one of the descriptions of how Ailes treated Luhn in the early days of their &quot;relationship&quot; when she was just on &quot;retainer&quot; for him as his communications consultant; other accusers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020917/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/six-more-women-allege-ailes-sexual-harassment.html">described how Ailes likes garter belts</a>:</p><blockquote>Luhn put on the black garter and stockings she said Ailes had instructed her to buy; he called it her uniform. Ailes sat on a couch. &#x201C;Go over there. Dance for me,&#x201D; she recalled him saying. She hesitated. &#x201C;Laurie, if you&apos;re gonna be my girl, my eyes and ears, if you are going to be someone I can depend on in Washington, my spy, come on, dance for me,&#x201D; he said, according to her account. When she started dancing, Ailes got out a video camera. Luhn didn&#x2019;t want to be filmed, she said, but Ailes was insistent: &#x201C;I am gonna need you to do better than that.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>When she had finished dancing, Ailes told her to get down on her knees in front of him, she said, and put his hands on her temples. As she recalled, he began speaking to her slowly and authoritatively, as if he were some kind of Svengali: &#x201C;Tell me you will do what I tell you to do, when I tell you to do it. At any time, at any place when I call. No matter where I call you, no matter where you are. Do you understand? You will follow orders. If I tell you to put on your uniform, what are you gonna do, Laurie? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, LAURIE?&#x201D; Then, she recalled, his voice dropped to a whisper: &#x201C;What are you, Laurie? Are you Roger&apos;s whore? Are you Roger&apos;s spy? Come over here.&#x201D; Ailes asked her to perform oral sex, she said.</p>

<p>Later, Ailes showed her the footage of her dancing. She asked him what he intended to do with it and, she says, he replied, &#x201C;I am going to put it in a safe-deposit box just so we understand each other.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Years later, she ended up working at Fox News, and many staffers knew was protected by Ailes and earning up to $250,000 a year. But, Sherman reports, &quot;the arrangement required her to do many things she is now horrified by, including luring young female Fox employees into one-on-one situations with Ailes that Luhn knew could result in harassment.&quot;</p><blockquote>You&#x2019;re going to find me &#x2018;Roger&#x2019;s Angels.&#x2019; You&#x2019;re going to find me whores,&#x201D; Luhn recalled Ailes saying on numerous occasions, urging her to send young Fox staffers his way. He had promoted Luhn to director of bookings, which gave her the authority to hire employees. She said she chose women Ailes would be attracted to. &#x201C;You&apos;re not expected to hire unattractive people,&#x201D; she said.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020917/http://www.people.com/article/laurie-luhn-roger-ailes-fox-news-sexual-harassment">Ailes&apos; spokeperson Susan Estrich said</a>, &quot;Roger denied these allegations in 2011 and he denies them now. He wishes Ms. Luhn well. Based on her statements, it is disturbing that she is the subject of one reporter&#x2019;s journalistic exploitation.&quot;<p></p>
