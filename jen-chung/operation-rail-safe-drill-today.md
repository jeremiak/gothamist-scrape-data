<p>Expect to see more various law enforcement authorities during your commute, if you travel through the big transit hubs, because there&apos;s an Operation Railsafe surge today.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153153/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7713359">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;The greatest concentration will be at major rail hubs like Penn Station and Grand Central terminal. NYPD officers will also ride the rails with bomb sniffing dogs, and bag checkpoints are possible. Meanwhile, Amtrak will have increased uniformed police visible along major routes and heightened station patrols.&quot;</p>

<p>Officials say the surge has been in the works for a while (it&apos;s allegedly not due to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153153/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/03/state_dept_issues_terror_warning_to.php">Al Qaeda concerns in Europe)</a>, and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;Forty percent of the attack in the last 20 years have been against transit facilities.&quot;</p>
