Expect delays on #4 #5&quot;</p>

<p>Police are currently still investigating the incident, which means the 6 is running express in both directions between the 42nd Street-Grand Central Station and the 125th Street Station.  Select 6 trains are running local from the 86th Street Station to the 125th Street Station in both directions.</p>

<p>When one NYCTSubwayScoop follower Tweeted that the death was sad, NYCTSubwayScoop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005412/https://twitter.com/#!/NYCTSubwayScoop/status/166640605462675456">replied,</a> &quot; Incredibly. Not just for victim and family but for Train Operator &amp; Conductor who do initial on scene investigation of accident.&quot; </p>
