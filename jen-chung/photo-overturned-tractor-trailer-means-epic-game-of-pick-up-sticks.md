<p>Earlier this morning, a tractor-trailer overturned on Route 80 in the Teaneck/Ridgefield Park area in NJ. And it happened to be carrying lumber. A lot of lumber.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030835/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9028749">WABC reports</a>, &quot;The driver of the big rig lost control just before 6 a.m., dumping hundreds of pieces of lumber all over the off-ramp to the New Jersey Turnpike.&quot; The huge pieces of lumber fell into the eastbound lanes, forcing the highway to be closed. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030835/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/21649516/truck-overturns-dumping-lumber-on-route-80">MyFoxNY reports</a>, &quot;All traffic is forced to go north on I-95.  Drivers should avoid the area.&quot; It&apos;s apparently going to take <em>hours</em> to clean it up. </p>
