</div></div><p>Newark Mayor Cory Booker is known for his hands-on approach to government, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/28/take_that_bloomberg_newark_mayor_di.php">shoveling people out of blizzards</a> to pushing away his security so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/newark_mayor_cory_booker_rescues_wo.php">he can save people from burning buildings</a>.  So it makes sense that NJ Governor Chris Christie is jealous!</p>

<p>In a hilarious video for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://www.njpa.org/njpa/events/">NJ Press Association Dinner</a> (basically the Garden State version of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://dcist.com/2012/04/videos_obama_jokes_about_eating_dog.php">White House Correspondents Dinner</a>), Christie&apos;s staff is seen trying to figure out ways to make the governor seem more exciting, but Christie hates the &quot;town halls four times a week&quot; nearly as much as he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/chris_christie_exaggerated_the_cost.php">hates public infrastructure</a>, so he looks for ways to generate his own buzz.  But that meddling Booker seems to be in the way every single time there&apos;s a fire, flat tire, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/11/dream_baby_dream_chris_christie_fel.php">a beloved Boss</a> in need of an axe. Check out the video here&#x2014;don&apos;t worry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/christie_wont_rule_out_running_for.php">there&apos;s a Romney reference or two</a>:</p>

<p>Christie&apos;s disdain makes him spit out &quot;Booker!&quot; in a very Jerry Seinfeld-esque fashion (&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9_8YxDQYCo">Newman!</a>&quot;).  Now, to really make things exciting, Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063134/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/chris_christie_wonders_if_nypd_is_a.php">should take on the NYPD</a>.</p>
