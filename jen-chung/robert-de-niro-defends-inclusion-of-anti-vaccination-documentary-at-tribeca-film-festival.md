<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/http://www.salon.com/2016/03/23/anti_vaxxers_tribeca_triumph_discredited_doctors_documentary_about_the_long_debated_link_between_autism_and_vaccines_doesnt_belong_in_respected_festival/">furor building over</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2016/03/22/wtf-andrew-wakefields-antivaccine-documentary-to-be-screened-at-the-tribeca-film-festival/">a discredited doctor&apos;s anti-vaccination</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-anti-vaccine-andrew-wakefield-movie-tribeca-20160322-story.html">documentary being shown</a> at the Tribeca Film Festival, festival co-founder Robert De Niro is speaking out. </p>

<p>In a statement posted on Facebook, the Oscar-winning actor (not doctor) said, &quot;[My wife] Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.&quot;</p>

<p>The film, <em>Vaxxed</em>, is by Andrew Wakefield, a doctor whose study that claimed to link the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella to autism <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield#MMR_controversy">was found to be &quot;fatally flawed.&quot;</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/20/andrew-wakefield-father-anti-vaccine-movement-sticks-his-story-305836.html">Wakefield&apos;s license was taken away</a> and he&apos;s not allowed to practice in the United Kingdom or United States. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/tribeca-film-festival-anti-vaxx.html">spokesperson for the film festival told The Cut</a>, &quot;Tribeca, as most film festivals, are about dialogue and discussion. Over the years we have presented many films from opposing sides of an issue. We are a forum, not a judge.&quot; </p>

<p>However, a press release from the Tribeca Film Festival about a post-screening talk with the filmmakers and subjects takes a definitive stance: &quot;The most vitriolic debate in medical history takes a dramatic turn when senior scientist turned whistleblower, Dr. William Thompson of the Centers for Disease Control, turns over secret documents, data, and internal emails confirming what millions of devastated parents and &#x201C;discredited&#x201D; doctors have long-suspected - vaccines do cause autism.&quot; (The current description on the festival&apos;s website is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/vaxxed-from-coverup-to-catastrophe-2016">little more measured</a>.)</p>

<p>Tribeca Film Institute grantee Penny Lane, whose documentary <em>NUTS!</em> about a goat testicle salesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/nuts-review-animated-documentary-john-romulus-brinkley-goat-testicles">was well-received</a>, posted an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/https://filmmakermagazine.com/97862-an-open-letter-to-the-tribeca-film-festival-about-vaxxed/">open letter to the festival on Filmmaker Magazine</a>:</p><blockquote>Here is the problem with your statement: it assumes that Vaxxed is just like any other film taking on an unpopular, controversial or provocative subject. It is not. There is a big difference between advocacy and fraud, between point of view and deception. For you to claim there is no difference helps to perpetuate Wakefield&#x2019;s fraud.<p></p>

<p>Also, it is disingenuous for you to claim you are not a &#x201C;judge.&#x201D; You are literally judging when you choose a film, from thousands of submissions, to screen under your banner.</p>

<p>A lot of people, including those who buy tickets to see docs at your festival, believe documentary film has become a new and important form of news. But journalists are expected to tell the truth &#x2014; or at least not knowingly spread dangerous lies. Your choice to include Vaxxed in your documentary lineup &#x2014; a lineup including films about abortion, Syrian refugees, solitary confinement, the American electoral system, in-vitro fertilization and drone warfare &#x2014; suggests that you think documentary filmmakers can&#x2019;t be held even to the latter standard. This threatens the credibility of not just the other filmmakers in your doc slate, but the field in general.</p>

<p>So yes, I take this personally.</p>

<p>While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies.</p></blockquote>She adds, &quot;I know that some people will say I&#x2019;m advocating censorship when I say this. I appreciate that concern. The last thing I would want is for festivals to stop being bold, independent tastemakers afraid of controversy. And I would never suggest banning the film is some global sense (as if that were even possible!). But the problem is not that Vaxxed is controversial, or even that it&#x2019;s deceptive. Honestly, I consider a large number of well-made, popular documentary films fairly deceptive. The problem is that it is dangerous misinformation being legitimized under the banner of your considerable prestige.&quot;<p></p>

<p>During a Republican presidential debate, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi-Y_N6qDPs">Donald Trump asserted there&apos;s a link</a> between the MMR vaccines and autism, which forced the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904060333/https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Reiterates-Safety-and-Importance-of-Vaccines.aspx">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> to issue a statement to &quot;correct false statements made during the Republican presidential debate last night regarding vaccin&#x200B;es.&quot;</p><blockquote>Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature. It is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise. There is no &#x2018;alternative&#x2019; immunization schedule. Delaying vaccines only leaves a chil&#x200B;d at risk of disease for a longer period of time; it does not make vaccinating safer. Vaccines work, plain and simple. Vaccines are one of the safest, most effective and most important medical innovations of our time. Pediatricians partner with parents to provide what is best for their child, and what is best is for children to be fully vaccinated.</blockquote><em>Vaxxed</em> is screening at the Tribeca Film Festival on  Sunday, April 24.<p></p>
