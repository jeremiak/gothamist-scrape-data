And now it&apos;s been announced that the temporary pavilion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://dcist.com/2012/03/the_bloomberg_balloon_hirshhorn_mus.php">will be called the Bloomberg Bubble</a>, after a major benefactor.  </p>

<p>Okay, <em>technically</em> the bubble is named after Bloomberg LP, which, in 2010, donated $1 million to the project, but let&apos;s face it&#x2014;Mayor Bloomberg founded Bloomberg LP, which is the source of his great wealth.  And it seems that the donation has, uh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/visual-arts/2012/03/23/official-name-for-the-hirshhorn-bubble-the-bloomberg-balloon/">ballooned in size from the $1 million</a>, but there hasn&apos;t been confirmation by how much.  </p>

<p>The building was designed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bunshaft">Gordon Bunshaft</a>, who designed the gorgeous Lever House in NYC, and is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1168&amp;bih=667&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=QhGmmmr_H4qQ_M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://farraguter.com/2012/03/01/hirshhorn-to-open-spring-liquid-architecture-exhibit/&amp;docid=WufT9AuG78ZsUM&amp;imgurl=http://farraguter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Hirshhorn.jpg&amp;w=666&amp;h=455&amp;ei=hfpsT6zCE4Tm0QGpy8m2Bg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=872&amp;vpy=316&amp;dur=1051&amp;hovh=185&amp;hovw=272&amp;tx=192&amp;ty=107&amp;sig=105074041035555345408&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=145&amp;tbnw=186&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=15&amp;ved=1t:429,r:9,s:0">circular, fortress-like museum</a>. As for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://dcist.com/2012/03/the_bloomberg_balloon_hirshhorn_mus.php">Bloomberg Pavilion</a>, DCist explains, &quot;Washingtonians started calling the project the &apos;Bubble&apos; not long after it was first announced in late 2009. The Hirshhorn originally hoped to &apos;inflate&apos; the structure, designed by the architectural firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, later this year, but funding snags pushed the opening into 2013.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://www.dsrny.com/">Diller Scofidio + Renfro</a> is known to NYers for its work on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/10/high_line_park_in_photos_night_move.php#photo-1">High Line</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161527/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/20/alice_tully_hall_renovations_raptur.php#photo-1">Lincoln Center update</a>.</p>
