<p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offered up the list of the 15 movies that can be nominated for Best Documentary, and, true to form, there are some great inclusions and some questionable absences.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/18/us-documentaries-idUSTRE7AH2PS20111118">As Reuters put it</a>, &quot;As for what first-round Academy voters did like, the list included a surprising number of lighter docs and portrait films, as opposed to the serious, issue-oriented films that usually dominate the category.&quot;</p>

<p>For instance, the Academy did include <em>Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory</em>, the third film following the wrongful convictions of three teens accused of murder and sentenced to death (Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky&apos;s films are considered important to helping the case get more attention and the teens&#x2014;now men&#x2014;out of prison), but didn&apos;t include Werner Herzog&apos;s meditation on the death penalty, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/into-the-abyss">Into the Abyss</a></em>.  <em>Bill Cunningham New York</em>, the charming documentary about the NY Times&apos; 80-something style photograph Bill Cunningham was included, but, <em>Page One</em>, the documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/ny_times_david_carr_never_been_bett.php">about the Times&apos; media reporters</a> was snubbed.  </p>

<p><em>Jane&apos;s Journey</em>, a documentary about beloved primatologist Jane Goodall, could be up for Best Doc honors, but even positive reviews have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/janes_journey_2010/reviews/?type=top_critics">noted it lacks &quot;intellectual substance,&quot;</a> where as nearly <a href="Violence Interrupters">unanimously critically-praised</a> <em>The Interrupters</em>, about &quot;violence interrupters&quot; in Chicago trying to take back their communities, was left out of contention. Then again, maybe that makes sense, since of the the directors of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://interrupters.kartemquin.com/">The Interrupters</a></em> is Steve James, part of the trio behind <em>Hoop Dreams</em>, the groundbreaking documentary about high school basketball players, poverty, and the American Dream, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1995/03/26/why-did-oscar-drop-the-ball-on-hoop-dreams.html">also snubbed to much uproar by the Academy</a>.  </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the Oscars shortlist for Best Documentary&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscar-documentary-paradise-lost-project-nim-263684">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>, &quot;Now branch members will pare the 15 films down to five nominees, who will be announced Jan. 24 at the Academy&apos;s Samuel Goldwyn Theater&quot;; after that, the whole Academy can vote on the Best Documentary:&quot;</p><blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081738/http://battleforbrooklyn.com/">Battle for Brooklyn</a> (RUMER Inc.)<br>
