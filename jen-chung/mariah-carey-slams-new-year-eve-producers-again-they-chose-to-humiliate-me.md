<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013136/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/30/mariah_careys.php">Subway rider</a> and pop super star Mariah Carey is speaking out once again about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013136/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/01/mariah_carey_nye.php">horrendous New Year&apos;s Eve performance she gave</a> on national TV. In an audio recording she released on Twitter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013136/https://twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/818112397156171777">the diva said</a>, &quot;I came to New Year&apos;s Eve in New York in great spirits and was looking forward to a celebratory moment with the world. It&apos;s a shame that we were put into the hands with a production team with technical issues who chose to capitalize on circumstances beyond our control.&quot;</p>

<p>Carey was the headlining act for <em>Dick Clark&apos;s Rockin&apos; New Year&apos;s Eve</em> on ABC, but apparently her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013136/http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/01/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-performance-sabotage-emotion/">ear pieces weren&apos;t working</a>. Backing vocals and music played as Carey tried singing, but repeatedly gave up and ad-libbed. Her dancers, though, were able to hit their marks.</p>

<p>Her management team accused producers of sabotaging her, but Dick Clark Production called those claims &quot;defamatory.&quot; Still, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013136/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/mariah_carey_mortified.php">Carey described her mortification</a> while her manager portrayed the producers as willing &quot;to do anything for a viral moment.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, Carey told her fans, &quot;It&apos;s not practical for a singer to sing live and be able to hear themselves properly in the middle of Times Square with all the noise, the freezing cold, the smoke from the smoke machines, the thousands of people celebrating. Especially when their ear monitors were not working at all. Listen guys, they spoiled me thus it turned into an opportunity to humiliate me.&quot;</p>

<p>Promising to go into &quot;greater detail&quot; later, Carey said she was taking a break from social media, to take the time to be &quot;with my loved ones.&quot; She emphasized how grateful she was for friends and fans for their support, &quot;Thank you to my lambs.&quot;</p>
