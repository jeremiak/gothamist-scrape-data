Given the state&apos;s budget troubles, Governor Jon Corzine has been trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312034234/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/02/06/turnpike_toll_plan_a_tough_sell/">increase the fare to more than $3</a> in 2014 and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312034234/http://blog.nj.com/jerseyblogs/2008/01/if_you_didnt_see_it.html">$5.80 in a decade</a>--to much public outcry--but this plan would see a $3 toll in 2023. Right now, the toll is $1.20 (average), and under the proposed plan, it would be $1.80 in 2011 and $2.70 in 2012).  The NJTA&apos;s board said, &quot;We believe increasing tolls, even minimally, is an action of last resort, not one of first choice,&quot; but there are many infrastructure projects, like maintaining the roads and bridges, that need funding.</p>
