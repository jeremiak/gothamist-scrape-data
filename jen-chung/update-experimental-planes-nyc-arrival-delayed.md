</div></div>					<p>Night owls, don&apos;t worry if you happen to see a funky looking plane fly over the city around 2 a.m.&#x2014;it&apos;s just the solar-powered Solar Impulse 2 making a photo op tour before landing at JFK Airport. <br>Update, June 7: The plane&apos;s arrival has been delayed due to weather. See more below.</p>

<p>According to Notify NYC, the &quot;plane is scheduled to conduct a flyover across various parts of NYC tomorrow morning,&quot; June 7th, from 2 to 3 a.m. &quot;The aircraft will enter NYC near the Verrazano Bridge and travel northbound to the Statue of Liberty before turning east to travel over JFK Airport. A helicopter will accompany the aircraft to take photos of the operation.&quot;</p>

<p>Solar Impulse 2 is expected to land at JFK around 4 a.m. The plane has been circumnavigating the world, making its way east (it flew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032636/http://sfist.com/2016/04/24/solar_powered_plane_completes_trip.php">to San Francisco in April</a>). Some fun facts from the press materials:</p><ul><li>Si2 is a concentration of clean technologies&#x2014;a genuine flying laboratory. <br>
</li><li>It is a single-seater aircraft made of carbon fiber that has a 72m / 236ft wingspan. That&apos;s larger than a Boeing 747.<br>
</li><li>It weighs around 5100 lbs, which is equivalent to an empty family car.  <br>
</li><li>The 17,248 solar cells built into the wing power the four batteries, which in turn power the four electric engines and the propellers with renewable energy. <br>
</li><li>The plane is capable of saving a maximum amount of energy during the day and flying throughout the night on batteries. <br>
</li><li>Si2 requires zero fuel... <em>it could fly forever</em> and is only limited by the pilot&#x2019;s sustainability.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye said, &quot;We are delighted to welcome Solar Impulse 2 back to JFK Airport. The clean technology exemplified by Si2 demonstrates clearly that renewable energy sources are reliable and capable of helping reduce fossil fuels in air travel. This innovative aircraft is proving that continuous flight without fossil fuel is possible. Our agency applauds the work of Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg and the Si2 team.&quot;</p>

<p>After NYC, Solar Impulse 2 will head to Abu Dhabi. Your best shot of spotting it in NYC is if you&apos;re in Lower Manhattan or Brooklyn Heights:</p>

<p><b>Update, June 7</b>: A spokeswoman said, &quot;Unfortunately the flight from Lehigh Valley to New York is postponed due to worsening weather conditions. Although we knew that showers were on their way, they came faster and more intensely than what the forecast showed.&quot; She added, &quot;The Solar Impulse team is continuing to study the weather.&quot;</p>
