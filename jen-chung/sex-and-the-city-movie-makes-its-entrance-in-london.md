<p>The long-awaited, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145255/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/05/sex_gets_prerel.php">much-hyped</a> Sex and the City Movie premiered in London and the film&apos;s stars strutted their stuff on the red carpet.  In particular, Sarah Jessica Parker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145255/http://offtherack.people.com/2008/05/12/would-carrie-approve-sarah-jessica-parkers-over-the-top-london-premiere-look/">wore not only a Alexander McQueen dress and Fred Leighton jewels</a> but a whimsical chapeau as well.  Created by go-to-milliner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145255/http://www.philiptreacy.co.uk/">Philip Treacy</a>, the hat is like a garden scene--butterfly, flowers, and maybe a mound of moss attached to Parker&apos;s head (it&apos;s all very fashion forward)</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145255/http://www.premiere.com/features/4578/sarah-jessica-parker-on-sex-and-the-city.html">Premiere.com has an interview with SJP</a>--here&apos;s one question:</p><blockquote><b>Whose idea was it to cast Jennifer Hudson?</b><br>
&#x201C;Michael Patrick King. I had wanted him to include an African-American [character on the show] for a long time, because I recognized that African-American women would legitimately say, &#x2018;Why aren&#x2019;t there enough women of color [on the show]?&#x2019; And I would say, &#x2018;I agree. It hasn&#x2019;t really reflected New York.&#x2019; And Michael was always [insisting] that you can&#x2019;t do token [parts]; you can&#x2019;t just throw someone in there because it&#x2019;s necessary. You have to find something real or it&#x2019;s even worse than not getting somebody. So he wrote this part, and he said he wanted Jennifer Hudson. And I was like, &#x2018;Sure, get in line! Everyone wants Jennifer Hudson.&#x2019; And then she came in and read, which I couldn&#x2019;t believe. And she was lovely. She&#x2019;s beautiful in person. She&#x2019;s gorgeous. She&#x2019;s probably six inches taller than me, easily. And she was so happy to be there and so enthusiastic and couldn&#x2019;t believe it.&quot;</blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145255/http://www.sexandthecitymovie.com/">Sex and the City movie</a> opens May 30.  <p></p>
