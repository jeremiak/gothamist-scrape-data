										<p><img alt="2008_12_himm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328204607im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_12_hirmm.jpg" class="left">The drama over whether State Senator-elect Hiram Monserrate assaulted his girlfriend continues!  Monserrate, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328204607/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/20/state_senators_domestic_violence_ar.php">arrested after allegedly hitting</a> Karla Giraldo with a broken glass (she had a black eye and a gash requiring 20 stitches), said the incident was a terrible accident; his supporters have reportedly said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328204607/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/22/the_alleged_reason_behind_monserrat.php">was upset about drugs</a> found in Giraldo&apos;s purse, hence their fight.  </p>

<p>However, sources tell the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328204607/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/12/23/2008-12-23_hiram_monserrates_girlfriend_pushes_pros-2.html">Daily News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328204607/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12232008/news/regionalnews/biz_card_made_hiram_a_slasher_145563.htm">Post</a> that it was the business card of another man (who is in the police union).  A source told the News, &quot;He was jealous. It was in her purse. He didn&apos;t like her explanations, and it got nasty,&quot; while the Post reported, &quot;<strong>Sources said her wound is consistent with a jagged piece of glass tearing into her skin</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>Giraldo is not cooperating with the police or Queens DA&apos;s office on the case&#x2014;a point that State Senator Eric Adams (who, like Monserrate is a former cop) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328204607/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2008/12/adams-nypd-priority-to-publicl.html">makes in a statement accusing</a> the NYPD of humiliating Monserrate because he supports police reform. Hmm, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328204607/http://www.yournabe.com/articles/2008/12/22/queens/doc495012e1258fe365107034.txt">Queens Times-Ledger reports</a>, according to its sources, &quot;<strong>Authorities have obtained video surveillance that allegedly shows embattled...Monserrate pulling his girlfriend&#x2019;s hair outside his apartment early Friday morning just hours before he was charged with assaulting her</strong>.&quot;</p>
