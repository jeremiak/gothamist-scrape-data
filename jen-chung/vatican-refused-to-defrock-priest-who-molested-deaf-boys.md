And when the church officials attempted to start proceedings that could have led to the priest&apos;s dismissal, the Vatican halted the trial.</p>

<p>The Times received documents between the church and Vatican, as well as other evidence, from lawyers for five men who are suing the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. According to the Times, &quot;In 1996, Cardinal Ratzinger&quot;&#x2014;now Pope Benedict&#x2014;&quot;failed to respond to two letters about the case from Rembert G. Weakland, Milwaukee&#x2019;s archbishop at the time. After eight months, the second in command at the doctrinal office, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, now the Vatican&#x2019;s secretary of state, instructed the Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial that could lead to [Rev. Lawrence] Murphy&#x2019;s dismissal.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, that was stopped after Cardinal Ratzinger received a letter from Murphy, &quot;protesting that he should not be put on trial because he had already repented and was in poor health and that the case was beyond the church&#x2019;s own statute of limitations.&quot; Murphy, who worked at the school from 1950 to 1974 before being moved to another parish (still able to work with children), wrote, &quot;I simply want to live out the time that I have left in the dignity of my priesthood. I ask your kind assistance in this matter.&quot;  He died two years later.</p>
