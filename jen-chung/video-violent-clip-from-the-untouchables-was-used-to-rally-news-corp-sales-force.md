<blockquote>Carlucci...used to show the sales staff the scene in &#x201C;The Untouchables&#x201D; in which Al Capone beats a man to death with a baseball bat. Mr. Emmel testified that Mr. Carlucci was clear about the guiding corporate philosophy.

<p>According to Mr. Emmel&#x2019;s testimony, Mr. Carlucci said that if there were employees uncomfortable with the company&#x2019;s philosophy &#x2014; &#x201C;bed-wetting liberals in particular was the description he used&#x201D; Mr. Emmel testified &#x2014; then he could arrange to have those employees &#x201C;outplaced from the company.&#x201D; </p></blockquote>That&apos;s so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144300/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-AXTx4PcKI">David Mamet</a>! But here&apos;s the scene in question.<p></p>

<p>News Corp., currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144300/http://gothamist.com/tags/newscorp">embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal</a> that has the British prime minister calling an emergency session of Parliament and U.S. Justice Department investigating rumors that 9/11 victims&apos; phone voicemail systems were broken into.</p>
