So it shouldn&apos;t be surprising to hear that when a 9-year-old flying Southwest Airlines from Tennessee to LaGuardia Airport was rerouted, <strong>her family had no idea</strong>.<p></p>

<p>Chloe Boyce was heading to LaGuardia to spend Christmas with her grandmother in Connecticut.  Her mother, Elena Kerr, says that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124103749/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/12/unaccompanied-minor-ends-up-in-wrong-state-after-airline-switches-flight/">Chloe flies by herself on Southwest often</a>, either to visit her grandmother or her father in Rhode Island: &quot;Whenever she flies alone, we go up to a ticket agent, and the ticket agent goes over the rules with her. We always go over how many stops there will be.&quot;  Her Tuesday flight to New York was supposed to have two stops: A layover in Baltimore and then a final stop at LGA.  But fog forced the plane to go to Columbus, Ohio before Baltimore.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124103749/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/Girl--136109498.html">Chloe told NBC Connecticut</a>, &#x201C;The lady at checkout, she said, &apos;Do not get off this plane, only when you see LaGuardia airport,&apos;&quot; but after the second stop in Baltimore, &quot;The flight attendant says the people who are going to LaGuardia have to get off in Baltimore and go to customer service to get another ticket. And I was like, &apos;What do I do?&apos; The flight attendant said, &apos;You&apos;ll be coming with me,&apos; and I said, &apos;But I&apos;m not supposed to get off the airplane.&apos;&quot; OMG, can you imagine what<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124103749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/07/airlines_claims_alec_baldwin_threw.php"> Alec Baldwin would have done</a>?!?</p>

<p>The girl&apos;s arrival in New York came hours later&#x2014;upside, a pilot bought her dinner at Chili&apos;s&#x2014;and on another flight, confusing her relatives who freaked out when a flight they thought was Chloe&apos;s had no unaccompanied minors on board.  Her grandmother, Maryann DiShuk, said, &quot;It was really scary. It was a scary situation not knowing where she is just for a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>Southwest was apologetic, &quot;Our unaccompanied minor policy aims to minimize these kinds of situations ... by only ticketing them on itineraries that don&apos;t require an aircraft change,&quot; and refunded Boyce&apos;s ticket plus offered a $250 voucher.  Kerr said, &quot;We just don&#x2019;t understand why we weren&#x2019;t called, especially because the Southwest policy states that someone must be available to answer phone calls during the flight time in the event of a flight irregularity.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Chloe, she will be getting a junior Girl Scout badge and her mother will be driving 17 hours to pick her up.</p>
