<p>Three men who were changing a tire on a disabled car were struck by a driver on the New England Expressway early this morning. One of the men died at the scene, while two others were injured.</p>

<p>Police responded to the stretch of the southbound thruway before 2 a.m. and found three men lying in the roadway, next to a 2010 Mazda on the shoulder exit 11 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170504/http://pix11.com/2016/12/15/man-29-changing-tire-on-new-england-thruway-fatally-struck-by-driver-police-say/">near Co-op City</a>. Artimis Jones, 29, was pronounced dead and the two other men, both 30 years old, were taken to Jacobi Hospital. </p>

<p>A 52-year-old man driving a Toyota Sienna minivan struck them.  &quot;It appeared the men had been changing the tire in the fast lane of the busy interstate when the van crashed into them,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170504/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-1-Dead-2-Hurt-After-Men-Changing-Tire-Hit-by-Van-on-I-95-in-Bronx-406742505.html">NBC New York reports</a>.</p>
