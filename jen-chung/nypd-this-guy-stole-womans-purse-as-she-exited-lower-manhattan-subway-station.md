<p>Police are hoping the public can help them find a robbery suspect who struck at a Financial District subway station last month. </p>

<p>The incident occurred just before 9:30 a.m. on November 16th, at the exit of the Fulton Street station located at Nassau and Fulton Streets. According to the NYPD, the victim, a 28-year-old woman, was about to walk through a turnstile to leave the J line, when the suspect &quot;forcibly grabbed her purse. The individual cut one of the straps on the purse and the victim struggled with him, resulting in her falling to the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim let go of the purse, and the suspect fled towards the southbound J platform, police say. Surveillance footage shows the incident, as well as the suspect, who is described as a male around 45 years old, 6&apos; and 175 pounds, with short black hair and last seen wearing large frame glasses, black headphones, a navy blue baseball hat, a black jacket with white interior, a black wide neck t-shirt, black pants and holding a black back pack.<br>
