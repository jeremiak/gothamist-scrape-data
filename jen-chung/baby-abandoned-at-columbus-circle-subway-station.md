<p>[UPDATE: A woman believed to be the child&apos;s mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103231/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/08/baby_abandoned_at_columbus_circle_s.php">is now in custody</a>.] Police say that a one-year-old baby was left at the Columbus Circle subway station in Manhattan at around 12:30 p.m. today.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, a woman, who is 20-30 years old, was on a northbound 1 train with the baby and pushed the stroller onto the platform at Columbus Circle. Then she got back onto the train. Police say they waited 20 minutes to see if the mother would return before taking the baby.</p>

<p>The child was taken to Roosevelt Hospital and is in good health. </p>
