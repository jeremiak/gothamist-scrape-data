<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_09_rudygiuliani.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_rudygiuliani.jpg" width="230" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>After months of speculation, former NYC mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://gothamist.com/tags/rudygiuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> won&apos;t be running for office next year.  He&apos;s expected to announce that he won&apos;t run for Senate against junior Senator Kirsten Gillibrand when he endorses former Senate candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://gothamist.com/tags/ricklazio">Rick Lazio</a>&apos;s bid for Governor!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/12/21/2009-12-21_rudy_giuliani_will_not_run.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;He had reason to weigh each run: surveys showed him a clear favorite to win primaries for either office, and as recently as last week a poll showed Giuliani crushing... Kirsten Gillibrand by 10 points. But the former mayor has decided to stay in the private sector, where he will continue his work as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/06/giuliani_takes_job_as_security_cons.php">security consultant</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/15/giuliani_mistake_to_bring_911_trial.php">sometimes TV commentator</a> and, increasingly, a celebrity draw on the GOP fund-raising circuit.&quot;</p>

<p>Ever since former governor Eliot Spitzer stepped down, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/28/into_the_breach.php">whispers of Giuliani being a gubernatorial candidate</a> in 2010&#x2014;and the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/giuliani_totally_considering_being.php"> idea gained momentum</a> what with Governor Paterson&apos;s terrible standings in the polls and dysfunctional State Senate.  But then the tide turned and some state Republicans thought that Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/14/will_ny_gop_go_for_senator_giuliani.php">would be better suited</a> at trying to oust Paterson-appointed Gillibrand from the Senate.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062928/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/nyregion/22rudy.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times notes</a> that besides not being able to do his lucrative speaking gigs, &quot;his business interests, including his firm, Giuliani Partners, tend to suffer when he runs for office, those who know him say.&quot; Plus, &quot;The corruption case against his friend and former police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, could have made a statewide campaign more complicated. And Mr. Giuliani has strained relations with Edward F. Cox, the new state Republican Party chairman.&quot; </p>
