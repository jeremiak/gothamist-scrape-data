<p>Caroline Kennedy had lunch at Sylvia&apos;s with the Reverend Al Sharpton today and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144749/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/politics/ny-nykenn1219,0,1952417.story">told reporters</a>, <strong>&quot;I feel like I&apos;m a Kennedy Democrat, a Clinton Democrat, [Sen. Charles] Schumer, Barack Obama -- these are all leaders whose values I share and I feel like those are the kinds of values that I would bring</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, Republican Rep. Peter King has been vocal questioning her abilities; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144749/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-stisra1812282422dec18,0,166582.story">he said to CNN</a>, &quot;I&apos;m not aware of anything she has ever said about the Islamic terrorist war against us, what we have to do to defend ourselves, what we should do on foreign policy. I&apos;m not saying you have to be a politician or to have held office ... but you have to be somewhere in the public arena. The fact is that she has a well-known name, her face has been on a lot of magazines but, really, very limited involvement in the public sphere.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, Kennedy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144749/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/nyregion/18upstate.html?hp">headed upstate to meet politicians</a> in Syracuse, Buffalo and Rochester (and it was apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144749/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/12/just_about_the_last_name_youd.html">very tightly controlled</a>) and said, &quot;I just hope everybody understands that it is not a campaign but that I have a lifelong devotion to public service. I&#x2019;ve written books on the Constitution and the importance of individual participation. And I&#x2019;ve raised my family. I think I really could help bring change to Washington.&#x201D;  She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144749/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/12/17/2008-12-17_caroline_kennedy_meets_syracuse_politici.html">even joked</a>, &quot;I&apos;ll be back as many times as Chuck Schumer.&quot;  </p>

<p>An interesting subplot is how trusted adviser to Mayor Bloomberg, Kevin Sheekey, has been pushing hard for Kennedy.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144749/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/nyregion/18bloomberg.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times quotes</a> someone who says &quot;<strong>Sheekey&apos;s up to his eyeballs in this.</strong>&quot;  While Bloomberg said Sheekey&apos;s private time is up to him, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144749/http://www.politickerny.com/1125/bloomberg-view-caroline-great-others">mayor told The Vie</a>w, &quot;If it were my call to pick somebody, I&apos;d know exactly. I can&apos;t tell you, because I&apos;d be getting involved. I should stay out of this race, it&apos;s up to Governor Paterson, he&apos;s lucky to have a number of different candidates. I was asked about Caroline Kennedy, she&apos;s very competent, she&apos;s done a lot for New York City.&quot;</p>
