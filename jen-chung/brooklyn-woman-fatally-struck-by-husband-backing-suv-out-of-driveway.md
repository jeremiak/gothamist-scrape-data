<p>A 26-year-old woman was killed outside her Brooklyn home by her husband this weekend, in an apparent auto accident.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, officers responded to a call about a vehicle collision in East Flatbush just after 9:30 a.m. Saturday. When they got to 372 East 32nd Street, the police found Nupur Baten &quot;in a semi-conscious state laying on the ground in the driveway with trauma to her body.&quot; Baten was taken to Kings County Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>The police investigation found that her husband had been backing their 2015 Toyota Rav4 when Baten was struck. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001948/http://nypost.com/2015/10/24/woman-killed-after-husband-runs-her-over-with-car-cops/">The NY Post reports</a> that she &quot;had been checking for traffic&quot; and was trying &quot;to guide him down the driveway&quot;&#x2014;and that her husband actually ran over her. </p>

<p>The Post adds that the husband allegedly lost control of the vehicle accidentally. Cops say no charges have been filed, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
