<p>Yesterday, the search warrants for Newtown killer Adam Lanza&apos;s home were released, and they revealed the disturbing depth of the stockpile of weapons and ammunition the 20-year-old and his mother owned. Over 1600 rounds of ammo were found, as were two rifles (like the .22-caliber one he used to kill Nancy Lanza) and a starter pistol, plus samurai swords and a National Rifle Association certificate in Adam Lanza&apos;s name. There was also an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525185259/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-newtown-search-warrants-20130327-1,0,5171609.story">instruction manual for the Bushmaster AR-15</a>&#x2014;the assault weapon that Lanza used to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525185259/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/breaking_multiple_people_injured_in.php">massacre 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2012.</p>

<p>The NY Times has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525185259/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/nyregion/29newton-warrant-ammo.html?ref=nyregion">graphic showing some of the items inventoried</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525185259/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/nyregion/search-warrants-reveal-items-seized-at-adam-lanzas-home.html">reports</a>:</p><blockquote>He saved photographs of what appeared to be a corpse smeared in blood and covered in plastic, as well as a newspaper clipping that chronicled a vicious shooting at Northern Illinois University. <p></p>

<p>A gun safe was in what investigators believed was his bedroom. Among his clothing was a military-style uniform. There was also a holiday card that contained a check made out to Mr. Lanza, 20, and signed by his mother. Investigators suggested that the money had been intended to buy a gun.</p></blockquote>You <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525185259/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-read-the-search-warrants-in-the-newtown-shooting-case-20130328,0,3695516.special">can see the warrants here</a>&#x2014;other items include books about Asperger&apos;s syndrome (which is what Adam Lanza had) and a receipt to a gun range in Oklahoma. While a NRA certificate was found, the NRA said, &quot;There is no record of a member relationship between Newtown killer Adam Lanza, nor between Nancy Lanza, A. Lanza or N. Lanza with the National Rifle Association. Reporting to the contrary is reckless, false and defamatory.&quot; <p></p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525185259/http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/adam-lanza-mom-nra-certificates-89426.html">Politico notes</a>, &quot;review of the NRA website shows that the organization offers a variety of education and training programs, and also provides online templates for certificates. Organizations around the country also offer what they bill as NRA certificates upon completion of certain classes. A spokeswoman for the NRA confirmed to POLITICO that it is possible to possess a certificate from the NRA without being a full-fledged member of the organization.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that it took Adam Lanza five minutes to kill the 26 victims, using 154 rounds.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525185259/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-newtown-search-warrants-20130327-1,0,2875588,full.story">According to the Courant</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;Police recovered from Lanza&apos;s body three, 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster, each containing 30 rounds. They also located in the area of the shootings six additional 30-round magazines, three of which were empty and the others containing 10, 11 and 13 live rounds. There was one 30-round magazine on the gun.<p></p>

<p>Police have theorized that Lanza might have been simulating the video games that he loved to play by switching out the ammunition in the Bushmaster as he moved from room to room and before the magazine was empty. It is a characteristic of hard-core gamers to constantly switch magazines so that they are never out of ammunition when entering a room.</p></blockquote>Lanza killed himself with one bullet. Mark Bearden, whose first-grader son Daniel Bearden was fatally shot, said of the inventory details, &quot;It was obvious his intention was to do a lot of damage and he was certainly capable of doing that &#x2026; considering the amount of ammunition he had,&quot; and mentioned Nancy Lanza&apos;s involvement, &quot;As a parent, I would think that she probably could have made different choices with how she came to spend her time with her son. Fishing comes to mind.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan Hockley was another first-grader killed in the massacre, told the Courant she hasn&apos;t &quot;spent a great deal of time pouring through&quot; the warrants, &quot;Everything I learn about the investigation is painful because it reminds me of the pain of that day and that Dylan and the others aren&apos;t ever going to come back... I&apos;m much more focused on the need for change. The search warrants contents aren&apos;t as important.&quot;</p>
