<p>Apparently, Summer was living near Ground Zero when the World Trade Center was attacked on September 11, 2001.  TMZ reports, &quot;Donna became almost paranoid about breathing the air, which was heavy with a rancid odor.   In the months and years following 9/11, Donna&apos;s feelings intensified.  One source tells us when he was around Donna, she would constantly spray some sort of disinfectant in the air.  Deney Terrio, the host of &quot;Dance Fever,&quot; tells us ... when he was around Donna post 9/11, she would hang silk sheets in her dressing room to prevent dust from coming in.&quot;</p>

<p>Another source says that Donna, &quot;who was a fervent practicing Christian, believed 9/11 was an attack on Christianity and in some metaphysical way Christians like her were targets.  She somehow felt that her illness was a byproduct of the attack.&quot;  And Summer reportedly didn&apos;t believe her lung cancer was due to her cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke.</p>

<p>Lung cancer is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727194041/http://www.lungcancer.org/reading/about.php">number-one cause</a> of cancer death for men and women.  It is strongly believed that the toxic air from the WTC attacks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727194041/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/further_evidence_that_911_causes_ca.php">caused many cases of cancer</a>&#x2014;especially among first responders&#x2014;but the government still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727194041/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/911_responders_with_cancer_dont_qua.php">won&apos;t give aid to cancer victims</a>.</p>
