<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140906142032/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121926582869857905.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news">various</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140906142032/http://wcbstv.com/campaign08/mccain.obama.poll.2.799749.html">national polls</a> show Senator John McCain cutting Senator Barack Obama&apos;s lead for the presidential race, the Obama camp has unveiled an ad reminding voters that McCain has more than just one or two houses.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140906142032/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12685.html">Politico reported</a> that when it asked how many homes McCain and his wife owned, McCain said, &quot;I think &#x2014; I&apos;ll have my staff get to you...It&apos;s condominiums where &#x2014; I&apos;ll have them get to you.&quot;  </p>

<p>When his staff did get back to Politico, they said the McCains had at least four (and Newsweek reported earlier that it&apos;s more like seven). Obama has made it a point to bring up McCain&apos;s earlier remark that people with more than $5 million were rich (which McCain later tried to correct) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140906142032/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/obama-counts-mccains-houses/">by saying today</a>, &quot;I guess if you think that being rich means you&apos;ve got to make $5 million, and if you don&apos;t know how many houses you have, then it&apos;s not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong. But if you&apos;re like me, and you&apos;ve got one house, or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they don&apos;t lose their home, you might have a different perspective.&quot;</p>

<p> McCain&apos;s campaign has responded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140906142032/http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/08/barack_obama_i_only_have_one_h.html">highlighting Obama&apos;s wealth</a>, &quot;Does a guy who made more than $4 million last year, just got back from vacation on a private beach in Hawaii and bought his own million-dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses?&quot;</p>
