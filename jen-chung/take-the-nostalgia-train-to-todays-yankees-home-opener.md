<p>The Yankees are a lousy 3-3 after dropping their first three games to Tampa (but then they turned it around in Baltimore), but hopefully luck will change at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120414052606/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_04_13_anamlb_nyamlb_1&amp;mode=preview&amp;c_id=mlb">today&apos;s 1 p.m. home opener</a>.  To put fans commuting by subway in a good mood, the MTA is rolling out the Nostalgia Special again!</p>

<p>According to the MTA:</p><blockquote>The four-car &apos;Nostalgia Special&apos; will go into service at 12 noon at Grand Central on the 4, uptown express platform and will make stops at 59th Street, 86th Street, 125th Street, 138th St-Grand Concourse, 149th Street-Grand Concourse and 161st Street-Yankee Stadium.</blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote>The cars on the train will be the 1917 vintage Lo-V (low voltage) cars, which were removed from regular passenger service in 1969 and this trip will mark the 96th year since they started transporting baseball fans to see the Yankees. They aren&apos;t air conditioned like the rest of NYC Transit&apos;s 6,300 subway cars, but there will be plenty of fans on board--Yankee fans, that is.<br>
 <br>
Additional trains and crews will be on hand with capacity crowds of more than 52,000 fans expected to attend opening day.  As a reminder during the season, fans can always take the B, D or 4 train to 161 St-Yankee Stadium (B during rush hours only). After all games, trains are queued along the center track of the Jerome and Concourse Lines and then called into 161 St-Yankee Stadium and filled one by one until the last Manhattan-bound customers are on their way.</blockquote>You can also reach the stadium by the Bx6 and Bx13 local buses (and the  Bx1, Bx2, and BxM4 stop at 161st Street and the Grand Concourse, a short three-block walk to the stadium).  <p></p>

<p>This is the Yankees&apos; 110th home opener and the fourth at the new stadium.  </p>
