<p>During what Splitsider called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321221001/http://splitsider.com/2013/03/the-weirdest-episode-of-the-weirdest-season-of-saturday-night-live-2/">&quot;weirdest season&quot;</a> of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, famed columnist Jimmy Breslin hosted an episode on May 17th, 1986. Chomping on a piece of gum, Breslin greeted the audience and marveled, &quot;This is about the nicest place I&apos;ve ever worked. Look at me now, my age, I&apos;m going to spend the next 90 minutes groveling in the dust to make some rat 19-year-olds like me.&quot;</p>

<p>Breslin used his monologue to talk about his Catholic school experiences in Queens and work in newspapers&#x2014;&quot;Some call it slander, I call it getting paid.&quot; He also slammed Mayor Koch, who &quot;can&apos;t do anything but purse his lips&quot; but admits that Koch&apos;s &quot;gonna be great for  my future.&quot; </p>
