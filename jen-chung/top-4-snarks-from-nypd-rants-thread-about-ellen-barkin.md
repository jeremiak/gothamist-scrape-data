<p>When actress Ellen Barkin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/01/ellen_barkin_pissed_off_at_nypd_for.php">Tweeted her anger about the NYPD&apos;s apparent &quot;random arrests&quot;</a> of innocent people in the wee hours of New Year&apos;s, she set off a firestorm of criticism from other Twitterers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://twitter.com/ellenbarkin">when she criticized the NYPD</a> (&quot;People being thrown in police vans, arrested for &apos;jaywalking&apos;What happened to the NYPD of my youth?Who are u all?Shame shame on u all&quot;) and Mayor Bloomberg (&quot;Fuck all of u,Bloomberg &amp; every1 goose-stepping behind u.I cannot believe what I am seeing.U protect nothing.U ARE the violence in my city&quot;) and complained about a cop shoving her.  But what do the cop-types on NYPD Rant think?</p>

<p>Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/46907/ELLEN-BARKIN-PISSED-OFF-NYPD">they seem to be more familiar</a> with Barkin as the ex-wife of Revlon mogul Ron Perelman (she<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/fashion/21barkin.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin"> famously auctioned off all the jewelry</a> he gave her), and less familiar with her steamy love scenes in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Easy_(film)">The Big Easy</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Love_(film)">Sea of Love</a> or the fact that she won a Tony last year for her supporting role in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/06/tony-winners-john-benjamin-hickey-and-ellen-barkin-talk-the-normal-heart-on-cbs-video/">The Normal Heart.</a> But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730170801/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/46907/ELLEN-BARKIN-PISSED-OFF-NYPD">there are some amusing take-downs</a>:<br>
</p><ul><br>
	<li>&quot;Word on the street is she used to date Teddy Roosevelt when he was PC.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>&quot;The NYPD of her youth? That was 50 freakin&apos; years ago. Most of them are dead.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>&quot;I&apos;ve seen toddlers redirected with more force.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>&quot;If I wanted everyone to love me, I&apos;d have become a fireman.&quot;</li><br>
</ul><p></p>
