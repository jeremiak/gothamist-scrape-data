<p>A teenager was viciously attacked by ten people on Coney Island Sunday, leaving him with a punctured lung. The assault was caught on a video&#x2014;which was posted to Facebook&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420134414/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/teenage-boy-stomped-coney-island-brawl-article-1.3075604">the attackers allegedly asked the 16-year-old victim</a>, &quot;Are you static?&quot; before ganging up on him.</p>

<p>The incident took place around 6 p.m. on Easter, April 16th. The victim was walking near 3205 West 12th Street when he got into a &quot;verbal dispute&quot; with ten males, an NYPD spokesperson said, which then turned into a physical altercation. The group kicked and punched the victim above the waist.</p>

<p>Police and EMS responded to the scene and took the teen to Interfaith Hospital where he was in serious but stable condition. He suffered a small puncture to his lung as well as cuts and bruising above the torso.</p>

<p>The victim&apos;s sister reportedly went to the 60th Precinct to report the attack on Monday. &quot;As detectives began their probe, they were informed of the Facebook video and were able to connect it to the hospitalized teen. &apos;Today in Coney,&apos; the Facebook user who posted the video, captioned it with three emojis for tears,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420134414/http://abc7ny.com/news/16-year-old-believed-to-be-victim-in-luna-park-attack/1894804/">according to WABC 7</a>. </p>

<p>The video remained on Facebook from Sunday through Wednesday afternoon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420134414/http://nypost.com/2017/04/19/helpless-victim-attacked-in-savage-beatdown/">Facebook told the Post</a>, &quot;We remove graphic images and videos when they are shared to celebrate or glorify violence.&quot; (Copies of it <a href="&lt;a href=" https:="" www.youtube.com="" watch?v="a1zyZ65eCpQ&quot;">&quot;&gt;are still on YouTube</a>.)</p>

<p>The NYPD investigation is ongoing. </p>
