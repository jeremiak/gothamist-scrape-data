<p>If Vogue is calling Bushwick the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515054651/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/09/bushwick_so_cool_its_over.php">7th coolest neighborhood in the world</a>, then of course lots of newcomers are going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515054651/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/21/bushwick_real_estate.php">look for apartments</a>. But as real estate prices rise there and in Bed-Stuy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515054651/http://nypost.com/2014/09/15/bed-stuy-and-bushwick-booming-despite-high-crime/">the Post warns</a> that gentrifiers are getting attacked, mugged, and burglarized.</p>

<p>The Post&apos;s police sources tell them, &quot;All I can say is there should be a sign that reads, &#x2018;Buyer beware,&#x2019;&#x2009;&quot; and &quot;A lot of the white folks moving into these areas are from out of state.They walk around as if they own the place... then they get robbed&#x2026; The problem is they&#x2019;re moving into their beautiful home with all these housing projects around them. That&#x2019;s where the crime comes from.&quot;</p>

<p>The paper hit the streets to scaremonger IRL, and found 29-year-old Paulina Jamet, who was checking out an open house on Quincy Street going for $1.3 million. She told them, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen how fast the new neighbors are moving in. More people like me are moving in and changing the neighborhood. So that&#x2019;s comforting.&#x201D; <em>Oh really Paulina?</em> The Post countered her search for comfort with a report about a 35-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515054651/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-dad-35-fatally-shot-bed-stuy-article-1.1909932">gunned down</a> just a block away from her would-be dream home.</p>

<p>The paper also mapped out crimes, million-dollar listings, and expensive rentals. One real estate agent admitted, &quot;People still have to be really careful. I want to call it a neighborhood in transition,&quot; while a longtime-resident said, &quot;At night, the freaks come out.&quot;</p>

<p>So&#x2026; we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515054651/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/23/brooklyn_is_dead_serious_about_expe.php">should all move to Jersey City</a>?</p>
