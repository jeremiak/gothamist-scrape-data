<p>Outrage over a photograph of Whitney Houston&apos;s body in her casket, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309163526/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-national-enquirer-whitney-houston-20120223,0,4552762.story">which was published by the National Enquirer</a>, has been so intense that people have been threatening funeral home owner Carolyn Whigham.  The Newark businesswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309163526/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/owner_of_funeral_home_that_han.html">held a press conference today to deny she had anything to do with leaking (or selling) the photograph</a>, &quot;I want to clear my name and my funeral home.&quot; </p>

<p>Whigham, who said she has been spat upon, and Rev. Ronald Slaughter of St. James AME Church said that they did know who took the photograph.  Whigham (see video below) said only she and two other licensed funeral directors had access to the pop singer&apos;s body; she did however note that &quot;a security detail from Nippy Inc., the singer&#x2019;s management company, was with the singer&#x2019;s body around the clock while it was&quot; at the funeral home. The Rev. Jethro James, pastor of Paradise Baptist Church, &quot;It&apos;s up to the Houston family to release the name.&quot;</p>
