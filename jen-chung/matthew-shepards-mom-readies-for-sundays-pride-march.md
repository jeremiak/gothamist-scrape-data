Judy Shepard, who has fought against violence against gays after her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101609/http://www.matthewshepard.org/site/PageServer">son Matthew&apos;s murder</a> in 1998, said that while she&apos;s happy the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101609/http://www.hrc.org/issues/5660.htm">Hate Crimes Prevention Act</a> was signed into law last fall, &quot;This is just the beginning, because this is the building block for future gay rights legislation, so this is really a big deal. And this is why, one reason why I really wanted to come to the parade this year, is because I want to celebrate that success and remind everyone that we just have so much more work to do and this is a great jumping-off point.&quot;</p>

<p>She added, &quot;I want to move forward to the other events where we can actually make a change, a positive change in people&apos;s lives that that takes affect right away. Job protection is crucial to me and Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell.&apos;&quot; (One of her fellow Grand Marshals is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101609/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/21/dan_choi_will_be_grand_marhal_at_ga.php">Lt. Dan Choi</a>; the other is Mississippi teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101609/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/gay_pride_1.php">Constance McMillen</a>.)</p>

<p>Shepard&apos;s book about her son, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101609/http://www.amazon.com/Meaning-Matthew-Murder-Laramie-Transformed/dp/B002XULXNS/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">The Meaning of Matthew</a>, was recently released in paperback.  She said, &quot;We owed it to Matt to tell people about who he really was. Not something that no one else could attain or aspire to, but just a really regular human being with great qualities and flaws.&quot;</p>
