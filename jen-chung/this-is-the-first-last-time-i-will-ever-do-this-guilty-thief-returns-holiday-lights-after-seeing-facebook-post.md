										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_11_holidaylights.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723072038im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_11_holidaylights.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Do not underestimate the power of holiday lights</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A sheepish holiday lights fiend returned the lights he stole from a Staten Island home after seeing video of himself taking the lights on Facebook. He left a note upon his second visit admitting, &quot;I was not thinking when I did it.&quot;</p>

<p>The video was posted to Facebook by retired police lieutenant Michael Reilly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723072038/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161130/huguenot/christmas-decoration-thief-returns-lights">who saw it on a private page first</a>. In the footage, someone steps out of a dark-colored, double-parked car; walks onto the Huguenot home&apos;s lawn; removes the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723072038/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/29/stolen-christmas-decoration/">two laser projector lights</a>&quot;; and then runs back into his car.</p>

<p>Reilly updated his Facebook post to inform the world that &quot;the man in the video returned the lights with a note apologizing. The family who owned the lights extends a big THANK YOU to everyone for sharing!&quot; And he included the note:</p>

<p>Of the thief, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723072038/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/29/stolen-christmas-decoration/">Reilly said</a>, &quot;He&#x2019;s never going to do it again! We&#x2019;ll see how that works out.&quot; He also gave WCBS 2 suggestions about securing holiday decorations, like using wire to tie the decorations down and having motion-sensor yard lights: &quot;It may startle them if they go near it, and then all of a sudden it comes on, and they&#x2019;ll move away.&quot;</p>

<p>&apos;Tis also the season for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723072038/http://patch.com/new-york/southeast/tips-prevent-package-theft-during-holiday-2016-shopping-season-southeast">package thieves</a>, so be vigilant.</p>
