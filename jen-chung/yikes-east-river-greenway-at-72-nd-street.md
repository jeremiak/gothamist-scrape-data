<p>Reader Seth took this photograph on the East River Greenway bike/pedestrian path near 72nd Street and says, &quot;This path has been falling apart for years and the City has simply fenced off damaged areas instead of repairing them. This is one of many dangerous sections of the East Side Greenway that desperately needs to be repaired. Please call 311.&quot;</p>
