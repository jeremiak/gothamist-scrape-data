Nassau County police spokesman Det. Lt. Kevin Smith said that officer Paul DeMarco had been driving north when there were calls for help for a swimmer in distress.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012332/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/long-beach-cops-sunbather-injury-an-accident-1.1955233">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;His attention momentarily diverted, DeMarco made a &apos;sweeping&apos; U-turn to the right when he struck Marshall Starkman, 43, sitting in a lounge chair, Smith said. DeMarco didn&#x2019;t realize he had hit anyone until beachgoers told him, police and officials said. &apos;<strong>He begins the turn and he doesn&#x2019;t see the gentleman lying in the sand</strong>,&apos; Smith said.&quot;<p></p>

<p>DeMarco, who was initially speaking with his daughter (who was at the beach) when he decided to change directions to help the swimmer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012332/http://www.wpix.com/news/local/wpix-beach-goer-ran-over-no-charges,0,5551478.story">won&apos;t be charged</a>.  Long Beach City Manager Charles Theofan added that Starkman was in a &quot;very low lounge chair... in that one spot where he couldn&#x2019;t be seen.&#x201D;  It also doesn&apos;t appear that DeMarco used his lights or sirens.</p>

<p>Starkman&apos;s spine was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012332/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/beach_crush_guy_cell_call_E1xEIVgJGzQHpMqk2B2bXK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">fractured in two places</a>.  His wife says he suffered &quot;very troubling&quot; internal injuries and his lawyer says there will be a lawsuit.</p>
