WNBC reports that when police responded to a call about shots fired, &quot;they arrived to find a man with a gun trying to get inside a building on Central Avenue.&quot; The man refused to drop his gun and instead fired at the police, who returned fire.   A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103750/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/08/28/2008-08-28_three_injured_in_wild_policeinvolved_sho.html">told the Daily News</a> there were two men involved with the shooting, &quot;<strong>They weren&apos;t yelling or screaming, they just started shooting. They were shooting wild, like Wild West. They hit a woman who was helping her kids get inside the building.</strong>&quot;  The woman, the shooter and another man (believed to be the second shooter, injured in an earlier gun fight) were taken to Brookdale University Hospital.</p>
