<p>A mobster who is set to be released this fall is reportedly looking to seize control of the Bonnano crime family.  And he&apos;s making sure he&apos;s in fighting shape by... not eating meat.  Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517041410/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/13/any_amount_of_any_type_of_red_meat.php">red meat <em>will kill you</em>, according to science</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517041410/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/plot_to_become_top_bonanno_zFc4sWR3rbGNnURPnw0sbL#ixzz1pU85TMuT">Post reports</a>, &quot;Bonanno soldier Vito Rizzuto has vowed to take control of the battered crime family when he gets out of federal prison in October &#x2014; and exact murderous revenge on the rivals who rubbed out his father and son while he stewed behind bars, a jailhouse source says... He&#x2019;s got little to live for, so while locked up at a maximum-security pen in Florence, Colo., he&#x2019;s been eating vegetarian, staying fit, sharpening his mind with games of pinochle &#x2014; and plotting his coup, the source said.&quot;</p>

<p>Rizzuto is considered to be the most powerful mobster in Canada, running the Bonnano crime family&apos;s concerns up north.  The source claims that he said, &quot;I don&#x2019;t just want to be godfather of Canada &#x2014; I want to be godfather of the world.&quot; He&apos;s serving time for being one of the gunmen who killed  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517041410/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Giaccone">Philip Giaccone</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517041410/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominick_Trinchera">Dominick Trinchera</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517041410/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Indelicato">Alphonse Indelicato</a> in 1981 (an incident you might recall if you saw Donnie Brasco) at a Brooklyn nightclub; apparently the trio were planning to overthrow the then-boss, Paul Rastelli.  </p>

<p>With his father and son assassinated in separate incidents in Montreal, Rizzuto reportedly has &quot;nothing else to do&quot; except plot revenge. According to the Post, &quot;A trim 180 pounds, the 6-foot-2 gangster relished cooking healthy soups for himself and his fellow inmates. He worked out with brisk walks around a track.&quot; Hmm, that&apos;s so different from prison the way Henry Hill told it:</p>
