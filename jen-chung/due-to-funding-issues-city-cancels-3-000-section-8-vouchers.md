<p>Federal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622150552/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/nyregion/18vouchers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Section 8 vouchers allow</a> poor (and elderly and disabled) tenants to pay just 30% of their incomes towards rents in private apartments, with the government picking up the rest. Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer was outraged, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622150552/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/110655/nycha-revokes-more-than-3-000-section-8-vouchers">telling NY1</a>, &quot;[The NYCHA] knew this in May. They didn&apos;t let anybody know. People were walking around thinking they have an affordable housing unit, the potential for that, and they don&apos;t.&quot;  But the NYCHA says they waited until the last possible moment, in hopes that funding would be restored.</p>

<p>One man who showed up at a NYCHA office&#x2014;with a signed lease in hand&#x2014; to find out his voucher was worth nothing told the News, &quot;They said, &apos;There&apos;s no money.&apos; They wouldn&apos;t take the voucher,&quot; and added that his 5-year-old son said, &quot;Daddy, what are we going to do? Are we going to have to go back to the shelter again?&quot;</p>
