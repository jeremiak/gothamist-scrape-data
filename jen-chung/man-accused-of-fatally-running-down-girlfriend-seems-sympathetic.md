Charles Ann, 26, who apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154645/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/man_accused_of_killing_girlfriend_w.php">fled to a friend&apos;s apartment in Flushing</a> after the fatal confrontation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154645/http://www.northjersey.com/topstories/fortlee/Fort_Lee_murder_suspect_coming_back_to_Bergen_County.html">will be arraigned on Monday</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154645/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/02/24/charles-ann-man-accused-of-repeatedly-running-over-girlfriend-extradited-to-new-jersey/">His public defender told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;In my opinion, he does seem sympathetic. He does seem &#x2018;normal.&#x2019; You know, I know he&#x2019;s kind of been painted as a bad guy in the media.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to the Bergen County Prosecutor&apos;s Office, Ann and girlfriend Aena Hong, 25, had a tumultuous relationship (she was supposedly trying to break up with him) and were seen arguing on a Fort Lee sidewalk on Monday afternoon.  Ann got in his car and drove away&#x2014;but then allegedly came back to hit Hong as she crossed the street.  Witnesses saw the car run over Hong at three times.  A nearby bank manager who served in Iraq and saw Hong&apos;s body said, &quot;I&#x2019;m a vet. I was overseas. I haven&#x2019;t seen anything this horrific since I got back.&quot;  </p>

<p>The car sped off, but authorities found Ann in Queens with $3,000 cash and his passport (he is a naturalized citizen with family in South Korea). He was held there until yesterday on $3 million bail.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154645/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/baby_faced_killer_t7XKRUa09OxbrjPBlgtjaM">Post, which declared</a>, &quot;He looks more like a high-school Poindexter than a psycho killer,&quot; noted that Ann was &quot;in thick glasses and wearing the same gray shirt and black-and-white track slacks he wore at a hearing on Wednesday&quot; during yesterday&apos;s extradition hearing.  Lawyer  Uchenna Emeagwali said, &#x201C;He seems sympathetic now. He does understand how serious the case is. My heart goes out to the families.&#x201D;<br>
