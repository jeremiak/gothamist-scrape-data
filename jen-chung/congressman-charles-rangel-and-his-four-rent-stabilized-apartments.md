<p>Representative Charles Rangel isn&apos;t so happy with the New York Times:  The Gray Lady revealed the high-ranking Congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210035/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/nyregion/11rangel.html?ref=nyregion">has <b>four</b> rent-stabilized apartments</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210035/http://www.olnick.com/residential/lenox/">Lenox Terrace</a>, the Harlem development where Governor David Paterson also lives (Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210035/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/16/governor_paters_2.php">only has one rent-stabilized apartment</a>, though).</p>

<p>The NY Times reports three of the apartments were combined to make one 2,500 square foot apartment on the 16th floor, while a fourth apartment serves as his campaign office &quot;despite state and city regulations that require rent-stabilized apartments to be used as a primary residence.&quot;  The Times points out most building owners and landlords, including the owners of Lenox Terrace, the Olnick Organization, would like to get rid of rent-stabilized apartments: &quot;Yet Mr. Rangel, a critic of other landlords&#x2019; callousness, has been uncharacteristically reticent about Olnick&#x2019;s actions.&quot;</p>

<p>The Times breaks down Rangel&apos;s apartment costs this way:</p><blockquote><u>Residence, units 16M, 16N, 16P:</u><br>
Two-bedroom apartment:  Rangel pays $1,329; market-rate rent is $2,600 to $2,750<br>
One-bedroom apartment:  Rangel pays $1,329; market-rate rent is $1,865 to $2,005<br>
Studio: Rangel pays $606; market-rate rent is $1,300<br>
<i>Combined monthly cost: Rangel pays $3,264; market-rate rate would be at least $5,765</i><br>
<u>Office, unit 10U:  </u><br>
One-bedroom apartment: Rangel pays $630, half of which is paid by his Congressional re-election fund; market-rate rent is $1,700 to $2,005<br></blockquote>When asked about his real estate situation, Rangel told the Times, &#x201C;<strong>Why should I help you embarrass me?</strong>&#x201D; and hung up on the reporter.  There are also questions about how Rangel got four apartments and whether the fact that they are rent-stabilized would constitute a &quot;gift&quot; by the government, because Congressional members cannot accept gifts over $100.  <p></p>

<p>Previously, the Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210035/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/01/looking_at_what.php">looked at what vehicles area Congressional members ride in</a> and Rangel said of his Cadillac deVille, &quot;I want them to feel that they are somebody and their congressman is somebody. And when they say, &#x2018;This is nice,&#x2019; it feels good.&quot;</p>
