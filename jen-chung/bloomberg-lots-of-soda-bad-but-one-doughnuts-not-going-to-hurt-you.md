<p>This morning, Mayor Bloomberg continued his media tour to tout <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062226/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/bloomberg_wants_to_ban_sugary_drink.php#photo-1">his ban of sugary drinks over 16 ounces.</a>  This morning, he appeared on the Today Show and host Matt Lauer tried to call him out on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062226/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/31/bloomberg_announces_soda_ban_today.php">his support of National Doughnut Day</a> and unveiling of one-foot-in-diameter doughnuts from Entenmann&apos;s.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062226/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/on-today-bloomberg-defends-his-anti-soda-plan/">Lauer said</a>, &quot;It sounds ridiculous,&quot; to which Bloomberg replied, &quot;C&#x2019;mon, it doesn&#x2019;t sound ridiculous. One doughnut&#x2019;s not going to hurt you. In moderation, most things are O.K.&quot;</p>

<p>Why isn&apos;t it okay to have soda in moderation, while we can shotgun Entenmann&apos;s doughnuts (and chocolate chip cookies, nom nom nom)?  Because people can&apos;t tell how much soda they are drinking, where as people will apparently know the difference between one and one hundred doughnuts!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062226/http://todayhealth.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/01/11994213-bloomberg-defends-soda-ban-plan-as-obesity-tonic?lite">He said</a>, &quot;All the studies show if the glass or the plate in front of you is smaller, you&#x2019;ll eat less... We&#x2019;re not banning you from getting the stuff. It&#x2019;s just if you want 32 ounces, the restaurant has to serve it in two glasses. That&#x2019;s not exactly taking away your freedoms. It&#x2019;s not something the Founding Fathers fought for... In the case of full-sugared drinks, in moderation it&#x2019;s fine, and all we&#x2019;re trying to do is to explain to people that if you drink a little bit less you will live longer.&quot;</p>

<p>The mayor also scoffed at people who didn&apos;t think the ban would work: &quot;Where did I hear this before? Wasn&#x2019;t it [that] smoking wasn&#x2019;t going to work? Today it&#x2019;s one of the best things we&#x2019;ve ever done. Deaths from smoking dramatically coming down across the country, virtually every major city has adopted the smoking ordinances.&quot; A former smoker told the Today Show she was glad that Bloomberg was going after fatties:</p><blockquote>&quot;When I heard the news, I felt like Etta James - &apos;At Last.&apos; People have long applauded the mayor&apos;s decision to ban smoking in public. And, as a former smoker, I kept thinking: Why is smoking the only costly, life-threatening behavior being punished when obesity represents a health epidemic in this country? It&apos;s crazy that parents can buy their kids these drinks with hundreds of calories with zero regard for the health implications and the potential impact that can have.</blockquote>For what it&apos;s worth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062226/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/31/post_159.php#photo-1">it&apos;s definitely provoking debate</a>!<p></p>
