<p>Valerie Piro and other members of the varsity girls&apos; track team were headed to a meet in New Hampshire.  The van, driven by their coach, teacher Erin Taylor, crashed into a median and rolled over.  Piro was wearing a seatbelt, but was still ejected from the van; Taylor and another student were seriously injured.  It later emerged the trip was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427235659/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/17/was_stuy_girls.php">not authorized by the high school</a>, though Taylor told her boss and received parental consent.  </p>

<p>Piro, now heading into her senior year at Stuyvesant, is confined to a wheelchair.  The News writes, &quot;Though Valerie remains optimistic about her recovery, the rehabilitation has been long and expensive - and her injuries could be permanent.&quot;  Her lawyer said the Ford 13-passenger van was dangerous, that Avis shouldn&apos;t have rented the car, and that the Department of Education should have been supervising Taylor.  </p>
