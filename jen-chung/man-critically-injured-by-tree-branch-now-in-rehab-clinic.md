According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011113244/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/09/24/2009-09-24_google_guy_hit_by_limb_is_in_rehab.html">Daily News sources</a>, he was moved from a Manhattan Hospital to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011113244/http://www.helenhayeshospital.org/">Helen Hayes Hospital</a> in West Haverstraw, NY earlier this month.</p>

<p>Blair-Goldensohn had been walking near West Drive and West 63th Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011113244/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/29/man_injured_by_falling_tree_branch.php">on July 29</a> when the pin oak tree&apos;s branch fell on his head. He went into cardiac arrest and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011113244/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/31/man_critically_injured_by_tree_bran.php">also had</a> &quot;a gash in his skull, [damage to] his upper vertebrae and... a partial lung collapse.&quot; </p>

<p>The 33-year-old Google engineer was in critical condition when he was moved to Helen Hayes, but now the News&apos; source says, &quot;He&apos;s getting better, but he&apos;s going to be there for a long time.&quot;  </p>
