And in the case of Trailways buses, well, the keys are waiting for you!<p></p>

<p>McCollum, who bragged he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054029/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/03/transit_thief_mccollum_stole_150_bu.php">stolen 150 buses</a>, took a Trailways bus last week after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054029/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/01/1_subway_superfan_mccollum_stole_a.php">finding the keys in the ignition</a>.  And for some reason, Trailways bus drivers didn&apos;t learn their lesson afterwards:  On Saturday, News reporter Mike Jaccarino<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054029/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/05/2010-09-05_untitled__2bus05m.html"> headed to the same Hoboken bus depot</a>, &quot;Amazingly, Trailways had left the keys in the ignition again. I got behind the wheel and started the engine, heard its growl and felt its rumble. I resisted the temptation to drive off, turned off the bus and slowly walked out as if nothing happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, reporter  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054029/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/06/2010-09-06_for_2nd_straight_day_news_finds_trailways_bus_with_key__boards_it_at_nj_depot_bu.html">Lore Croghan headed there for herself</a>:</p><blockquote>Sunday afternoon when I showed up, the depot gate was open wide. I walked right in.<p></p>

<p>I was plenty conspicuous, carrying a big leather-bound notebook and wearing a floor-length skirt that couldn&apos;t be mistaken for a bus driver&apos;s uniform. But there wasn&apos;t a living soul to notice me.</p>

<p>I spent 20 minutes taking a self-guided tour of the place. The rows of parked buses looked so eager to be off and rolling; it was a sunny afternoon, just right for a road trip.</p>

<p>In the middle of a lineup of Trailways, I found one bus I could make my own. Through its closed door, I saw a silvery key gleaming in the ignition. The passenger door opened with a flick of my wrist.</p>

<p>I stepped right in, no problem. It was mine for the taking.</p></blockquote><br>
Trailways had no comment for the Daily News.<p></p>
