PPP assistant director Dustin Ingalls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112802/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/donald_trump_support_surges_in_new_9ZkjmDaaoyLzjjJ8rGqEdO">told the Post</a>, &quot;He has more support than even we thought.&quot; But where he&apos;s getting all this love is no surprise: It&apos;s the birthers and Tea Partiers in the Granite State!<p></p>

<p>PPP says, &quot;The key to Trump&apos;s relatively strong showing? He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112802/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/donald_trump_loves_the_birthers_med.php">does well with birthers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112802/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/if_trump_were_prez_hed_make_hu_jint.php">Tea Partiers</a>, two groups he has seemed to actively court with his public comments of late. 42% of primary voters firmly say they do not believe Barack Obama was born in the United States to 35% who believe that he was and 23% who aren&apos;t sure. Trump leads Romney 22-21 with the birther crowd, but Romney holds the overall lead because he&apos;s up by a much wider margin with the folks who dismiss the birther theory.&quot; </p>

<p>As for favorability ratings, the poll says The Donald is viewed favorably by 41% while 43% view him unfavorably; Romney is 68% favorable/19% unfavorable, Rudy Giuliani is 62% favorable/22% and Ron Paul is 53% favorable/21%.</p>
