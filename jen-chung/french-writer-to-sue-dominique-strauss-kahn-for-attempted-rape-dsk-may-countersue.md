<p>As the sexual assault case against Dominque Strauss-Kahn seems to be faltering, due to concerns that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/30/report_authorities_suspect_dominiqu.php">accuser has been lying</a> to investigators (plus, there are the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/02/ny_post_dominique_strauss-kahns_acc.php"> more scurrilous</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/03/dsks_accuser_allegedly_turned_trick.php">rumors</a>), he may actually face a new set of charges in his native country:  Writer Tristane Banon, who has said in interviews that the former IMF head and leading Socialist politician of trying to rape her in 2002, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/tristane-banon-annonce-qu-elle-porte-plainte-contre-dsk-pour-tentative-de-viol_1009004.html">going to formally accuse him of rape</a>. However, his lawyers suggests that Strauss-Kahn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/world/europe/05france.html">may countersue for slander</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 2002, Banon interviewed Strauss-Kahn and met him an apartment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.businessinsider.com/dominique-strauss-kahn-attempted-rape-allegations-2011-5">According to an interview she gave</a>, Banon said they fought and he &quot;opened my bra, tried to open my jeans. ... It finished very badly.&quot; Banon was convinced not to press charges by her mother, Anne Mansouret, a Socialist Party official.</p>

<p>After allegations of Strauss-Kahn&apos;s assault on a NYC hotel maid this past May, Mansouret explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/world/europe/17banonbox.html?scp=1&amp;sq=tristane%20banon&amp;st=cse">what she told her daughter back then</a>, &quot;Listen, you know, if he had raped you, I wouldn&#x2019;t have any hesitation, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case. He sexually assaulted you, there wasn&#x2019;t any rape per se; so until the end of your life, you&#x2019;re going to have on your r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, you know, Tristane Banon is the girl who ... &apos;&quot; But now Mansouret realizes that probably wasn&apos;t a great idea and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/journalist-tristane-banon-makes-further-sexual-assault-allegation-against-dominique-strausskahn-2284995.html">wrote on her blog</a>, &quot;Now I regret having persuaded her not to bring charges. I carry a heavy responsibility. My daughter was in a bad way but it was awkward for reasons of family and friendship.&quot;</p>

<p>Banon&apos;s lawyer David Koubbi said that his client &quot;truly suffered what she accuses Mr. Strauss-Kahn of doing&quot; and said her case was &quot;extremely solid.&quot;  Unlike, perhaps, the case in NYC:  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/nyregion/soon-after-strauss-kahn-arrest-now-shaky-case-seemed-solid.html?_r=1">NY Times has a look at what happened</a> with the investigation and some of the issues they faced:</p><blockquote> &#x201C;Since he was getting on a plane, getting out of the nation, they grabbed him faster than sooner, because it would have looked bad if they let him out of the country and they couldn&#x2019;t get him back,&#x201D; said a law enforcement official with knowledge of the case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down as managing director of the International Monetary Fund after his arrest.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I guess, in a perfect world, they would not have had to arrest him right away,&#x201D; said the official, who insisted on anonymity because the case is continuing. &#x201C;They could have checked the evidence and everything. But I guess they figured they had to get him off the plane. It changed the circumstances quite a bit.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Of course all of this may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/world/europe/04france.html?ref=europe">sparking &quot;slumbering anti-Americanism&quot; in France</a>, too.<p></p>

<p>As it appears to face an uphill battle, the Manhattan DA&apos;s office appears to have started a PR offensive to explain why Strauss-Kahn still faces charges: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152014/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/03/2011-07-03_nothing_indicates_dominique_strausskahns_hotel_maid_accuser_was_targeting_him_sa.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">A source tells the Daily News</a> that the hotel maid was told the room was empty, &quot;Nothing has been raised to indicate that she was targeting him... There was a lot of reason to believe what she was telling up. There were other [hotel] staffers who independently corroborated her actions and motions that day.&quot; Also, there&apos;s all the DNA evidence found that could back up the maid&apos;s claims she was assaulted, &quot;It was rare to have so much corroboration on a sex crime.&quot;</p>
