---

	
										<p>An 85-year-old Greenpoint man played dead after a home invasion robber choked him, and now police are looking for three suspects.</p>

<p>The robbery took place on November 29th, at 1:50 p.m., in Pablo Roldan&apos;s apartment on Huron Street near Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014918/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/12/15/greenpoint-robbery-suspects/">Roldan told WCBS 2</a> that he was sleeping when he heard a knock at the door. He opened the door, and the NYPD says, &quot;three unknown individuals barged into the apartment... Once inside, one of the individuals held the victim by the neck and asked &apos;where is the money.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Roldan said he told them &quot;What money? I got no money. I got some money, but it&#x2019;s in the bank,&quot; as the other two suspects ransacked his apartment. </p>
