<p>A member of the &quot;Mermaid Boys&quot; gang has been arrested for allegedly killing two men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011902/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/04/two_men_fatally_shot_at_19th_st_bro.php">who were sitting in an SUV in Manhattan</a> over five years ago. </p>

<p>On October 4, 2010, just before 4 a.m., police officers found Rashawn Washington, 26, and Terrance Serrano, 22, both shot in the head inside an SUV parked on 19th Street between Broadway and 19th Street. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. Surveillance footage showed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011902/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/05/flatiron_murder_victims_were_witnes.php">gunmen followed the victims from the Roam nightclub</a> on East 19th Street to the car. </p>

<p>Frank Smith, 31, was arrested and charged with two counts of murder. He is allegedly a member of the &quot;Mermaid Boys,&quot; which is also known as &#x201C;Rival Impact,&#x201D; &#x201C;R.I.,&#x201D; &#x201C;Mermaids&quot; and &#x201C;33rd Street Crew.&quot; Washington and Serrano were both in a rival gang, &quot;Thirty-O&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011902/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-man-33-charged-murder-2010-manhattan-shooting-article-1.2704036">the Daily News reports</a> that Smith &quot;believed they were involved in the drive-by shooting of a member of his crew one year earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said, &quot;We are hopeful that today&#x2019;s indictment is a milestone along the path to this individual&#x2019;s conviction. The defendant, as alleged, terrorized Coney Island and other parts of the City by selling illegal narcotics, murdering members of a rival gang and using violence and intimidation to achieve his criminal objectives.&quot; </p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Robert Capers stated, &quot;As alleged, for years the defendant and other members of this violent Brooklyn street gang have plagued neighborhoods throughout Coney Island and elsewhere with drugs and violence. Today&#x2019;s charges send the clear message that violence by and among street gangs will not be tolerated. We will use all available resources to hold accountable those who endanger the lives and well-being of the residents of our communities.&quot;</p>
