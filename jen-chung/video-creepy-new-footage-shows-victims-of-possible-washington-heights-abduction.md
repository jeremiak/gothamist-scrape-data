<p>Yesterday, police released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104938/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/30/video_possible_abduction_in_washing.php">surveillance footage of two people and a minivan</a> involved in a possible abduction in upper Manhattan on Friday. Now the NYPD has released more footage, showing the possible victims.</p>

<p>The video shows a man and a woman walking West on 173rd Street, turning onto Haven Avenue in Washington Heights, on Friday just before 7 p.m. Then, after they leave the frame, you see two men running in their direction, as well as a minivan apparently involved in the chase (going the north on Haven Avenue, which is one-way going south). There&apos;s a housing facility for Columbia dental students at the intersection.</p>

<p>The female victim is seen wearing a long white coat and dark pants, while the male victim is wearing all dark clothing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104938/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/brazen_street_kidnap_O1zYoJc0SfZuYMl4ci4SeN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">According to the Post</a>, the woman had been &quot;lugging two heavy bags &apos;strapped around her like a bandolier&apos;&quot; and &quot;Moments before the unidentified couple vanished, they were seen &apos;looking behind them and acting nervous,&apos; sources said.&quot; Two girls who heard the screaming and saw the couple get dragged into the minivan called the police.</p>

<p>The Post&apos;s source added, &quot;There&#x2019;s something in those bags,&quot; and suspect there may have been drugs, &quot;It&#x2019;s very possible the abductors took their stuff and dropped them off nearby and [they] took the loss... Or we have two bodies somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>A woman who saw the minivan before the kidnapping say one of the occupants was wearing a ski mask that &quot;covered everything except his eyes&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104938/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/brazen_street_kidnap_O1zYoJc0SfZuYMl4ci4SeN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post</a> that it looked like he was trying to &apos;spy on someone... He was sneaking over to the park and looked over the wall and across the street.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
