</div></div>					<p>On the afternoon of August 14, 2003, a massive power outage seized the East Coast and Midwest of the United States, as well as Ontario, Canada. Many New Yorkers&apos; first fear was that it was terrorism, but the blackout actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://gothamist.com/2003/11/20/blackout_report_blame_ohio.php">started in Ohio</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://science.time.com/2013/08/13/ten-years-after-the-great-blackout-the-grid-is-stronger-but-vulnerable-to-extreme-weather/">According to Time</a>, &quot;As power lines became overloaded, they began sagging because of the high temperatures, until one line south of Cleveland touched an overgrown tree limb and short-circuited. What followed was a cascade of disaster due to a mix of human error and equipment failure, until by 4:10 p.m. E.T. that day more than 50 million people had lost power in parts of Ontario and eight U.S. states.&quot;</p>

<p>Power did come back about 30 hours later, during which time many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/15/the_new_york_city_blackout_edition.php">New York residents</a> were trapped in elevators and subways, unable to make cell phone calls (because lines were overloaded), walked home or stayed with friends, finished out whatever was in their or restaurants&apos; fridges and maybe got a little busy, too (though there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://gothamist.com/2004/05/18/blackout_baby_boom.php">wasn&apos;t a blackout baby boom</a>). Of course, it&apos;s unclear if our power grid is any more reliable today, which is why you keep your home fully stocked with flashlights, bottled water, and a crank radio, right?</p>

<p>These days, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://www.npr.org/2013/08/11/210700217/how-a-massive-power-outage-sent-people-dancing-in-the-street">look back at the blackout with fondness</a> (and marvel at how Gothamist was such a simpler site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/14/blackout_on_east_coast.php">back in the day</a>)&#x2014;impromptu BBQ parties in the streets, making new friends by giving them a ride&#x2014;and we still love this quote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/18/throwing_out_blackout_food.php">Brooklyn woman gave the Daily News</a>, as she was throwing out 40 pounds of raw meat and potato salad, &quot;I guess if I wanted to kill off my family, I could serve them this, but I kind of like the mopes.&quot;</p>

<p>Where were you doing the blackout? Tell us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710172410/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/18/where_were_you_during_the_blackout_talking_about_power.php">your stories below</a>!</p>
