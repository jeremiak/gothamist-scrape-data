Kids shouted things like &quot;furburger,&quot; &quot;blow job,&quot; and &quot;schmeckle,&quot; and wrote them down in their notebooks. Cue the outraged parents and the reactionary Department of Education, which banished Kramer to a rubber room.  A judge ruled against the city&apos;s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, noting there are no actual rules prohibiting &quot;vulgarisms&quot; during sex-ex classes. Kramer will be back at IS 72 this fall.  </p>
