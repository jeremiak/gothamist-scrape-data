Curtis Granderson had three RBIs and Brett Gardner scored three times.  Plus, Lance Berkman, Ramiro Pena and Eduardo Nunez each had two hits. The Daily News notes, &quot;Rookie Ivan Nova had his least effective performance of his three starts, giving up three runs in 4 2/3 innings before being replaced by Boone Logan in the fifth with the tying runs on base. Logan, Dave Robertson, Kerry Wood and Mariano Rivera combined for 4 1/3 scoreless innings to finish the game, with Wood (3-4) earning the win after retiring all five batters he faced.&quot;</li>
