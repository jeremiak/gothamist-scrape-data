<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014845/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/07/trump_time_bigly_person.php">incurring the President-elect&apos;s ire</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014845/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/04/again_snl_mocks_donald_trumps_tweet.php">last week&apos;s first sketch</a>, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> continued to poke at the orange bear with another Trump-focused cold open. This time, Alec Baldwin got a break and another Emmy-winner got a turn: Bryan Cranston appeared, because if the Trump White House is gonna have someone head the Drug Enforcement Agency, it&apos;s gotta be Walter White  from <em>Breaking Bad</em>!</p>

<p>CNN&apos;s Jake Tapper, played by Beck Bennett, asks Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon) about the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014845/http://laist.com/2016/12/08/andy_puzder.php"> various nominees fo</a>r administration positions, &quot;It&apos;s almost like Mr. Trump appoints these people specifically to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014845/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/07/donald_trump_picks_man_who_wants_to.php">undermine the very agencies</a> they head. Are these bad picks?&quot; To which Conway says, &quot;No, they are not bad. They are alt-good.&quot; </p>

<p>Then Tapper excitedly announces that Trump&apos;s nominee for the DEA is a &quot;high school science teacher from New Mexico&quot;&#x2014;Walter White. Conway explains that Steve Bannon recommended White for the job, to which White says, &quot;We&apos;ve had <em>some times</em>.&quot; Also, Bannon found White in Breitbart.com&apos;s comments section.</p>

<p>White likes Trump, because &quot;he acts first, and then asks questions later. I also like that wall he wants to build. Nothing comes in from Mexico, which means a lot less competition for the rest of us.&quot; They also share similar views: &quot;It&#x2019;s time to make America cook again. We want to fill this nation with red, white, and a whole lot of blue.&quot;</p>
