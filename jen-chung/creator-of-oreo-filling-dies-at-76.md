<p>On Saturday, May 12, Sam J. Porcello <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120521231954/http://obits.nj.com/obituaries/starledger/obituary.aspx?pid=157635826">passed away in NJ</a>.  You may not know Porcello&apos;s name, but you are likely familiar with what he worked on: He was a principal scientist at Nabisco, &quot;where he was known as &quot;Mr. Oreo.&quot; <strong>He holds five patents relating to Oreo and developed the current Oreo filling and chocolate-covered Oreos</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120521231954/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/celebrating-life-sam-porcello-man-developed-filling-oreos-article-1.1080508?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News&apos; David Hinckley noticed the obituary</a> last Monday and was struck, &quot;Every so often, there will be an obituary that makes you gently murmur, &apos;Whoa,&apos;&quot; and found out more: </p><blockquote>&#x201C;My father was proud of what he did,&#x201D; says Curtis Porcello, one of his two sons. &#x201C;He&#x2019;d come home and tell us all what he was working on.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>...He could figure out how to translate a good idea into a viable product, and yes, sometimes he would bring his experiments home to see how the family responded.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We always had a lot of sweets around,&#x201D; Curtis recalls, though curiously, Sam himself wasn&#x2019;t a voracious Oreo man. When he did eat them, it was straight, no dunking. </p>

<p>He traveled the world looking for ingredients he could use at Nabisco. It was a trade show in Europe where he found the chocolate that worked as an Oreo coating.</p></blockquote>Porcello retired in 1993.  We suspect he would have agreed that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120521231954/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/taste-testing_the_new_triple_double.php">Triple Double Oreo should have had triple the filling</a>.<br>
