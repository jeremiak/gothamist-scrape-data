The female officer and her partner had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320034542/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/breaks-leg-suspect-pushes-stairs-article-1.1290404?localLinksEnabled=false">spotted Jose Pages in the lobby</a> of a building in the Ravenswood Houses in Quenens and chased him up stairs when Pages allegedly pushed the officer. The officer was taken to the hospital with a broken leg.<p></p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that Pages&apos; sister had taken out a restraining order against him. The police had responded to a call about a dispute, but when they got there, the 20-year-old wasn&apos;t present. As they were leaving, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320034542/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/astoria-queens-ravenswood-houses-jose-pages-cop-stairwell-198560561.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;Police said they received a call from inside the apartment shortly after leaving, and the person who they spoke with said Pages was at the apartment. Once they returned, Pages fled, resulting in a police chase that lasted 25 minutes.&quot; </p>

<p>After the scuffle with the cops, Pages fled again, forcing more cops plus a K9 to search for him&#x2014;he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320034542/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/cop_breaks_leg_in_bust_ZN412PVmuXHtB8tLyeRBrI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">found on a nearby roof</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320034542/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/breaks-leg-suspect-pushes-stairs-article-1.1290404">Pages&apos; stepfather defended him</a>, &quot;Jose didn&#x2019;t throw the cop down the stairs. Maybe she tried to grab him and the cop fell back. He&#x2019;s a good kid, not a bad kid.&quot; And when Pages was taken into custody, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320034542/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9029554">crowd chanted</a>, &quot;Jose, Jose, Jose. You&apos;re a hero Jose.&quot;</p>
