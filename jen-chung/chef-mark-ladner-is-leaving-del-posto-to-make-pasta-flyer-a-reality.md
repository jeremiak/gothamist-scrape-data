<p>Two years ago, Del Posto chef Mark Ladner opened up a pop-up version of his gluten-free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008103842/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/18/del_posto_gluten_free_pop.php#photo-2">pasta &quot;fast casual&quot; concept, Pasta Flyer</a>. Now, he&apos;s going to leave the four-star restaurant to focus on a Pasta Flyer restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008103842/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/dining/del-posto-mark-ladner-pasta-flyer.html">The NY Times reported</a> yesterday Ladner, who has been with Del Posto since its opening in 2005, will depart in January and &quot;is diving into the world of upscale fast food with a quick-serve restaurant, Pasta Flyer, that he hopes to develop into a chain.&quot; The first location of the potential chain will open in Greenwich Village.</p>

<p>The new restaurant will be at 510 6th Avenue, between 13th and 14th Streets. Ladner originally developed Pasta Flyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008103842/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pastaflyer/pasta-flyer-italian-cuisine-japanese-style-andglut">with the help of Kickstarter</a>: &quot;Pasta Flyer delivers soulful, traditional Italian pasta to a hungry customer&#x2019;s belly as fast as a bowl of Japanese ramen, for under $10.&quot;</p>

<p>The Times article points out that while fast casual concepts are springing up faster and faster, with more name chefs jumping in, &quot;no one has yet cracked the complex code of how to produce a good bowl of pasta &#x2014; reasonably al dente, appropriately sauced, made with high-quality ingredients &#x2014; in the same amount of time it takes a Chipotle outlet to roll a burrito or a Sweetgreen branch to toss a salad, and for about the same price.&quot;</p><blockquote>Mr. Ladner said he has worked out a method of parcooking pasta &#x2014; he plans to use Felicetti, a top-quality brand of dried pasta from a small producer in the Dolomites &#x2014; so that it can be reheated and ready to sauce in about 15 seconds.</blockquote>It&apos;s unclear if the upcoming Pasta Flyer will be strictly gluten-free; the Times article didn&apos;t mention it, and it would make sense to offer both versions of pasta. <p></p>

<p>When we tried a few gluten-free Pasta Flyer dishes two years ago&#x2014;pesto spirals, tubes with marinara and meatballs and brown rice lasagna&#x2014; we wrote, &quot;[T]he pasta did not seem gummy, like some gluten-free pastas tend to be&#x2014;the tubes were hearty and lasagna was rich. The pesto spirals were a particular revelation, firm and flavorful.&quot;</p>

<p>Melissa Rodriguez, Ladner&apos;s sous chef at Del Posto, will become the restaurant&apos;s executive chef. The Times says, &quot;She will be the first woman to head the kitchen of a New York City restaurant that has received four stars from The New York Times.&quot;</p>
