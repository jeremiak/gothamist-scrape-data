<p>After Texas officials announced that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/15/ebola_outbreak_dallas.php">second Dallas health care worker had Ebola</a>, it turned out that the nurse, Amber Vinson, had flown to Cleveland with a temperature of 99.5 degrees. The CDC&apos;s director said she shouldn&apos;t have flown, but it turns out no one stopped her from flying either.</p>

<p>Vinson, 29, treated Eric Thomas Duncan, the Liberian man who was diagnosed with Ebola last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/10/amber_joy_vincent_drew_blood_i.html">changing his catheters and drawing his blood</a>. Duncan, who was initially given antibiotics and sent home, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://sfist.com/2014/10/08/dallas_ebola_patient_has_died_bay_a.php">died last week</a>, and health care workers in contact with him were told to self-monitor their conditions.</p>

<p>CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said, &quot;The CDC guidance in this setting outlines the need for what is called controlled movement. That can include a charter plane, a car, but it does not include public transport. We will from this moment forward ensure that no other individual who is being monitored for exposure undergoes travel in any way other than controlled movement.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/ebola-outbreak-texas.html">However, as the NY Times reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Hours after Dr. Frieden spoke, a federal health official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly, said that because it was thought that Ms. Vinson&#x2019;s protective gear would have kept her safe and because her temperature was only mildly elevated, she fell into a category not covered by C.D.C. guidelines.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think we actually said she could fly, but they didn&#x2019;t tell her she couldn&#x2019;t fly,&#x201D; the official said. He said the error was on the part of the C.D.C., not the nurse. &#x201C;She called us,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I really think this one is on us.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Vinson headed to Cleveland to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20141015-second-dallas-nurse-stricken-is-planning-a-wedding.ece">prepare for her upcoming wedding</a> before the first health care worker, Nina Pham, was diagnosed with Ebola. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/10/dallas_ebola_patient_should_no.html#incart_most-read">According to The Plain Dealer</a>, Vinson &quot;had a low-grade fever of 99 degrees while on a Frontier flight from Cleveland to Dallas on Oct. 13th, which is below the threshold of 100.5 degrees which may indicate that a patient is contagious or becoming ill with Ebola, Frieden said. She did not have any nausea, vomiting or other symptoms that would have put others on the flight at risk.&quot; Now Frontier is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.newsweek.com/frontier-airlines-wants-speak-passengers-second-ebola-nurses-flight-277714">tracking down passengers from that flight</a>.<p></p>

<p>Vinson was flown to Atlanta, to be treated at Emory University&apos;s hospital; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.ajc.com/news/news/texas-ebola-patient-headed-to-emory/nhjsK/">she was able to walk on her own from the plane to an ambulance</a>. However, the sight of of Vinson being taken to a private plane to fly to Atlanta freaked out some people (like Michelle Malkin):</p>

<p>But it turns out there&apos;s a method to the Hazmat suit-less madness: It was a medical protocol supervisor, who was supposed to be without any protection. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/clipboard-man-hazmat-suit/story?id=26235850">A spokesperson for the plane told ABC News</a>, &quot;Our medical professionals in the biohazard suits have limited vision and mobility and it is the protocol supervisor&#x2019;s job to watch each person carefully and give them verbal directions to insure no close contact protocols are violated... There is absolutely no problem with this and in fact insures an even higher level of safety for all involved.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html">Ebola cannot be transmitted through the air or water</a>, but that hasn&apos;t stopped some travelers from creating their own DIY Hazmat suits:</p>

<p>In the meantime, the head of Texas Presbyterian Hospital, where Duncan was treated and Pham and Vinson work, has apologized for the response to Ebola. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/us/ebola-dallas-texas-presbyterian-hospital-apology.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpSum&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">Dr. Daniel Varga said</a>, &quot;Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team we made mistakes... We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, the hospital says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2014/10/presbyterian-followed-cdc-guidelines-when-treating-nations-first-ebola-patient-officials-said-thursday.html/">it followed CDC guidelines</a>&#x2014;which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012633/http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20141015-nurses-hospitals-ebola-response-put-workers-patients-at-risk.ece">disputed by the nurses&apos; union, which claims</a>, &quot;Nurses suited up with whatever protective gear was at hand &#x2014; gowns that were not impermeable to fluids, three pairs of gloves that were not taped at the wrists and surgical masks. They were given the option of so-called N-95 respirators and face shields, though some were told by supervisors that the shields were not necessary. The patchwork get-up left portions of their necks exposed, so they used medical tape &#x2014; which is not impermeable &#x2014; around their necks. They then took their gear off by themselves, without the typical &apos;buddy&apos; system used in special bio-containment units set up to handle Ebola.&quot;</p>
