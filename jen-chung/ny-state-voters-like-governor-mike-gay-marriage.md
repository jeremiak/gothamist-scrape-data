Out of 1,388 NY voters, 30% said they like the idea of Governor Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Current Governor David Paterson was in third place, with 23%--former mayor Rudy Giuliani was in second with 26% (15% of respondents picked Attorney General Andrew Cuomo)!  Given that the margin of error is +/- 2.6 percentage points, imagine an election with Paterson, Giuliani and Bloomberg all running against each other!  </p>

<p>Respondents were also asked about gay marriage, and the findings were:</p><ul><li>42 percent say same-sex couples should be allowed to legally marry<br>
</li><li> 31 percent say these couples should be allowed to form civil unions, but not marry<br>
</li><li>21 percent say there should be no legal recognition of same-sex unions. </li></ul>Another interesting stat: 63% of Republicans support either same-sex marriage or civil unions (80% of Democrats and 75% of independent voters support either).<p></p>
