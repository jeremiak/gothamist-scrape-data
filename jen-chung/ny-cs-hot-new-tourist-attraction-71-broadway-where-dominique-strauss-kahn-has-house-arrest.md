                            <p>Sure, disgraced (and guilty until proven innocent) ex-IMF head <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiquestrausskahn">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/21/imf.php">may have some supporters</a> at the upscale rental where he&apos;s living out his house arrest existence. But we&apos;re betting the rest of the residents at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/21/dominique_strauss-kahn_now_under_ho.php">71 Broadway</a> are more than a little annoyed that hordes of media are camped outside...and that tourists are making this one of their lower Manhattan stops&#x2014;perhaps after Ground Zero and Century 21 and before buying counterfeit bags in Chinatown.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/strauss-kahns-new-apartment-now-a-tourist-attraction-20110521-ncx">According to the AFP</a>, a tour guide on a double-decker bus was heard saying on the microphone, &quot;<strong>On your right is the building where the French guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/imf_head_to_plead_not_guilty_to_sex.php">accused of attempted rape</a> is staying</strong>.&quot; Next up, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/that_sidewalk_line_dividing_tourist.php">Tourist Lane</a>?</p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn was originally going to serve his house arrest at an much more luxurious Upper East Side building, but when the residents caught wind (thanks to news crews) of who their new neighbor might be, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/20/dominique_strauss-kahn_has_no_place.php">they freaked out</a> and Strauss-Kahn&apos;s team was left scrambling for a place to make that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/dsk_bail_among_the_largest_in_ny_JY8kFHvtPulD8ESUB9qLqI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">$6 million bail</a> worth it.  The building manager at 71 Broadway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/05/21/building-manager-looks-to-reassure-71-broadways-residents/?mod=WSJBlog">sent this memo to residents</a>: </p><blockquote>To: Residents of 71 Broadway<p></p>

<p>We want to inform you that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former IMF Director who is under indictment in New York, is currently staying at 71 Broadway. Mr. Strauss-Kahn is here as a guest of a leaseholder. We were not consulted before the leaseholder invited him in, but we have been assured that he will only be staying here until early next week.</p>

<p>We will have an increased staff presence in the building this weekend to ensure that the media, and the curious, are kept out of the building.</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.</p>

<p>General Manager</p>

<p>71 Broadway</p></blockquote>Prosecutors had argued that having Strauss-Kahn, a leading French politician thought to be a frontrunner to challenge President Nicolas Sarkozy, in lower Manhattan<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307100920/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/21/dominique_strauss-kahn_now_under_ho.php"> was a terrible idea</a> and a stress to the NYPD, so it&apos;ll be interesting to see where he&apos;s moved next (Columbia didn&apos;t want him staying with his daughter, a graduate student in graduate housing, either!).  <p></p>
