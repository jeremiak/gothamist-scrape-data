The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182916/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/13partner.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times has a feature</a> on how the coveted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182916/http://gothamist.com/tags/goldmansachs">Goldman Sachs</a> partnership can also be taken away from executives.&quot; And, people, it&apos;s serious: A former senior managing director at Bear Stearns and visiting professor at Adelphi, Michael Driscoll, tells the Times, &quot;Being partner at Goldman is the pinnacle of Wall Street; if you make it, you are considered set for life. <strong>To have it taken away would just be devastating to an individual. There is just no other word for it.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Sources says dozens of partners could be demoted (really &quot;de-partnered&quot;) &quot;to make way for new blood.&quot;  According to the Times, &quot;Goldman weeds out partners because it is worried that if the partnership becomes too big, it will lose its cachet and become less of a motivational tool for talented up-and-comers, people involved in the process say. If too many people stay, it creates a logjam.&quot;  And there&apos;s been a logjam these recent years, because of the financial crisis.</p>

<p>De-partnered executives keep their $200,000 salaries, but their bonuses can dwindle.  One former executive said, &quot;I have friends who have been de-partnered who are still there, and most people inside think they are still partners. It is something you just don&#x2019;t talk about.&quot;</p>
