<p>A month after an NYPD officer administered a prohibited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014311/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">chokehold that killed a Staten Island man</a>, District Attorney Daniel Donovan announced that he would summon a grand jury.</p>

<p>Eric Garner, 43, died while police officers tried to arrest him (cops claim he was selling untaxed cigarettes while witnesses say he was just breaking up a fight), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014311/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">a shocking video</a> shows Garner arguing with the police: &quot;I was just minding my own business. Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I&#x2019;m tired of it. It stops today!&quot; When a number of cops try to subdue him, Garner, who weighed 400 pounds, is seen swatting their hands away and saying, &quot;Don&#x2019;t touch me, please.&quot;</p>

<p>As Officer Daniel Pantaleo puts him in a chokehold, other officers struggle to pull him to the ground and get his arms behind his back. Garner, an asthmatic, can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe.&quot; He was later pronounced dead at Richmond University Medical Center, and the first police report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014311/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/chokehold_what_chokehold.php">didn&apos;t even mention the chokehold</a>. Pantaleo, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014311/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/21/cop_who_put_eric_garner_in_chokehol.php">sued twice for civil rights violations</a>, was stripped of his badge and gun while Officer Justin Damico was placed on modified duty. The ME&apos;s office eventually concluded that Garner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014311/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/eric_garners_death_ruled_a_homicide.php">death was a homicide</a>.</p>

<p>Donovan said, &quot;[A]fter a careful review of the recent findings of the Medical Examiner regarding the cause and manner of Mr. Garner&apos;s death, I have determined that it is appropriate to present evidence regarding the circumstances of his death to a Richmond County Grand Jury... Mindful of the solemn oath to enforce the law that I took when I was first sworn into office as District Attorney in January of 2004, and with a full appreciation that no person is above the law, nor beneath its protection, I assure the public that I am committed to conducting a fair, thorough, and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner&apos;s death, and that I will go wherever the evidence takes me, without fear or favor.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014311/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/district_attorney_will_convene.html#incart_breaking">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;Suspects who have not yet been arrested are permitted to testify before the grand jury, but because the proceedings are kept secret, they may not be aware of the proceedings unless notified by prosecutors.&quot; More analysis from the Advance:</p><blockquote>While Pantaleo or any other suspect could have been arrested prior to the impaneling of a grand jury, lawyers told the Advance they doubted an arrest would occur prior to a grand jury presentation.<p></p>

<p>That&apos;s because a felony arrest case must be put to the panel within six days if the defendant doesn&apos;t make bail, which would put an enormous amount of pressure on the DA to lay out the evidence under significant time constraints.</p>

<p>Waiting to make an arrest until after the grand jury is presented with the evidence buys prosecutors more time. &quot;They&apos;ll try to make as complete a presentation as possible,&quot; local criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor Joseph Sorrentino told the Advance earlier this month.</p></blockquote>This Saturday, the Rev. Al Sharpton is leading a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014311/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/09/sharpton_will_relocate_verrazano_br.php">march in Staten Island to protest Garner&apos;s death</a>.<p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s D.A. Donovan&apos;s full statement:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Based upon the investigation that my office has conducted to date regarding the July 17, 2014, death of Eric Garner, and after a careful review of the recent findings of the Medical Examiner regarding the cause and manner of Mr. Garner&apos;s death, I have determined that it is appropriate to present evidence regarding the circumstances of his death to a Richmond County Grand Jury. Yesterday, the Court granted my application for the impaneling of an additional Grand Jury and I intend to utilize that Grand Jury sometime next month to begin presenting evidence on this matter.<br>
 <br>
&#x201C;Mindful of the solemn oath to enforce the law that I took when I was first sworn into office as District Attorney in January of 2004, and with a full appreciation that no person is above the law, nor beneath its protection, I assure the public that I am committed to conducting a fair, thorough, and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner&apos;s death, and that I will go wherever the evidence takes me, without fear or favor.<br>
 <br>
&#x201C;Notwithstanding the keen public interest in this matter, to maintain the integrity of this investigation, and in furtherance of my obligations under Penal Law &#xA7;215.70 to maintain the secrecy of Grand Jury proceedings, I will make no comment now, or during the period of time that the Grand Jury is convened, regarding the days that the Grand Jury will be sitting; who may be called as a witness before the Grand Jury; what any witness has or will testify about before the Grand Jury; when the Grand Jury will conclude its investigation; what criminal charges will be considered by the Grand Jury, or against whom the Grand Jury might consider any such criminal charges.&#x201D;</blockquote><br>
