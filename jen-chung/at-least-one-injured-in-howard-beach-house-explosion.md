	<p>At about 2 p.m., a house on 84th Street between 162nd and 163rd Avenues exploded. The FDNY says that one woman was taken to the hospital while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233908/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/29/house-explodes-in-howard-beach/">WCBS 2 reports two were injured</a>, &quot;The top of the home appears to have been completely demolished, leaving a giant crater in the center of the structure.&quot;</p>

<p>Firefighters are currently battling a two-alarm fire; there is also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233908/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/qns-house-collapse-gas-explosion-article-1.1357653?localLinksEnabled=false">possible wall collapse</a>. The inferno is apparently being fed by gas.</p>
