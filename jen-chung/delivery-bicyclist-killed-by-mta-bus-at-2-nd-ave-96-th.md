										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_delbike.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110056im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_delbike.jpg" width="365" height="229" class="image-left"> </span>A MTA bus and a delivery man on a bicycle collided on the Upper East Side today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110056/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/?ArID=136251">leaving the bicyclist dead</a> at the scene.  The incident occurred at Second Avenue and East 96th Street just before 4:30 p.m.; the bus driver kept going, apparently not realizing someone was hit, and the authorities are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110056/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/police-mta-bus-kills-bicyclist-on-upper-east-side-20110325-akd">still seeking the bus</a>.  </p>

<p>The bus, an express bus, was headed southbound when it hit the bicyclist, who was going east on 96th Street.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110056/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/delivery_bicyclist_killed_in_collision_Dnbk6UGMyq877uErLkUKFO#ixzz1HeczaRMU">According to the Post</a>, residents and area businesses think the intersection is terrible.  One said, &quot;The conditions of the streets are a mess. It&#x2019;s not surprising he got hit today&quot; while another said, &quot;I see accidents happen here all the time. This one just happened to slip by because you didn&#x2019;t hear a loud bang or a crash... Everything went on as normal until people found him on the street and started calling 911.&#x201D;</p>
