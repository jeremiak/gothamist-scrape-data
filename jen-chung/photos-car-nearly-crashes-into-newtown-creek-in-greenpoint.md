	<p>Earlier this morning around 6:30 a.m., a car collided through a guardrail at the northern end of Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, nearly ending up in Newtown Creek. Yvette Hellin, who lives nearby, was inside her house and heard a loud crash, but thought the noise was coming from inside her building. But when she went to walk her dog a few minutes later, she realized it was actually a crazy crash&#x2014;the car was essentially overturned and partially through the guardrail, over the embankment.</p>

<p>Hellin says that the &quot;driver was walking around dazed and other people said his girlfriend was inside the ambulance with head injuries.&quot; She noted that many people take walks because there&apos;s a green space at the northern end of Manhattan Avenue, &quot;I could easily have been hit by that vehicle had I left studio slightly earlier to walk dog.&quot; In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092557/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1205+manhattan+avenue+brooklyn+ny&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89c2593c58e8e9e5:0xc4cdcb6e89324427,1205+Manhattan+Ave,+Brooklyn,+NY+11222&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=Ioi0Uc-wD-rA4APjh4DwDA&amp;ved=0CC4Q8gEwAA">Google Maps Street VIew shows</a> a person walking a dog right there.</p>

<p>Hellin added that lately she&apos;s seen &quot;remnants of several other wrecks and also witnessed some very erratic driving on the BQE at 5 :10 am. Please drive safely people!!&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY said that situation was still ongoing (we&apos;ll check in later) while the NYPD&apos;s press office didn&apos;t have information because it was a &quot;non-fatal&quot; collision. </p>
