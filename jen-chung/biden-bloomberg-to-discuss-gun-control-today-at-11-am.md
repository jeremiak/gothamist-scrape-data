<p>Vice President Biden is in town to speak at the 2013 Irish America Hall of Fame luncheon at the JW Marriott Essex House hotel today, but before that, he&apos;ll be meeting with Mayor Bloomberg and having a press conference. According to his schedule, &quot;Vice President Biden will join New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at City Hall to discuss the importance of passing commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence.&quot; Bloomberg&apos;s announcement says they&apos;ll be joined by &quot;Families from Newtown, Connecticut to Discuss the Need for Common-Sense Federal Gun Laws.&quot;</p>

He said Mr. Bloomberg was &apos;committed to this issue.&apos;&quot; So committed that he&apos;s donated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401071400/http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/michael-bloomberg-gave-2-million-to-his-anti-guns-group-89150.html">about $2 million to his anti-guns group</a>.</p>
