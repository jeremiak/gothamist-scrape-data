<p>Running after kids while in Jimmy Choos? Pancake batter on a Prada jacket? The lines between Carrie Bradshaw and Sarah Jessica Parker blur in the new movie, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145147/http://howshedoesitmovie.com/">I Don&apos;t Know How She Does It</a></em>, which opens today and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145147/http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Know-How-She-Does/dp/0375414053">based on a British novel</a> about a working mother who tries to do it all/have it all and not go insane. Oh, and in the movie, Parker&apos;s character Kate Reddy is married to Greg Kinnear (Aidan?, flirts with Pierce Brosnan (Mr. Big?), is best friends with Christina Hendricks (Miranda/Samantha/Charlotte?), has a work rival in Seth Meyers (someone mean, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145147/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michiko-kakutani-you-know-when-youve-been-kakutanied-497374.html">Michiko Kakutani</a>, maybe?).  </p>

<p>Female critics are mostly down on the adaptation directed by Douglas McGrath. (Okay, the men are too&#x2014;it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145147/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_dont_know_how_she_does_it/">19% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes</a>.)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145147/http://www.slate.com/id/2303929/">Slate&apos;s Dana Stevens says</a>, &quot;Like Carrie Bradshaw, Parker&apos;s dithering Sex and the City protagonist, Kate has a way of taking up all the air in the room and getting applauded for it. Seriously, has it occurred to this woman that she&apos;s losing credibility at work not because she&apos;s a mother but because she&apos;s a chronic over-apologizer with a persecution complex?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145147/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20518760,00.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+entertainmentweekly%2Fmovies%2Freviews+%28Entertainment+Weekly%2FEW.com%27s%3A+Movie+Reviews%29">Entertainment Weekly&apos;s Lisa Schwarzbaum</a> calls it a &quot;bogus chick flick,&quot; grades it a D+ and adds, an &quot;insurmountable problem is the difference between Parker&apos;s performance as a fortysomething banker, wife, and mother musing (in voice-over) at her computer and her previous performance as a single, thirtysomething girl-about-town in Sex and the City: There is none. I don&apos;t know why she does.&quot;</p>

She is also played by Sarah Jessica Parker, a performer so aggressively determined to make us like her that no work-life conflicts in the film ever gain any traction; we&apos;re too distracted by the actress&apos;s manic tics (the head tilts, the popping of the wounded-deer eyes) to&quot; notice any real adversity.&quot; The Daily News&apos; Elizabeth Weitzman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145147/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2011/09/16/2011-09-16_i_dont_know_how_she_does_it_review_sarah_jessica_parker_is_married__harried_in_r.html?r=entertainment/movies">actually kinda liked it</a>, &quot;Unfortunately, Parker infuses Kate - a nonstop mess who&apos;s constantly apologizing - with such frantic insecurity that she comes across more as an anxious twentysomething than a 40-year-old mother. It&apos;s Hendricks who provides the welcome maturity, and I couldn&apos;t help wishing she had been given the lead.&quot;</p>
