<p>Earlier this year, Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926153221/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/01/cuomo_signs_tougher_texting-while-d.php">signed a tougher texting-while-driving law</a>, emphasizing, &quot;It&#x2019;s not okay for people to do this. It&#x2019;s not fun; it&#x2019;s not cool. If you&#x2019;re in a car with someone whose talking the cell phone or texting, you have to let them know it&#x2019;s not okay.&quot; Now, after a summer crackdown resulting in 21,580 tickets (last year, only 5,208 were written), Cuomo announced 91 new &quot;texting zones&quot; across New York for drivers to pull over and use their phones, &quot;There is no excuse to take your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road because your text can wait until the next Texting Zone.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&quot;These Zones will be identified with signs along the Thruway and State Highways, reminding drivers that there is a nearby opportunity for them to legally and safely use their phone,&quot; Cuomo said in a statement, pointing out there are five times more fatalities from distracted driving than drunk driving:</p>

<p>There will be  298 signs posted along the NY State Thruway and other highways to notify drivers of the &quot;texting zones.&quot; You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926153221/http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/09232013-governor-unveils-texting-zones">see the list here</a>. </p>

I have three young ladies at home and I see it first-hand.&quot; So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926153221/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/video_louis_ck_beautifully_explains.php">does Louis CK</a>.</p>
