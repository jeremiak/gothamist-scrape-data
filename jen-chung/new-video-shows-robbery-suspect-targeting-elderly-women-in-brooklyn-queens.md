<p>The NYPD has released a new video showing a man suspected of at least five violent home invasion robberies, and investigators hope the public can help them track the suspect down. In each instance, cops say he has targeted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708083250/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/serial_senior_mugger.php">elderly women going into their homes</a>.</p>

<p>The first reported incident was on March 2nd, at 1 p.m., in Park Slope. Police say that &quot;inside of 555 9 Street in Brooklyn, the suspect approached the 91 year-old female victim from behind as she entered the location, placed her in a chokehold and displayed a handgun. After he pushed her inside the location&apos;s vestibule he demanded her money. As the suspect took the female victim&apos;s money, a 50 year-old male came across the pair in the vestibule. The suspect pointed the handgun at the male victim and removed his money. The suspect fled the location with approximately $370.&quot;</p>

As she reached the door, the male put his hands over her mouth and pushed her inside. He then demanded money at knife point and then pointed a firearm at a 87-year-old male demanding more money.  The suspect fled with approximately $800.&quot;<br>
 <br>
On February 11th, the suspect then allegedly struck at Prospect Place and 6th Avenue around 2:30 p.m.: &quot;An unidentified male followed a 71-year-old female into her residence, attempted to tie her up, displayed a firearm and struck her on the left side of the lip causing a laceration. The  individual removed approximately $375 and fled on foot east on Prospect Place.&quot;<br>
 <br>
According to the NYPD, two more robberies occurred this month: On Saturday, March 19th, at 5:15 p.m., near Prospect Place and Carlton Avenue in Prospect Heights, &quot;an unidentified male followed a 43-year-old male into his residence and demanded money.  He then observed an 81-year-old female and approached her at gunpoint and with a box cutter in his other hand and demanded money. The suspect fled on foot with approximately $330.&quot;</p>

<p>This past Saturday, March 26th,  police say he struck again in Kensington near Ocean Parkway and Beverly Road: &quot;The suspect followed the 83-year-old female victim into her building. Once the victim was inside of her apartment the suspect knocked on her door. After she opened the door, the suspect hit her in the face with a hard object. The suspect did not remove any items from her home and fled the building in an unknown direction.&quot;</p>
