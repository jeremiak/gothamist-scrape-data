<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_coned2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190347im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_coned2.jpg" width="150" height="123" class="image-left"> </span>Now that a federal ruling has raised the amount that power generators can get, which would then result in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190347/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/02/con_ed_rates_may_go_up_12_this_summ.php">12% rate hike for Con Ed customers</a>, on top of another previously-scheduled 4% rate hike, we need a hero to stop this madness.  And Senator Charles Schumer is signing up for hero duty: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190347/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/chuck_bid_to_nix_rate_hike_JVlLcvYn5cBkZosg1oM8fK">Schumer told the Post</a> that he spoke to the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, &quot;I told him how upset we were about FERC&apos;s decision, and how we thought they left out some very key information, and about how we wanted a rehearing. He said there will definitely be a rehearing.&quot;</p>

<p>Schumer, Mayor Bloomberg, and other officials think that FERC is giving Con Ed the extra money because it mistakenly thinks the city won&apos;t guarantee property tax breaks to power generators. Con Ed is also against the extra hike (it is a power transmission company, so it won&apos;t get a cut of the rate hike) and says that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190347/mailto:http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hey_you_fuse_you_lose_usdxtYyIrgGtXmAeGGk6xH">it&apos;ll get blamed by customers</a> instead.  Schumer said of FERC Chairman Jay Willinghoff, &quot;He&apos;s not averse to changing his vote. I&apos;m going to fight this tooth and nail. I think it&apos;s really unjust for ratepayers in New York and bad for business and job growth... I got the feeling that we have a second shot here. He wasn&apos;t being perfunctory, or &apos;Yes, yes, yes.&apos; He was serious. He understood.&quot;</p>
