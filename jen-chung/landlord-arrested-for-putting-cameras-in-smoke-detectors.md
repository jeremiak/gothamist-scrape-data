The tenants had asked a friend to check the detectors, which were found to be non-working.  &quot;The friend brought one of the detectors to a local firehouse, where a volunteer firefighter realized &apos;<strong>the guts were removed from that smoke detector and in its place was a digital video camera and some sort of a transmitter</strong>.&apos;&quot;  Nassau police arrested the landlord Michael Murartore, who claimed he just wanted to make sure his apartment wasn&apos;t being damaged, but the cops told Newsday, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s against the law to do that.  It&apos;s kind of obvious.</strong>&quot;</p>
