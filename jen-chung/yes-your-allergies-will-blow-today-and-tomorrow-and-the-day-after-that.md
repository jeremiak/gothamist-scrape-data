<p>Did you realize there&apos;s been what a NYU medical professor calls a &quot;global expansion of pollen&quot;? Dr. Clifford Bassett <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172555/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/top-summer-allergens/story?id=16449624#1">told ABC News</a>, &quot;There&apos;s more of it and it&apos;s more powerful.&quot; His tips: &quot;Avoid bringing in those pesky pollens and mold spores into your home via an air sucking fan, especially during the allergy season if you are a sufferer,&quot; exercise indoors, wear sunglasses and hats, and wash hair at night to get rid of pollen! </p>
