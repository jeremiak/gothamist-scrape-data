<p>Real estate developer Blayne Ross hopes to raise $35,000 to get started on an operational plan, like getting more information from architects, figuring out the permitting, start some structural engineering, noting, &quot;It&apos;s about getting all the ducks in a row.&quot; Ross is currently working on project in the Hamptons, and he enjoys the beaches there, &quot;But it takes three hours to get there.&quot; City Beach, on the other hand, could be just 15 minutes away for many New Yorkers seeking a place for solace and sand.</p>

<p>Ross says the goal is to make the floating beach&#x2014;which would be tethered to a pier&#x2014;free to the public, while supporting it by charging for amenities, like towels and lounge chairs, and concessions. There would be three restaurants (run by an experienced restaurateur/restaurant group). And the &quot;potato chip&quot; shape of the beach mimics the feel of a dune, giving sunbathers a chance to take in the sights and hear the waterfalls around the sides. </p>

<p>There are a few other phases of the project after this one&#x2014;one involving 3D modeling; design development and engineering; permit applications and community outreach&#x2014;before even getting to buying a barge ($1.5 million) and building it (which would reach $24 million).</p>

<p>Ross likened the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180516/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/city-beach-nyc--2">Indiegogo crowdfunding</a> to &quot;a community experiment&quot; and drew inspiration from urban renewal projects; for instance, he said, &quot;The guys who started The High Line had no idea&quot; how it would take off. He said, &quot;The biggest thing&quot; about this crowdfunding campaign is that it&apos;s &quot;about the public getting behind it and people voting with dollars.&quot;</p>
