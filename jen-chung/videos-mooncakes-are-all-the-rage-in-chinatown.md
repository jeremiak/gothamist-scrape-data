<p>September 19th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, which celebrated many Asian cultures on the 15th moon of the 8th lunar month. And mooncakes&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303005656/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/29/harvest_moon_is_coming_so_its_time.php">those high-calorie treats</a>&#x2014;are the centerpiece delicacy.</p>

<p>A Pacific Asia Museum spokeswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303005656/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/social-affairs/20130917/the-mid-autumn-festival-the-story-behind-the-moon-cakes">explained to a newspaper</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s almost like a Christmas fruitcake. It&#x2019;s a traditional gift that people just give each other during the Moon Festival. ness partners give them to each other as an appreciation for their support in the past. It&#x2019;s best wishes for another year of harvest and prosperity (or) exchanging a good blessing.&#x201D; The pastry is filled with lotus seed, red bean or a similar paste and sometimes there&apos;s an egg yolk (which represents the moon). </p>

<p>The folks behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303005656/http://myblocknyc.com/#/welcome">MyBlockNYC</a> captured some videos, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303005656/http://camra.tv/">Camra</a>, of the scene at a Chinatown bakery that makes mooncakes as well as the chaos when mooncakes are being given out at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. </p>

<p>Mooncakes were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303005656/http://www.chinatownology.com/mooncake_and_mongols.html">also used as part of a rebellion</a> to get rid of Mongol occupiers hundreds of years ago. And if mooncake pastries aren&apos;t your thing, did you realize there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303005656/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=417649098355428&amp;set=pb.136612306459110.-2207520000.1379784525.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Haagen Dazs ice cream mooncakes</a>?</p>
