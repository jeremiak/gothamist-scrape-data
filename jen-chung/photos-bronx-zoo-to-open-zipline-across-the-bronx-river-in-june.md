					<p>Visiting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601172959/https://bronxzoo.com/">Bronx Zoo</a> will soon be more thrilling: The Wildlife Conservation Society will open two new attractions next month, one of which will give the public a chance to fly 400 feet across the Bronx River along a zipline suspended 50-feet above the water. </p>

<p>The zoo&apos;s plans were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601172959/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161216/belmont/bronx-zoo-zip-line-nature-trek">announced last December</a>, and Sue Chin, the vice president of planning and design and chief architect at the WCS, said at the time, &quot;It&#x2019;s an amazing river in our city, but not everybody gets to see it.&quot; </p>

<p>The zipline is part of the Bronx Zoo&apos;s new Treetop Adventure attraction, which also includes an &quot;aerial climbing experience&quot; with seven ropes courses (two beginner; two intermediate; two advanced; and one expert) and obstacles like &quot;rope bridges, wobbly bridges, tight rope walks, ladders, rolling and swinging elements,&quot; according to a press release. All participants will be harnessed in.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2017_05_wobby1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601172959im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_05_wobby1.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Climbing at the Bronx Zoo&apos;s new Treetop Experience (Julie Larsen Maher / Wildlife Conservation Society)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The Bronx Zoo Treetop Adventure, which is located next to the zoo&apos;s Bronx River entrance, will have a separate fee from regular zoo admission, even for members: A two-hour climbing ticket will cost $64.99, while a 2-way river crossing ticket is $34.99, or $74.99 for a climb &amp; zipline combined ticket. </p>

<p>There&apos;s also a new Nature Trek attraction (included in the Bronx Zoo Total Experience, or $6 separately) which is a family-oriented adventure that has a completely netted climbing course with towers two stories above ground, connected by 12 different bridges (there&apos;s an ADA accessible route, too), and a &quot;nature play&quot; zone that lets children explore natural elements. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601172959/http://www.BronxZooTreetop.com/">Bronx Zoo Treetop Adventure</a> is opening on Friday, June 16, and will be open year-round (weather-permitting). Given all the climbing and ziplining elements, there are many requirements: participants must be age 7 or older, weigh a minimum 50 pounds/maximum 275 pounds, and be able to touch a height of 5&apos;6&quot; when standing with feet flat on the ground. Children 7-17 must also be accompanied by a parent of guardian, who are able to sign a liability waiver and safety orientation. </p>

<p>The Nature Trek debuts on Friday, June 26, and will be open daily April-October and weather-permitting in November-March.</p>
