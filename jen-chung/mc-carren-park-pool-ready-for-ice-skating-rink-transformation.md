The NYC Parks and Recreation Department and the Open Space Alliance announced that the McCarren Rink will open on November 15&#x2014;and there will be a holiday market and food market, too.</p>

<p>The newest Brooklyn ice skating rink will be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week through January. The rink measures 60 feet wide by 120 feet long, which will allow space for over 300 people. There will be skate rentals ($5 each), skate sharpening and a pro shop&#x2014;and skaters can use the pool lockers and other facilities in the locker rooms (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016223836/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/05/diarrhea_delay_mccarren_pool_re-ope.php">use them</a>). Admission is $8 for adults, $5 for seniors and students, and $4 for children, with group discounts and party packages available. </p>

<p>The holiday market will be open on weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas while the food concessions are a collaboration between Josh Cohen, co-owner of Anella and Jimmy&#x2019;s Diner in North Brooklyn, and Tyler Kord of No. 7 Sub. </p>

<p>Ed Janoff, Administrator of North Brooklyn Parks and Executive Director of OSA, said the new rink will become &quot;a premier winter destination and new holiday tradition for New Yorkers and visitors alike&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016223836/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/nyregion/brooklyn-pool-to-double-as-ice-skating-rink.html?ref=nyregion">called the area an &quot;ice-rink desert.&quot;</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016223836/http://www.ny1.com/content/news/190532/ice-skating-rink-coming-to-mccarren-park-pool">One resident said to NY1</a>, &quot;Anything to keep the kids engaged and in the community and out of trouble I think is a great move.&quot;</p>
