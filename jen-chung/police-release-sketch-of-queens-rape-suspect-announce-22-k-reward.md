                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_08_qnsrapist.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075802im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_qnsrapist.jpg" width="300" height="395" class="image-right"> </span>The police released a sketch of the man suspected of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075802/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/69-year-old_female_jogger_tasered_s.php">raping a 69-year-old woman</a> after using a stun gun to incapacitate her in a Queens park earlier this week. And the NYPD also announced a $22,000 reward for information leading to the suspect&apos;s arrest and conviction. </p>

<p>The incident occurred on Monday, August 26, at 4:30 p.m. in Forest Park. Apparently the suspect was talking to the victim, who had been jogging, before he tased her, pushed her to the ground and raped her. The victim, who had been near Forest Park Drive and Myrtle Avenue, was treated and released from Queens General Hospital.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as being 30-40 years old, 5&apos;9&quot;-5&apos;10&quot;, with light brown hair, clean shaven, wearing a black t-shirt and black sweat pants.</p>

<p>Police urge anyone with information in regards to this incident to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075802/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM </a>or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577. The $22,000 reward is made up of $10,000 from the City of New York; $10,000 from the NYPD (for the arrest and conviction of the rapist); and $2,000 from Crime Stoppers (for the arrest and indictment). </p>

<p>Earlier this year, in March, a jogger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075802/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/30/23-year-old_female_jogger_tasered_d.php">was shot with a stun gun and robbed</a>; her attacker also tried to rape her and police are looking into whether there&apos;s a connection between the assaults. </p>
