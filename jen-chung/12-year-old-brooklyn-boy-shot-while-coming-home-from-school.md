<p>A 12-year-old boy was shot in the left leg in Brooklyn yesterday afternoon. Levon Gilliam, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013505/http://7online.com/news/12-year-old-boy-shot-in-brooklyn/319534/">who had been walking home from school when he was shot, said</a>, &quot;It felt like something bit me.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2014_09_lottave1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013505im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_09_lottave1.jpg" width="288" height="331"> <br> <i style=" width:288px; ;display:block"> The shooting suspect</i></div> Levon was shot outside of 211 Lott Avenue in Brownsville around 4:11 p.m. His mother, Shakeeta McCollum, said she saw the shooting when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013505/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/12-year-old-boy-shot-leg-bus-stop-brooklyn-article-1.1949039">she went to meet him from the bus stop</a>, &quot;It&apos;s not right for a child to be coming home at 4 o&apos;clock in the afternoon to get caught in the crossfire.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013505/http://nypost.com/2014/09/22/teen-shot-in-leg-in-apparent-drive-by-shooting/">told the Post</a>, &quot;It looks like some kind of drive-by shooting. We still don&#x2019;t know if he was the intended target.&quot; Levon was treated at Kings County Hospital and released&#x2014;with a pair of crutches&#x2014;last night.</p>

<p>His mother worried in an interview with WABC 7: &quot;If he would have moved any other way he would have been dead, and I just thank God that it was just him getting shot in his leg.&quot; She added that it was time to move out of Brownsville.</p>

<p>The police released an image (right) of the suspect, who is described as a man in his 20s. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
