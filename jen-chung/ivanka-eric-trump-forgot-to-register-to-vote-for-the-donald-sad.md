<p>Back in October, articles about Donald Trump&apos;s presidential campaign were titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-race.html">From Donald Trump, Hints of a Campaign Exit Strategy</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/debate-donald-trump-shrinkage-2016-215333">The Incredible Shrinking Trump</a>,&quot; suggesting that the real estate mogul/professional braggart&apos;s White House hopes were just a pipe dream. So maybe that&apos;s why two of his children-turned-campaign surrogates never bothered to register in the Republican primary.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/https://www.yahoo.com/news/ivanka-and-eric-trump-loyal-offspring-proud-202153319.html">Yahoo reported</a> that while big brother Donald Trump Jr. was a registered Republican, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump weren&apos;t. Which means they can&apos;t vote in the suddenly pivotal New York primary on April 19. </p>

<p>Party affiliation registration for New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/06/democracy_bureacracy.php">was last October</a>, when we noted, &quot;Bernie Sanders supporters have made a whole website dedicated to letting slacktivists, coffee-shop socialists, and Green Party members know that for their vote to count in New York, they have to become Democrats. The same applies if you&apos;re a 4chan user who voted Libertarian in 2012 but want Donald Trump to get the Republican nomination so he can continue to troll the world.&quot;</p>

<p>This morning, Donald Trump addressed this dishonor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-kids-eric-ivanka-miss-deadline-vote/story?id=38303943">telling Fox and Friends</a>, &quot;They were unaware of the rules and they didn&apos;t register in time... So Eric and Ivanka, I guess, won&apos;t be voting... They feel very, very guilty. They feel very guilty. But it&apos;s fine. I understand that.&quot; </p>

<p>Fox and Friends co-host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/trump-children-register-vote-221790">Steve Doocey &quot;joked,&quot;</a> &quot;Are you cutting off their allowance?&quot; and Trump said, &quot;Yes. No more allowance.&quot; Both children have used their allowance to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/https://www.yahoo.com/news/ivanka-and-eric-trump-loyal-offspring-proud-202153319.html">donate to Republican and Democratic politicians</a>.</p>

<p>Still, there&apos;s no guarantee that Eric and Ivanka&apos;s party affiliation would have been correct anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821192640/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/voter_confusion_primary_ny.php">given the chaos that is the NY State Board of Election</a>.</p>
