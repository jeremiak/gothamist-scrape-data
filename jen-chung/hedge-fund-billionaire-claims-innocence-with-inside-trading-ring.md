<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_rajraj.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_rajraj.jpg" width="200" height="165" class="image-left"> </span>To no one&apos;s surprise, traders at the Galleon Group have been<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601170&amp;sid=agbBM3zGKSBk"> working on their resumes</a> and calling their lawyers, after the hedge fund&apos;s founder Raj Rajaratnam was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/17/hedge_fund_billionaire_5_others_arr.php">arrested on insider trading charges last week</a>. However, he was in the office yesterday (out on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/19/alleged_insider_trading_billionaire.php"><em>$100 million</em> bail</a>) and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://www.businessinsider.com/raj-rajaratnams-letter-to-clients-and-employees-2009-10">offered a letter</a> to employees, friends and clients: &quot;As I am sure you understand, I am not able to respond in detail to the charges recently brought against me.  But let me be clear: they are, without exception, entirely baseless.  I am innocent and will vigorously defend myself and our firm.&quot;</p>

<p>Also not surprising is the fact that many Galleon investors want out of the fund. Already, those holding about $1.3 billion of the $3.7 billion fund have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/10/20/2009-10-20_arrest_has_investors_bailing_out_of_rajs_galleon_fund_reports_say.html">requested to withdraw their funds</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-fund-sharks-circle-galleons-big-bucks-2009-10">rival hedge funds are eager</a> to take them on as clients.</p>

<p>Rajaratnam and five others, including some well-placed individuals such as a top executive at IBM, are accused of sharing information for profitable stock picks. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/business/20insider.html?adxnnl=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;adxnnlx=1256065571-l4yDQ6BgGvGRHmuvkeWniQ">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Insider trading, however, can be difficult to prove...The line between buying legitimate research, trading rumors and gossip, and illegally paying for market-moving information can be complicated.&quot; The feds, though, do have tapes of the defendants allegedly discussing deals&#x2014;for instance, Rajaratnam <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403142329/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/10/20/2009-10-20_arrest_has_investors_bailing_out_of_rajs_galleon_fund_reports_say.html">said</a>, &quot;I get s--t on lots of companie.&quot;</p>
