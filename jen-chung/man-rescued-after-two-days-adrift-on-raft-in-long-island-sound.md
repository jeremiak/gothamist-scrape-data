<p>A man stranded on his small inflatable raft since Sunday was rescued from Long Island Sound yesterday morning by boaters.</p>

<p>According to the Coast Guard, one of its auxiliary members, Bob Edwin, and his wife spotted the man on the raft in distress. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133003/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/uscg-missing-rafter-in-long-island-sound-found-1.11915642?pts=916710">Newsday reports</a> the stranded man was &quot;in the 14-foot raft, frantically waving a T-shirt. The auxiliary member brought him onto his boat, and the Coast Guard dispatched another boat to pick him up at about 9:50 a.m.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the rafter and a friend had gone into the water from Milford, Connecticut; his friend had jumped off the raft on Monday, swimming to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133003/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Island">Charles Island</a> and spending the night there. </p>

<p>Sunday was a deadly day for people in the water: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133003/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/14/kayak_paddleboard_death.php">Two died in a kayak and paddle board excursion</a> in the Sound, and another paddle boarder, Upper West Sider Gary Turkel, is still missing. The Coast Guard has just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133003/http://thejewishbuzz.com/2016/06/15/update-coast-guard-suspends-their-search-for-jewish-paddle-boarder-gary-turkel-off-long-island-shore/">suspended their search for Turkel</a>.</p>
