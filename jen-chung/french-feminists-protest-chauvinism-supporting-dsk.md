</div></div><p>The arrest of former IMF head and leading French politician <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525051846/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiquestrausskahn">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a> for allegedly sexually assaulting a hotel maid in NYC has become an international incident. His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525051846/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/from_oswald_to_lohan_america_loves.php">perp walk</a> set off a torrent of criticism from the French, who were outraged that someone so prominent could be treated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525051846/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/imf_heads_perp_walk_horrifies_the_f.php">like a common suspect</a> and beliefs that he&apos;s being set-up.  It has also prompted French politicians, philosophers, social commentators, and many more to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525051846/http://felixsalmon.tumblr.com/post/5753082372/why-all-the-fuss-its-merely-a-bit-o">make comments like</a>, &quot;Why all the fuss? It&apos;s merely a bit of hanky-panky with the help&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525051846/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe13n9Jg4Ks">Really, nobody died in that hotel room</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>French feminist groups organized a protest yesterday against the chauvinism.  The groups issued a statement saying, &quot;We do not know what happened in New York Saturday May 14, but we know what has been happening in France in the past week. We are witnessing a sudden rise of sexist and reactionary reflexes, so quick to surface among part of the French elite... There is a certain impunity in France when it comes to this kind of uninhibited sexism.&quot; Their anger was directed most at Jean-Francois Kahn, a left-wing editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525051846/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/dominique-strauss-kahn/8528512/Dominique-Strauss-Kahn-why-French-women-put-up-with-it.html">who said</a>, &quot;Why all the fuss? It&apos;s merely a bit of hanky-panky with the help&quot; and has referred to the alleged incident as a &quot;troussage de domestique,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525051846/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/21/us-strausskahn-feminists-idUSTRE74K21S20110521">which Reuters explains</a> is &quot;a phrase that evokes a master having non-consensual sex with a servant.&quot;</p>

<p>While Kahn apologized for the remark, the feminist groups said, &quot;This kind of language generates an intolerable confusion between sexual freedom and violence toward women. Violent acts, rape, attempted rape and harassment are all the mark of men&apos;s desire to dominate women&apos;s bodies.&quot;  The protesters held signs that roughly translate to, &quot;We are all servants.&quot;  </p>
