A diverse group turned out for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418045800/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/29/slutwalk_heads_to_nyc_on_saturday.php">today&apos;s SlutWalk</a>, a grassroots movement to protest against sexual violence, victim-blaming and slut-shaming.  The day started with sign-making in Union Square, followed by a march which is still going on with an impassioned rally back at Union Square. </p>

<p>One woman, Holly Meyer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418045800/http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/09/29/1021315/-Why-I&#x2019;m-Marching-in-SlutWalk-NYC">explained why she was marching in a post on the Daily Kos</a>:</p><blockquote>One night in January after a lot of dancing at a friend&#x2019;s house party in Brooklyn, a male neighbor and I made our way back to our building less than a mile away. We&#x2019;d both consumed alcoholic beverages but nothing unusual for twenty-somethings on a Saturday night. My roommate had a new love interest at home with him, so to give him some privacy I went back to the neighbor&#x2019;s apartment to crash, which I&#x2019;d done several times before. I felt safe going back there as I&#x2019;d spent a lot of time with this neighbor in a Will &amp; Grace, Glee-watching, Katy Perry-listening kind of way. He&#x2019;d had a homosexual relationship for more than a year prior to our being neighbors and for all intents and purposes I thought of him and treated him like a gay, male friend.<p></p>

<p>The next thing I know I&#x2019;m feeling my pants being pulled down off my body. I heard the neighbor mutter, &#x201C;Time to take charge of this situation.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>You can read most about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418045800/http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/09/29/1021315/-Why-I&#x2019;m-Marching-in-SlutWalk-NYC">Meyer&apos;s awful experience here</a>&#x2014;she adds, &quot;When I finally felt able to tell people what happened, I was asked numerous times about what I had been wearing and if I had anything to drink. The fact that I was wearing grey pants and a black sweater and had consumed alcohol that evening should not have any bearing on what happened to me that night in January.&quot;<p></p>
