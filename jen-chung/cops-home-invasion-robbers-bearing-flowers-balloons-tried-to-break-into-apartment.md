<p>A Bronx mother of two managed to fight off a pair of would-be home invasion robbers earlier this week. Apparently one of the suspects waited outside their door for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Police say the incident occurred at 7:16 a.m. on Monday, August 1: &quot;Two unidentified individuals attempted to gain entry into a 31 year old female victim&apos;s apartment, located in the vicinity of Home Street and Bryant Avenue, by pushing their way in through the front door. They were unable to gain entry and fled the location.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015209/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/05/bronx-push-in-robbery/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;One of the men hid under the stairs, while the other waited outside of a first floor apartment for more than 20 minutes.&quot; Video shows one of the suspects carrying flowers and balloons:</p>

<p>Inside the first floor apartment was the 31-year-old woman and her 9-year-old son and baby daughter. The boy told WCBS 2, &quot;I was sleeping, and I was the one that heard the knock. So, I told my mom someone&#x2019;s knocking at the door... She didn&#x2019;t see nobody like three or five minutes after that. She was gonna go out to buy me a sandwich, that&#x2019;s when they started to push the door to get in.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the suspects wedged his foot in the door as he tried to get into the apartment; when he fled, he left his shoe. </p>

<p>One suspect is described as 20 to 30 years old, 5&apos;10&quot; and approximately 180 pounds and wearing a black and gray sweater, brown pants, green baseball cap, and tan shoes, while the other was described as 20 to 25 years old, 5&apos;8&quot; to 5&apos;10&quot; and  approximately 160 to 170 pounds and wearing a gray hoodie sweatshirt, blue jeans and black sneakers.<br>
