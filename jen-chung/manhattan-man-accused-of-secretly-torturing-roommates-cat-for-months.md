<p>A 24-year-old man was arrested for allegedly torturing his roommate&apos;s cat while the roommate was at work. The cat, named Lucy, was found with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062437/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nyc-financial-analyst-busted-torturing-cat-3-months-article-1.2543317">&quot;fractured hind legs and bruises on her back&quot;</a> as well as broken facial and pelvis bones, broken teeth, &quot;ripped out&quot; nails and burns on her tail.</p>

<p>Lucy&apos;s owner, a woman, told the Daily News that she met her roommate Declan Garrity, who is a financial analyst at Barclays, via Craigslist: &quot;I thought he was the best roommate I ever had. It&#x2019;s bizarre.&quot; </p><blockquote>The owner said her suspicions grew when Lucy began avoiding Garrity and hiding in the closet. She first noticed an injury to the car in late January, and things escalated quickly.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;She was noticeably staying away from (Garrity),&#x201D; said the owner. &#x201C;I thought it was weird. I was like, &#x2018;How can we get the cat to like him?&#x2019; Your mind doesn&#x2019;t go straight to &#x2018;He&#x2019;s doing something to my cat.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Then, last weekend, she noticed that Lucy was hiding under the bed, cowering, &quot;She was crying, hair was missing from her tail, her foot was not even facing the right direction. I thought she was going to die.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The cat owner is a nurse, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062437/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160225/upper-east-side/ues-man-who-tortured-roommates-cat-while-she-was-away-arrested-nypd">explained to DNAinfo</a> that &quot;she works long hours, sometimes overnight, and the incident over the weekend was the fourth time she had come home to find her cat hurt... Lucy&apos;s behavior changed after Garrity moved into the apartment [last fall], Danielle said. Lucy would hide in her owner&apos;s closet, refused to eat and constantly licked her paws. In one instance, on Jan. 25, Danielle came home to find Lucy hurt, and when she asked Garrity about it, he told her the cat had knocked over an iron and it landed on her, Danielle said.&quot;</p>

<p>Garrity was charged with felony animal cruelty; he is an Irish citizen who is here on a work visa. Barclays says that Garrity is on a leave of absence.</p>

<p>Lucy&apos;s owner has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062437/https://www.gofundme.com/ubr93f9t">started a GoFundMe</a> to help pay for expenses related to Lucy&apos;s current and previous medical treatment.</p>
