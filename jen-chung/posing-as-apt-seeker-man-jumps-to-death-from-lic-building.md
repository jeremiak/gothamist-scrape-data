										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_avrivnorth.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803004550im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_avrivnorth.jpg" width="180" height="212" class="image-left"> </span>There was a report of a &quot;fatal jumper down&quot; yesterday morning on 49th Avenue in Queens.  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803004550/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/apt_buyer_tours_high_rise_to_jump_KKWhbFR6HLZrjb5XgxFIkN">Post reports</a> that victim was a man who posed as a potential renter at a Long Island City high-rise: Anastasi Calatzis, an out-of-work car salesman who was upset about his mother&apos;s illness and medical bills, &quot;sent a grim text message to his brother and then jumped from the Avalon Riverview North in Long Island City.&quot;</p>

<p>Calatzis, 38, apparently pretended to be interested in the 25th floor apartment (he first saw it a few days ago), in order to gain access to terrace.  A woman who lives across the street told the Post, &quot;I see this guy go out on the terrace, look around holding on to the banister, and then he puts one foot over and I thought, &apos;Oh no! What&apos;s he going to do?&apos; He bends his knee, and down he went, just like that. It was just so quick. He looked very calm for some reason.&quot;  </p>

<p>His cousin says that Calatzis sent his younger brother a text message saying, &quot;&apos;Please take care of my mother. I can&apos;t take it anymore.&apos; He left all the account numbers, all the keys and apologized in the text for all the pain he was going to cause.&quot;</p>
