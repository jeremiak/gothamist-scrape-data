<p>Last month, a woman was leaving a 4 train in the Bronx when she &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119143851/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/creep-busted-masturbating-subway-rider-pants-bronx-article-1.2873793">realized her pants and leg were wet</a>&quot;&#x2014;that&apos;s when a fellow subway passenger told her that a man had masturbated on her. Now cops say they&apos;ve caught the culprit after matching his DNA to the state&apos;s database.</p>

<p>Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119143851/http://nypost.com/2016/11/14/sex-offender-arrested-for-masturbating-on-womans-leg-on-subway/">tell the NY Post</a> that Rodney Pierre, 50, was arrested on Friday after his DNA matched bodily fluid on the victim&apos;s clothing. His DNA was already on file from at least one other attack, the Post reports. </p>

<p>Both the victim and the eyewitness reported the incident to the police. </p>

<p>Pierre, who is a level-three sex offender and reportedly committed a similar crime in 1992, was charged with forcible touching, harassment and sexual abuse. He&apos;s being held on $10,000 bail or $15,000 bond. </p>
