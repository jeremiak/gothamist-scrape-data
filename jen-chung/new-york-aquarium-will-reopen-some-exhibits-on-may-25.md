<p>In case you&apos;ve been wondering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510155044/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/new_york_aquarium_will_open_in_late.php#photo-1">when you&apos;ll be able</a> to see the fish and other sea creatures at the New York Aquarium, the facility has set its partial reopening for May 25.  Cristi&#xE1;n Samper, Wildlife Conservation Society President, said, &quot;We are ready to welcome New York families and tourists back into the WCS New York Aquarium. We have worked nonstop to ensure that the marine life in the aquarium was safe and secure. We want to share this progress with New Yorkers and be a part of the Coney Island comeback following Hurricane Sandy.&quot;</p>

<p>The aquarium and its 14-acre space was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510155044/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/photos_ny_aquariums_damage_after_be.php#photo-1">badly damaged during Hurricane Sandy</a>, with flooding throughout. Thankfully, all of its animals&#x2014;except for 130 koi fish&#x2014;survived.  The reopened exhibits include &quot;Glover&#x2019;s Reef (featuring the sea life found in Glover&apos;s Reef, Belize); Exhibits in Conservation Hall (Coral Triangle of Fiji, Great Lakes of East Africa, and the Flooded Forests of the Amazon;) Outdoor spaces of Sea Cliffs (walrus, sea lions, harbor seals, sea otters and penguins); And a fully re-modeled Aquatheater with a new sea lion demonstration.&quot;</p>

<p>All told, the New York Aquarium&apos;s damages are in the $65 million range, and the WCS has spent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510155044/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-aquarium-coney-island-set-reopen-25-sea-lions-included-article-1.1308741">$7 million to repair it so far</a>. Jon Forrest Dohlin, Director of the New York Aquarium, said, &quot;I want to thank all of our Coney Island neighbors for supporting us through these difficult months since the hurricane. The community spirit has inspired the WCS aquarium staff to work hard every day so we can reopen and again bring economic stimulus to Coney Island and to share the wonders of the oceans with New Yorkers and tourists.&quot; Check out video&#x2014;Dohlin says many of the animals, like the walruses and sea lions, were totally fine during the storm:</p>
