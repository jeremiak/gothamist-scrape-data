<p>Last week, the Fire Department discovered a pair of male bodies in a Queens marsh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145320/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/dead_bodies_found_at_2-alarm_howard.php">while battling a two-alarm fire</a>. It turned out that the men had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145320/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/07/queens_brush_fire_bodies_were_murde.php">been killed before being dumped and burned</a> at the Spring Creek Park Preserve in Howard Beach. Now the police say that the victims had been trying to rob drug dealers, but the dealers got wise and killed them.</p>

<p>Rudy Superville, 22, and Gary Lopez, 25, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145320/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/nyregion/brooklyn-man-held-in-killing-of-2-and-dumping-of-guns.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">had apparently planned to rob</a> a Bushwick, Brooklyn apartment. But the dealers figured it out. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145320/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-murdered-men-rob-dealer-article-1.1286588">NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said</a>, &quot;They picked the wrong drug dealers to rip. When they got inside their targets essentially were waiting for them.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145320/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/two_killed_mutilated_in_ill_fated_6MMpwbUouPNQs54dmVSQCO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Brooklyn">Browne added</a>, &quot;We believe Rudy went in first and they jumped him right away. Then they told him to &#x2018;Go out and get Gary in here.... We believe they were both armed though Superville&#x2019;s gun didn&#x2019;t have ammo... They took turns shooting, stabbing and beating them with a chair.&quot; The Post reports, &quot;Superville was shot to the elbow and neck but stab wounds to his torso and neck caused him to bleed out, officials said. Lopez suffered blunt trauma to the head, gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and right arm, police said. The shot to the chest was the fatal blow for Lopez, authorities said.&quot;</p>

<p>Rogelio Rodriguez, 34, was arrested and charged with murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal tampering. Police are still looking for more suspects.</p>
