</div></div><p>Last night, Michael Moore rallied the spirits of East Villagers and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/">St. Mark&apos;s Bookshop</a> fans by yelling, &quot;<strong>Save St. Mark&#x2019;s bookstore!</strong>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/09/3560204/michael-moore-rallies-east-villagers-signs-books-st-marks-bookshop">Capital New York reports</a> that the opinionated filmmaker said of the shop&apos;s landlord, Cooper Union,  &quot;We&#x2019;re appealing to their conscience and the integrity of their history, because they exist only because the people of New York have supported Cooper Union for all of these centuries.&quot; </p>

<p>Like many bookstores, big and small, St. Mark&apos;s Bookshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/24/st_marks_bookshop_in_deep_weeds.php">has been struggling lately</a> and Cooper Union has been demanding higher rents.  Tens of thousands (currently it&apos;s over 40,000) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://signon. /sign/save-the-st-marks-bookshop">have signed a petition</a> to save the institution as the store&apos;s plight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/st_marks_bookshop_might_make_it_out.php">has been publicized</a>.  Moore called the store earlier this week to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/28/michael_moore_heads_to_saint_marks.php">ask if he could hold a signing</a> for his new memoir, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mike-friends-blog/here-comes-trouble-michael-moore-book">Here Comes Trouble</a></em>.  </p>

<p>Capital New York says about 200 people were there and recounts Moore&apos;s speech:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen enough of New York destroyed! I am ashamed to live in a city where out of 8 million people, one million of them live in poverty.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Disgraceful! St. Mark&#x2019;s can&#x2019;t pay the rent it paid three years ago, so all it&#x2019;s asking for is a reduction,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x2019;s not asking for a free lunch! Oh, God forbid!&#x201D;</p>

<p>The crowd giggled and booed.</p>

<p>Moore proceeded to describe his childhood trips to the once-independent Borders bookstore in his hometown of Ann Arbor, Mich., as he compared its quaintness to St. Mark&#x2019;s.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The bookstores are not going to die,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;because people want to get out of the house! We like being around other people. That&#x2019;s why we like coming to bookstores. You can&#x2019;t really quantify it &#x2026; but you know why it feels good &#x2026; when you leave here, you have something you didn&#x2019;t know &#x2026; or go to a fantasy place. Whatever, right?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Now the audience was practically screaming its adulation.</p></blockquote>St. Mark&apos;s Bookshop is asking for its rent to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/48886-st-mark-s-bookshop-rent-fate-settled-in-october.html">lowered from the current $20,000/month</a>.  Supporters hope to get 50,000 signatures on the petition by mid-October&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125942/http://signon.org/sign/save-the-st-marks-bookshop">you can sign it here</a>.<p></p>
