										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_05_conroy25.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_05_conroy25.jpg" width="215" height="249" class="image-left"> </span>Jeffrey Conroy, the Long Island teen who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/19/jury_li_teen_guilty_of_manslaughter.php">convicted</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/jury_immigrants_killing_was_hate_cr.php">manslaughter as a hate crime</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/20/upgraded_and_additional_charges_in.php">fatally stabbing an Ecuadorean immigrant</a> in 2008, was sentenced to 25 years in prison yesterday.  His father raged at the at the sentence, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/li_hate_crime_killer_gets_years_GFVVmVY0TH4sckX2ULEchI">running out of the courtroom and yelling</a>, &quot;He was f---ing 17. This is mercy for crying out loud? Jesus, f---ing, Christ! Jesus Christ!&quot;  </p>

<p>Conroy, who is now 19 and admitted to police that he and friends had gone &quot;beaner-hopping,&quot; specifically targeting Hispanic victims, had apologized to victim Marcelo Lucero&apos;s family before the judge made the announcement, &quot;I&apos;m really sorry for what happened to Mr. Lucero. I feel really bad for what the Lucero family is going through right now. Every day I wish it didn&apos;t happen.&quot;  Lucero&apos;s brother Joselo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iyOq7mhNW2WjpPOWuAd607cd0xxgD9FULIL80">said in a victim&apos;s impact statement</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t want this hate to continue. I want my brother to know that I&apos;m fighting for the right reason, for human rights.&quot;</p>

<p>Conroy has tried to insist, in spite of his swastika tattoo and other actions, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/30/hate_crime_killer_im_not_this_serio.php">that he&apos;s not racist</a>, noting how he listens to hip-hop and has a Bolivian girlfriend.  His father Robert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/jeffrey-conroy-gets-25-years-in-hate-crime-killing-1.1951043">later spoke to Newsday</a>, calling the maximum sentence &quot;very unfair...I never expected the maximum,&quot; and claimed his son was &quot;a good kid&quot; and was seized as a &quot;poster boy&quot; for an &quot;international story... The DAs and judges and everybody, all these politicians were boxed into it.&quot; And an alternate juror sympathized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062300/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/lucero.hate.crime.2.1716159.html">with his pain,</a> &quot;It was probably something he&apos;d held inside for a long time. It was emotional for me. Again, both sides lost.&quot; </p>
