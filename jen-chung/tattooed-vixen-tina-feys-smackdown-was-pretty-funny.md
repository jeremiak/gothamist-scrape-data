										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_04_mcgeefey.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174113im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_mcgeefey.jpg" width="250" height="166" class="image-left"> </span>On Saturday Night Live, when not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174113/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/11/tina_fey_spoofs_sarah_palin_slams_m.php">yucking it up with Justin Bieber and Mark Sanchez</a>, Tina Fey took harsh aim at Michelle McGee (see video below), the woman who had an affair with Sandra Bullock&apos;s husband, and said her body &quot;like a dirt bag&#x2019;s binder from 7th grade metal shop.&quot; McGee now tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174113/http://www.insideedition.com/">Inside Edition</a>, which is airing an interview with her tonight and tomorrow, &#x201C;<strong>It&#x2019;s really pretty funny.  People like to pick on my tattoos and stuff.  And, that&#x2019;s fine.</strong>&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
But what&apos;s not so fine is when Fey compared her to a whore: &quot;That is kind of hurtful because she doesn&#x2019;t know me.  She doesn&#x2019;t know my side of the story.&quot; Inside Edition also brought up how Fey &quot;said if Hitler were alive, he&#x2019;d be on Sandra Bullock&#x2019;s side,&quot; which prompted McGee to reply, &#x201C;<strong>That&#x2019;s very hurtful to bring that up.  Hitler.  That stuff is just wrong.</strong>&quot;  When IE pointed out that there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174113/http://www.tmz.com/2010/03/20/jesse-james-sandra-bullock-michelle-mcgee-nazi-swastika-mistress-photos/">photographs of McGee with swastikas</a>, the tattoo enthusiast admitted, &quot;It is one of my biggest regrets -- that photo shoot... I was very stupid [to get a swastika tattoo 15 years ago]&#x2026; I am not a racist.  I am not a white supremacist.  I am not a Nazi&#x2026;I don&#x2019;t have those views.&quot;</p>

<p>Overall, McGee says, &quot;Tina Fey is funny.  She is just doing her job - to make people laugh,&quot; and would be happy to appear on TV, &quot;Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to be on Saturday Night Live?&quot;</p>
