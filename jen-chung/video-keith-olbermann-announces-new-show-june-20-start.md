He explained, &quot;I wanted to go somewhere where i could expand upon and enlarge upon the work I&apos;d already done.<strong>..a place where journalistic integrity and analytical honesty would never be compromised by corporate synergy</strong>... I found that place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063603/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/08/keith_olbermann_going_to_al_gores_c.php">at Current TV</a>...  where they gave me a title, an equity stake, and a PONY.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063603/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/olbermann-relaunches-countdown-on-current-tv/">Media Decoder says</a> that MSNBC doesn&apos;t have a comment yet about Olbermann&apos;s decision to re-use Countdown for his new show and adds, &quot;Current TV has a much lower audience base that MSNBC. The channel averages fewer than 25,000 viewers in prime time; at MSNBC Mr. Olbermann often commanded audiences exceeding 1 million. The channel&#x2019;s executives have called Mr. Olbermann the best investment they have ever made. (His salary has not been disclosed, but he was granted an equity stake in Current, along with a management role.)&quot;</p>

<p>Olbermann was a highly rated talk show host on MSNBC, but he wore out his welcome after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063603/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/olbermann_returns_calls_nbcs_policy.php">not disclosing political donations to management</a>.</p>
