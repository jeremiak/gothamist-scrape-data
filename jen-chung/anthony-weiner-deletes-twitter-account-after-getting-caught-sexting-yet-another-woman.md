<p>Anthony Weiner, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">resigned from Congress in 2011</a> after accidentally publicly tweeting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php">crotch selfie</a> he meant to send privately and whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/22/anthony_weiner_announces_mayoral_ru.php">2013 mayoral campaign</a> was torpedoed by more sexting (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">this time as &quot;Carlos Danger&quot;</a>), has been sexting again, to no one&apos;s surprise. But what is surprising, and distressing, is that this time one of his sexting photos included his young son in the frame. Weiner has now deleted his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/https://twitter.com/anthonyweiner">prolific Twitter account</a>. </p>

<p><em><b>Update</b>: Three strikes and he&apos;s out&#x2014;Weiner&apos;s wife Huma Abedin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/huma_abedin_weiner_separation.php">announced she&apos;s separating from him</a>.<br>

The NY Post&apos;s exclusive, on the front page of course, is headlined, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/">Anthony Weiner sexted busty brunette while his son was in bed with him.</a>&quot; The paper obtained the images from the woman, a &quot;40-something divorcee ... [who] is his polar opposite politically: a self-avowed supporter of Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association who&#x2019;s used Twitter to bash both President Obama and Clinton.&quot; </p>

<p>The woman told the Post they had been texting and sexting via Twitter from January of 2015 up until this month:</p><blockquote>The latest online dalliance developed when Weiner began exchanging direct messages with her via Twitter following an online clash with a second woman, according to the gal.<p></p>

<p>As their conversation progressed, she mentioned having &#x201C;over 30 nieces and nephews,&#x201D; at which point Weiner responded by asking: &#x201C;Wow. Got your own? (Weiner sees opening to ask about [your] status).&#x201D;</p>

<p>When she tried to end the conversation by saying &#x201C;it&#x2019;s time for bed,&#x201D; Weiner wrote back: &#x201C;Sleeping alone? Asking for a friend?&#x201D; before adding, &#x201C;That was a fib.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Weiner frequently steered the conversation toward sex, as many of their discussions initially involved such mundane topics as their respective workout regimens.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I am always, uh, raging after the gym,&#x201D; he wrote in one of several apparent references to his genitalia.</p>

<p>Another time, he wrote about how &#x201C;Id [sic] put someone&#x2019;s eye out with this thing. #Overdue.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>The Post also published selfie photos that the woman sent to Weiner, as well as Weiner&apos;s reactions (&quot;I did not sleep well...&#x2002;Horny as f-k&quot;). And Weiner allegedly suggested meeting up in NYC (the woman lives on the other side of the country), &quot;Lets get together. I&#x2019;m a big wheel in this town.&quot;<p></p>

<p>As for the photograph with his son, Weiner had been texting with the woman at 3 a.m. on July 31, 2015, telling her, &quot;Someone just climbed into my bed,&quot; and then sent &quot;the cringe-inducing image, which shows a bulge in his white, Jockey-brand boxer briefs and his son cuddled up to his left, wrapped in a light-green blanket.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/">Weiner told the Post </a>that he knew the woman, saying that they have been friends for some time: &quot;She has asked me not to comment except to say that our conversations were private, often included pictures of her nieces and nephews and my son and were always appropriate.&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner&apos;s wife is Huma Abedin, Democratic presidential candidate&apos;s Hillary Clinton&apos;s right-hand woman. The couple has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/11/anthony_weiner_marries_huma_abedin.php">been married since 2010,</a> and their son Jordan was born in 2011. Abedin has been steadfastly by his side throughout, and in 2013, when Weiner apologized for the Carlos Danger scandal, she described the period as a &quot;difficult&quot; time in their marriage, during a press conference. </p>

<p>The couple reportedly went into &quot;intensive&quot; therapy together, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015249/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20721790,00.html">friend told People magazine why Abedin</a> didn&apos;t leave Weiner: &quot;Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse. She never wanted Jordan to say to her, &apos;Why didn&apos;t you do everything you could to help Dad?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Now Weiner&apos;s Twitter account is gone</p>
