<p>Former Mayor Bloomberg has been pretty quiet since leaving office. He took a barrage of criticism during Mayor de Blasio&apos;s inauguration and hasn&apos;t really spoken to the press, except for an interview with Katie Couric for Yahoo (he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821060206/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bloomberg-takes-aim-de-blasio-policies-article-1.1722371">complained about de Blasio&apos;s policies, natch</a>). But now he&apos;s got a huge initiative that taps into his billions: Creating an organization, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821060206/http://everytown.org/">Everytown</a>, to counter the National Rife Association and gun lobbyists. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821060206/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/us/bloomberg-plans-a-50-million-challenge-to-the-nra.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">Bloomberg told the NY Times</a> about the grassroots effort, &quot;You&#x2019;ve got to work at it piece by piece. One mom and another mom. You&#x2019;ve got to wear them down until they finally say, &#x2018;Enough.&#x2019;&quot; Bloomberg has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821060206/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/16/bloomberg_demands_gun_control_leade.php">fighting for gun control reform</a> while mayor, but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821060206/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/bloomberg_children_lost_theyre_goin.php">disappointing results</a>. From the Times:</p><blockquote>Mr. Bloomberg&#x2019;s blueprint reimagines the way gun control advocates have traditionally confronted the issue. Rather than relying so heavily on television ad campaigns, Mr. Bloomberg will put a large portion of his resources into the often-unseen field operations that have been effective for groups like the N.R.A. in driving single-issue, like-minded voters to the polls.<p></p>

<p>Women, and mothers in particular, will be the focus of the organizing and outreach, a path that he and his advisers have modeled after groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving...</p>

<p>He was also dismissive of skeptics who might question whether he could ever build an organization that rivaled the N.R.A. And he seemed unaware of, or unwilling to acknowledge, the ways in which his own persona &#x2014; of a billionaire, Big Gulp-banning former mayor of New York &#x2014; could undercut his efforts, especially in rural, conservative states.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what your perception is of our reputation, and mine, the name Bloomberg around the country,&#x201D; he said. But every place he goes, he added, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a rock star. People yelling out of cabs, &#x2018;Hey, way to go!&#x2019; </p></blockquote>The head of Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt, told the Times, &quot;He&#x2019;s got the money to waste. So I guess he&#x2019;s free to do so. But frankly, I think he&#x2019;s going to find out why his side keeps losing.&quot;<p></p>

<p>But Bloomberg is confident&#x2014;plus he&apos;s rich! He &quot;said with a shrug,&quot; &quot;I put $50 million this year, last year into coal, $53 million into oceans. Certainly a number like that, $50 million. Let&#x2019;s see what happens.&quot; Here&apos;s a little of what the money is going towards:</p>

<p>A press release for Everytown stated, &quot;Everytown will ask Americans to join the fight to reduce the gun violence that kills 86 Americans every day and affects every town - big cities and small towns alike.  This means continuing to press for change in Washington and moving beyond Congress to bring the fight for common-sense gun policies to state capitols, corporate boards, and state and federal elections - fields of play formerly occupied almost solely by the gun lobby.  Supporters of Everytown will back candidates and legislation that will save lives, donate to the group&#x2019;s efforts and take action to raise awareness for important issues like guns in schools, domestic violence, child access to guns, suicide and the other ways that gun violence affects all Americans.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, Bloomberg totally believes in Heaven because he&apos;s bought admission, &quot;I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I&#x2019;m not stopping to be interviewed. I am heading straight in. I have earned my place in heaven. It&#x2019;s not even close.&quot;</p>
