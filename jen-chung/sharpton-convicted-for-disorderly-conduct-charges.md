Sharpton had organized a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194337/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/07/sean_bell_civil.php">number of civil disobedience events around the city</a> to protest the acquittals of three police officers whose gun fire killed unarmed Sean Bell in November 2006. Sharpton had promised to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194337/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/27/sharpton_promis.php">shut down the city with the protests</a>, which was situated at bridge and tunnel crossings and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194337/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/08/over_200_arrest.php">over 200 people were arrested</a>, though most of the cases were ultimately dismissed.  WNBC reports that Sharpton and the other defendants were <strong>sentenced to time already served</strong> (Sharpton had served  5 1/2 hours in jail).  </p>
