Tell him what to do&quot; (supposedly what Mario told a consultant about Andrew) and &quot;There was this sense of rivalry &#x2014; Andrew seemed to feel that his dad talked a good game but that he, Andrew, got things done&quot; (someone who worked under Andrew Cuomo at HUD).  But what&apos;s interesting is how the 1977 mayoral campaign comes into play.</p>

<p>Back in 1977, Mario Cuomo was battling Ed Koch for the NYC mayorship, and there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228092118/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/27/the_spirit_of_7.php">nasty campaign posters saying </a>&quot;Vote For Cuomo, Not The Homo.&quot;  When Andrew Cuomo was running for attorney general in 2006 (after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228092118/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo#New_York_Gubernatorial_Campaign_2002">his failed 2002 gubernatorial run</a> and divorce from Kerry Kennedy), the NY Times reports, &quot;Mario approached George Arzt, a former press secretary to Mr. Koch, at the Regency Hotel in New York and told him, &#x201C;&#x2018;I&#x2019;d like to patch things up with Ed,&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; Mr. Arzt recalled. &#x201C;I asked him what he had in mind. And he said, &#x2018;Could Ed endorse Andrew?&#x2019;&quot;  Which Koch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228092118/http://www.shortnews.com/start.cfm?id=54940">did do</a>.</p>

<p>Koch, for his part, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228092118/http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/andrew-cuomo-bio#ixzz0mtDhXsLX">told Esquire</a>,  &quot;The signs said, VOTE FOR CUOMO, NOT THE HOMO. Andrew says he didn&apos;t do it, and I believe him. Mario says he thinks he now knows who did it. I was very angry at the time. Primary races always end in anger. They&apos;re different than the general election: They&apos;re like a civil war &#x2014; it&apos;s brother against brother. But I&apos;ve forgiven them. I&apos;m eighty-five now, and grudges take your energy away. I&apos;ve forgiven them all.&quot;</p>
