<p>Kelly said, &quot;He calls the police, at the 114th precinct and states that &apos;<strong>we had a dispute, I threw her against the wall and somebody should go check to see if she&apos;s alright.</strong>&apos; When police respond, her body is found in the bathtub surrounded by ice. She had trauma to the head.&quot;  Apparently the NYPD visited a Rite Aid near the couple&apos;s 33rd Street apartment, telling a manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130702045047/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-nypd-hunts-ivy-league-lawyer-after-young-girlfriend-found-dead-20120627,0,106267.story">that Bohn bought ice there</a>.  When police discovered her body, they found she had been beaten and strangled.</p>

<p>Thomas, 27, and Bohn, 33, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130702045047/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120628/astoria/murdered-astoria-womans-new-york-dream-cut-short">met last fall in Florida</a>, where they both attended the University of Florida (Bohn went to law school there; he also has a bachelor&apos;s and master&apos;s from Columbia). Thomas had left her finance job at Disney to move to New York, working at Weight Watchers as a financial analyst, to be with Bohn. A friend told the Post that before the move, the couple had a long-distance relationship, &quot;When she visited him, he at one point threw her out in the cold. When a friend took her in, he managed to get her to come back and tell him what the friend had said &#x2014; and then [he] threatened the friend.&quot;</p>

<p>After moving here in March, Bohn&apos;s abuse continued and earlier this month, Thomas went to the 114th Precinct to ask for a restraining order, after being beaten in the face and body by Bohn in May (according to the Post, he &quot;beat her so severely that the bruises on Thomas&#x2019; face and back were still showing two weeks later, when she reported the assault to cops&quot;).  While she was at the precinct, Bohn allegedly yelled at her on the cellphone, &quot;It&#x2019;s war! I&#x2019;ll dedicate my life to hunting you down like a dog in the streets. I am going to make your life impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>The friend added, &quot;I think everyone who heard anything about the situation now believes he&#x2019;s a sociopath, and we feel terrible about giving her no more than token resistance when she said she was moving in with him.&quot; </p>
