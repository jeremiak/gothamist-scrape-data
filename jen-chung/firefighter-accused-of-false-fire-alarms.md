Nicholas Vrettos allegedly made a dozen calls about fires, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151531/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/nyc.firefighter.arrested.2.885438.html">one in a school cafeteria</a>, on December 4 (when the cuts were announced).  Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said, &quot;<strong>You&apos;re taking a unit away from what might be a real emergency where somebody is having a heart attack or there&apos;s a fire or any other life-threatening emergency and that&apos;s the danger and that&apos;s why this is a felony</strong>,&quot; but a City Island resident, who did not condone calling in false alarms, told NY1, &quot;If it in any way illustrated our plight, it at least had that effect.&quot; Vrettos could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151531/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/nyregion/12firefighter.html?ref=nyregion">face up to seven in prison</a>.</p>
