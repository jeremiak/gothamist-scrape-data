</div></div>					Yesterday, two groups of protesters faced off over the controversial mosque and community center proposed for 45-47 Park Place.  Hundreds of people were there&#x2014;the anti-mosque folks had props (a fake missile) and a patriotic mix tape (yes, &quot;Born on the U.S.A.&quot; was included).   Here&apos;s a sampling of what was shouted or written on signs:
<ul><li>Supporters: &quot;America! When did it become OK to be a bigot!&quot; &quot;Hallowed ground, that&apos;s a lie!&quot; Opponents:  &quot;Obama, your middle-name is Hussain [sic], we understand. Bloomberg, what&apos;s your excuse.&quot;  [<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134149/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/22/2010-08-22_antiground_zero_mosque_protestors_descend_on_downtown_park51_site.html">Daily News</a></em>]</li>

<li>Supporters: &quot;Fascists get out!&quot; &quot;Stop the fear and hate.&quot;  Opponents, while chanting &quot;USA!&quot;: &quot;No clubhouse for terrorists.&quot; [<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134149/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/clash_at_world_trade_mosque_site_gMRqABsOKMICgDL7S4baYN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">NY Post</a></em>]</li>

<li>&quot;Thousands of people died here. I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but just because you have the right to do something doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s the right thing to do.&quot;&#x2014;Jersey City resident Bob Brennan [<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134149/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/clash_at_world_trade_mosque_site_gMRqABsOKMICgDL7S4baYN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">NY Post</a></em>]

</li><li>&quot;It&#x2019;s a disgrace to have a mosque at this sacred site.&quot;&#x2014;Kali Costas, Tea Party member  [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134149/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/nyregion/23protest.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss"><em>NY Times</em></a>] </li>
<li>&quot;Land of the free. Stop sharia before it stops you.&quot; &quot;No mosque here. Preserve the dignity of our loved ones killed on 9/11.&quot; [<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134149/http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/08/22/new.york.mosque.protests/index.html?hpt=T1">CNN</a></em>]</li>
<li>&quot;The mosque shouldn&apos;t be here!  ...There is an un-Godly, unholy thing gonna go up two blocks away from this site. Absolutely not!&quot;&#x2014;Barry Bledsoe, a West Virginia resident who brought his 9-year-old son to the protest [<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134149/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/22/2010-08-22_antiground_zero_mosque_protestors_descend_on_downtown_park51_site.html">Daily News</a></em>]</li>
<li>&quot;We support religious freedom but at some point in our lives, we have to have a little common sense, and a little sensitivity.&quot;&#x2014;retired firefighter Daryl Patterson [<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134149/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/22/ground-zero-mosque-rallies-held-sunday/">WCBS 2</a></em>]</li></ul>
The Times also noted that one supporter of the project, medical student Michael Rose, held a sign that said, &quot;Religious tolerance is what makes America great&quot;: &quot;An argument broke out, punctuated by angry fingers pointed in the student&#x2019;s face. One man, his cheeks red, leaned in and hissed that if the police were not present, Mr. Rose would be in danger.&quot;  The police took Rose away; later on, the red-cheeked man apologized, &quot;You have a right. I am sorry for what I said to you. I disagree with you completely, but you have a right.&quot;   Good times!
