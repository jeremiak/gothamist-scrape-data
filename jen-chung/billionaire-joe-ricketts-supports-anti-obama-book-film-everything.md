<p>Last week, it was revealed that billionaire TD Ameritrade founder, Cubs buyer and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803165719/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/dnainfos_billionaire_founder_really.php">DNAinfo backer</a> Joe Ricketts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803165719/http://chicagoist.com/2012/05/17/billionaire_cubs_owner_joe_ricketts.php">was considering a $10 million advertising campaign</a> to attack President Obama, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803165719/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/us/politics/gop-super-pac-weighs-hard-line-attack-on-obama.html?pagewanted=all">offering provocative, potentially race-baiting ideas</a> to show the world &quot;Jeremiah Wright and understand his influence on Barack Obama for the first time in a big, attention-arresting way.&quot;  While Ricketts claimed he rejected the proposal, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803165719/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/us/politics/joe-ricketts-finds-new-role-in-anti-obama-campaign.html">NY Times reports today</a> that he  is involved in another effort slated for this summer, a documentary film based on a widely criticized book, &apos;The Roots of Obama&#x2019;s Rage&apos; by Dinesh D&#x2019;Souza, &quot;<strong>which asserts that Mr. Obama is carrying out the &apos;anticolonial&apos; agenda of his Kenyan father</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>MediaMatters has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803165719/http://mediamatters.org/research/201010040030">details refuting D&apos;Souza&apos;s thesis</a>&#x2014;and even conservatives think the book is faulty.  According the Times, &quot;The columnist George F. Will urged Republicans to &#x201C;recoil&#x201D; from such views, and wrote last year: &apos;To the notion that Obama has a Kenyan, anticolonial worldview, the sensible response is: If only.&apos; A review of &apos;The Roots of Obama&#x2019;s Rage&apos; in The Weekly Standard criticized it for &apos;misstatements of fact, leaps in logic, and pointlessly elaborate argumentation.&apos;&quot; In fact, the Weekly Standard&apos;s review is titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803165719/http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/roots-lunacy_508809.html">&quot;The Roots of Lunacy: How not to understand Obama.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Still, Ricketts is one of about a dozen investors in the documentary and also paid of newspaper and online ads promoting the book in 2010 (sample slogan: &#x201C;The real Barack Obama is even worse than you think&quot;).  The Times reports, &quot;A spokesman for Mr. Ricketts said that he had supported the book and the movie only because of his friendship with Mr. D&#x2019;Souza, whom he has known for several years. The two men became acquainted through the American Enterprise Institute, a spokesman said, when Mr. D&#x2019;Souza, now president of the King&#x2019;s College in New York, was a scholar there and Mr. Ricketts was on its board of trustees.&quot; Ricketts also told the Times he was a &quot;proud supporter of [D&apos;Souza&apos;s] scholarship.&quot;</p>
