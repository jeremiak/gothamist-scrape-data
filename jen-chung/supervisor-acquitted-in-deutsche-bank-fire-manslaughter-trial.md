<p>Nearly four years after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701032732/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/19/two_firefighter.php">seven-alarm fire killed two firefighters</a> at the under-dismantling Deutsche Bank site, a construction supervisor was acquitted of manslaughter charges. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701032732/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/28/2011-06-28_construction_foreman_acquitted_of_all_charges_in_deaths_of_two_firefighters_in_d.html">Salvatore DePaola  cried</a> after also being cleared of criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment, &quot;It&apos;s a happy day and a sad day, We&apos;ve still got two firefighters that are deceased.&quot;</p>

<p>Firefighters Joseph Graffagnino, 34, and Robert Beddia, 56, died in the blaze that was started by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701032732/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/18/one_year_after_fatal_deutsche_bank.php">construction worker&apos;s cigarette</a>.  A large piece of the standpipe&#x2014;which would have carried water up to the firefighters&#x2014;was missing, leaving them without resources to battle the flames.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701032732/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/nyregion/judge-in-bronx-murder-trial-accommodates-frightened-witness.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Prosecutors charged that a crew working under Mr. DePaola, 56, removed part of a standpipe during abatement work in the fall of 2006... Mr. DePaola, [co-defendant  Jeffrey]  Melofchik, the site safety supervisor, and a third defendant, Mitchel Alvo, the director of abatement, ignored the removal of a 42-foot section of the standpipe as they rushed to finish the abatement work on time to protect the corporate bottom line, prosecutors argued.&quot;</p>

<p>DePaolo claimed that he had no idea it was a standpipe, because it was black like &quot;5,000 other pipes in the building.&quot; And apparently jurors believed him.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701032732/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/deutsche_bank_contracter_found_not_r8IIytYrswxr2ixNgkryMN">Graffagnino&apos;s widow told the Post</a>, &quot;My comment is this..I could care less about Salvatore DiPaolo and his comments. His acquittal doesn&apos;t affect my life or the lives of my children one way or another. The only good that could come of this is that maybe the next time he works on a job of such importance, he will be more conscious of his actions and how they might affect his life or the lives of others....as far as I&apos;m concerned this was the fault of many..many of who will never be held accountable.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides questions about building safety practices during the dismantling of the former Deutsche Bank site, which was ravaged by the 9/11 attacks, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701032732/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/22/fire_3.php">tragedy also raised concerns</a> that the FDNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701032732/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/26/new_memo_reveal.php">was not doing enough for the building&apos;s safety either</a>.</p>
