<p>The criminal charges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160928113158/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/18/bobby_shmurda_arrest.php">against Bobby Shmurda</a> were revealed yesterday, and the Brooklyn-born rapper is now accused of conspiracy, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and criminally using drug paraphernalia. When he was arrested on Wednesday, while inside a car outside a Midtown recording studio, prosecutors claim he had a gun near him and another one in a duffel bag on his lap, not to mention a &quot;small quantity of crack-cocaine&quot; in the vehicle.</p>

<p>Shmurda, whose real name is Ackquille Pollard, was charged alongside numerous others for allegedly being part of the GS9&#x2014;&quot;G Stone Crips&quot;&#x2014;gang based in East Flatbush. According to the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor, &quot;[M]embers of GS9 engaged in violent disputes with rival gangs, committed murder and carried out numerous non-fatal shootings. GS9 members are also charged in multiple instances of gunfire in public locations in which no one was shot in both New York City and Miami, Fla.&quot; </p><blockquote>The investigation revealed that GS9 is a criminal street organization operating in and around the geographical area of East 95th Street from Kings Highway to East New York Avenue in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. During the course of the conspiracy, between January 2013 and October 2014, members of the gang are charged with committing murder, assault, weapons possession, narcotics possession and sales and other crimes in order to maintain their dominance of this territory.<br>
&#xA0;<br>
Much of the violence in the case stemmed from an ongoing dispute between GS9 and members of rival street gangs, including the gang known as &#x201C;Folk Nation&#x201D; and the gang known as &#x201C;Brooklyn&#x2019;s Most Wanted&#x201D; or &#x201C;BMW&#x201D;.<br>
&#xA0;<br>
As violence escalated, members of GS9 sought to shoot members of rival gangs, often discussing their efforts and plotting additional attacks in recorded phone conversations with incarcerated GS9 members.<br>
&#xA0;<br>
Members of GS9 sold narcotics in order to make money and had frequent discussions about narcotics trafficking during recorded phone conversations. The gang maintained stash locations for firearms and narcotics.<br>
&#xA0;<br>
A distinctive system of code words and phrases allowed GS9 members to communicate with one another while hiding the nature of their communication from others. Among the code words for firearms were &#x201C;tone&#x201D; and &#x201C;socks&#x201D;. &#x201C;Crills&#x201D; referred to narcotics and &#x201C;suntan&#x201D; or &#x201C;scoom&#x201D; referred to shootings.</blockquote>Prosecutors claim that in April, Shmurda stated, &quot;I am two socks Bobby right now.&quot; Shmurda was arrested in June for gun possession&#x2014;per the prosecution, &quot;ACKQUILLE POLLARD is alleged to have fired a gun towards a crowd of people outside a barber shop at 1088 Clarkson Avenue on June 2, 2014, shattering a glass storefront. In a recorded phone conversation that day, a GS9 member told DEVON RODNEY that ACKQUILLE POLLARD fired the gun during an argument with his brother JAVESE POLLARD, aka &apos;Fame&apos;, who is also a GS9 member.&quot;<p></p>
