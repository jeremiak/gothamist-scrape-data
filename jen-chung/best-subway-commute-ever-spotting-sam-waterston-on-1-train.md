<p>Being underground on a steamy subway platform can be sweaty and soul-crushing.  Which is why spotting Sam Waterston this morning&#x2014;waiting for a train with a crowd of commuters&#x2014;was like a mirage.  When he entered the crowded 1 train, he took out his glasses and studied the subway map&#x2014;perhaps he was trying to figure out what station would be his best bet to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/mapping_law_orders_first_season.php">check out some of these spots</a>.</p>

<p>There were so many things we wished to say to the man who portrayed Jack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://badassoftheweek.com/mccoy.html">&quot;Hang &apos;Em High&quot;</a> McCoy for two decades (&quot;Did you see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/16/best_law_order_food_tumblr_ever.php#photo-1">Law and Order and Food Tumblr</a>? Isn&apos;t the noise <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/26/the_law_order_noise_is_chung_chung.php">&apos;Chung-chung&apos;</a>? Was it weird to work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I&apos;ll_Fly_Away_(TV_series)">with both</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102388/">London twins</a>?&quot;)  but since it was a packed subway car, we decided to leave it at &quot;Are you Sam Waterston?&quot;&#x2014;&quot;Yes&quot; he replied with a smile&#x2014; &quot;I&apos;m a HUGE fan of your work&quot;&#x2014;&quot;Thank you&quot;&#x2014;and &quot;Have a nice day!&quot;  </p>

<p>And first thing we did upon getting to the office? Reflect upon some of our favorite Waterson moments:</p>

<p>Unless we are lucky enough to spot him on the subway again, we guess we&apos;ll just wait to see him on Aaron Sorkin&apos;s HBO cable news network drama, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom/index.html"><em>The Newsroom</em></a> when it premieres June 24... or at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081546/http://www.tntdrama.com/series/lawandorder/">4 p.m. on TNT today</a>.</p>
