<p>While 49ers fans were verklempt after Saturday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525114636/http://sfist.com/2012/01/16/daisy_does_the_niners_sfs_emotional.php#photo-1">emotional&#x2014;and exciting!&#x2014;win over the Saints</a>, Giants safety Antrel Rolle believes they will be crying for different reasons this Sunday during the NFC championship.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525114636/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/01/17/confident-antrel-rolle-giants-wont-be-denied/">He said yesterday</a>, &quot;We are not going to be denied...We understand what we have as a team. It&#x2019;s not all talent, it&#x2019;s about chemistry and we are jelling at this point. Coaches and players being one the same page at the same time. We have one mind, to win a championship.&quot;</p>

<p>And today, he said during his weekly WFAN stint, &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t take the field if I felt otherwise. I think we&#x2019;re believing as a team. And I think we understand where we are, we understand where we&#x2019;re trying to get to and we understand what it&#x2019;s going to take for us to get there. We&#x2019;re doing everything in our power. And like I said, we won&#x2019;t be denied at this point.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Fun fact&#x2014;Rolle&apos;s blood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525114636/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/giantsblog/giants_rolle_to_ers_careful_what_7vqwNaI5Saew4CFhw5hKMP">vessels are filled with blood</a>: &quot;I don&#x2019;t give a damn who we&#x2019;ll be playing. I&#x2019;ll take any opponent any given day. I don&#x2019;t shy away from any opponent. My heart doesn&#x2019;t pump any Kool Aid, only blood. I&#x2019;m ready to play whenever, however, whenever, however. I&#x2019;m ready for it.&quot;  So, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525114636/http://sfist.com/2012/01/17/five_things_that_make_someone_a_49e.php">49ers Bandwagonies</a>, get ready.</p>
