<p>Earlier today, NJ Governor Chris Christie signed a bill banning the gay conversion therapy on minors. The bill, which says it &quot;prohibits counseling to change the sexual orientation of a minor,&quot; passed with bipartisan support in both the NJ Assembly and State Senate, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823022556/http://nj.gov/governor/news/news/552013/approved/20130819a.html">Christie noted</a>, &quot;The American Psychological Association has found that efforts to change sexual orientation can pose critical health risks including, but not limited to, depression, substance abuse, social withdrawal, decreased self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie, who will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823022556/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/chris_christie_is_using_george_w_bu.php">probably be running for President in 2016</a>, believes that people are born gay, but hadn&apos;t confirmed whether he would sign such a bill. In his statement, he said:</p><blockquote>At the outset of this debate, I expressed my concerns about government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children.  I still have those concerns.  Government should tread carefully into this area and I do so here reluctantly.  I have scrutinized this piece of legislation with that concern in mind.<p></p>

<p>However, I also believe that on issues of medical treatment for children we must look to experts in the field to determine the relative risks and rewards.  The American Psychological Association has found that efforts to change sexual orientation can pose critical health risks including, but not limited to, depression, substance abuse, social withdrawal, decreased self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p> I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate.  Based upon this analysis, I sign this bill into law.</p></blockquote>NJ is the second state to ban gay conversion therapy; California was the first, but it&apos;s being challenged. <p></p>
