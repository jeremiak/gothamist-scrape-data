<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034529/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/02/6_great_options_to_celebrate_nation.php">many ways</a> to enjoy an ice cream sandwich, but the most elegant option may be Macaron Ice Cream Sandwiches from Francois Payard. </p>

<p>The delicate meringue cookie surrounds fresh made ice cream or sorbet, which is perfect for a hot summer day when you don&apos;t want anything heavy. Flavors include Pistachio Raspberry, Chocolate, Coconut Mango and Strawberry Cheesecake. We tried a few recently and our favorite was the Strawberry Cheesecake, for the cheesecake ice cream&apos;s slightly savory tang mixing with the refreshing strawberry sorbet.</p>
