<p>A woman was groped at a lower Manhattan subway station last month, and now police have released surveillance footage of the suspect, who remains at large.</p>

<p>The incident occurred just after 7 p.m on November 19th, at the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station on Chambers Street. According to the NYPD, &quot;the individual followed the 25 year-old female victim onto the subway platform and grabbed her buttocks and private area from behind as she boarded the train.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect fled the station and is now wanted for forcible touching. He is described as  20 to 30 years old, 5&apos;8&quot; to 5&apos;10&quot; and 140 to 160 pounds. He has a beard and was last seen wearing a black backpack, a black jacket and a white T-shirt.<br>
