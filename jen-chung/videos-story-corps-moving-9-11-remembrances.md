<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122044501/http://storycorps.org/">StoryCorps </a>collected over a thousand remembrances from September 11, 2001 victims&apos; families and friends as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122044501/http://storycorps.org/initiatives/september-11th/">part of its 9/11 Initiative</a>.  So, far, 583 victims have been represented and StoryCorps has produced three, incredibly moving and lovely animated shorts. In &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122044501/http://storycorps.org/animation/always-a-family/">Always a Family</a>,&quot; Monique Ferrer remembers how her ex-husband and the father of two children Michael Trinidad called from the 103rd floor at the North Tower: &quot;The only thing on his mind was to tell the kids that he loved them.&quot;  </p>

<p>Story Corps founder Dave Isay tells us, &quot;I think it&apos;s impossible for the human mind and heart to process a tragedy  of this magnitude&#x2014;the only way we can try to understand it is to break it down into individual stories.   I hope these animations help people, just for a moment, walk in the footsteps of the families who lost loved ones ten years ago&#x2014;so we can begin to comprehend all that was lost on that day.   Someone wrote into us yesterday saying something like &apos;some wounds don&apos;t heal, some heartbreaks never mend&#x2014;honoring the memories of the lost is the best the rest of can do.&apos;  I think that pretty well sums it up.&quot;</p>

<p>The animation was by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122044501/http://rauchbrothers.com/">The Rauch Brothers</a> and the shorts were art directed by Bill Wray. The other videos are &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122044501/http://storycorps.org/animation/john-and-joe/">John and Joe</a>&quot; (John Vigiano Sr, a retired New York City firefighter, remembers his sons John Jr., a firefighter, and Joe, a police detective) and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122044501/http://storycorps.org/animation/she-was-the-one/">She Was The One</a>&quot; (Richie Pecorella on his love for for fiancee Karen Juday, who worked as an administrative assistant at the World Trade Center).
