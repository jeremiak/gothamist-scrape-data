<p>In various parts of the city, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327090154/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/photos_cars_are_floating_through_fl.php#photo-1">Hurricane Sandy&apos;s destructive force</a> can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327090154/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/29/hurricane_sandy_photos_2015.php">still be felt today</a>. And that&apos;s why the MTA will be closing the main entrance of the South Ferry station until August 2016.</p>

<p>The station, which had received a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327090154/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/16/new_south_ferry_subway_station_fina.php">beautiful $530 million renovation that ended in 2009</a>, was totally flooded during Sandy. </p>

<p>According to the MTA, &quot;In October 2012, Superstorm Sandy sent 15 million gallons of salt water into the new South Ferry station, destroying all electrical and mechanical systems and components and filling the entire structure from the track level to the mezzanine, a depth of 80 feet.  The flood water, a mix of seawater, sewage, and debris, caused extensive damage to the station and critical equipment.&quot;</p>

<p>They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327090154/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/photos_south_ferry_station_is_dry_n.php">managed to pump the water out</a>, but the station didn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327090154/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/04/photos_the_very_first_train_of_the.php">reopen until April of 2013</a>. Now, as part of the &quot;ongoing 31-month rehabilitation project,&quot; the station will get permanent watertight doors (the current ones are temporary panels) on the street level. Plus:</p><blockquote> Below grade, redundant flood mitigation features will be added, including flood barrier walls between stations (South Ferry Loop Station and Whitehall Street Station).  Watertight doors will also be installed to protect critical rooms, and louver covers will be installed on interior walls at critical rooms.  Other entry points for water such as vents, manholes and hatches, conduits, and ducts will also be hardened.</blockquote>The entrance will close on Monday, November 2. Subway riders will still be able to access the 1 and R trains through the Staten Island Ferry terminal building or from the Whitehall Street entrance.<p></p>
