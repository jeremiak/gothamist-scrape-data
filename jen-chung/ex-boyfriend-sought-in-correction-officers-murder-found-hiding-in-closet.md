<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_12_abryan1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015135im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_12_abryan1.jpg" width="200" height="259"> <br> <i style=" width:200px; ;display:block"> Alastasia Bryan</i></div> Police have arrested a man wanted for allegedly setting an ex-girlfriend&apos;s car on fire in Brooklyn in October. That man also happens to be the ex-boyfriend of a rookie Correction officer who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015135/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/05/correction_officer_shot_dead.php">fatally shot while she sat in her car</a>.<p></p>

<p>Investigators were interested in talking to Keon Richmond, 34, about the killing of Alastasia Bryan, 25, who was off-duty when she was found dead in her car at East 73rd Street and Avenue L in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, on December 4th around 9:15 p.m. </p>

<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said that she had left her mother&apos;s house to make a phone call when the shooter walked up to the car, a new Infiniti, and fired five times.</p>

<p>The shooter then fled west on Avenue L and got into what the police say is a gold or tan colored 4-door Hyundai Elantra. </p>

<p>The shooter and another individual (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015135/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/09/correction_officer_killed_video.php">video</a>) are described as males in dark colored clothing.</p>

<p>When Richmond refused to return the car, Bryan had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015135/http://nypost.com/2016/12/14/cops-find-ex-beau-of-slain-corrections-officer-in-closet/">apparently reported it stolen</a>. </p>

<p>The New York-New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force found Richmond, a gang member with dozens of arrests and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015135/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161214/mill-basin/alastasia-bryan-murder-73rd-street-avenue-l-correction-officer">history of terrorizing girlfriends</a>, hiding in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015135/http://pix11.com/2016/12/14/ex-boyfriend-in-custody-in-slaying-of-correction-officer-in-brooklyn-sources/">closet in a Flatlands apartment</a>. </p>

<p>He has not been charged in Bryan&apos;s murder, just the arson. </p>
