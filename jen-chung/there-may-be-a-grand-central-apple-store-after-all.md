<p>Back in February, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144512/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/apple_store_may_be_on_grand_central.php">there were rumors</a> then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144512/http://www.observer.com/2011/real-estate/apple-sour-grand-central?utm_medium=partial-text&amp;utm_campaign=real-estate">rumors squashing rumors</a> that Apple would build a store on the Grand Central Terminal balcony.  Now, the rumors are back, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144512/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304066504576339624222852818.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">thanks to a Wall Street Journal report</a>.</p>

<p>The WSJ says, &quot;The agency is looking for a single renter for two adjacent balconies on the north and east sides of the terminal. It will issue a request for proposals Monday. The current tenant of one of the balconies, celebrity chef Charlie Palmer&apos;s M&#xE9;trazur restaurant, plans to close July 1 even though his lease ran until 2019 and the eatery was doing &apos;quite well,&apos; Mr. Palmer said Sunday.&quot; In order for Palmer to vacate, he&apos;ll need to be paid out, and Palmer explains, &quot;It&apos;s an offer that&apos;s hard to refuse. It&apos;s hard to compete with whatever that company might be that&apos;s taking the space.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Apple <em>is</em> interested because while the 15,000+ square foot space is not that large, it&apos;s in a prime location with tens of thousands of commuters and visitors: &quot;Retail experts said an Apple store in Grand Central could surpass the popularity of the store that&apos;s open 24 hours a day under the plaza in front the General Motors building. Apple&apos;s designers built that store by putting a glass cube leading into a basement on Fifth Avenue, and experts figure the computer maker would figure out a clever way to make the Grand Central site work.&quot;</p>

<p>Whomever the eventual tenant is will have to submit plans that win the approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. </p>
