<p>Police are reportedly questioning a man in connection to a violent home invasion in Williamsburg on Berry Street last night. Some reports indicate a female resident was the victim of an attempted sexual assault, but there&apos;s no official confirmation from the NYPD press office so far.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134308/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9204053">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;The suspect allegedly pushed his way into a third-floor Berry Street apartment home and attempted to sexually assault the victim. The incident happened around 7:50 p.m. Police say the suspect pushed his way in and struck the woman, in her 20s, in the head. He also attempted to sexually assault her before stealing her iPhone and fleeing the apartment.&quot; The victim was taken to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134308/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/intruder-attacks-woman-home-invasion-article-1.1425183">hospital for minor injuries</a>.</p>

<p>It&apos;s possible the same man may be responsible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134308/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/13/police-questioning-person-of-interest-in-connection-with-violent-brooklyn-home-invasion/">two other home invasions in the area</a> last night, one on Nassau Avenue in Greenpoint and the other at another Greenpoint home on Engert Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134308/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Williamsburg-Brooklyn-Home-Invasion-Robbery-Woman-Assaulted-219351521.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;A neighbor of the victim in the Berry Street attack told NBC 4 New York he saw a suspicious man who looked to be in his 20s or early 30s walking up and down the road about 20 minutes before the break-in. The neighbor said the person appeared to be eyeing different apartment buildings, and when he pulled out his cell phone to take a picture of him, the stranger ran into the building where the first victim lives.&quot;</p>

The evening is not a time when I think anyone needs to be worried. It&#x2019;s very busy around here, lots of restaurants, lots of people walking around so it&#x2019;s not an issue.&quot;</p>
