<p>In solidarity with World Naked Bike Ride, wear your hottest, fiercest hot pants on this clothing optional extravaganza through the streets of New York.</p>

<p>Climate change is real (Thanks Obama!) and it ain&apos;t getting any cooler out here. Get comfortable in our future climate and show some skin.</p>

<p>We love Short shorts! Mask up, pants down! As comfortable as you please.</p>

<p>Reclaim your body! Reclaim your streets! Reclaim your planet! Ride your bike! The Hot Pants Ride is a safer space for all bodies to ride free of harassment or pollutants in the physical or mental environment. To participate each rider is asked to respect that the liberation of bodies requires freedom, autonomy, and justice for all. This begins with joy and commitment to self-determination. And of course bikes!!!</p>

<p>What: An afternoon of fun, free community, and direct action, including a clothing-optional bike ride. We celebrate our bodies, celebrate cycling in NYC!</p>

Make sure the shape itself is comfortable and maybe get a new seat cover if you notice fraying, tears or other stuff that could make you even more uncomfortable than showing off your goods to strangers.&quot;<p></p>
