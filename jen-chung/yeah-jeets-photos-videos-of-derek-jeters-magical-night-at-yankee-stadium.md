</div></div>					<p>Last night was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/http://gothamist.com/tags/derekjeter">Derek Jeter</a>&apos;s last time in pinstripes at Yankee Stadium. The game, which capped off a never-ending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/12/derek_jeter_retiring.php">series of farewells</a> at other stadiums (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttz6H5jMyxc">seriously</a>), was clear of rain (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/26/photos_last_nights_rainbow.php">graced by rainbows</a>), but the stadium was filled with emotions.</p>

<p>The Yankees won the game against the Baltimore Orioles, capped off by a too-good-to-be-true game-winning single by Jeter in his final appearance at Yankees Stadium as a player. He later told reporters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/http://nypost.com/2014/09/25/mlb-wont-let-rain-stand-in-way-of-derek-jeters-stadium-farewell/">he was breaking up on the inside</a>, &quot;There were a couple of times where I almost lost it. In the first inning I was thinking, &#x2018;Please don&#x2019;t hit it to me.&#x2019; In the last inning I almost lost it.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/sports/baseball/derek-jeters-finale-yankee-stadium.html?ref=sports">And from the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>He almost started crying as he drove himself to Yankee Stadium in the afternoon. He had to turn away from his teammates before the game when they presented him with gifts, so overcome was he by the emotion. In the first inning, he said, he barely knew what was happening, and later, in the top of the ninth, his eyes welled with tears to the point that he worried that he might break down in front of the crowd of 48,613.<p></p>

<p>When the time came for Derek Jeter to get a game-winning hit, to add another signature moment to a long list of achievements over his 20-year career, he knew exactly what to do, and seemingly no one doubted that he would.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Everyone in the dugout and the Stadium knew it was going to happen,&#x201D; said David Robertson, whose blown save paved the way for one of the most dramatic endings to a game at the new Stadium.</p></blockquote>Jeter said, &quot;It was above and beyond anything that I&apos;ve ever dreamt of. This was a lot of fun.&quot;<p></p>

<p>For the last time, &quot;Derek Jee-tah&quot;:</p>

<p>Will Jeter ever return to the Bronx? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/http://www.theonion.com/articles/derek-jeter-i-will-never-enter-this-part-of-the-ci,37023/">The Onion doesn&apos;t think so.</a>  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013303/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/24/video_keith_olbermann_makes_case_ag.php">Jeter troll Keith Olbermann</a> kept things lively last night:</p>
