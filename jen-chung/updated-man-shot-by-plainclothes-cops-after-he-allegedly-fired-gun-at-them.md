<p>A man was shot in the leg by police officers on a Brooklyn street last night, and the NYPD says that he was armed and had fired at detectives first.</p>

<p>NYPD Assistant Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, Commanding Officer, Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, said three plainclothes detectives from the Brooklyn North Gang Squad were on patrol in an unmarked vehicle when they &quot;observed a black Lexus sedan in front of them come to a stop in front of 656 Howard Avenue- where a large group of people were assembled outside.&quot;</p><blockquote>The driver of the Lexus exited the vehicle with a firearm in his hand. As he motioned toward the crowd, the three detectives, who were assigned to plainclothes duty, exited their vehicle and gave the command, &quot;Police, don&apos;t move.&quot;<br>
 <br>
At that point, the driver turned toward the officers and fired his weapon. An exchange of gunfire between the suspect and the detectives ensued.<br>
 <br>
The suspect then fled the location on foot. He was apprehended less than one block away, on Sutter Avenue between Howard Avenue and Grafton Street. The suspect&apos;s weapon was recovered. The suspect sustained a gunshot wound to his left leg. He was transported to Brookdale Hospital and is in stable condition.</blockquote>Maddrey also said that the detectives, who were not hit by any bullets, were taken to Jamaica Hospital for observation. Police released an image of the gun they retrieved:<p></p>
