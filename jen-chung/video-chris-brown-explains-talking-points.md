<p>Good Morning America continued coverage of its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145014/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/chris_brown_has_meltdown_at_good_mo.php">Tuesday contretemps</a> with performer Chris Brown by airing Brown&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145014/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/chris_brown_sorry_for_good_morning.php">quasi-apology</a> this morning.  Brown appeared on BET&apos;s 106 and Park yesterday and referred to his temper tantrum at ABC&apos;s Times Square studios (which included breaking a window), &quot;First of all, I want to apologize to anybody who was startled in the office, or anybody who was offended or really looked, and [was] disappointed at my actions. Because I&apos;m disappointed in the way I acted.&quot; And he explained how his team sends out talking points to interviewers:</p>

<p>Brown said, &quot;When I do interviews, we always send out a talking points sheet.  If the network or whoever isn&apos;t compliant with what we want to do so we can equally accomplish a goal, we usually back out and wait until it can be a better situation... So with [the GMA appearance] everything was cool and the talking points were positive and creative.  Everything that was sent to me, it was about the album... As the interview proceeded, it was thrown off, I was thrown off.&quot; Thrown off by GMA host Robin Robert&apos;s questions about his former girlfriend and beating victim Rihanna (Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and was sentenced to probation), that is.  But ABC News says, &quot;Chris Brown was invited on &apos;Good Morning America&apos; to perform and to be interviewed. There were no talking points offered.&quot;</p>

<p>Brown also said during the BET segment, &quot;I felt like, &apos;OK, they told us this just so they can get us on the show so they can exploit me.&apos; You know, that&apos;s what I thought. I kind of took it very, very hard. And I kept my composure throughout the interview, although you could see me upset, you know. I kept my composure and did my performances, and when I got back, I just let off, like, steam in the back.&quot;</p>

<p>Brown is hardly the first celebrity to want to restrict topics; in 1991, Jodie Foster cancelled an appearance on the Today show because the show would mention John Hinckley&apos;s assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan (Hinckley was obsessed with Foster&apos;s character from <em>Taxi Driver</em>).  </p>
