<p>In the summer, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023142/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/appeals_court_agrees_nyc_soda_ban_i.php">NY appellate court agreed</a> with a NYC judge who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023142/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/judge_stops_bloombergs_soda_ban.php">found the controversial sugary drink ban unconstitutional</a>. That set up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023142/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/05/nyc_appeals_ban_on_bloombergs_soda.php">Bloomberg administration to beg</a> NY&apos;s highest court to hear the case. Now it looks like the mayor&apos;s wish has been granted.</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg just released a statement about the New York Court of Appeals&apos; decision to hear the case&#x2014;and he sounds pretty confident, &quot;Obesity is the only major public health issue we face that is getting worse, and sugary drinks are a major driver of the crisis. The related epidemics of obesity and diabetes are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522023142/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/soda_ban_begins_tomorrow_with_poten.php#photo-1">killing at least 5,000 New Yorkers a year</a> and striking hardest in black and Latino communities and low-income neighborhoods. New York City&#x2019;s portion cap rule would help save lives, and we are confident the Appeals court will uphold the Board of Health&#x2019;s rule.&quot; </p>

<p>Buy your 32-ounce sodas now while you can&#x2014;or maybe for Bloomberg it&apos;s Supreme Court or bust!</p>
