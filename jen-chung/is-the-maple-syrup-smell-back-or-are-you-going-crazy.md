<p>Is it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/30/maple_syrup_smell_moves_around.php">January 2009</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/28/maple_sugar_smell_mystery.php">October 2005</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/14/maple_syrup_mon.php">March 2006</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/10/mmm_maple_syrup.php">November 2006</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/09/the_strange_sme.php">November 2007</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/29/has_the_maple_s.php">May 2008</a>) again, or are you just hallucinating? Or is the air just pre-gaming for tomorrow&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/free_food_alert_ihop_celebrates_nat.php">National Pancake Day</a>? We received two independent scentings of maple syrup&#x2014;one on the Upper West Side and one in New Jersey&#x2014;so we put on our deerstalker hat to investigate.</p>

<p>Our Upper West Side tipster says the maple syrup smell was apparent at 7:40 p.m. at West End Avenue and 85th Street (he did not smell it at 10 p.m.).  Our Garden State tipster says the maple syrup smell hit him in the 9 p.m. hour in Jersey City.  Further, around 10:30 p.m., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/https://twitter.com/#!/tkbalt/status/173973555862712320">someone Tweeted from Jersey City</a>, &quot;Oh my god it reeks of maple syrup!

<p>When Mayor Bloomberg claimed that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/05/map_of_the_day_nycs_maple_syrup_odo.php#photo-1">city solved the maple syrup smell mystery</a> in 2009, officials said that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/05/maple_syrup_smell_press_conference.php">factory in northern New Jersey, Frutarom, was responsible.</a>  After the &quot;J&apos;accuse,&quot; Frutarom, which processes fenugreek seeds for additives, claimed it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/06/nj_factory_questions_nycs_maple_syr.php">surprised it was the smelly culprit</a> and other NJ officials were skeptical about being the one who dealt it.  </p>

<p>The NYC Office of Emergency Management and the NJ Department of Environmental Protection say that no calls about a maple syrup-like smell were received yesterday or today.  We contacted Frutarom, which says they were not operating yesterday.  So there are a couple of theories:</p>

<p>1) The wind picked up leftover fenugreek smell from Frutarom.<br>
2) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/16/as_seen_on_tv_t.php">It&apos;s Northrax</a>.<br>
3) People in Jersey City and at West End &amp; 85th Street were having breakfast for Oscars dinner.<br>
4) People have been sniffing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220021222/http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=78594">new Canadian $100 bills</a>.<br>
5) You are going crazy.<br>
6) It&apos;s time to get ready for our pancake-loving overlords.</p>
