<span class="photo_caption">Photography by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161227/http://flickr.com/photos/thebleedingheartbakery/2771993572/in/pool-chicagoist">The Bleeding Heart Bakery</a> in Chicago</span></p>

<p>Though this confection is by way of the Windy City (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161227/http://thebleedingheartbakery.com/">Bleeding Heart Bakery</a> is heralding the opening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161227/http://chaostheorycakes.com/">Chaos Theory Cakes</a>), we had to point it out because it involves the old NY State license plate AND a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161227/http://www.stanthecaddy.com/assman.html">reference</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161227/http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheFusilliJerry.htm">The Fusili Jerry episode</a> of Seinfeld.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ASSMAN plate is not available through the NY State DMV.  We&apos;re not sure if it&apos;s taken or just off-limits.  And, after the jump, are the final minutes of The Fusili Jerry episode.</p>
