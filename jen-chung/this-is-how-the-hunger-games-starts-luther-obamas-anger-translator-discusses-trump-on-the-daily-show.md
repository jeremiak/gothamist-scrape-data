<p>President Barack Obama has been playing the long game with President-elect Donald Trump, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108170356/http://dcist.com/2016/11/president_obama_to_address_the_nati.php">telling America</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m looking forward to doing everything I can to make sure the next president is successful. We are all rooting for his success.&quot; Of course, that&apos;s not what the 65 million people who voted for Hillary Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108170356/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/obama_alternative_speech.php">wanted to hear</a>, so we&apos;ll just have to settle for Luther, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108170356/http://dcist.com/2015/04/videos_president_obama_brings_luthe.php#photo-1">Obama&apos;s certified anger translator</a>, to take the edge off of things.</p>

<p>Keegan-Michael Key appeared on <em>The Daily Show</em> with a clip that he and Jordan Peele put together as a farewell address. Peele, as the placid Obama, greets the audience, &quot;Since we last spoke, the country has voted for a new president,&quot; prompting Key&apos;s Luther to fume, &quot;TRUMP?! Really? How did this happen? Don&apos;t you understand? This is how The Hunger Games starts!&quot;</p>

<center><div style="background-color:#000000;width:648px;"><div style="padding:4px;width:640;height:360"><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108170356if_/http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:comedycentral.com:7901f4dd-f6f1-4217-9645-09c685e44245" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></center><br><br>

<p>&quot;Obama&quot; also explains that &quot;we [must] move on as a country united,&quot; but Luther points out, &quot;United in the fact that we can&apos;t f***ing stand each other!&quot; Luther also says that Trump doesn&apos;t want to be President, describing him as &quot;shook. The only reason he ran is because his factory in China made too many red hats.&#x201D;</p>

<p>When &quot;Obama&quot; says, &quot;We all succeed&quot; if Trump succeeds, Luther drops the truth, &quot;Unless he succeeds with all the sh*t he promised to succeed with &#x2014; in that case, we&#x2019;re f&#x2014;ed!&quot; </p>
