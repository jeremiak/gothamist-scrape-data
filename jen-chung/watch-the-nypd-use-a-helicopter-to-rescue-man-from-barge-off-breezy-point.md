<p>The NYPD Harbor and Aviation Units staged a rescue by helicopter to save a man having a heart attack on a barge just south of Breezy Point yesterday afternoon. This morning the NYPD released dramatic videos of the operation:</p>

<p>Police say the U.S. Coast Guard contacted them around 1:34 p.m. about a man who was &quot;suffering from chest pains on board the dredge barge Super Chief, which was approximately 1.63 miles due south of Breezy Point in the area of the 100 Precinct.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD Harbor Unit responded to help an on-board paramedic give CPR to a 47-old-man in cardiac arrest. At 1:50 p.m., police say that &quot;Air Sea Rescue Helicopter 22 arrived overhead the vessel and lowered a rescue basket with a NYPD Scuba Team member inside. The officer continued CPR immediately and continuously as the male was hoisted into the helicopter and transported to Staten Island University Hospital South.&quot; </p>

<p>The video above shows Det. John Mortimer being lowered onto the barge, and the one below shows him doing CPR on the man, while being pulled back up: </p>

<p>The helicopter landed at 2:05 p.m. and the man is in critical but stable condition. The police noted the team involved: Det. Erin Egan (Pilot); Det. Christopher Maher (Co-Pilot); Det. John Mortimer (Scuba)(Lowered in basket); Det. Brian Mullen (Scuba); and Det. Tom Diaz (Crew Chief).</p>
