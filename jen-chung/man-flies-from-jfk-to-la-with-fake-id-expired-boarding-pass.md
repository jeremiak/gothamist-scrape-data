Olajide Olwaseun Noibi used a fake ID and an <em>expired boarding pass </em>to get onto Virgin America Flight 415.  <p></p>

<p>WCBS 2 reports, &quot;The FBI says Noibi sat in the main cabin and when a flight attendant asked him to show his boarding pass, he produced the expired pass. Noibi was still allowed to get off the plane when it landed in Los Angeles.&quot;  Great!  And how did Noibi get the pass?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110701031256/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/man-arrested-boarding-plane-false-id-day-boarding/story?id=13963831">ABC News explains</a>:</p><blockquote>On that pass was the name of a man with the initials M.D. After tracking down and interviewing him, the FBI learned that M.D. had lost his home-printed boarding pass from his back pocket, which had been folded into fourths, once he arrived at JFK via subway Friday. Once he discovered it missing, he obtained a new boarding pass from a ticket kiosk and boarded flight 413.<p></p>

<p>On flight 415 Saturday -- the day after M.D.&apos;s flight had already taken off -- a similarly folded home-printed boarding pass with M.D.&apos;s name on it was found on Noibi.</p></blockquote>Noibi was arrested yesterday in Wednesday when he tried to board a Delta flight from LA to NYC under the same MO. Authorities found 10 other expired boarding passes. A federal agent wrote in his report, &quot;Noibi [while at LAX] claimed he was able to go through passenger screening by obtaining a seat pass and displaying his University of Michigan identification and a police report that his passport had been stolen.&quot;<p></p>
