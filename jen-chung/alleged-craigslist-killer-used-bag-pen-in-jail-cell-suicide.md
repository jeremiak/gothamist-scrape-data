<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_07_clkiller.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063305im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_clkiller.jpg" width="240" height="263" class="image-left"> </span>Authorities say that the suspected Craigslist Killer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063305/http://gothamist.com/tags/philipmarkoff">Philip Markoff</a> was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063305/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/08/markoff_lawyer.html?p1=News_links"> found by paramedics</a> in his jail cell with &quot;with puncture wounds to his neck and both ankles.&quot;  He also had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063305/http://bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/20100816sources_suspected_craigslist_killer_used_bag_pen_in_suicide_city_councilor_calls_for_probe_into_death/srvc=home&amp;position=0">clear plastic bag from the jail&apos;s canteen</a> over his head.  </p>

<p>Markoff, a medical student at Boston University, had been in the Boston jail for over a year for allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063305/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/22/craigslist_killer_suspect_held_with.php">killing NYC resident Julissa Brisman</a> at the Mariott Copley Place.  Brisman, who was fatally shot, advertised her massage service via Craigslist and Boston police were able to trace back emails to an IP address at Markoff&apos;s apartment.  Besides finding a gun and plastic ties in his home, police also found women&apos;s underwear.  Another escort who was robbed and tied up by a man she arranged an appointment with on Craigslist identified the man seen in surveillance footage at the Mariott as her attacker.  </p>

<p>The police and state medical examiner&apos;s office are investigating his death. The Boston Herald reports, &quot;The shocking demise of the former doc-to-be - who sources said used his medical know-how to try to sever major arteries so he would bleed to death - was preliminarily ruled an &apos;apparent suicide&apos; by authorities on the day after the one-year anniversary of what was to be Markoff&#x2019;s marriage to New Jersey bombshell Megan McAllister.&quot; </p>

<p>Brisman&apos;s family hopes a confession will be found among Markoff&apos;s belongings, and her friend Mark Pines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063305/http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/20100816victims_mom_beside_herself/">said he was consoling Brisman&apos;s mother</a>, &quot;She&#x2019;s beside herself.&quot; Pines added, &quot;There&#x2019;s some relief, because it&#x2019;s a form of closure, but it&#x2019;s not true closure. A trial would have been grueling and heartstopping, but it would have provided closure.&#x201D;</p>
