<p>Earlier this year, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013512/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/17/banker_sex_taps.php">Kelly was arraigned on 19 counts</a>, including unlawful surveillance, he claimed that the tapes were accidentally leftover from when he was trying to film his dog. In court papers, he said, &quot;I have this camera set up in my apartment to watch my dog when I&apos;m not there. It&apos;s not on and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex because it&apos;s always recording.&quot; </p>

<p>However, Kelly allegedly uploaded the tapes to websites (you know, YouTube and Vimeo). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013512/http://nypost.com/2014/09/22/banker-allegedly-admitted-to-recording-sex-romps/">The Post now reports</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not innocent, I&#x2019;ve said exactly what I&#x2019;ve done. I lied about having sex with someone else and I videotaped it for my own watching enjoyment. Which is weird but&#x2009;.&#x2009;.&#x2009;.&#x2009;,&#x201D; John C. Kelly, 32, told a former lover who secretly recorded his confession last year.<p></p>

<p>The son of noted civil attorney John Q. Kelly had actually videotaped the victim, 37, multiple times and the two other women over a dozen times in their most intimate moments without their consent between May 2011 and December 2012, prosecutors allege.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know that you were filming it and I trusted you,&#x201D; the Ivy League grad responds in the secret recording. &#x201C;It was once. And I had totally forgotten about it,&#x201D; stammers Kelly. &#x201C;Like I never had watched it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The victim then blasts the handsome, blond, blue-eyed Williams College grad for titling the creepy porno &#x201C;India Research&#x201D; in a flip reference to her ethnic background. &#x201C;I remember thinking &#x2018;That&#x2019;s not funny&#x2019; when I read the name &#x2014; like you could get something better than that,&#x201D; he admits...</p>

<p>&#x201C;Do you know how it feels?&#x201D; the woman asks on the furtive recording of her tormentor. &#x201C;E&#x2014; saw my videos first, of like, me giving you [oral sex]. Do you know how embarrassing that is?&#x201D;</p></blockquote>However, Kelly did snap at her, &quot;Big f-king deal. I never showed anyone.&quot; One victim&apos;s lawyer says that Kelly used a hidden camera, a webcam and an app on his phone to film the women.<p></p>

<p>Kelly is reportedly on his third defense lawyer. </p>
