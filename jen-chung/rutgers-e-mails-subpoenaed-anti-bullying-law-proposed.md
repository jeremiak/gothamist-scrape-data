Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208084325/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/06/new-jersey-poised-to-crack-down-on-bullying/">proposed legislation that would prohibit bullying and harassment</a> at colleges. Lautenberg said of Clementi, &quot;No one could have heard about this degradation he suffered without feeling pain themselves. This is a major problem, and we&#x2019;re going to fix it.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Comedian Judy Gold was also present, and she told the crowd, &quot;What happened to him was not just an invasion of privacy. This was just sick... Because being bullied because you&#x2019;re gay is the last acceptable form of bullying. Because bullies see gay people being thrown out of the military. They see gay people fighting tooth and nail for basic civil human rights.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>In the meantime, Middlesex County prosecutors have<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208084325/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/middlesex_prosecutor_subpoenas.html"> subpoenaed emails from Rutgers</a>&#x2014;specifically ones related to how the university dealt with complaints about roommate Dharun Ravi. According to the Star-Ledger, &quot;Prosecutors asked for the subpoenas after investigators felt some at the state university were not fully cooperating with the investigation into the high-profile suicide... Campus officials denied they are obstructing the Clementi investigation. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act &#x2014; a federal law that protects the privacy of student records &#x2014; requires the university protect certain student documents, said E.J. Miranda, a Rutgers spokesman.&quot;</p>

<p>Ravi faces  invasion of privacy charges, which could be upgraded if prosecutors determine whether there was an element of bias.  His lawyer said he was glad investigators were taking their time to look into the matter before upgrading charges,  &quot;I can only hope that the public will do the same. I am confident that nothing will be learned to justify, warrant or support the filing of any bias criminal complaint.&#x201D;</p>
