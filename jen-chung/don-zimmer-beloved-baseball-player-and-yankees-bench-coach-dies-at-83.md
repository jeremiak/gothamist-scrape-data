</div></div>					<p>Don Zimmer, the beloved baseball player as well as manager, bench coach and adviser for many teams, died tonight in a Florida hospital. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142/http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/rays-adviser-don-zimmer-widely-seen-as-a-baseball-treasure-dies/2182972">Tampa Bay Times reports</a>, &quot;Mr. Zimmer underwent April 16 heart surgery to repair a leaky valve but had remained hospitalized and on a ventilator due to fibrosis in his lungs.&quot; His son said, &quot;He went peacefully. He just faded away.&quot;</p>

<p>Zimmer first played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954, and was part of the 1955 and 1959 (as the LA Dodgers) World Series championship teams. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/don-zimmer-baseball-lifer-dead-83-article-1.1817522">The Daily News&apos; loving obituary notes</a>, &quot;Baseball is forever poorer with the passing of Don Zimmer, one of the game&#x2019;s all-time good will ambassadors, humorists and raconteurs who began his travelogue career as a Dodger in Brooklyn, surviving two near-fatal beanings, and went on to be an original &#x2019;62 Met, a Washington Senator, manager of two storied franchises, the Red Sox and Cubs, and finally Joe Torre&#x2019;s bench coach for four Yankee world championship teams.&quot;</p>

<p>The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/sports/baseball/don-zimmer-dies-at-83-after-a-lifetime-in-baseball.html?smid=tw-nytimes"> NY Times says</a>, &quot;Zimmer was married on a baseball diamond in 1951 and it seemed that he never left the ball field... Zimmer&#x2019;s bulging arm muscles on his 5-foot-9-inch frame (he was about 170 pounds in his playing years) brought him the enduring nickname Popeye when he played for the Dodger teams known as the Boys of Summer. His puffy face seemed like something out of a baseball trading card from the days when dugouts were awash in the juice from chewing tobacco.&quot;</p>

<p>After spending a year playing baseball in Japan, Zimmer took on his more familiar role as a manager and a coach in the minor and major leagues. While managed both the Red Sox and Chicago Cubs (taking the Cubs to a division championship in 1989), his most famous turn might have been as a bench coach for the New York Yankees, starting in 1996. The team won four championships, but it was the American League Championship Series, against the Red Sox in 2003, that was peak Zimmer:</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142im_/http://s.mlkshk.com/r/Z9PZ" width="640"></p>

<p>Here&apos;s how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20031011&amp;content_id=574390&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb">MLB described the events</a>, after the Red Sox&apos; Pedro Martinez got annoyed with a high pitch from Roger Clemens, calling it one of the &quot; strangest sights anyone will ever see in a baseball game&quot;:</p><blockquote>...Boston starter Pedro Martinez threw behind Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia and hit him in the back in the fourth inning, prompting Garcia to slide hard into Boston second baseman Todd Walker to break up a double play.<p></p>

<p>That emptied the benches, too, and that wasn&apos;t strange, either.</p>

<p>But the sight of bald-headed, 72-year-old Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer running on the field to go after Martinez was not just strange.</p>

<p>It was surreal, baffling, bizarre, you name it. And it didn&apos;t end there.</p>

<p>Zimmer got to Martinez and appeared to give a little fake punch with his right hand before attempting a sweeping overhand left.</p>

<p>Martinez put both hands on Zimmer and shoved him away, causing Zimmer to fall to the turf, where he sat, dazed, for a few minutes.</p></blockquote>Afterward, Zimmer, then 72, said, &quot;I feel good enough to have a hot dinner.&quot; The next day, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142/http://gothamist.com/2003/10/13/baseball_brawl_continues_and_sockgate.php">he was apologetic, crying</a>, &quot;I&apos;m embarrassed for what happened last night. I&apos;m embarrassed for the Yankees, the Red Sox, the fans, the umpires and my family.&quot;<p></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150426153142if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/AsuYIN7y8Ew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Zimmer also had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142/http://gothamist.com/2003/10/27/zimmer_wants_to_leave.php">run-ins with Yankees owner</a> George Steinbrenner, who apparently called coaches &quot;assholes.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153142/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/don-zimmer-baseball-lifer-dead-83-article-1.1817522">Zimmer said in 2003</a>, &quot;This is one ---hole (Steinbrenner) won&#x2019;t have to worry about firing, &#x2018;cause I won&#x2019;t be back. I&#x2019;m a human being and I ain&#x2019;t been treated like one for 11 months.&quot;</p>

<p>He was most recently an adviser for the Tampa Bay Rays in Florida, where he lived for decades. According to the Tampa Bay Times: </p><blockquote>Get him started, and it usually didn&apos;t take much, and he would talk with passion and vigor, telling stories rich in detail about the life he led:<p></p>

<p>About being teammates with Jackie Robinson during his 12 years playing in the majors, or managing the Red Sox and Cubs during historic seasons, or having a prime seat on the bench for the Yankees&apos; dynastic run, or getting the chance to come home and work for the Rays.</p>

<p>And then he would stop and smile and deliver his own punch line:</p>

<p>&quot;A pretty good career for a .235 hitter.&apos;&apos;</p></blockquote><p></p>
