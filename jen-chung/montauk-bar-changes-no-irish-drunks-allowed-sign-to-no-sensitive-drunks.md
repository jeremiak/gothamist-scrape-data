<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030609/http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Is-this-Long-Island-bars-No-Irish-Drunks-sign-offensive.html">considerable outcry</a>, a Montauk eatery has decided to forgo its &quot;No Irish Drunks&quot; ban. In an attempt to make amends, the Dock Bar &amp; Grill put a piece of paper over &quot;Irish&quot; so the sign now reads &quot;No Sensitive Drunks&quot; allowed.</p>

<p>Pauline Turley, vice chair of the board of the Irish Arts Center, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030609/http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Is-this-Long-Island-bars-No-Irish-Drunks-sign-offensive.html">noticed the sign and expressed her dismay to IrishCentral</a>. Turley, who originally hails from Ireland, said, &quot;I was taken aback by the way that kind of stereotype was so blatantly displayed. &#x2019;No Irish Drunks,&#x2019; that&#x2019;s very pointed.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030609/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/fightin_irish_pissed_over_bloomberg.php">Remember the lesson</a> former Mayor Bloomberg learned when he mentioned the &quot;inebriated Irish&quot; during the St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade.</p>

<p>However, IrishCentral reports that owner &quot;George Watson, a former NYC police officer, fireman, and Marine who served in Vietnam,&quot; had his reasons: </p><blockquote>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a large Irish contingent out here and once they attacked me - verbally - so we added &#x2018;No Irish Drunks&#x2019; to the list,&#x201D; he said during a phone call.<p></p>

<p>Many in the Montauk community are Irish American, and the beach town is also a popular destination for Irish students working for the summer on the J-1 visa. Watson told IrishCentral that he is of Irish descent, &#x201C;and also a drunk at times.&#x201D; He was the Grand Marshal of the Montauk St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day Parade in 2003.</p>

<p>A portion of his bio on The Dock&apos;s website reads &quot;At The Dock, we feel that in order for a joke to be funny, it must be told at someone&#x2019;s expense. We tell ethnic, sexist, and racial jokes - everyone gets their turn in the barrel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you spoke about any other religion or race they would probably take offense to it, but the Irish have a sense of humor,&#x201D; Watson said.</p></blockquote>Still, they changed the sign! No stranger to controversy, in 2006 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030609/http://www.thedockmontauk.com/dishwasher/">Watson explained why he asks patrons</a> to take their screaming children outside: &quot;I think it&#x2019;s extremely rude [to keep the kids inside the restaurant]. It&#x2019;s rude to everybody around here. What about the people that came in and hired a babysitter so they could go out and enjoy themselves? And you&#x2019;re going to sit them down next to a screaming kid? I don&#x2019;t think so.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Anyway, the &quot;No Irish Drunks&quot; sign means there&apos;s one less thing for Watson to do:</p>
