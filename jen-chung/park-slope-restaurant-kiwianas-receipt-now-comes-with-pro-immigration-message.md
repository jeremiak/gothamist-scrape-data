										<p>A Brooklyn restaurant added a note <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214720/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/04/federal_judge_blocks_president_trum.php">supporting immigrants </a>at the bottom of the restaurant&apos;s receipt&#x2014;and now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214720/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Kiwiana-Restaurant-Brooklyn-Immigrant-Cook-Food-Thanks-Twitter-Trump-Executive-Order-Ban-412896463.html">note has gone viral</a>, as they say.</p>

<p>The brunch bill from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214720/http://www.kiwiana-nyc.com/">Kiwiana</a> in Park Sope was Tweeted by Mary Emily O&apos;Hara. It shows the message, &quot;Immigrants make America great (they also cooked your food and served you today).&quot;</p>

<p>Chef Mark Simmons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214720/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170206/park-slope/receipt-restaurant-kiwiana-pro-immigrant-refugee-ban-trump">told DNAinfo</a>, &quot;I added that message to the bottom of the receipts recently, to remind ourselves [and] our customers that immigrants are quite often the backbone of the hospitality industry... I normally add little notes at the end of the receipt, though rarely are they political. We are happy people are noticing. Overall the feedback has been positive.&quot;</p>

<p>O&apos;Hara, though, revealed to DNAinfo that some people are shocked that brunch in NYC costs so much.</p>

<p>Exactly! But, as a small note, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214720/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/29/fight_for_15_first_phase_of_minimum.php">the $15/hour wage</a> doesn&apos;t kick in until the end of 2018, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214720/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/18/restaurant_tip_guide.php">so just tip 20%</a>.</p>
