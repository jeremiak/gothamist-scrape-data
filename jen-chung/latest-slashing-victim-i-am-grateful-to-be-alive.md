<p>The 20-year-old woman who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809224041/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/robbery_slashing_bronx.php">brutally slashed while walking</a> on a Bronx street yesterday is discussing the attack. Victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809224041/http://nypost.com/2016/02/12/woman-slashed-across-face-in-mugging-in-another-terrifying-nyc-attack/">Paula Delos Santos said</a>, &quot;I was terrified, very frantic, hysterical. I had blood all over me. I thought it was because he kicked me in the face.&quot;</p>

<p>Delos Santos, who attends City College, was walking on Holland Avenue, near Morris Park Avenue, just after midnight on Friday when someone approached her from behind. She told the NY Post, &quot;All of a sudden, I feel a presence behind me, so I turn to look and he grabbed my phone and my first instinct was to grasp on tighter to the phone. I think he took that as me trying to fight back. I didn&#x2019;t really see what he cut me with, he just slashed my cheek.&quot;</p>

<p>She added, &quot;It was like an adrenaline rush &#x2026; All I was sure of was his hand motion towards my face, he pushed me and he just kicked me in the mouth area.&quot; </p>

<p>The suspect managed to take her purse, but not her cellphone, and fled. Delos Santos&apos; landlord&apos;s son, Raphael Hernandez, heard her screaming and called the police. She said, &quot;All of a sudden the door just opens and he&#x2019;s like, &#x2018;Your face, what the hell.&apos; I went inside the hallway and I looked at my face in the mirror and that&#x2019;s when I was even more frantic, like screaming and my parents came down and they called the police and the ambulance.&quot;</p>

<p>Delos Santos also posted photos of her injury and said, &quot;I am grateful to be alive and recovering. I know you all are probably aware of it but I stress you be careful walking alone in the evening especially with your belongings out. I&apos;ve always read and heard about these stories and never thought that I would experience it myself. I do not wish this upon anyone. Again please be careful and always aware of your surroundings.&quot;</p>
