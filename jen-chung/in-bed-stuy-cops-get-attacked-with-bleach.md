title: In Bed-Stuy, Cops Get Attacked With Bleach
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012-05_bleach.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120530232258im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012-05_bleach.jpg" width="244" height="234" class="image-left"> </span>Last night, a fight erupted on Lexington Avenue in Brooklyn&#x2014;and when the cops arrived, they got a stinging welcome: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120530232258/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/cops_attacked_1vQ1oX48MKUNFiIIDRwxOP">Post reports</a> that &quot;some nearby belligerent residents threw bleach on&quot; them.</p>

<p>Apparently the police arrived to issue a summons before 7 p.m.: &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t clear what the summonses were for, but a large crowd gathered and a scuffle broke out, injuring two cops, police said. At that point, people inside the three-story building began throwing the bleach, striking five cops with it.&quot; A witness said, &quot;I saw all these cops. I&#x2019;ve never seen so many in one place &#x2014; there must have been more than 30.&quot;</p>

<p>The police, who suffered minor injuries, were able to arrest five people...but none of them were believed to be bleach-throwers.  While we&apos;re on the subject, please note that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120530232258/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRhQ8g6w-I">bleach is not something you should brush your teeth with</a>.</p>
