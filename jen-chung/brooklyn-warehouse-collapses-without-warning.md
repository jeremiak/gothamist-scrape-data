<p>The Buildings Department is investigating the collapse of a warehouse in Brooklyn last night. The warehouse, at 1 43rd Street in Sunset Park, was vacant at the time. It&apos;s unclear what caused the building to suddenly collapse, but no injuries were reported.</p>

<p>Authorities responded around 9 p.m. The FDNY and NYPD searched the building for people as a precaution:</p>
