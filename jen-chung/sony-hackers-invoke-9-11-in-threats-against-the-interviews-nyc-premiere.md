<p>The group that&apos;s allegedly behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011113/http://laist.com/tags/sonyhack">massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures</a> is now threatening the upcoming NYC premiere of the James Franco-Seth Rogen film that apparently spurred the hack.</p>

<p>City News Service reports that the  &quot;threat, written in broken English, was posted on file-sharing services that have been used to circulate internal Sony emails stolen in the<br>
cyberattack.&quot;</p><blockquote>Warning<p></p>

<p>We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places &#x201C;The Interview&#x201D; be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.</p>

<p>Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.</p>

<p>The world will be full of fear.</p>

<p>Remember the 11th of September 2001.</p>

<p>We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.</p>

<p>(If your house is nearby, you&#x2019;d better leave.)</p>

<p>Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.<br>
All the world will denounce the SONY.</p></blockquote>The film, <em>The Interview</em>, is about a TV news team who land an interview with Kim Jong-Un&#x2014;and then get recruited by the CIA to assassinate the North Korean leader. It&apos;s believed the hack may be related to the film&apos;s controversial subject, because the Guardians of Peace have asked Sony <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011113/https://variety.com/2014/film/news/sony-hackers-apparently-demand-studio-pull-the-interview-1201374036/">to pull the film</a>.<p></p>

<p>The movie will have a NYC premiere on Thursday and is being released on December 25. A giddy Rogen&#x2014;he pointed out it&apos;s not illegal to carry a small amount of weed in NYC anymore&#x2014;appeared on <em>The Colbert Report</em> last night to discuss the controversy:</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the NYPD to ask if they are increasing security around the premiere and the film&apos;s release in theaters; we&apos;ll update if we hear back.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Franco and Rogen have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011113/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/seth-rogen-and-james-franco-cancel-all-media-appearances-for-the-interview-1201380917/">cancelled all their media appearances for the film</a>. </p>
