</div></div>					<p>The police are continuing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164502/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/12_years_later_after_911_plane_land.php">investigate plane landing gear</a>&#x2014;which they believe is from one of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001&#x2014;found between two buildings blocks from the WTC site. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly described the piece as being around 5 feet by 4 feet by 17 inches, discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164502/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/World-Trade-Center-Airplane-Pieces-Found-Sifting-Debris-Remains-204901961.html">in a &quot;very, very narrow, confined area&quot;</a> between 51 Park Place and 50 Murray Street: &quot;It&apos;s difficult to get in there and see.&quot;</p>

<p>Kelly said there was rope tied to one part of the gear, raising the possibility that it had been lowered. He added there weren&apos;t marks on the buildings: &quot;It would have had to fall down at a certain angle.&quot; The location happens to be near where a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164502/http://gothamist.com/tags/groundzeromosque">controversial mosque and community center</a> has been planned. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164502/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/relic_is_found_zero_cops_ezFZx7AMWcpODAGcC44oaP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">Post reports</a>, &quot;A lawyer for the proposed &apos;Park51&apos; mosque claimed the landing gear was planted by opponents of the project &#x2014; a theory Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said cops would explore.&quot; </p>

<p>The object was noticed by surveyors (hired by the owners of 51 Park Place) yesterday who then contacted the police. Kelly also added, &quot;If you see how confined this space is, and you realize the chaos that existed down here on this street, it&apos;s not surprising. It&apos;s very, very confined. No cleanup went on in this 18-inch space between these two buildings.&quot; </p>

<p>There is a Boeing identification number on the gear, but the National Transportation Safety Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164502/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/relic_is_found_zero_cops_ezFZx7AMWcpODAGcC44oaP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">hasn&apos;t checked it</a> against the two 9/11 flights yet. </p>

<p>Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter son died on September 11 and who opposes plans for the Park 51 mosque, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164502/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/landing-gear-9-11-boeing-jet-found-ground-zero-mosque-article-1.1328547">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;The main goal was build, build, money, money, money, the hell with human remains, and this is what we have today. Some people say, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m shocked.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m not shocked,&quot; adding, &quot;This is a legacy of failure and disregard. Perhaps finding the fuselage now is finally going to make people realize this.&quot;</p>

<p>NBC New York reports, &quot;Police officials say the part could be difficult to remove, and may require demolition work that would destroy the two surrounding buildings. Officials are expected to be back at the scene on Monday to see if it can be removed.&quot; Kelly said, &quot;I think it really is an historical artifact, and we want to make sure it doesn&#x2019;t involve any human remains.&quot; The police have secured the area as a crime scene and the Medical Examiner&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164502/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/27/investigators-probe-area-near-world-trade-center-after-plane-part-discovery/">will sift for remains</a>. </p>
