A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060006/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/09/truck_driver_in_toll_booth_cra.html">told the Staten Island Advance</a> the &quot;driver apparently lost his brakes, then jumped the curb at the plaza, near lane 17, and struck the toll booth... The accident caused traffic tie-ups heading into Staten Island.&quot;  The driver was not pinned, though his door was &quot;pressed against the toll booth&quot;&#x2014;it turns out that emergency responders &quot;were hesitant to remove him through the passenger-side door&quot; due to the driver&apos;s shoulder injuries.</p>
