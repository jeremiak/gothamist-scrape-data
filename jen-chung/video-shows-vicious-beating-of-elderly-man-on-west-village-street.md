<p>A senior citizen was attacked on a Manhattan street yesterday afternoon, and police are hoping the public can identify two suspects&#x2014;one who beat the man and another person who acted as a lookout. </p>

<p>The assault took place on the sidewalk outside of 120 West 14th Street, a Salvation Army. Police say the &quot;first suspect punched the 75-year-old male victim in the back of the head and knocked him to the ground. The suspect then kicked the victim in the face and rendered him unconscious.&quot; </p>

<p>The female suspect stood nearby as a lookout and  then the pair fled east on 14th Street. It&apos;s unclear what, if anything, provoked the attack.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital in stable condition. Video shows part of the assault:</p>

The first suspect is described as a male black hair with a red streak in it; he was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, beige pants and a black and gray backpack. The second suspect is a female who was last seen wearing a green dress with a hood over her head and black sneakers.</p>
