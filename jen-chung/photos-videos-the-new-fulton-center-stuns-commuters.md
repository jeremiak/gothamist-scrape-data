<p>After 12 years of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327094622/http://gothamist.com/2003/10/03/new_fulton_street_transit_center.php">planning</a>, design <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327094622/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/28/form_or_functio.php">revisions</a>, budget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327094622/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/11/fulton_1.php">drama</a>, bureaucratic red tape, community hand-wringing and a lot of good old-fashioned hard work, the Fulton Center welcomed its first commuters and more than a few curious onlookers. Drawn to the stunning oculus and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327094622/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/14/watch_installation_of_fulton_transi.php">&quot;Sky Reflector Net&quot;</a>, many lingered in the center of transit hub to gaze upward. Or they enjoyed the view while taking the escalator:</p>

<p>The Fulton Center was originally budgeted at $750 million and wound up costing $1.4 billion, with much of the money coming from the Federal Transit Administration. Rivera, a Bronx resident who went out of his way to visit the center this morning, told us, &quot;Oh, yeah, it&apos;s worth it... I thought this would be like the Barclays Center Atlantic Avenue station... something new and nice... This is amazing.&quot;</p>

<p>The glass pavilion was designed by Arup and Grimshaw Architects, and &quot;Sky Reflector Net&quot; is an &quot;artist, architect, engineer collaboration,&quot; between Arup, Grimshaw Architects and James Carpenter Design Associates, commissioned by the MTA. JCDA said they got the job through a competition to &quot;articulate light throughout their design,&quot; and an MTA fact sheet explains, &quot;Arup performed sunpath analyses which showed the geometrical relationship between the building site, the oculus and the path of the sun through the sky on the station&apos;s interior during the year.&quot; MTA Capital Construction Senior Vice President and Chief Engineer Uday Durg added that the panels at the top of the oculus are angled to maximize sunlight onto the 4000-pound net throughout the seasons. </p>

<p>The atrium and natural light make the center feel soaring and capacious. Plus there are all the transfers: The biggest one is the A/C to the 4/5; here are two videos (the first at 4x the speed and the second&#x2014;a slightly different route&#x2014;at real time):</p>
