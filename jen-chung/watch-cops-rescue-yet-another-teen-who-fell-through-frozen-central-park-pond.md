title: Watch Cops Rescue Yet Another Teen Who Fell Through Frozen Central Park Pond
---

	
										<p>What is it about precariously thin ice over a frigid pond that proves so irresistible to teenagers? Yesterday afternoon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323221502/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/nypd-cops-pull-teen-icy-central-park-lake-article-1.3003825">two police officers rescued</a> yet another adolescent, a 16-year-old boy, who fell through the Central Park pond. </p>

<p>The NYPD released video of the incident:</p>

<p>This was the third time this year that teens have ventured onto the pond&apos;s somewhat frozen surface with dangerous consequences: Last month, a group of teenagers<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323221502/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/21/central_park_teens_ice.php"> trying to take selfies fell through through the ice</a> (luckily there were some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323221502/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/22/stone_cold_hunks_save_nyc.php">male models nearby to rescue them</a>) and, on Sunday, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323221502/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/20/teen_selfies_ice.php">pair of teens fell through the ice</a>&#x2014;allegedly to take a selfie&#x2014;and pulled themselves out. </p>

<p>Two NYPD counterterrorism officers, Edward Radoncic and Anthony Dispigna, happened to be nearby and successfully rescued the unnamed teenager, who was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center and is expected to be fine, the Daily News reports.</p>

<p>Radoncic used a ladder to help the boy out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323221502/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/nypd-cops-pull-teen-icy-central-park-lake-article-1.3003825">telling the News</a>, &quot;My foot sunk through the ice, but luckily the rest of our team was there and I could feel them pulling me back, so I was totally confident in them being able to help me out and help us out.&quot;</p>

<p>The Parks Department is putting more officers on patrol near the pond and has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323221502/http://nypost.com/2017/03/20/central-park-ups-security-as-teens-keep-falling-through-pond/">issued these tips</a>:<br>
</p><blockquote>- Ponds and lakes may appear frozen, but venturing onto them is extremely dangerous and can cause potentially fatal accidents.<p></p>

<p>- Ice must be at least 6 inches thick before it can maintain the weight of a person, and to freeze to the right thickness, the temperature must be well below freezing for weeks.</p>

<p>- Determining the strength of ice is extremely difficult, especially for the untrained.</p>

<p>- NYC Parks posts warning signs along the perimeter of the city&#x2019;s lakes and ponds.</p>

<p>- Special ladders are also installed around the edges for trained personnel to use in the event of an emergency.</p></blockquote><p></p>
