<p>The police hope the public can help them find three suspects in a Midtown Manhattan robbery. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at about 4:30 a.m. on October 19, three male suspects cut the lock of the New Golden Apple Store, at 666 5 Avenue, and entered, taking $4,000, plus $20,000 worth of scratch off Lottery tickets and $5,200 in cigarettes. The police released photos (above) of the suspects. </p>

<p>Then, a few days later, the suspects went to the Abreu Deli, at 65 Sackman Street, to cash in winning scratch-off tickets. Here are photos from that:</p>
