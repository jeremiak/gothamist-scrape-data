<p>Around 5 a.m. yesterday morning, a 22-year-old woman was entering the vestibule of her East 20th Street building at Stuyvesant Town when an unknown male grabbed her from behind.

He had scratches on his chest and was missing some clothing.<p></p>

<p>When cops arrived, they recognized the suspect from a photo they had from the building&apos;s surveillance camera, authorities said.</p></blockquote>The NYPD has now charged Kish, a NJ resident, with attempted rape, strangulation, assault, burglary and sexual abuse. <p></p>
