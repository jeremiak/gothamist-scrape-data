<p>It seems that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/mls_stadium_announcement_due_in_wee.php">rumored deal to bring a soccer stadium</a> to Queens is closer to reality, with the NY Times reporting what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-14/manchester-city-said-close-to-becoming-owner-of-mls-queens-team.html">Bloomberg News</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/Manchester-City-takes-lead-to-buy-New-York-MLS-expansion-team-but-theres-no-deal-yet.html">Philadelphia Inquirer</a> and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/mls_stadium_announcement_due_in_wee.php"> other publications</a> had noted: Sheik Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/sports/soccer/abu-dhabi-sheik-is-said-to-be-on-track-to-own-new-soccer-team-in-new-york.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">is close to paying $100 million</a> to bring professional soccer to Queens.</p>

<p>The Times says, &quot;The prospective owners are willing to pay a $100 million expansion fee for the league&#x2019;s 20th team, which could be called New York City F.C. and begin play in 2016, the two people said. That would more than double the expansion fee of $40 million paid by the Montreal team that entered M.L.S. in 2012.&quot;</p>

<p>If the deal goes through, MLS will take 13 acres in Flushing Meadows Corona Park&#x2014;and this is contingent upon the City Council and State Legislature okaying it&#x2014; with the league replacing the 13 acres of parkland to the community at a location yet to be identified. Weirdly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/17/parkconstruction_all_2013_04_26_q.html">as noted last week</a>, the Parks Department has begun work on an $2.8 million improvement plan (approved by City Councilperson Julissa Ferreras) in the proposed stadium area.</p>

<p>While Sheik Mansour, deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://www.forbes.com/2009/03/11/mansour-al-nahayan-billionaires-2009-billionaires-abu-dhabi.html">personal net worth of $4.9 billion</a>&#x2014;a.k.a. money to burn&#x2014;critics of the MLS stadium-in-Queens plan are pointing out his country&apos;s human rights failings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/04/8529528/soccer-loving-sheik-gives-more-grist-flushing-meadows-stadium-criti">City Councilman Daniel Dromm said,</a> &quot;I was shocked to read in the New York Times that the Bloomberg Administration is negotiating to give NYC parkland away to Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, an oil billionaire that helps rule a country where gays or lesbians is a crime punishable by death. This is outrageous. <strong>This is also a country where gay and lesbian people could be subject to chemical castration.</strong> It is totally unacceptable. I urge my colleagues in the City Council and elected officials across the state to join me in saying that New Yorkers won&#x2019;t do business with a murderous regime and we won&#x2019;t sell, trade or giveaway our public assets to those who discriminate and participate in human rights abuses.&quot;</p>

<p>Dromm also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081415/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/04/8529528/soccer-loving-sheik-gives-more-grist-flushing-meadows-stadium-criti">told Capital New York</a>, &quot;The human rights record of that country in particular, where they punish gay people by death and by chemical castration, I felt a moral obligation to speak out on that basis.&quot;</p>
