</div></div>					<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/25/carriage_horses_ya_or_neigh.php">months of speculation</a>, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that an &quot;agreement in concept&quot; has been reached in the great NYC carriage horse debate: The number of horses will eventually decrease from 220 to 75 by 2018, and all horses will work&#x2014;and reside in new stables&#x2014;in Central Park. </p>

<p>A joint statement from de Blasio; City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito; and several reps from the Teamsters union, which organizes the carriage drivers, reads, &quot;We are pleased to have reached an agreement in concept on the future of New York&apos;s horse carriage industry. We look forward to working together on the final details of this legislation and getting this passed.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides keeping the horses in the park and the city paying for the new stables, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/horse-carriage-industry-mayor-de-blasio-strike-deal-article-1.2499992">the Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Horses will be banned from traveling the streets outside Central Park, except when going to and from their current stables, starting in June... The number of horses will drop from the current 180 to 110 by December, and to 95 when new stables open in the park.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/nyregion/in-compromise-mayor-de-blasio-to-allow-75-carriage-horses-in-central-park.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;The deal comes with an unexpected twist: Pedicabs, the oft-lamented tricycles that ply tourists, would be banned from operating inside Central Park below 85th Street, eliminating a chief competitor of the carriage industry.&quot;</p>

<p>Other elements of the proposed deal include, according to the News: &quot;The number of hours a horse can work a day will drop to nine. Drivers will be allowed to charge an extra $5 for rides after 6 p.m. between Nov. 15 and Jan. 5. The surcharge will also apply on Valentine&apos;s Day and Easter. Horses not currently at work will be required to furlough outside the city.&quot;</p>

<p>Those calling for the end of carriage horses say the horses are overworked and endangered by city traffic, and point to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/photo_spooked_horse_knocks_his_carr.php#photo-1">various examples</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/24/photo_spooked_carriage_horse_collap.php">of &quot;spooked horses.&quot;</a> Activists working to ban the industry were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/13/carriage_horse_debate_rears_head_at.php">among de Blasio&apos;s biggest donors</a> during the 2013 mayoral campaign, and, before being elected, de Blasio promised to ban carriage horses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/13/carriage_horse_debate_rears_head_at.php">as soon as he got to office</a>. </p>

<p>However, some who work in the carriage horse industry allege that their well-financed critics have ulterior movies. The most prominent opposition group, NYCLASS (&quot;New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets&quot;), was founded by Steve Nislick, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/12/8558480/man-behind-horse-carriage-fuss">owns parking garage behemoth</a> Edison Properties, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130421/POLITICS/304219998/sister-team-ponies-up-to-oust-quinn">and Wendy Neu</a>, CEO of electronics recycling firm Hugo Neu. In 2014, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/steve-nislick-advocate-animals-not-horses-article-1.1607326">News cited</a> anonymous speculation from carriage horse drivers that &quot;Nislick&#x2019;s real interest is in grabbing the far West Side land where their stables sit.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Nislick emphatically denies that he has any hidden agenda to further enrich himself through a carriage horse ban, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://m.nydailynews.com/opinion/december-1-horse-cash-cruel-cartoons-christmas-wins-article-1.2450740">in a letter to the Daily News</a>, wrote, &quot;I will not reap any financial gain &#x2014; from real estate or otherwise &#x2014; by the city removing the carriage horses off dangerous city streets. Let me go one further: If asked to participate in any way that benefits me financially, I will not do it.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mayor has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/20/deblasio_carriage_horses.php">blamed the City Council</a> for blocking his attempts to ban carriage horses. And it turns out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164455/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/19/horse_ban_neigh_way_jose.php">New Yorkers actually like them</a>. </p>

<p>This deal probably won&apos;t make anyone happy. Tupper Thomas, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, told the Times, &quot;This was not the way public parkland was intended to be used. Building something in Central Park for a private business does not seem like the appropriate answer to this issue. There are a lot of questions about this proposal that have to be looked at carefully.&quot;</p>

<p>And the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages&apos;s president, Elizabeth Forel, said, &quot;The Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages is opposed to the new Mayor deBlasio deal, which preserves the carriage trade at the expense of the horses and smells like a convenient real estate deal to us.   Street traffic was never the sole reason we advocated for a ban.  There are many other reasons including the sensitive, nervous nature of the horses; the very high turnover, which leads us to believe many of the unwanted go to the kill auctions, and punishing working conditions.  Putting the stables in Central Park, which may be illegal,  is not going to relieve this and may just exacerbate it because all the abuses will now be within the park and not so noticeable.&quot;</p>

<p>The City Council may have a hearing about the proposed deal this week.</p>
