<p>If you hate Roger Stone, the Nixon loyalist (seriously, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/07/gop_operative_c.php">has a Nixon tattoo on his back</a>) and now Trump adviser, then you&apos;re just playing into his hands. In the trailer for the new Netflix documentary, <em>Get Me Roger Stone</em>, the political operative explains, &quot;I revel in your hatred because I weren&apos;t effective, you wouldn&apos;t hate me.&quot;</p>

<p>The documentary will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/get-me-roger-stone/?crt=regular&amp;sort=best">premiere next month</a> at the Tribeca Film Festival, and Stone, as seen in the trailer below, is credited with envisioning Trump as a politician, with Trump&apos;s former campaign manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/28/paul_manafort_real_estate.php">Paul Manafort</a> adding his two cents about Stone: &quot;Roger saw something that nobody else saw back in the early &#x2019;80s&quot;:</p>

<p>Stone is a legendary master in the dark arts of politicking, taking credit for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot">&quot;Brooks Brothers Riot&quot;</a> during the 2000 presidential election recount and in the downfall of Governor Eliot Spitzer. NY politics nerds may recall in 2007 that Spitzer&apos;s father, developer Bernard Spitzer, received a voicemail that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/22/crazy_phone_cal.php">eventually traced to Stone</a> (the caller referred to Eliot Spitzer as &quot;your phony, psycho piece of s--- son&quot;), but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/23/a_funny_thing_h_3.php">Stone denied it</a>, claiming that the Spitzer crony who owned his apartment building broke into his apartment and made the call. </p>

<p>Then came Spitzer&apos;s resignation, after soliciting prostitutes; Stone said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/21/gop_operative_c_1.php">tipped off the FBI the year before</a> and shared &quot;didn&apos;t really need to know that&quot; details like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/23/spitzer_reporte.php">how Spitzer supposedly kept his socks on</a> during assignations. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/eliot-spitzer-and-the-legend-of-the-black-socks-the-naked-truth-6667395">This is likely untrue</a>, so let your mind stop picturing it.) Funnily enough, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/02/the-dirty-trickster">2008 interview with the New Yorker</a>&apos;s Jeffrey Toobin offered this quote:</p><blockquote>Over the years, Stone&#x2019;s relationships with colleagues and clients have been so combustible that his value as a messenger has been compromised. Stone worked for Donald Trump as an occasional lobbyist and as an adviser when Trump considered running for President in 2000. &#x201C;Roger is a stone-cold loser,&#x201D; Trump told me. &#x201C;He always tries taking credit for things he never did.&#x201D; </blockquote>Now, in the documentary, Trump praises Stone: &quot;He loves the game. He has fun with it. And he&apos;s very good with it.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Stone himself is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/us/roger-stone-donald-trump-russia.html">now under the spotlight</a> as the Trump campaign&apos;s connections to the Russian government are being investigated. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/russia-hearing-fbi-roger-stone-236268">He told Politico</a>, &quot;I am anxious to rebut allegations that I had any improper or nefarious contact with any agent of the Russia State based on facts not misleading and salacious headlines. Claims of Russian influence or collusion in the Trump Campaign by the Intelligence Community are backed up buy ZERO evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Last week, Press Secretary Sean Spicer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080323/http://pagesix.com/2017/03/29/roger-stone-netflix-doc-to-premiere-at-tribeca-film-fest/">said of Stone</a>, &quot;Mr. Stone is somebody the president has known for a long time. He worked briefly on the campaign ... until about August of 2015 ... They have talked from time to time, but I don&#x2019;t think anytime recently.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, this is the kicker from the 2008 New Yorker article: </p><blockquote>&#x201C;Remember,&#x201D; Stone said. &#x201C;Politics is not about uniting people. It&#x2019;s about dividing people. And getting your fifty-one per cent.&#x201D; (Stone&#x2019;s rule: &#x201C;The only thing worse in politics than being wrong is being boring.&#x201D;) </blockquote><p></p>
