<p>On this Summer Friday, the Associated Press wants us to appreciate this fun fact: Bird poop facials&#x2014;I shit you not&#x2014;are still very popular with people concerned with their skincare. And at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035445/http://www.lohud.com/viewart/20130802/NEWS05/308020062/Bird-poop-facial-draws-clients-NYC-spa">one NYC salon, people pay $180 to get one</a>.</p>

<p>The magic bird poop is actually nightingale droppings that have been dried and incorporated into a mask that&apos;s just one step in a thorough facial process. The Shizuka New York salon calls it a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035445/http://shizukany.com/services/skin-care/the-geisha-facial/">Geisha Facial</a> because geishas used it hundreds of years ago. Salon owner Shizuka Bernstein&#x2014;she&apos;s Japanese and married to an American&#x2014;told the AP, &quot;I try to bring Japanese beauty secrets to the United States.&quot; In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035445/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/beauty/article-1350741/Its-hailed-beauty-wonder-product-Victoria-Beckham-loves--bird-poo-face.html">previous interview</a>, she explained, &quot;The bird poop facial works because of an enzyme that breaks down the dead skin on the upper layers of the face. <strong>The nightingale poo acts as an exfoliate that brings out the dirt and dust that builds up in the skin and leaves the customer feeling refreshed.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Client Mari Miyoshi, one of Bernstein&apos;s 100 clients who get the facial every month (that&apos;s $18,000/month in bird poop facial revenue!), said the mixture smells &quot;but like toasted rice.&quot; The salon&apos;s website has a little FAQ about the poop facial: &quot;<em>Is uguisu no fun facial safe/sanitary to use on my face?</em> Yes, the uguisu no fun used in Shzuka&#x2019;s Geisha Facial&#xAE;s is professionally sanitized under UV light and powdered before being applied to the face in our NYC spa.&quot; However, a dermatologist says that using an apricot scrub to exfoliate your might have the same benefits.</p>

<p>Tom Cruise <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035445/http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/537072/how-does-tom-cruise-look-so-young-nightingale-poo-facials">reportedly gets them</a>, but don&apos;t think you can just collect pigeon bird droppings. Bernstein said nightingales , &quot;We don&#x2019;t do Central Park facials, because those birds eat garbage.&quot;</p>
