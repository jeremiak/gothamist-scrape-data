This wasn&apos;t merely an &apos;aspirational&apos; plot with no chance of success. This plot was very serious and, had it not been disrupted, it could have resulted in the loss of American lives.&quot;</p>

<p>Zazi was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811121658/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/30/terror_suspect_zazi_pleads_not_guil.php">charged with one count of terrorism conspiracy</a>; he has pleaded not guilty, though has admitted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811121658/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/18/queens_terror_suspect_still_monitor.php">talking to Al Qaeda</a>.  His visit to NYC in early September set off a flurry of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811121658/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/14/nypd_fbi_raided_queens_homes_in_ter.php">raids on Queens homes</a>, where authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811121658/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/16/queens_terror_raids_worries_of_madr.php">allegedly found backpacks</a> for a possible mass transit bombing. Plans for bomb making were also allegedly found on Zazi&apos;s laptop and Zazi was seen buying large quantities of beauty supplies, such as hydrogen peroxide and acetone, which can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811121658/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/experts_zazi_could_have_killed_many.php">used to make bombs</a>.</p>

<p>During his talk with Justice Department reporters, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811121658/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/06/AR2009100602618.html">Washington Post repor</a>ts that Holder went on to say the threat &quot;very serious&quot; and &quot;could have resulted in the loss of American lives... It is our intention to bring all who were involved to justice. We have a good sense of who these people were, and I can say the investigation is pretty far along and I think we&apos;ve got a pretty good handle on who was involved.&quot; Holder would not say when more arrests were coming.</p>
