<p>Besides trying to figure out whether taxi drivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521121929/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/13/some_taxi_drivers_scammed_fares_out.php">cheated passengers out of fares</a> (or just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521121929/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/24/taxi_drivers_demand_apology.php">made a mistake</a>), know what else taxi cabs&apos; GPS systems are good for?  Giving urban planning geeks a glimpse into Manhattan&apos;s traffic flow. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521121929/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/nyregion/24traffic.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times has details on a study</a> where &quot;officials tracked the routes of tens of millions of taxi trips over the past two years. The result: a database of speeds and travel routes that can be broken down by minute, month and neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides offering up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521121929/http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/03/24/nyregion/24trafficGRPH.html?ref=nyregion">graphic of the average daily speed of taxis</a> during the week&#x2014;Wednesdays are the slowest at 9.3 MPH, while Sunday is the fastest at 11.5 MPH&#x2014;here are some other details:</p><ul><li>&quot;Thursday, Nov. 13 was the slowest weekday of the year studied, with an average speed of 7.5 m.p.h. &#x2014; about the speed of the typical jogger in Central Park. Excluding holidays, the fastest weekday: Monday, Sept. 28, at a speed of 11.7 m.p.h.&quot;  Also, as expected, U.N. General Assembly week turned traffic &quot;to sludge.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;The four fastest days to drive in Manhattan, in order of average speed: New Year&#x2019;s Day, Christmas, Memorial Day and July 4.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;On a typical Tuesday night, about 13,000 cabs travel south from the Upper East Side to a destination between 14th Street and Canal Street; on Saturdays, about three times as many cabs (38,000 on average) make the trip.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Unlike other cities, Manhattan&apos;s streets stay pretty congested between morning and evening rush hours, which officials chalk up to commercial deliveries. Department of Transportation consultant Bruce Schaller points out the obvious, &quot;Walk around downtown San Francisco at 11 o&#x2019;clock in the morning and there&#x2019;s not much going on. You go to SoHo, and it&#x2019;s really busy.&quot;</p>
