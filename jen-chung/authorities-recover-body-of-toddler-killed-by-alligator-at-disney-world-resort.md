					<p>Police in Orlando, Florida confirmed that they have found the body of the two-year-old boy who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143206/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/alligator_attack_disney.php">attacked and dragged underwater at a Disney World resort last night</a>. During a press conference, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said he spoke to the family, telling reporters, &quot;I will tell you that it was a tough message to deliver.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy, identified as Lane Graves, was along the shore of the Seven Seas Lagoon at the Grand Floridian Resort last night around 9 p.m., apparently wading in about a foot of water when an alligator grabbed him and took him. His father, Matt Graves, tried to fight off the alligator but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>A search, involving dive teams and sonar equipment, was conducted at the 200-acre man-made lake, and Sheriff Demings said that the Orange County dive team found what they believed were the remains at 1:45 p.m. and then at 3:30 p.m. they recovered Lane&apos;s body intact. Demings said the search had its challenges&#x2014;&quot;the water is kind of murky&quot;&#x2014;and the body was found about 10-15 yards away from where Lane was last seen, with a water depth of around six feet. </p>

<p>The boy&apos;s body was sent to the medical examiner&apos;s for an autopsy. While the cause of death has yet to be determined, the sheriff said, &quot;There&apos;s no question in my mind that the child was drowned by the alligator.&quot;</p>

<p>Nick Wiley, the executive director of Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation, said that they were working to find the alligator that attacked the child. &quot;There&apos;s a good chance we have the alligator,&quot; he said, referring to the five alligator found since the boy went missing, but added, &quot;If we can&apos;t get a match, we&apos;ll continue to get it.&quot; He explained that they&apos;ll use forensics, like comparing bite marks of the alligators to what might be found on the boy. </p>

<p>Demings and Wiley both stressed that Disney was very &quot;cooperative&quot; during the investigation. Wiley also mentioned that Disney had its own wildlife management program, where its staff will find alligators and work with the FWC to have them removed; Wiley did not have specific numbers on how many alligator incidents there were.</p>

<p>Answering questions about the &quot;No Swimming&quot; signs posted around the lagoon, Demings did not specifically say that Disney could have been more explicit forbidding any activity near the water&#x2014;photographs do not show any fencing at the shore&#x2014;but did indicate there was an opportunity to learn from the tragedy.</p>

<p>He also said the Graves family, who are visiting from Elkhorn, Nebraska, appreciated all the prayers people have been sending them. &quot;Of course, the family was distraught but [they were] somewhat relieved that we were able to find his body intact,&quot; Demings said, adding that the family would now be able to move forward with a burial.</p>

<p>All Disney property beaches around the Seven Seas Lagoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143206/http://www.people.com/article/beaches-closed-disney-alligator-attack-toddler">have been closed</a>. </p>
