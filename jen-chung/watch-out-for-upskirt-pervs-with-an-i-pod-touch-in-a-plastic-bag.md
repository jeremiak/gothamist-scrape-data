<p>The Union Square subway station is heavily trafficked, thanks to the many train lines that subway riders can catch there. It also means that it&apos;s pervert central. </p>

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509003158/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/suspected_union_square_subway_stati.php">pervs on the subway</a> groping women as well as ones who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509003158/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/03/former_tsa_agent_caught_alleged_ups.php">take upskirt pictures there</a>. The Post reports that a man was charged with unlawful surveillance for taking upskirts last week at the station: &quot;A cop caught Jefferson Sanchez, 22, <strong>placing a plastic sack containing an iPod Touch, usable for shooting videos, behind a woman</strong> walking up from the L-train platform at about 11:30 a.m. Monday, according to a Criminal Court complaint.&quot;</p>

<p>Also: Perverts may be lurking in Union Square Park, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509003158/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/10/cops_find_upskirt_perv_suspect_in_u.php">mirrors afixed to their boots for upskirt viewing</a>. </p>
