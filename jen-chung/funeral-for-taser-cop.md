Hundreds of police officers were on hand to remember the 21-year veteran of the force, who left behind his wife and three children.  Rev. Douglas Madlon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054821/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/suffolk/ny-lifune1007,0,3096362.story">revealed during the service</a> that Pigott, stripped of his badge and gun, was afraid he wouldn&apos;t be a police officer and had said to him, &quot;I&apos;m not a desk person.&quot;  One fellow cop told Newsday, &quot;It&apos;s a horrible, horrible thing.  He was a great man. He was a cop&apos;s cop.&quot; And while there was bitterness from some police officers and even Pigott&apos;s own father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054821/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/03/esu_cop_worried_he_disgraced_his_fa.php">towards the NYPD</a>, Police Commission Ray Kelly attended the wake over the weekend but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054821/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/10/06/2008-10-06_funeral_for_lt_michael_pigott_who_commit.html">not the funeral &quot;out of sensitivity to the family.&quot;</a></p>
