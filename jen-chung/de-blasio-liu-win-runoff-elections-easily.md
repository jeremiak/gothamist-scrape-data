										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_09_runoffwin.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015010304im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_runoffwin.jpg" width="264" height="170" class="image-left"> </span>Last night, the Democratic candidates for Public Advocate and City Comptroller were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015010304/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/29/runoff_results.php">decided in runoff elections</a>:  City Councilman Bill de Blasio won the Public Advocate race, with 63% of the vote while Councilman John Liu won the Comptroller matchup with 56% of the vote.  While they will face Republican challengers in the November election (Alex Zablocki for PA, Joseph Mendola for Comptroller), de Blasio and Liu are expected to win, given NYC&apos;s overwhelming majority of Democratic voters. </p>

<p>De Blasio told his supporters, &quot;There is so much we have to improve and change about our city. Whenever your government is not there for you, I will stand up for you. He defeated former Public Advocate Mark Green, who got 37% of the vote. Green said, who had been a frontrunner based on his name recognition, said, &quot;or now, I&#x2019;ll go back to writing, commenting, perhaps teaching and Air America Radio to keep the progressive voice strong around the city and country. You&#x2019;ll be hearing from me, but not in elected office.&quot; </p>
