<p>Police are still searching for the man accused of opening fire outside a Manhattan nightclub early Monday morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/12/flatiron_nighclub_shooting_leaves_2.php">killing one and wounding two others</a>. The suspect, meanwhile, insists he&apos;s innocent and has posted a photograph of himself on Instagram posing with Walikque Faussett, the 24-year-old woman who died. <b>Update</b>: The suspect is reportedly in custody (more details below).</p>

<p>Dalone &quot;Smack&quot; Jamison, 26, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://nypost.com/2015/10/12/three-women-shot-outside-new-york-city-nightclub/">was apparently identified</a> by bouncers at Motivo, the Flatiron District venue where an &quot;All Black Libra Bash&quot; party was being held (attendees were asked to wear all black). From the Post:</p><blockquote>Sources said bouncers threw Jamison out of Motivo following an argument with an unidentified woman and he vowed to return with a gun.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;He started to get disorderly and security had to physically escort him out,&#x201D; a source said. About 20 minutes later, he allegedly retrieved a gun from his BMW and waited on the street for the club to close, sources said. As patrons exited, he allegedly squeezed off at least five shots &#x2014; fatally striking Faussett &#x2014; before jumping back in the Beemer and fleeing, sources said.</p>

<p>Faussett, who has a 3-year-old son, Alexander, was struck in the back as she tried to hail a cab near Fifth Avenue. Her best pal, Renee Rondot, 25, was hit in the foot and hip, cops said.</p></blockquote>Deborah Raji , 30, was grazed in the shoulder. Faussett was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital; both Rondot and Raji are in stable condition.<p></p>

<p>After the shooting, Jamison posted the photograph with Faussett (above) and wrote, &quot;What&apos;s goin on in these streets smh hope lil sis ok I would loose it if not.&quot; Later he shared other thoughts, like &quot;I would never do no dumb shit people make story&apos;s&quot;:</p>

<p>A friend of Jamison&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/women-shot-critically-shot-flatiron-district-cops-article-1.2393697">told the Daily News</a> said that the suspect and victim knew each other: &quot;They are close friends. We all eat together. We go out together, we party together.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nyc-nightclub-shooting-suspect-long-criminal-history-article-1.2394977">The News also detailed</a> Jamison&apos;s history of arrests, noting he &quot;served virtually no jail time&quot; for a variety of incidents and was allegedly a &quot;member of Dymes R Us going back to at least 2008, court papers show... According to court papers, he choked a woman, pulled her to the ground and then slammed her head on the concrete. Then, court papers alleged, Jamison used a video camera to record others beating the woman. &apos;All I want to see is a good clean hook,&apos; he is quoted as saying. &apos;I just want to record it. Oooh. Oooh. Oooh. Dymes R us city.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_10_mot2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_mot2.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> (David Torres)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Witnesses recalled the frantic scene after the 4 a.m. shooting. One told the Daily News, &quot;We were about to step back out and at this point we see the two women laying on the ground on the sidewalk. They were shot. EMS was trying to resuscitate one of the females but nothing was working. They were trying to revive her but she was not responding at all.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/10/12/flatiron-district-fatal-nightclub-shooting/">Another said</a>, &quot;There were a lot of people actually trying to resuscitate one of the females.&quot;</p>

<p>Police found five shell casings. It&apos;s still unclear whether the target was the nightclub security staff or Faussett, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/women-shot-critically-shot-flatiron-district-cops-article-1.2393697">but an onlooker said</a>, &quot;The guy who started the fight, he was outside. The other guy was inside because the other guy didn&#x2019;t want to fight. But the one that was outside, he tried to get inside the club again, but the security did not let him go inside.&quot;</p>

<p>Faussett, a graduate of SUNY Canton and a Bronx resident, was the mother of a three-year-old boy and worked at Bloomingdale&apos;s in White Plains. Her father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://nypost.com/2015/10/12/three-women-shot-outside-new-york-city-nightclub/">Wali Faussett said</a> she was the &quot;perfect daughter,&quot; adding, &quot;I just hope the police catch him before I do. If I know anything of him, any pictures, I&#x2019;ll search for him myself because he should pay. A coward runs, shooting with a gun into a crowd.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Jamison is in custody; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164149/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/suspect-flatiron-district-nightclub-shooting-nabbed-article-1.2395510?utm_content=bufferca691&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">the News reports</a> that he &quot;was grabbed during a car stop in Brooklyn after investigators received a tip he was hiding out in the borough, officials said. Cops were bringing him to the 13th Precinct stationhouse for questioning Tuesday afternoon.&quot;</p>
