<p>The police are hoping the public can help them find the SUV driver who slammed into a man on a Manhattan sidewalk last week.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, on March 4th at 9:39 p.m., &quot;a dark colored SUV, bearing a partial New York State license plate of &apos;GSP&apos;, was heading westbound on Christopher Street when it mounted the sidewalk and struck a 40 year-old male.&quot;</p>

<p>The SUV driver fled in his car before officers arrived. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital for injuries to his torso. </p>

<p>Police released video (above) of the SUV, and the driver is wanted for leaving the scene of an accident. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
