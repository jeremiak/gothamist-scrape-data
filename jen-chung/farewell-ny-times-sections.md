The main difference is that the Metro section is no longer--Metro-related stories are now in Section A Monday through Saturday.  Business and Sports will be combined Tuesday through Friday (just think--after reading about your tanking stocks, you get to read about the crappy Knicks!).  As the letter from NY Times Senior VP of Marketing and Circulation Yasmin Namini said, &quot;Please note that were are not reducing the space devoted to Metro or Sports news.  This is simply a way for us to produce the paper more efficiently.  These changes enable us to offer you later- breaking news on Mondays and a freestanding Arts section on Saturdays.&quot;</p>
