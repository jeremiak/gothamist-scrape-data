</div></div><p>Joey Chestnut has done it again: The California native ate 62 hot dogs in 95-degree weather at this year&apos;s Nathan&apos;s July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest, for his fifth win in a row.  When asked if the humid weather affected him, Chestnut said not so much and emphasized that he&apos;s always looking to set a record (alas, he hasn&apos;t been able to break the 70-dog mark; he set the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130710063815/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/04/joey_chestnut_retains_mustard_belt.php">hot dog-eating record in 2009&#x2014;amid 70-degree weather&#x2014;with a stunning 68 dogs</a> but last year, Chestnut &quot;only&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130710063815/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/nathans_hot_dog_eating_contest_is_o.php#photo-1">downed 54 hot dogs in 10 minutes</a>).</p>

<p>His next closest competitor was Patrick &quot;Deep Dish&quot; Bertoletti, who finished the contest with an impressive showing by eating 53 hot dogs while Tim Janus finished with 45. As for what&apos;s next, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130710063815/http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=6737233">Chestnut told ESPN</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve never done oysters or hard-boiled eggs. I remember as a kid watching that movie -- &apos;Cool Hand Luke&apos; -- with my grandfather. You remember that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130710063815/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNyl6gXLMLQ">famous scene</a>? That&apos;s what I want to try.&quot;</p>
