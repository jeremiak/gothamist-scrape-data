<p>A woman was brutally slashed in the Bronx on Saturday, and the police have released surveillance footage of the attack in hopes that the public can identify the suspects.</p>

<p>At around 5:19 p.m. on February 20, in front of 3046 Holland Avenue, police say that two males &quot;got out of a black two door sedan and approached the 26 year old female victim on the sidewalk. One of the suspects stabbed the victim once in the right side of her stomach and the other suspect cut her in her right ear.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspects then fled in the car, going eastbound on Burke Avenue.</p>

<p>One suspect is described as being 6&apos;1&quot; and 160 pounds, last seen wearing a green hooded sweater, a gray winter cap, red shorts and black sneakers, while the other is described as being around 5&apos;10&quot;-5&apos;11&quot; and 200 pounds, last seen wearing a black jacket and gray pants. In the video, you can clearly see the suspect in red shorts threatening/chasing a person in blue who tries to approach them.<br>
