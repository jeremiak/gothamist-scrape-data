Caputo was also crowing the Quinnipiac poll that showed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730104235/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/new_poll_shows_paladino_closing_in.php">Paladino trailing Cuomo by just 6 points</a>&#x2014;&quot;With this kind of poll, we believe Carl can compete financially with Andrew Cuomo&quot;&#x2014;but a Marist poll to be released soon may show Cuomo with a far more comfortable lead.</p>
