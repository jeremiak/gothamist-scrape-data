The street then collapsed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010227/http://instagram.com/p/oUERHjGSWp/">creating a sinkhole</a>. However, the deli remained open, which Katz&apos;s owner Jake Dell says it&apos;s a credit to his &quot;amazing&quot; staff and the hard work of city agencies. </p>

<p>Dell, third generation owner of the deli, said, &quot;You wake up and you don&apos;t expect&quot; that your business&apos;s basement will be seriously flooded. Initially, there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010227/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/05/22/houston-street-pipe-break-hurts-businesses-drivers/">foot and a half of water</a>, but it turned into three feet of mud. The water &quot;hit everything&quot; but they stayed open because &quot;People always need to eat.&quot;</p>

<p>The  6,000 square feet basement stored mostly dry goods&#x2014;&quot;everything you need to run a business, basically,&quot; Dell said&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010227/http://instagram.com/p/oUMxC4GSTp/">no pastrami was harmed</a>, thank goodness. He heard the main, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010227/http://nypost.com/2014/05/22/massive-pipe-burst-floods-nyc-street-near-famed-deli/">installed in 1959</a>, break just before 11 a.m. and it was a &quot;gush&quot; of water.</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150518010227if_/http://instagram.com/p/oTcK1eBKuJ/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Dell and his staff immediately went to the basement to move items on shelves near the floor to higher ground. But Dell was only expecting six inches of water&#x2014;not the mess. &quot;It looks like a war zone,&quot; he said. &quot;Any crack you didn&apos;t think was there had water coming out. It was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; Dell added that during Hurricane Sandy, they lost power but there was only minor flooding (they stayed open during that, too). </p>

<p>The Houston street sidewalk was flooded yesterday, and Dell was relieved that it&apos;s dry and walkable today. A restoration crew has been working since last night to remove mud from the basement, and he hopes it&apos;ll be clean by tomorrow and it can dry out over the weekend, with construction next week. </p>

<p>Dell was grateful to all the city agencies who were on the scene yesterday and today, &quot;They all came together...  The Small Business Services and Office of Emergency Management are the only reason why we&apos;re open.&quot; Other businesses weren&apos;t as fortunate: The Lobster Joint, which is next to Katz&apos;s on Houston, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010227/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/05/22/houston-street-pipe-break-hurts-businesses-drivers/">had much equipment and seafood damaged</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;My job is to maintain tradition,&quot; Dell reflected. &quot;We&apos;re part of the community, the Lower East Side, and we want to be here for them... I&apos;m a little emotional at the response we&apos;ve gotten from everyone. It&apos;s been amazing.&quot;</p>
