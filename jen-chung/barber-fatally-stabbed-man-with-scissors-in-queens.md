										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2014_03_carlr.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330205732im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_03_carlr.jpg" width="240" height="283"> <br> <i style=" width:240px; ;display:block"> Carl Richardson</i></div> Yesterday afternoon, a 19-year-old man was stabbed at the Select Stylez barbershop in Laurelton, Queens. Carl Richardson was pronounced dead at Franklin General Hospital, and one of the barbers was arrested for killing Richardson with a pair of scissors.<p></p>

<p>Richardson&apos;s family says that he sold Cedric Simpson, 34, a pair of Bluetooth headphones on Wednesday and went to the shop on Merrick Boulevard yesterday to get his money. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330205732/http://nypost.com/2014/03/27/teen-fatally-stabbed-inside-queens-barbershop/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;When the young man returned on Thursday, Simpson refused to give him either the money or return the headphones, according to Richardson&#x2019;s family. A scuffle broke out, and was quickly broken up by the staff and patrons. But then the enraged Simpson lunged at the teen, allegedly stabbing him repeatedly in the stomach.&quot;</p>

<p>Simpson, a co-owner of the store, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330205732/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9482962">had apparently owed around $50</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330205732/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/queens-barber-fatally-stabs-teen-debt-cops-article-1.1737557">Richardson&apos;s father said</a> his son was selling the headphones to &quot;to raise $1,500 to buy a car,&quot; while his mother told the Daily News that he had been interning with an occupational therapist at a school, &quot;The fact that he could help kids&#x2014;he liked that&#x2014;he wanted to do that.&quot;</p>

<p>Simpson, who reportedly claimed that Richardson threatened him, was charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
