Why? Because of a suspicious passenger  An early report said that a passenger or group made threats against President Obama, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153341/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/delta-flight-investigated-after-threat-against-the-president-20110929-akd">MyFoxNY reports</a> that the FBI said, &quot;The FBI met the flight and an individual from that flight was denied entry to the U.S. There was no threat to the president.&quot;</p>

<p>The person who was denied entry was &quot;a British citizen tied to a radical environmentalist group that opposes airport expansion. The group apparently believes more runways mean more flights polluting the atmosphere.&quot;  The group is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153341/http://www.hacan.org.uk/">HACAN</a>&#x2014;&quot;campaigning against aircraft noise&quot;&#x2014;and the man is John Stewart.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153341/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23992996-third-runway-protester-escorted-off-plane-and-barred-from-america.do">Evening Standard says</a>, &quot;Mr Stewart, 62, who heads the anti-airport expansion protest group HACAN and who led the campaign against the third runway at Heathrow airport, was believed to have fallen foul of the US&apos;s strict visa entry requirements because he planned to spend a month travelling across the country campaigning.&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart was ordered to return to the U.K.  He had been accused of hypocrisy for flying out of Heathrow.</p>
