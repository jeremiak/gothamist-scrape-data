<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603143558/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/04/mo_no_mariano_rivera_tears_acl_duri.php">day after tearing his right ACL</a> while shagging balls during batting practice, the Yankees&apos; legendary closer Mariano Rivera told reporters, &quot;I&apos;m coming back. Write it down in big letters. I&apos;m not going down like this.&quot;</p>

<p>Rivera&apos;s doctor, David Altchek, told him he should be ready for spring training by February.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603143558/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/mariano-rivera-back-play-yankees-torn-acl-career-pinstripes-article-1.1072804">42-year-old said</a>, &quot;God willing and given the strength, I&apos;m coming back... I love to play the game. I don&apos;t think, to me, going out like this is the right way. ... I don&apos;t think like that. With the strength of the Lord, I have to continue.&quot;</p>

Mo&apos;s all about endings. I&apos;m sure he wanted to end things the right way.&quot;</p>
