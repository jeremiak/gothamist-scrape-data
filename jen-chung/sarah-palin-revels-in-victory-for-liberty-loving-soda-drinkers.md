<p>Mayor Bloomberg and the City of New York may be planning to appeal a NY judge&apos;s decision to block the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523114526/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/judge_stops_bloombergs_soda_ban.php">sugary drink ban, finding it &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot;</a> but of course not all politicians are crying carbonated tears. Freedom fighter and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin Tweeted last night, &quot;<strong>Victory in NYC for liberty-loving soda drinkers. To politicians with too much time on their hands we say: Govt, stay out of my refrigerator!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg has been touting the fact that 5,000 New Yorkers will die of obesity this year (70,000 across the U.S.) as Americans have become more and more obese over the years. In Alaska, Palin&apos;s home state, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523114526/http://www.ktva.com/news/local/Report-Alaska-Obesity-rate-up-to-27-percent-among-adults-169232396.html">obesity rate is up to 27% among adults</a> between 1991 and 2010, according to a state study: &quot;Alaska spends an estimated $459 million per year on direct medical health care costs related to obesity, according to the report. Alaska Medicaid spending attributable to obesity is projected to rise from $144 million in 2010 to $684 million in 2030 if current trends continue.&quot;</p>

<p>Interestingly, when surveyed about ways to prevent obesity, 60% of Alaskans supported a soda tax and 56% supported a junk food tax.</p>
