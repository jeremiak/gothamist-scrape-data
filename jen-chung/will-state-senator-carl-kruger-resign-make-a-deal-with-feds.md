<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="2011_07_krugerturks.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121015im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_krugerturks.jpg" width="250" height="247"> <br> <i>State Sen. Kruger with turkeys for donation (Kruger&apos;s State Senate website)</i></div> State Senator Carl Kruger has kept a relatively low profile since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121015/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/10/brooklyn_state_senator_carl_kruger.php">surrendering to federal authorities on corruption charges</a>. Okay, he did change his long opposition to gay marriage by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121015/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/24/gay_marriage_legalized_in_new_york.php">supporting the marriage equality bill</a>, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121015/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/quitter_kruger_plea_deal_3rYHqRnJv8bAV219RpWOLK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports he&apos;s got bigger stuff on his mind</a>&#x2014;like resigning this summer and taking a plea deal with the feds.  Why?  A source claims, &quot;The importance of his decision is so that he can negotiate better for his boyfriend.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Kruger is single and has never disclosed any details about his personal life, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121015/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/11/carl_kruger_lives_at_his_friends_ma.php">he was essentially outed</a> (by the Post) after he was accused of taking $1 million in bribes and setting up shell companies to launder the money.  His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121015/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/20/brooklyn_gothic_state_senator_carl.php">&quot;close&quot; friend and &quot;roommate&quot;</a> Michael Turano was also hit with corruption charges.</p>

<p>The Post&apos;s source points out, &quot;It&apos;s better to be able to negotiate the terms of your own surrender,&quot; but Kruger, a one-time &quot;Amigo&quot; who thought nothing of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201121015/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/07/amigos_walk_out_on_state_senate_dem.php">walking out on his fellow Democrats</a>, insists, &quot;I am absolutely not resigning, and I will continue to do what I&apos;ve been doing for the last 18 years.&quot;</p>
