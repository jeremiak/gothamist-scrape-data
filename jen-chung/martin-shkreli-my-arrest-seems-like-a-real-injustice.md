<p>Martin Shkreli, the reviled douchebag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://sfist.com/2015/12/15/garbage_human_martin_shkreli_once_a.php">pharmaceutical bro</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/martin_shkreli_wu_tang_clan.php">rap connoisseur</a> who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/douche_martin_shkreli_arrested.php">arrested last week for securities fraud</a>, has given his first interview. Speaking with the Wall Street Journal, the 32-year-old insisted the government targeted him because he&apos;s just a horrible human being, not because he actually did anything criminal, &quot;Beating the person up and then trying to find the merits to make up for it&#x2014;I would have hoped the government wouldn&#x2019;t take that kind of approach.&quot;</p>

<p>Shkreli&apos;s flamboyant trolling&#x2014;livestreaming his activities, fighting on Twitter&#x2014;made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://time.com/4078731/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-martin-shkreli/">him globally infamous</a> when, as CEO and founder of Turning Pharmaceuticals, he raised the price of a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis in AIDS and cancer patients from $13.50 per tablet to $750 per tablet.</p>

<p>However, the federal authorities say that his previous companies were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/us_vs_martin_shkreli.php">actually part of a Ponzi scheme</a> to pay off lost millions to investors of his failed hedge fund, using stock from a different pharmaceutical company, Retrophin. After ousting Shkreli, Retrophin then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://www.forbes.com/sites/arleneweintraub/2015/08/18/retrophin-sues-founder-martin-shkreli-for-65m-his-reply-preposterous/">sued him for $65 million</a>.</p>

<p>Discussing his public persona&#x2014;like offering to play the $2 million Wu-Tang Clan album for Taylor Swift <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2825/title.martin-shkreli-plans-to-bail-out-bobby-shmurda">if &quot;she wants to come over and suck my dick&quot;</a>&#x2014;Shkreli claims he was just playing:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;What do you do when you have the attention of millions of people? It seemed to me like it would be fun to experiment with,&#x201D; Mr. Shkreli said in the interview. He said he was arrested &#x201C;because of a social experiment and teasing people over the Internet,&#x201D; adding, &#x201C;that seems like a real injustice.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Quite frankly, it was not something I expected, and definitely not something I deserve given the facts,&#x201D; he said.</p></blockquote>He also scoffed at U.S. Attorney Robert Capers and the feds, &quot;&quot;You know, the press conference they put on was unacceptable. They used the term &#x2018;Ponzi,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Ponzi-like,&#x2019; which is nowhere near reality. The indictment doesn&#x2019;t use that word.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Well, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s press release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/former-hedge-fund-manager-and-new-york-attorney-indicted-multimillion-dollar-fraud">does use the term Ponzi</a>&#x2014;and if you read the indictment, it definitely describes a Ponzi scheme:<br>

<p>The hoverboard enthusiast has been cooped up in his Murray Hill apartment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/martin_shkreli_bail_thanks.php#photo-1">since making bail</a> because photographers are waiting for him to emerge. Over the weekend, Shkreli&apos;s social media <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251/http://nypost.com/2015/12/20/martin-shkrelis-calls-social-media-hacker-a-10-year-old/">was apparently hacked</a>; Shkreli dismissed the perpetrator a &quot;10-year-old.&quot; A 10-year-old with a solid sense of parody!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2015_12_shkrelitwitterhack.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022251im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_12_shkrelitwitterhack.jpg" width="640" height="664" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>&quot;The indictment itself is lacking rigor. I think it doesn&#x2019;t tell my side of the story at all,&quot; Shkreli told the Wall Street Journal, wearing &quot;the same gray, hooded sweatshirt that he had on when he was photographed after the arrest Thursday.&quot; WSJ adds, &quot;Mr. Shkreli declined to answer specific questions about the allegations, or about his defense. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Evan L. Greebel, a lawyer who worked with Mr. Shkreli, was also arrested for his role in the alleged scheme. Mr. Greebel has pleaded not guilty.&quot;</p>

<p>He now says he should have been less controversial and attention-whoring in his ways, because now there are regrets: &quot;Most people don&#x2019;t know the real Martin Shkreli. I think it would make sense to show them.&quot;</p>
