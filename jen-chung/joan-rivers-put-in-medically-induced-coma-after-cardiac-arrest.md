<p>Her daughter Melissa flew from L.A. yesterday to be with her and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518173642/http://www.eonline.com/news/574383/joan-rivers-hospitalized-daughter-melissa-rivers-says-iconic-comedian-is-resting-comfortably-surrounded-by-family">released a statement</a>, &quot;I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming love and support for my mother. She is resting comfortably and is with our family. We ask that you continue to keep her in your thoughts and prayers.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518173642/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/joan-rivers-hospitalized-stops-breathing-operation-article-1.1920028">A family source told the Daily News</a>, &quot;We are scared. This is not looking good.&quot; The News adds, &quot;Rivers, who was in critical condition late Thursday, will remain in a coma until the weekend, when doctors will discuss with her daughter the damage caused when her mother fell unconscious during a routine visit. &apos;They don&#x2019;t know how long she was starved of oxygen,&apos; a source said.&quot;</p>

Breathing can stop. You never know,&apos; Gomez said. &apos;And also, the elderly tend to metabolize medications a little bit differently.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Rivers had performed at a Manhattan club on Wednesday<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518173642/http://pagesix.com/2014/08/28/joan-rivers-stops-breathing-during-throat-procedure/?_ga=1.105964355.1965030224.1401028033">; attendee Shade Rupe said</a>, <br>
&quot;She did a joke onstage, she goes, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m 81 &#x2014; I could go at any moment.&apos;</p>

<p>The family source told the News, &quot;She would want us all to laugh. But at the moment, we are all praying.&quot;</p>
