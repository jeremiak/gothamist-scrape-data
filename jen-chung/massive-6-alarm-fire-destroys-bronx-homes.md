</div></div>					<p>Just before midnight, a fire started in a Bronx home that quickly spread to surrounding wood-frame houses. Two hundred firefighters were called to the scene, and brought the fire under control three hours later. </p>

<p>The fire started at 2086 Valentine Avenue at 180th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406055632/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/11/fire-bronx-row-houses/">One resident told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;My landlady knocked on the door screaming &#x2018;Fire! Fire!&#x2019; I ran out, grabbed my phone, no asthma pump, no glasses, nothing.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406055632/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/four-alarm-fire-tears-bronx-home-article-1.2462417">Another said to the Daily News</a>, &quot;We were woken up by the firefighters. We were sleeping. I have no idea how the fire started.&quot; </p>

Three of those homes were vacant, and five of the homes sustained severe damage.&quot;</p>

<p>FDNY Chief Edward Ferier said, &quot;One of the problems with the wood frame buildings is that it&#x2019;s purely combustible. So everything burns &#x2014; the furniture burns, the structural members burn, the roofing burns.&#x201D;</p>
