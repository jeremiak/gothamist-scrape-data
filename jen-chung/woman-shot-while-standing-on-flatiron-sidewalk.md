<p>A 21-year-old woman was grazed by a bullet while standing on a Manhattan sidewalk earlier this morning.</p>

<p>Police say the incident occurred around 1:20 a.m. today, at 28th Street and Broadway. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426130045/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Stabbings-East-New-York-Brooklyn-350725961.html">According to NBC New York</a>, the victim was &quot;waiting for her boyfriend at West 28th Street and Seventh Avenue... when two men arguing nearby began shooting at one another. Police say she ran for cover when she heard the gunfire, ducking into the NoMad Hotel at Broadway and West 28th Street.&quot; It was only when she was inside the hotel that she realized she had been shot.</p>

<p>The woman was taken to Bellevue Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police are investigating the shooting; apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426130045/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/17/flatiron-district-shooting/">four males got into a SUV and fled</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, a young woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426130045/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/12/flatiron_nighclub_shooting_leaves_2.php">was fatally shot and two others were injured</a> when a Flatiron district nightclub fight spilled out onto the sidewalk.</p>
