</div></div>					<p>Gahhhhhh! Six little grey kittens were saved by a pair of cops in Brooklyn this morning&#x2014;some heartless jerk threw them away in a suitcase!</p>

<p>The police tell us that at 7:26 a.m., officers responded to a 911 call about animal cruelty at 373 Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg, where a 30-year-old woman said that she saw a suitcase containing kittens inside the building&apos;s parking lot. </p>

<p>There were seven kittens in the suitcase; one of the kittens had an ear injury while another was dead. The six kittens were taken to the ASPCA and the police are investigating. (The NYPD is in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135524/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/29/aspca_reviews_three_times_as_many_a.php#photo-1">charge of investigating animal cruelty</a>, while the ASPCA provides care for the victims.)</p>
