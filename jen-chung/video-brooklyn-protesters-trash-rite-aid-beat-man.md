<p>According to the police, they are looking for &quot;a group of males and females that robbed&quot; a 51-year-old male at around 10:20 p.m. last night: &quot;The group entered the location and began to ransack the store. They removed items from the store, assaulted the victim with closed fists and a bottle, removed the victim&apos;s cellphone, and then fled the store on foot.&quot;</p>

They pulled the registers off the counter. They flipped over everything. They punched me in the face, several of them did, not just one. It was insane.&quot; Here&apos;s another video:</p>

<p>The vigil was prompted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604122941/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/cops_fatally_shoot_16-year-old_gunm.php">fatal police shooting</a> of 16-year-old Kimani Gray. While police insist that Kimani aimed his .38 caliber gun at them, his relatives questioned whether he owned a gun or would point one at the cops. Kelly said today, &quot;We have three witnesses, two of which said that one of the officers shouted &apos;Don&apos;t move&apos; and &apos;Freeze.&apos; Two witnesses also said they heard officers say, &apos;What do you have in your hands?&apos;&quot;<br>
