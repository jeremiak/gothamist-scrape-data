<p>Friends and relatives were especially concerned with Lehrer&apos;s disappearance, because she had a 10-month-old baby.  Back in August, authorities criticized Acuna for not cooperating (apparently he insisted on having a lawyer first).  Jersey City Police Chief Tom Comey said of Lehrer&apos;s husband, &#x201C;We have been delayed, because of a lack of cooperation on his part, has forced us to seek court orders, subpoenas and warrants to do our job.&quot; Comey added, &quot;Apparently, this is very uncharacteristic of her. In three years, this is the only time she&apos;s missed work, other than when she had her baby. It&apos;s out of her nature, according to all the people we&apos;ve interviewed, for her to leave her child behind.&quot;</p>

<p>Police discovered human remains in the concrete-filled drum in the  basement of the couple&apos;s former residence on Friday and confirmed that the remains had a tattoo with the same saying as one of Lehrer&apos;s.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111118040750/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/09/25/officials-killing-of-jersey-city-mom-&#x2018;a-domestic-violence-situation&#x2019;/?utm_source=home&amp;utm_medium=dl&amp;utm_campaign=missing-mom-arrest">Still, Lehrer&apos;s boss was upset</a>, &quot;The police should have found it right away. It&#x2019;s a two-family house and they should have searched from the top to the bottom.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Hudson County Prosecutor Edward DeFazio says the cause of death is still unknown but it&apos;s believed Lehrer was killed &quot;in the context of a domestic violence situation.&quot;</p>
