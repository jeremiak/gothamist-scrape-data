<p>The incident occurred at 9:07 p.m. on July 13, at the Crown Heights-Utica Avenue subway station at Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway. Police say that an &quot;unidentified male threw a lit cigarette, which struck the victim, a 4-year-old girl, in her chest.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect then fled. The girl, who was with her mother, complained of pain and was taken to a nearby hospital. </p>

<p>The NYPD released an image of the suspect, who is wanted for reckless endangerment. He is described as being bald and wearing blue jeans, a white short-sleeve polo shirt, and red sneakers and carrying a backpack on his back. <br>
