<p>When Christian Marclay&apos;s acclaimed 24-hour video montage <em>The Clock</em> made its New York debut at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115524/http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/497">Paula Cooper Gallery</a> a year and a half ago, lines of people spilled down the block.  Marclay&apos;s film incorporates thousands of movie clips that reference each minute of the day, for an entire day. Moments include those from <em>Great Expectations, The Simpsons, Mary Poppins</em> and <em>Tomb Raider</em>. Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115524/http://lincolncenterfestival.org/index.php/2012-the-clock">you can see it as part</a> of this year&apos;s Lincoln Center Festival&#x2014;and it will be shown continuously on some days!</p>

<p><em>The Clock</em> is showing at the David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center for free: Tuesdays-Thursdays, 8:00 am-10:00 pm; it runs continuously from Fridays at 8:00 am through Sundays at 10:00 pm (it&apos;s closed on Mondays). You can even get updates about the line via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115524/http://twitter.com/LCLineUpdates">LC Line Updates Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115524/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/arts/design/04marclay.html">NY Times wrote</a>, &quot;While &apos;The Clock&apos; is accurately parsing real time, movie time goes nuts, rushing past in an exhilarating, surprisingly addictive flood. A door opened in one movie leads into another movie. Questions asked in one will be answered in the next or the next after that.</p>
