<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Police-Manhunt-for-Escaped-16-Year-Old-Prisoner-in-Brooklyn-383724661.html">K9 units, a helicopter</a>, and numerous cops were dispatched to find a 16-year-old boy who escaped from a Brooklyn police precinct last night. The search was called off when the teen decided to turn himself back in.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_06_susp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_06_susp.jpg" width="215" height="270" class="image-right"> </span>Rhamar Perkins, a Brooklyn resident, had been arrested for &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/21/brooklyn-teen-escapes-police-custody/">turnstile jumping at the Rockaway Avenue subway station in Brownsville</a>&quot; around 9:30 p.m. But somehow, while being processed by the police at Transit District 32 at 960 Carroll Street, he managed to slip away. The police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245/http://7ny.tv/28KVSjq">issued an alert</a>, and at 2:49 a.m., authorities said he turned himself in.</p>

<p>Police don&apos;t know or aren&apos;t saying how the teen escaped&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245/http://nypost.com/2016/06/21/teen-caught-jumping-subway-turnstile-escapes-police-station/">the NY Post reports</a> that he left his confiscated belt and shoelaces behind. <b>Update</b>: It turns out that Perkins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245/http://nypost.com/2016/06/21/teen-escaped-from-police-custody-by-tricking-rookie-cop/">asked a rookie cop to use the bathroom</a> and made his getaway then. </p>

<p>Now, in addition to his initial &quot;theft of service&quot; charge, Perkins is charged with &quot;Escape.&quot; And some police officers will likely be in trouble, as Police Commissioner Bill Bratton has said in the past that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/escaped_prisoner_in_scrubs.php">rash of</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103245/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/20/escaped_prisoner_brooklyn.php">escaped prisoners</a> is &quot;an embarrassment for the department and something that we will deal with very severely as far as the officers involved.&quot;</p>
