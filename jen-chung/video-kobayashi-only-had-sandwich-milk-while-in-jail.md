<p>Here&apos;s video of six-time Nathan&apos;s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest champion Takeru Kobayashi discussing why he jumped onstage after Sunday&apos;s event, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131653/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/tsunami_strikes_kobayashi_arrested.php">led to his arrest</a> on charges of obstruction of governmental administration; resisting arrest; trespassing and disorderly conduct.  Kobayashi, who did not compete due to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131653/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/01/kobayashi_contest_organizers_are_tr.php">contract dispute </a>(he claims organizers would limit his participation in other events), said through a translator, &quot;I went as a spectator to cheer on my friends, and everyone was yelling &apos;let him eat,&apos; so I was hoping they would let me eat and prove I am still the champ.&quot; And, yes, he wished he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131653/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/05/chestnut_wins_hot_dog_eating_contes.php">could have had hot dogs</a> because all he had was a peanut butter sandwich and milk!</p>

<p>Of course, he jumped onstage <em>after</em> Joey Chestnut took the Mustard Belt for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131653/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/nathans_hot_dog_eating_contest_is_o.php">fourth year in a row</a> (and how much English does Kobayashi understand?).  Chestnut wasn&apos;t impressed with Kobayashi&apos;s claims and suggested that Kobayashi is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131653/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/kobi_dogged_fans_rLTbEeJSUeN0lBeJWKx2tK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">just talking a big game</a>, &quot;<strong>I know he thinks he&apos;s entitled to privileges, but he&apos;s lost three years in a row.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Major League Eating&apos;s Richard Shea insisted that this was not a publicity stunt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131653/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/05/2010-07-05_former_hot_dog_champ_takeru_kobayashi_released_from_jail_after_distrupting_natha.html">telling the Daily News</a>, &quot;We did not plan this. I stake my whole reputation on that,&quot; adding, &quot;I think [Kobayashi&apos;s] gone a bit loony. I don&apos;t know what his deal is. Does he want to start his own organization? If so, he can&apos;t stay in this one. I just hope he gets his head screwed back on.&quot; Shea also wasn&apos;t sure if Kobayashi would be banned from other events, &quot;We have to let everything digest before we do anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Kobayashi&apos;s rematch with the justice system is on August 5. </p>
