The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161543/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/drunk_cuff_huff_UjZhrUvZxsnXZDiyohwWwJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports that Seth Andrews crashed his city-owned car </a>and then threatened a female police officer who was arresting him, &quot;I&#x2019;m going to choke you, just watch out. You&#x2019;re done. I can&#x2019;t wait to get you on Staten Island. You just watch your gun.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to the Post, &quot;Andrews had been drowning his sorrows earlier that night at his White Street apartment in lower Manhattan after learning he hadn&#x2019;t landed a new job, law-enforcement sources said.&quot;  He drove to a bar to pick up his girlfriend, and crashed the Crown Victoria into a cab at King and Sixth Avenue.  He allegedly yelled at cops, &quot;I&#x2019;m on the job. Get the f--k away from me.&quot;  Andrews refused to leave his car to the point where &quot;His supervisor had to be called to persuade him to leave the car.&quot;</p>

<p>Andrews blew a 0.196 on the field sobriety test, more than twice the legal limit and then:</p><blockquote>During the trip to the Seventh Precinct station house, Andrews allegedly growled to the cops that he would &#x201C;get you after I get out&#x201D; and &#x201C;end you.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>At the station house, Andrews refused to take a Breathalyzer and allegedly claimed he had been &#x201C;beaten up&#x201D; by the arresting cops.</p>

<p>But he quickly recanted while being interviewed by a police captain and instead &#x201C;praised the officers for their professionalism,&#x201D; the sources said.</p>

<p>The NYPD&#x2019;s Internal Affairs Bureau was notified of Andrews&#x2019; liquor-laced accusations about cops beating him, but discounted them because of the flack&#x2019;s &#x201C;high level of intoxication,&#x201D; the sources said.</p></blockquote>Andrews was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161543/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111208/manhattan/city-spokesman-suspended-after-dwi-arrest">charged with DWI</a> and refusing to take a Breathalyzer.<p></p>
