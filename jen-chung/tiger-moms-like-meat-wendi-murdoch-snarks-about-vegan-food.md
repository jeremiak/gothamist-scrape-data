<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144149/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/fashion/wendi-murdoch-is-creating-a-career-of-her-own.html?_r=1&amp;ref=fashion&amp;pagewanted=all">NY Times has a long profile Styles section on Wendi Deng Murdoch</a>, media mogul Rupert Murdoch&apos;s third wife, who happens to be 38 years younger than his 81 years.  Apparently her first words to Murdoch&#x2014;during a town hall meeting in Hong Kong where Murdoch, still married to his second wife, was meeting with employees of Star TV&#x2014;were, &quot;Why is your China strategy so bad?&quot;  </p>

<p>The article touches upon on how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144149/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/09/chinese_mother_explains_why_chinese.php">she loves Tiger Mother Amy Chua</a> (Wendi Murdoch contacted Chua to have her daughters meet Chua&apos;s daughters: &quot;She was asking for advice like, &#x2018;How do you get a child to practice piano for more than one hour a day?&#x2019;&quot;) and how her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144149/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/rupert_murdochs_wife_also_shoved_sh.php">valiant defense of old man Murdoch against a prankster with a cream pie </a>during phone hacking testimony won her respect (&quot;Until the cream-pie incident, she&#x2019;d really been branded the classic younger wife with a tinge of racism and stereotyping&quot; said one former News Corp. employee).  </p>

<p>Overall, the article shows the incredible trajectory of a woman who came to the U.S. and had a first job at a Chinese restaurant in Westwood, California (&quot;for $20 day and all the leftover soup she can eat&quot;) while taking night classes to a woman who now goes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144149/http://thelook.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/07/25/7159825-wendi-murdoch-and-ivanka-trump-team-up-for-friendship-bling?lite">Sabbath dinner at Ivanka Trump</a> and Jared Kushner&apos;s apartment (Trump says, &quot;She loves the challah. She calls it &#x2018;that bread.&#x2019;&quot;).  And she&apos;s not above reminding her new fancy friends about her roots:</p><blockquote>Like last year when she and [Arianna] Huffington <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144149/http://www.patrickmcmullan.com/site/event_detail.aspx?eid=40599">hosted a party at Ms. Huffington&#x2019;s Manhattan apartment</a> to celebrate [Kathy] Freston&#x2019;s newest weight-loss book, &#x201C;The Lean.&#x201D; Guests included Martha Stewart, Joel Klein and Harvey Weinstein. Because Mrs. Freston is a vegan, the caterers had assembled a meatless spread with tofu, quinoa and kale spun into elaborate hors d&#x2019;oeuvres.<p></p>

<p>Ms. Huffington recalled a toast Mrs. Murdoch gave. &#x201C;She said, &#x2018;I grew up so poor in China that one day I aspired to have meat regularly,&#x2019; &#x201D; Mrs. Huffington said. &#x201C; &#x2018;Now that I can have meat three times a day, Kathy tells us we can&#x2019;t have any meat at all.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p></blockquote>Well, she hasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144149/http://dcist.com/2012/06/reviewed_subways_vegan_subs.php">tried the vegan Subway sandwich yet</a>!<p></p>
