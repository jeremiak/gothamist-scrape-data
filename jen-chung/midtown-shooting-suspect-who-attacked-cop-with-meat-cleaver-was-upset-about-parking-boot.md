					<p>The man who  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014924/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/15/penn_station_cleaver_shooting.php#photo-1">allegedly attacked an off-duty cop</a> with an 11-inch meat cleaver before getting shot in midtown Manhattan yesterday was apparently upset about a parking boot placed on his car, setting off a rush-hour panic. The suspect, Akram Joudeh, 32, was shot by police officers, and at a subsequent press conference Police Commissioner Bill Bratton explained, &quot;You have a character running down the street with a meat cleaver. The officer fired sufficient rounds to stop the attack.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The NYPD said that around 5 p.m., two uniformed Midtown South officers were responding to a possible crime at West 31st Street and Broadway. Someone apparently had called about Joudeh removing a parking boot from his car:</p>

He was doing it for about an hour. He was using a hammer. Other people were telling him to stop, that&#x2019;s illegal.&quot;</p>

<p>When the cops arrived, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014924/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/struck-meat-cleaver-attack-madison-square-garden-article-1.2793991">the Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Joudeh, who was likely living in the car, erupted in fury and pulled an 11-inch cleaver from his waistband. He began taunting the officers before running up Sixth Ave., knife in hand. &apos;He was running down the street, waving it,&apos; said an MTA worker who requested anonymity. &apos;The cops were chasing him.&apos;&quot;</p>

Officers directed him to drop weapons several times. It was a tense situation.&quot;</p>

<p>The officers pursued him to 6th Avenue, where Joudeh headed north, and they were joined other cops from Midtown South and the Transit Bureau. Around West 32nd Street, authorities say that a uniformed sergeant &quot;deployed a Taser striking the suspect without apparent effect.&quot; </p>

<p> NYPD Chief James P. O&apos;Neill told reporters:</p><blockquote>The suspect continued to run westbound on 32nd Street toward 7th Avenue. At mid-block the suspect mounted the front grill of the marked police car that was responding to the call.  At this point, an off-duty detective in civilian clothes attempted to subdue the suspect. The detective, Brian O&apos;Donnell, was struck in the head by the cleaver causing an approximate 6 inch gash.</blockquote>The detective was  slashed from his temple to his jaw.<p></p>

<p>At that point, O&apos;Neill said, &quot;Uniformed members then fired at the suspect, striking him several times.&quot; Both Joudeh and O&apos;Donnell were taken to Bellevue Hospital. </p>

<p>Two other officers suffered minor injuries. Bratton said of O&apos;Donnell, &quot;He&#x2019;s in good spirits, but he had a very significant injury to his head caused by that suspect wielding that meat cleaver.&quot;</p>

<p>Joudeh, who is in critical condition and underwent surgery, had previously been living in Queens, and was described as &quot;troubled&quot; by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014924/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Detective-Critical-Condition-Man-Attacks-Officers-Cleaver-Midtown-Shots-Fired-393673431.html">neighbors who spoke to NBC New York</a>: They said he was &quot;constantly fighting with his two roommates and sometimes getting visits from police. One woman who asked not to be identified said he once got into an altercation with a family member, and during the fight, broke the front glass door of the building&apos;s entrance.&quot;</p>

<p>His criminal history includes a 2013 incident during which, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014924/http://abc7ny.com/news/who-is-the-man-accused-in-meat-cleaver-attack/1513931/">according to WABC 7</a>,  he &quot;used a wooden fence post to smash up a 2009 Chevy while it was parked at 25th Avenue and 96th street in Queens.&quot; He reportedly told police, &quot;I thought it was a detective&apos;s car.&quot; More recently, in July, he was arrested for weapons possession&#x2014;&quot;police stopped him while pacing back and forth in front of a Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, synagogue&quot; and found knives in his car&#x2014;but the charges were dropped. </p>

<p>While the attack reminded some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014924/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/23/man_with_hatchet_killed_four_cops_w.php">2014 hatchet attack on police officers</a> that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014924/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/25/nypd_declares_hatchet_attack_an_act.php">deemed a terrorist attack</a>, police so far don&apos;t think Joudeh was radicalized. A police source told the News, &quot;There doesn&#x2019;t appear to be a terrorist link. He&#x2019;s an (emotionally disturbed person) who lives in his car.&quot;</p>
