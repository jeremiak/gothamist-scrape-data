But in the bad choices I made, I in turn made good choices. And one was for them to be with their dad a lot.&#x201D; Chamberlain, who says he hasn&apos;t spoken to her in a while, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111929/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/05/04/2009-05-04_joba_chamberlains_mom_arrested_in_nebraska_for_selling_meth_to_officer.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>You&apos;ve only got one mom, man, and you&apos;ve got to be thankful for her. I still love her</strong>.&quot; Random fact: Standley appeared in the same courtroom where Chamberlain pleaded guilty to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111929/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/07/during_arrest_joba_tells_cop_that_n.php">his October DUI</a>.</p>
