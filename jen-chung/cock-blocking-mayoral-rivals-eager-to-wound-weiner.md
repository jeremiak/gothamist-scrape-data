<p>Disgraced former Congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071756/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071756/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/its_official_anthony_weiner_wants_t.php">disclosure that he&apos;s considering running for mayor</a> has struck fear into the hearts of mayoral rivals&#x2014;and delight in the hearts of anyone who appreciate penis puns. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071756/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/charging_hard_at_weiner_JUI7OGfIMQa1q4MpfpsrZJ">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Sources in the camps of several campaigns said they have been in dirt-digging overdrive...Potential rivals are aggressively compiling dossiers and detailed lists of questions about the Democrat&#x2019;s three-year foray into social-media sexting in hope of keeping the illicit Web exchanges at the center of any mayoral bid.&quot; Operation: BONER KILLER.</p>

<p>In fact, apparently some campaigns have &quot;dispatch[ed] workers to squeeze Weiner&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071756/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weinergate_weiner_and_his_willing_w.php">online sexting partners</a> &#x2014; he has claimed there were six in all &#x2014; for information about the late-night exchanges, which culminated in the infamous &apos;crotch shot&apos; tweet that imploded his career.&quot; A source said, &quot;He is such a danger to them, and he has so much money, that <strong>the thinking is, if Weiner wants to run, he has to be destroyed.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking of money&#x2014;the Daily News points out that three of his fundraisers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071756/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/weiner-return-questionable-cash-run-article-1.1314519?localLinksEnabled=false">have been arrested</a> and that some of his former supporters are over him (&quot;He&#x2019;s a good person. He would be a good mayor. But I&#x2019;m not supporting him&quot;) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071756/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-backers-cool-weiner-run-article-1.1314503">although one was pumped</a>, &#x201C;I think he&#x2019;s a terrific candidate and would be a great mayor. Personal failings fade with time in people&#x2019;s minds.&quot;</p>
