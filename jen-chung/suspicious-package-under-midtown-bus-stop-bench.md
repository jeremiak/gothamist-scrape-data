<p>The NYPD has closed down 9th Avenue between 34th and 33rd Streets, due to a suspicious package.  A reader sent us a photograph of the package in question&#x2014;numerous bags under a bus stop bench.  Ever since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153432/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/01/times_square_closed_after_police_fi.php">attempted car bombing</a> in Times Square on May 1, there have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153432/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/photo_of_times_square_empty_for_sus.php">numerous calls</a> about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153432/http://gothamist.com/tags/suspiciouspackage">suspicious packages</a> (street vendors were credited with tipping off cops in the May 1 incident).  </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The packages were apparently deemed not suspicious later on, as the street reopened without incident.</p>
