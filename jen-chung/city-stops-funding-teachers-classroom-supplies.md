										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="20011_09_crayons.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223094421im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/20011_09_crayons.jpg" width="300" height="240" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223094421/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/nyc_public_schools_open_up_today.php">school year has started again</a>, but classrooms may be lacking in essential supplies.  With budget cuts hitting every possible part of city agencies (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223094421/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/25/4100_teacher_layoffs_averted_after.php">4,100 teachers jobs were threatened</a>), the NY Times reports on how the &quot;Teacher&apos;s Choice&quot; program, which allowed teachers to get reimbursed for getting their classes ready, has been suspended for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>At one time, Teacher&apos;s Choice reimbursed up to $220 in purchases, but it fell to $110 last  year. Still, $110 was still <em>something</em> when many teachers tend to spend more out of their own pockets. A second-grade teacher in Brooklyn told the Times, &quot;More than the dollar amount, I think it&#x2019;s the concept. Because the concept says: &#x2018;We understand that you&#x2019;re putting out a lot, and we&#x2019;re supporting you in that.&apos;&quot;  </p>

<p>Some teachers say they&apos;ll keep buying, but might have to budget.  A kindergarten teacher admitted, &quot;A lot of things you would have bought, you&#x2019;re going to leave off. Like helping the kids out with their supplies, because some of them come in without supplies &#x2014; that&#x2019;s going to have to stay off the list. I am going to buy some notebooks, but I&#x2019;m not going to buy as many as I usually buy. I&#x2019;m just going to hope that most of them bring it in, and these are for the kids who just can&apos;t.&quot; </p>

<p>In July, one educator said the end of Teacher&apos;s Choice<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223094421/http://www.accountabletalk.com/2011/07/requiem-for-bad-program.html"> should translate to all teachers dropping the habit</a> of spending their own money on supplies: &quot;No more money from our pockets while Bloomberg spends 900 million on &quot;contractors&quot; or pays millions of our tax dollars to Rupert Murdoch and Joel Klein in no bid contracts. Nuh uh. No way. I&apos;ll live without chalk and chart paper. But I can&apos;t live with the idea that the billionaires are feasting on our tax dollars while we have to go begging for rubber bands.&quot;  Well, the state did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223094421/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/state_kills_27_million_nyc_schools.php">drop the News Corp. contract</a>&#x2014;so maybe spend now? </p>

<p>And if you want to help needy classrooms, go to Donors Choose, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223094421/http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/search.html?page=1&amp;state=NY&amp;community=19811:3">where you can donate to classrooms</a>.  For instance, Ms. G&apos;s Bronx kindergarten class&#x2014;in a high poverty area&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223094421/http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=623427&amp;verify=-177265512">could use paper, glue sticks, and more</a>.  </p>
