					<p>After being arraigned on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/douche_martin_shkreli_arrested.php">securities fraud charges</a>, hedge fund founder turned pharmaceutical CEO/provocative asshole Martin Shkreli posted $5 million bail yesterday afternoon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/dealbook/shkreli-indictment-portrays-small-time-fraud.html">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Mr. Shkreli, who had shown a great deal of self-confidence in recent television appearances before his arrest, looked a little shaken during the arraignment, occasionally twisting his head to look at the packed courtroom.&quot;</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors accused Shkreli, as well as his lawyer, of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/us_vs_martin_shkreli.php">orchestrating a Ponzi scheme</a> using the hedge fund and Shkreli&apos;s subsequent companies, to dupe investors out of their money. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Diego Rodriguez deemed it a &quot;securities fraud trifecta of lies, deceit, and greed.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the allegations: that the 32-year-old had bragged to a hedge fund investor that there was $35 million in the fund&apos;s accounts, while there was only $700, and that Shkreli and attorney Evan Greebel continued to lie about the fund&apos;s success while trying to pay the investors with stock from Retrophin, which Shkreli started after the fund failed. </p>

<p>Michael Perino, the Dean George W. Matheson Professor of Law at St. John&#x2019;s University School of Law, noted that it was &quot;pretty unusual&quot; for the prosecutors to charge the attorney, which allows them to undercut&apos;s Shkreli&apos;s possible defense that he &quot;relied in good faith on my counsel,&quot; making this case more than the &quot;plain vanilla securities fraud.&quot; </p>

<p>Shkreli left Retrophin earlier this year, and founded Turing Pharmaceuticals, reaching new heights of public notoriety after raising the price of Daraprim, a drug used to treat rare, life-threatening cases of toxoplasmosis, from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill. He insisted it was necessary to allow Turing to develop research and development about drugs and to educate physicians. The U.S. Attorney&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/us_vs_martin_shkreli.php">said yesterday it was unclear if Shkreli</a> did so to raise money to fight a $65 million civil lawsuit from Retrophin. (It&apos;s worth noting that<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/an-executives-arrest-gives-drug-makers-cover.html?ref=dealbook"> many pharmaceutical companies raise the prices</a> of their much-needed drugs, though maybe not as steeply as Turing did.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://www.wsj.com/articles/martin-shkreli-from-biotech-entrepreneur-to-accused-criminal-1450389335?tesla=y">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;The [Retrophin] lawsuit described a vengeful executive, accusing Mr. Shkreli of threatening a former employee of his MSMB hedge fund and the former employee&#x2019;s family, including contacting two of the former employee&#x2019;s children on Facebook and telling one that their father had stolen $3 million. According to the lawsuit, Mr. Shkreli also threatened the former employee&#x2019;s wife, writing in a letter, &apos;I hope to see you and your four children homeless and will do whatever I can to assure this.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Retrophin says Shkreli&apos;s arrest &quot;vindicated&quot; their decision to replace him and that they are cooperating with the authorities. </p>

<p>Both Shkreli and Greebel posted bail and must surrender their passports. Shkreli&apos;s $5 million bail was secured by his father and brother and Greebel&apos;s $1 million bail was secured by his wife and mother. Shkreli has turned to Twitter:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Glad to be home. Thanks for the support.</p>&#x2014; Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/https://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/677696761511682048">December 18, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if he&apos;ll be resuming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://gawker.com/here-s-a-video-of-pharma-creep-martin-shkreli-flirting-1748338016">livestreams to creepily chat with teenagers</a> or finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/shkreli_wu_tang_seizure.php">listen to that Wu-Tang Clan album</a>, but a statement from Shkreli&apos;s spokesperson reads, &quot;It is no coincidence that these charges, the result of investigations which have been languishing for considerable time, have been filed at the same time of Shkreli&#x2019;s high-profile, controversial and yet unrelated activities.&quot; </p>

<p>Greebel has not released a statement, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawyer-linked-to-martin-shkreli-arrested-on-fraud-charge-1450393836?tesla=y">WSJ article notes</a> he had been part of a team helping the Winklevoss twins start a bitcoin exchange fund.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181016/http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-securities-fraud/">Bloomberg News offers</a> two now-prescient quotes: Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) said during a Senate hearing last week, &quot;Some of these companies seem to act more like hedge funds than traditional pharmaceutical companies,&quot; and George Scangos, CEO of biotechnology giant Biogen Inc., said in an interview, &quot;Turing is to a research-based company like a loan shark is to a legitimate bank.&quot;</p>
