<p>Horton, who had 13 children, was at Pitkin Avenue and Watkins Street when the shooting took place and two other people were injured&#x2014;a woman was shot in the arm and chest while an 11-year-old girl was grazed in the face. The child, Cheanne McKnight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224094052/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/hero_mom_is_killed_XTwbjsRvjRJdIg2QTAvlNK#ixzz1bW5AiIZJ">was yelling</a>, &quot;They shot me in the face! They shot my face!&quot; and her mother says that Horton saved her daughter, &#x201C;She could have been dead. Thank God it was just her face. She knew what happened, her face hurt.  She said it felt like a rock hit her.&#x201D;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224094052/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/21/witnesses-say-pregnant-woman-killed-in-crossfire-near-brooklyn-school/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, police are looking at whether the gunfire was from the roof at 1800 Pitkin, &quot;where seven shell casings were found.  Five other shell casings were found in front of that building and authorities believe they came from a gunman&#x2019;s 9mm semiautomatic pistol.&quot; Cops say 14 shots were fired and it&apos;s thought that the shooter was aiming at some young people on the street.</p>

<p>A witness said that Horton&apos;s face was &quot;torn off&quot; by the gunshots. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224094052/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/hero_mom_is_killed_XTwbjsRvjRJdIg2QTAvlNK"> Horton&apos;s fiance&apos;s brother told the Pos</a>t, &quot;She&#x2019;s the best mom they could ask for. She gave them what they want -- she took care of her kids. [The killer] should suffer because the little kids of Zurana have to suffer.&quot;</p>

<p>No one has been arrested, but there is a $12,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the shooter. The Daily News says, &quot;The shooting took place inside an NYPD Operation Impact Zone, an area saturated with young cops in response to persistent crime problems.&quot;</p>
