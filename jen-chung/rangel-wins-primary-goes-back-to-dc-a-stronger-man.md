<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316081310/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/charles_rangel_charged_with_house_e.php">embattled</a> longtime House member Rep. Charles Rangel won the Democratic primary for the 15th Congressional seat in Harlem.  He had 50% of the vote; the next closest challenger was Adam Clayton Powell IV, who had about 24%.  The 80-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316081310/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/nyregion/15rangel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told his supporters</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know how this will be misconstrued by the press. But no matter what they say, I go back to Washington a stronger man than I have ever been.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, the Daily News reports that Rangel&apos;s team had been hoping the 20-term Congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316081310/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/14/2010-09-14_rangel_wins_but_margin_short_of_hopes.html">would win 60% of the vote</a>, to show President Obama and other Democrats that he&apos;s still a powerfully popular figure.  Still, Rangel also said, &quot;In the time we are at in our history, President Obama needs people like me more than ever. I&#x2019;ll go back to tell the president, &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t need those Republicans, and there are a lot of Democrats who got elected, but they vote Republican.&apos;&quot; (Obama notably suggested that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316081310/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/31/obama_thinks_rangel_should_end_care.php">Rangel end his career with dignity</a>.)</p>

<p>Rangel will likely face his House ethics trial after the general election.  </p>
