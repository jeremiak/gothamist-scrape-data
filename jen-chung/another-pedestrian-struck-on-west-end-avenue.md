<p>Last night, around 8 p.m., a pedestrian crossing West End Avenue in Manhattan was struck by a car. </p>

<p>Police say that an 87-year-old man driving a Nissan Sentra was traveling northbound on West End Avenue when he struck a 73-year-old crossing the street. The victim was traveling east to west across West End.</p>

<p>This is one of many incidents where pedestrians have been struck by vehicles on or turning onto West End Avenue. This year, Cooper Stock, 9, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013903/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/11/9-year-old_fatally_struck_by_taxi_i.php">was killed when crossing 97th Street</a> with his father when a taxi turned from West End and Jean Chambers, 61, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013903/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/10/woman_killed_by_suv_driver_on_upper.php">crossing West End when a car</a> turning from 95th Street fatally struck her. </p>

<p>Residents and lawmakers have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013903/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/pedestrian_deaths_uws.php">outraged at the &quot;epidemic&quot; of pedestrian fatality and injuries</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013903/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/dots_new_plan_for_west_end_ave_mean.php">Department of Transportation will be transforming West End</a> from four lanes of traffic (two northbound, two southbound) to two lanes (one north, one south) plus a median/turn bay area.</p>
