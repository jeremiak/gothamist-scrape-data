<p>The taxi driver<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325210932/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/cops_arrest_taxi_driver_suspected_o.php"> arrested for allegedly raping a passenger</a> in Williamsburg is claiming he was not behind the Brooklyn attack.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325210932/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cabbie_accused_woman_rape_says_dna_7t5WWWFLANZvH2TWoAPtLJ">According to prosecutors</a>, Gurmeet Singh said, &quot;I did not rape anybody ... I do not know how my DNA got in her vagina.&quot;</p>

<p>Singh, who is being held on $1 million bail, was caught by police officers posing as Taxi and Limousine inspectors who asked him to meet at the TLC offices.  They offered him a glass of water&#x2014;which gave them a chance to collect his DNA.  The DNA was matched to the May attack, where an East Village woman who hailed a cab on N. 6th blacked out in Singh&apos;s taxi and was allegedly raped.  </p>

<p>Singh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325210932/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/taxi-driver-gurmeet-singh-charged-rape-picked-hookers-record-shows-article-1.1004512">also allegedly said</a>, &quot;Sometimes I pick up women, call girls, off the street and have sex with them.&quot;  Police were led to Singh after another attack where he allegedly raped a passenger in Harlem.</p>

He&#x2019;s not that kind of man. He never keeps secrets from me or his family. I&#x2019;ve talked to him, and he said: &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know why they are taking me. I&#x2019;ve done nothing wrong.&#x2019;&quot;</p>
