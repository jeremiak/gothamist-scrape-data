<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321083021/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/remember_the_r_train_will_be_useles.php">we&apos;ve been reminding you</a>, the R train will be running in two parts on weekdays while the Montague Tube tunnel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321083021/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/r_train_east_river_tunnel_will_prob.php">is shut down for 14 months</a> for repairs (it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321083021/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/mta_just_now_beginning_to_repair_r.php#photo-1">badly damaged</a> during Hurricane Sandy). And the last Queens-bound train leaves the Court Street Station at 11 p.m. tonight.</p>

<p>Then, at 11:30 p.m., the MTA NYC Transit will begin its &quot;Fix&amp;Fortify;&quot; work on the tunnel. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321083021/http://new.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/r-montague-tubes-set-close-friday-night-14-months-sandy-related-repairs">MTA explained</a>, &quot;The project is designed to restore and rebuild damaged infrastructure while reducing the subway system&#x2019;s vulnerability in the event of future severe weather events&quot;&#x2014;it&apos;s received nearly $3.8 billion in funds from the Federal Transit Administration.</p>

<p>Chairman Thomas Prendergast said, &quot;The job that we have ahead of us is an enormous challenge and we are grateful for the support that we have received from Governor Cuomo and the Federal Government in securing the funds necessary to perform these vital tasks. These investments in repairing and reinforcing the system&#x2019;s infrastructure will help safeguard the most vulnerable areas of our subway system for decades to come.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are the changes:</p>

<p><strong>On weekdays: </strong><br>
From 6 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on weekdays, the R will run in two sections, from Forest Hills-71st Street in Queens to Whitehall Street in Manhattan, and from Court Street to Bay Ridge-95th Street in Brooklyn. The estimated 65,000 daily riders affected will be accommodated by trains running between Brooklyn and Manhattan on the 2/3/4/5/A/B/C/D/F/N and Q lines, all of which are accessible from the R train&#x2019;s final four stations in Brooklyn (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321083021/http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/R_14monthMontagueTunnelClosure.htm">see more here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>On weekends: </strong><br>
From 6 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, the R will be re-routed over the Manhattan Bridge serving all stations with the exception of Court Street and Jay-Street-MetroTech in Brooklyn and the City Hall, Cortlandt, Rector, and Whitehall Street stations in Lower Manhattan.</p>

<p><strong>Late nights:<br>
</strong>The N, which is normally re-routed through the tunnel to replace the R, will instead continue to operate over the Manhattan Bridge at all times.</p>
