<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011555/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Central-Park-Robbery-Woman-Purse-Snatched-Chokehold-283435011.html">victim, Lisa Karanz, told NBC New York</a> that &quot;she was taking her normal route home along the northernmost path of the park after getting off the subway at 110th Street near Lenox Avenue just before midnight. Then &apos;I was grabbed, put in a chokehold, brought to my knees, brought to the ground.&apos; &quot; Her purse was later found at a subway platform, with everything inside. </p>

<p>Karanz believes the  suspects were following her &quot;along the well-lit path before ambushing her.&quot; She added, &quot;Don&apos;t let your guard down for a second because when you do, you never know what can happen in a city like this.&quot;<br>
