                            <p> <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_buffalowings.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820135340im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_buffalowings.jpg" width="640" height="497"> <br> <i> Some Buffalo Wild Wings</i></div> <p></p>

<p>There&apos;s already a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant and bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820135340/http://www.buffalowildwings.com/Locator/Detail/3331">in Brooklyn</a>, and now the chain restaurant (based in Minneapolis) is taking over an entire building in Times Square to build a 15,000 square foot temple to wings&#x2014;and TVs for sports fans to watch games. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820135340/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/realestate/commercial/imes_sq_to_take_wings_DJ0QylbBlu1u99hZnIARnI">There will be stadium seating</a>.</p>

<p>Buffalo Wild Wings will take over 253 West 47th Street. According to a press release from Winick Realty Group, there will be &quot;15,000 square feet of dining and entertainment, including a 5,000-square-foot ground floor with soaring 22-foot ceilings&quot; for its multimedia entertainment systems. And there will be a 2,000 square foot roof deck. </p>

<p>The chain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820135340/http://www.buffalowildwings.com/menu/wings/">boasts about</a> its 16 sauces and 5 seasonings for wings (Jamming Jalapeno!, Thai Curry) and an array of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820135340/http://www.buffalowildwings.com/menu/drinks/beer/">domestic, imported and craft beers</a>. However, reviewers on Yelp have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820135340/http://www.yelp.com/biz/buffalo-wild-wings-brooklyn">wildly differing opinions</a> of the popular Brooklyn location, especially on Tuesdays when there&apos;s special pricing on wings: &quot;Groups of people lined up in front of this place like a Black Friday sale and fight for seating. That&apos;s how rough it is. Fortunately, it&apos;s in the mall and you can kill time by shopping. I came here last summer with my coworkers and the 12 of us were seated within almost 2 hours, more or less.&quot;<br>
