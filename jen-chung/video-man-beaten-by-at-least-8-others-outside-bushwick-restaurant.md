<p>Surveillance video shows the brawl, which includes one person using his belt to strike the victim and another wielding a bar stool.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at midnight on Saturday, April 16th, in front of Vaqueros restaurant at 1541 Myrtle Avenue in Bushwick. The 26-year-old victim, police say, &quot;was punched, kicked, stabbed with a sharp object and hit with bar stools by a group of approximately 8 to 10 suspects.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim, who suffered multiple lacerations to his torso, shoulder and left arm, was taken to Elmhurst General Hospital in critical but stable condition.</p>

<p>Police describe the suspects as being in their early-to-mid-20s and believe they fled eastbound on Myrtle Avenue after the assault.</p>
