<p>Billy Bush is talking more about his career-wrecking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170524221505/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">vulgar off-camera 2005 conversation with Donald Trump</a>. The disgraced entertainment journalist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170524221505/https://www.yahoo.com/gma/billy-bush-breaks-silence-infamous-tape-trump-sacrificed-113258909--abc-news-celebrities.html">told Good Morning America</a>, &quot;If I had ever thought...that there was a grown man sitting in front of me detailing his sexual assault strategy, I would have called the FBI... With Trump, it&apos;s not much of a give-and-take. When he said what he said at the end...to me, it was more braggadocio, his word, and performance.&quot;</p>

<p>Last October, the Washington Post published audio that was captured as part of an <em>Access Hollywood</em> interview segment between Bush and Trump, which featured Trump telling Bush during a break, &quot;You know I&#x2019;m automatically attracted to beautiful&#x2014;I just start kissing them. It&#x2019;s like a magnet... And when you&apos;re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything. Grab &apos;em by the pussy.&quot;</p>

<p>Bush&apos;s response at the time was to laugh hysterically, which he now realizes was terrible, especially after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170524221505/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/22/billy_bush_trump_interview.php">his teen daughter cried when she heard the clip</a>. On Good Morning America, Bush claimed that he reported Trump&apos;s remarks after the interview and learned that they had been recorded a few days later. &quot;I said, &apos;You wouldn&apos;t believe the things that Trump was saying, you know, off camera&apos;....  I never thought about it again. I just went on. It was Trump. It was an inconsequential ... He wasn&apos;t running for president. He was, at the time, the biggest star on television.&quot;</p>

<p>Bush had been interviewing Trump ahead of the real estate developer/reality star&apos;s guest appearance on <em>Days of Our Lives</em>. When Bush apparently spotted Trump&apos;s co-star, <em>Days</em> actress Arianne Zucker, Bush was heard saying that she&apos;s &quot;hot as s--t. In the purple. Whoa, the Donald is good! Whoa, my man!... The Donald scores!&quot;</p>

<p>Bush only actually listened to the tape days before the Washington Post released it, and recalled, &quot;I recoiled ... It was guttural. Nobody reacted harsher and more gutturally than I did ... It really, really just killed me... &quot;I remember the guy on the other side ... Twelve years ago, it was my first year as co-host of the show. I was insecure ... I was a pleaser.&quot; </p>

<p>After the tape emerged, Bush was fired from his new gig as a host of The Today Show. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170524221505/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4535176/Billy-Bush-knew-producer-planned-leak-p-gate-tape.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailus">The Daily Mail is now reporting</a> that the person who remembered the conversation during last year&apos;s campaign was Bush&apos;s executive producer at Access Hollywood, Rob Silverstein, who &quot;allegedly wanted to compromise Trump&apos;s presidential bid while boosting the ratings of Access Hollywood.&quot; </p><blockquote>Silverstein, Bush&apos;s best friend and godfather to his youngest daughter, concocted a plan to release the tapes. He initially intended to edit out his pal&apos;s participation in the conversation.<p></p>

<p>&apos;Rob sent the entire video to the NBC legal department to get permission to leak it. They were stalling the process, doing what network lawyers do when over-thinking a situation like this,&apos; said the source. </p>

<p>&apos;But that&apos;s when someone else with access to the tape got antsy and decided to send the video to The Washington Post. It was done without Billy being edited out and that&apos;s how he was compromised during the process.&apos;</p></blockquote>Bush has reportedly not spoken to Silverstein since.<p></p>

<p>The tape also included a part where Trump revealed to Bush how he tried to sleep with Bush&apos;s colleague, Nancy O&apos;Dell, but failed&#x2014;&quot;I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll show you where they have some nice furniture.&#x2019; I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn&#x2019;t get there. And she was married.&quot; Trump also said of Dell, &quot;Then all of a sudden I see her, she&#x2019;s now got the big phony tits and everything. She&#x2019;s totally changed her look.&quot;<br>

O&apos;Dell said this week</a> on Entertainment Tonight, &quot;Billy reached out to me just about three weeks ago by email. He wrote a really nice apology, which I appreciated very much. He and I worked together for so many years, for a long time, and I only wish him the best moving forward.&quot;</p>
