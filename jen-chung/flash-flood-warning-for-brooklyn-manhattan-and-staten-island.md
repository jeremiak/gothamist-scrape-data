<p>It&apos;s thunderstorming, and the National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning until 9:15 a.m. for Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719050514/http://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=okx&amp;wwa=flash%20flood%20warning">NWS also says</a>, &quot;Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other drainage areas and low lying spots. Do not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the roadway. The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross safely. Move to higher ground.&quot;</p>

<p>But what if you&apos;re in the subway?</p>
