<p>Anywhere from 50 to 70 people have reportedly been arrested as part of a huge child pornography ring takedown by the federal authorities. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523185255/http://7online.com/news/cops-youth-coach-arrested-in-massive-child-porn-bust/70996/">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;Two NYPD officers, an FDNY paramedic and a Little League coach are among [the arrestees]...The months-long investigation by federal authorities also nabbed a rabbi, a nurse and a Boy Scout den master.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspects, who were from the NYC area, apparently used anonymous file-sharing sites to distribute images and videos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523185255/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Child-Porn-Arrest-New-York-Little-League-Coach-Rabbi-Police-Officer--260093081.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;Authorities said the victims who were sexually exploited and photographed range in age from newborn to 17... The New York effort resulted in the seizure of nearly 600 desktop and laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices containing a total of 175 terabytes of storage.&quot;</p>

<p>The charges will be announced at a press conference later today. The investigation was launched after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523185255/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/westchester_police_chief_arrested_o.php">arrest of Mount Pleasant Police Chief Brian Fannelli for child pornography</a>. The Westchester law enforcement official had been instructing children at church classes about inappropriate touching; he told investigators that he had been looking at child porn for &quot;research&quot; and then continued out of &#x201C;personal interest.&#x201D;</p>

<p>James Hayes, of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523185255/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/21/feds-charge-dozens-in-nyc-area-in-child-porn-case/">told the AP that consuming child porn</a> &#x201C;is not something that is just done by unemployed drifters who live in their parent&#x2019;s basement. If this operation does anything, it puts the lie to the belief that the people who do this are not productive members of society.&quot;</p>
