The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151816/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2010/04/cops_make_arrest_in_break-in_a.html">Advance reports,</a> &quot;Emil Sorensen, 21, of Elm Park, is accused of being the lookout in the crime, which was carried out on a weekend... Police say he admitted his role and copped to selling some of the stolen goods &#x2014; a Nintendo Wii, a laptop and jewelry.&quot; Unfortunately, &quot;Star&#x2019;s fate is unclear.&quot;  </p>

<p>The burglary rocked Eden II School For Children With Autism <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151816/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/10/burglar_takes_hamster_sock_monkey_f.php">last month</a>:  School director Joanne Gerenser said, &quot;It just felt personal. That hamster was of no monetary value to anybody but the kids ... I felt that it was really malicious,&quot; that the students were traumatized, &quot;One of the students told us that she didn&apos;t sleep the night before because she was afraid,&quot; while another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151816/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/11/autistic_students_still_shaken_up_a.php">said</a>, &quot;I miss the sock puppet.&quot;  </p>

<p>Sorenson, whose Myspace page &quot;lists as his interests &apos;videogames,&apos; &apos;weed&apos; and &apos;making money,&apos;&quot; was found via a police tip and now the cops are zeroing in on his cohorts.  The Advance adds, &quot;After the theft made headlines, Best Buy donated several Wii consoles, games and a camcorder to the school, spurred on by a group of concerned citizens who formed the group Staten Island for Eden II. The school also received several pet hamsters as gifts, and $100 from a freshman at Manhattan&#x2019;s Xavier High School who&#x2019;d been saving the money for video games of his own.&quot;  Awww.  </p>
