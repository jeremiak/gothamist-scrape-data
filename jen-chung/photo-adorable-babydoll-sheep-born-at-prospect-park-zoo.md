<p>Spring (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173700/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/spring_weather_returns_after_brief.php">summer</a>) is here, and the Prospect Park Zoo has two new additions: Babydoll lambs Arthur and Brooklyn!</p>

<p>According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, baby dolls, which are also known as the miniature Southdown, are &quot;the oldest known purebred sheep in the world. The brother and sister pair was born last month. The male, Arthur, weighed eight pounds at birth while his sister, Brooklyn, weighed six pounds.  Both healthy youngsters are gaining weight daily. As adults, Arthur will weigh approximately 175 pounds and Brooklyn 120 pounds.  Both Arthur and Brooklyn have delicate features, a diminutive size, and downy coats of pure white.&quot;<br>
 <br>
And it&apos;s just in time for next month&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173700/http://prospectparkzoo.com/plan-your-trip/events-calendar/fleece-festival.aspx">Fleece Festival at the Prospect Park Zoo</a>! Actually, Arthur and Brooklyn probably won&apos;t be sheared, but their mother Ginger and other aunts and uncles probably will be: At 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday, May 18 and 19, the sheep will get shorn. There are also other spring activities for families, like live music and demos on how felt is made. </p>
