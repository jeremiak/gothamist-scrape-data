<p>Around 6 p.m. last night, police responded to a 911 call about a person shot in a car on Staten Island and discovered an 86-year-old shot in the head. Then they found two more people shot in a house nearby. Now the police believe that the elderly man was behind those shootings, and then turned the gun on himself.</p>

<p>Police suspect that Brooklyn resident Heriberto Pagan, 86, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401023616/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/man_shoots_grandson_kills_unkn.html#incart_m-rpt-1">&quot;shot his grandson in the head, then killed the man&apos;s girlfriend.&quot;</a> The grandson, 47, was found outside 455 Virginia Avenue while his girlfriend, Claritle Christina Huerta, 28, was shot in the head inside the house. Huerta, who died at the hospital, also had an infant with her; the baby was not injured.</p>

<p>Pagan then apparently fled to a car at Rockwell and Clifton Avenues and then shot himself. A gun was found.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401023616/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/man_shoots_grandson_kills_unkn.html#incart_m-rpt-1">The Staten Island Advance reports</a>, &quot;A law enforcement source at the scene said the incident involved domestic violence, but noted, &apos;It wasn&apos;t anything like a previous history involved.&apos;&quot;  </p><blockquote> Linda Zhang, 36, said her father-in-law, Ninj Wu, 64, saw the incident and told her. &quot;The (grand)son broke down the door and ran out while the (grand)father was holding a gun and chased after him ... and then the father got in the car and left.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In the past, Ms. Zhang said, a few of the family&apos;s arguments had spilled out into the street; at least once, police were called to the scene, she said.</p></blockquote>The 47-year-old man is in critical condition. <p></p>
