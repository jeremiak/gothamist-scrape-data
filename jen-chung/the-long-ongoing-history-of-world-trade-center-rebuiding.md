<p>After the September 11th, 2001 attacks, when the smoke finally cleared and the last of the wreckage was removed, the long road to rebuilding the 16 acres of the World Trade Center began. It has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155040/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/world_trade_center_site_progress_vi.php#photo-1">been called one of the biggest infrastructure projects</a> in the world. Here are some official&#x2014;and unofficial&#x2014;milestones so far, as construction continues on:</p>

<p><strong>November 2001</strong>: The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155040/http://www.renewnyc.com/overlay/AboutUs/">was created</a> &quot;to help plan and coordinate the rebuilding and revitalization of Lower Manhattan, defined as everything south of Houston Street.&quot; </p>
