                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_07_dairwaycow.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209061854im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_dairwaycow.jpg" width="640" height="423"> <br> <i>Photograph of kids and a young dairy cow by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209061854/http://www.flickr.com/photos/11396985@N08/4700549112/">dianebondareff on Flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>As unbearable as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209061854/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/heat_breaks_records_power_grid.php">last week&apos;s heat wave</a> was, at least humans are able to sweat.  Unlike dairy cows&#x2014;and NY State dairy farmers say their cows have been too uncomfortable.  Douglas Aukema, of Chenango Forks farm, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209061854/http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20110729/NEWS01/107290378/Heat-putting-cows-low-gear?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE">told the Press and Star Bulletin</a> that his farm&apos;s milk production was &quot;down by a third, probably, because of the heat stress.&quot;</p>

<p>Cows are eating and drinking less in this weather, which means they are making less milk.  Which gets farmers concerned about &quot;cow comfort.&quot;  At Spencer farms, there are three-foot diameter fans to cool the bovines.  Also: &quot;Each cow at his farm has its own rubber mat to lie on, and other farms go as far as to install sprinkler systems.&quot;  Cody Spencer said, &quot;When you&apos;re 1,500 pounds, it makes a big difference.&quot;  </p>

<p>An expert says that cows like temperatures of 40-60 degrees best and when it&apos;s 90 degrees, it makes sense they don&apos;t even want to graze. And earlier this month in Texas, a drought was so bad that cows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209061854/http://www.accuweather.com/blogs/news/story/52441/texas-drought-causing-cattle-d.asp">were overdrinking water and dying</a>.</p>
