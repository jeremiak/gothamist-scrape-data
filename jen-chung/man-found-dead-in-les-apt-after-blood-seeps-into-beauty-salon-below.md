<p>The decomposing body of a 27-year-old man was found in a Manhattan apartment yesterday after a business owner on the ground floor noticed a terrible odor and other signs of death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015237/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/badly-decomposed-body-man-27-found-manhattan-apartment-article-1.2717499">She told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I saw blood dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom and called cops.&quot; </p>

<p>Caridad Alvarado, who owns the Grace Salon at 39 Essex Street, initially thought the overpowering smell was from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015237/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/badly-decomposed-body-man-27-found-manhattan-apartment-article-1.2717499">&quot;nearby porta-potties&quot;</a> over the weekend. The News reports, &quot;The smell worsened on Monday so she lit incense and called the landlord, but he only knocked on the man&#x2019;s door. She was horrified when she noticed a deep red stain on the salon&#x2019;s bathroom ceiling Tuesday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was blood coming down from the second floor,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015237/http://nypost.com/2016/07/19/dead-body-found-after-blood-seeps-through-salons-ceiling/">she told the Post</a>. &quot;I was sure somebody was dead upstairs because that&#x2019;s not normal.&#x201D;</p>

<p>She cancelled her appointments and called 911, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015237/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2016/07/man-found-dead-in-essex-street-apartment-today.html">according to the Lo-Down</a>, which also reports, &quot;The victim was staying in the apartment while a longtime tenant was out of town. Alvarado said she&#x2019;d seen the man off-and-on around the building during the five years she&#x2019;s worked on Essex Street. A neighbor said this evening that the victim recently lost his job but was not distressed. He described the man as a happy person.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post, which published a grisly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015237/http://nypost.com/2016/07/19/dead-body-found-after-blood-seeps-through-salons-ceiling/">photograph of the blood</a> dripping down a pipe into the salon, reports that the man was a construction worker who lost his job recently.  </p>

<p>The medical examiner will determine a cause of death.</p>
