Max Mendez and his mother, Erika Lorenzo, who were walking to the Wagner Pool on East 124th Street for swim lessons, were both struck.  Lorenzo, 7 months pregnant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153113/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bridge_tragedy_x3irRsecawDxEkRYAFpUGM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;I will never recover from the death of my son, but I do want justice.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153113/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703999304575399770143567154.html">According to the Wall Street Journal,</a> &quot;The pair were apparently crossing a stretch of road without a crosswalk, a path that many nearby residents and workers use, but say is unsafe. As the truck began moving toward them, Ms. Lorenzo held her son&apos;s hand, trying to run to avoid being hit... Ms. Lorenzo said she was waiting for the light to change and that she lost her son&apos;s grip when she was hit.&quot; However, she told the Post that she was holding Max&apos;s hand, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t let go of my son for nothing in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>The MTA Truck was heading to the RFK Bridge to attend to a disabled vehicle and the MTA said that the driver tested negative for alcohol. Some witnesses told the WSJ the driver looked behind him to make sure he wasn&apos;t pulling in front of traffic&#x2014;but ended up not seeing Lorenzo and her son in front of him; some told the Post that he was on his cellphone.  Police do not believe any criminality was involved).  </p>

<p>The boy&apos;s legs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153113/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-child-struck-mta-truck,0,4744054.story">were crushed</a> and his body had to removed from the truck&apos;s wheel. One driver jumped out of his car to perform CPR on him before EMT arrived.  A neighborhood resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153113/http://dnainfo.com/20100730/harlem/10yearold-boy-hit-by-tow-truck-at-entrance-rfk-bridge">said</a>, &quot;There should be a light before you make the turn onto the ramp... It&apos;s really hard to get across there for grownups and kids.&quot; Another said a crosswalk would be good, &quot;People come speeding around when they get ready to go onto the bridge.&quot;</p>
