<p>A Long Island deli worker managed to fight off an armed robber last month&#x2014;thanks to the machete his boss bought.</p>

<p>A surveillance video shows the September 25 incident at the Stop &amp; Shop Deli in Brentwood: A deli worker is at the counter when a man bursts through the door, aiming a gun at him. Then the clerk takes a machete from under the counter, unsheathes it and starts waving it around. The robber fled.</p>

<p>The Suffolk County police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010060049/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=9277587">are offering a reward for information</a> leading to an arrest. The suspect is described as a young man with a thin build, about 5&apos;1&quot;. He was wearing a gray mask, a black running-style top with white stripes on the sleeves, dark pants and black and white sneakers, plus carrying a black Air Jordan backpack and a .22 pistol. Anyone with information about this crime is asked to call anonymously to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS. </p>

<p>The deli&apos;s owner Elena Alvarado <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010060049/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Video-Machete-Armed-Robber-Gun-Masked-Long-Island-Brentwood-Deli-226744131.html">told NBC New York</a> that they&apos;ve only had the machete for a month: &quot;She said she wished her worker, who has been employed there part-time for four years, would not have gone after the robber, saying it was a risky move. &apos;You can make money again, but not your life,&apos; she said.&quot;</p>
