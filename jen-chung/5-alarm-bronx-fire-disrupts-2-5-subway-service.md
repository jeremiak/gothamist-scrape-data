	<p>A fire broke out in a Bronx garage at 6:16 a.m. and it&apos;s turned into a five-alarm blaze. The conditions have also disrupted 2 and 5 train service&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704032112/http://new.mta.info/gss/2/0">MTA says</a>, &quot;There is no 2 and 5 train service between Gun Hill Rd and 241 St due to FDNY activity on 225 St and White Plains Rd. Customers are advised to use Bx39 bus service which will make nearby station stops.&quot;</p>

<p>The garage is located at E. 225th street and White Plains Road in the Wakefield section. The fire can be seen 25 miles away, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704032112/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9087619">according to WABC 7</a>, which also reports, &quot;Heavy flames shot out of the garage, and firefighters unsuccessfully battled to keep the fire from spreading to an adjacent commercial building. They reportedly had trouble gaining access to the area, but as of now, the fire appears contained to the private garage.&quot;</p>

<p>There are no injuries (aside from one pedestrian treated for smoke inhalation) so far. The FDNY is not sure what is inside the garage.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Here&apos;s video of the fire:</p>
