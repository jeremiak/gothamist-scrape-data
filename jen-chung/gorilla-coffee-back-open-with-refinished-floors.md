She said the walkout was &quot;unexpected&quot; and that other neighbors and businesses were supportive of them, &quot;From a business owner&#x2019;s standpoint, we feel like we&#x2019;re doing everything right: paying everyone well, and setting up health benefits and encouraging learning in coffee and sending people places and paying in full. So now we&#x2019;re kind of just getting back to basics. I said to everybody, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s learn about coffee and do a good job and be happy.&#x2019;&quot;</p>
