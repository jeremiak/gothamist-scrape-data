<p>After the SEC accused it of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/16/goldman_sued_by_sec_for_subprime_mo.php">securities fraud related</a> to subprime mortgages, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303491304575187920845670844.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLETopStories">Goldman Sachs promised</a> to &quot;contest them and defend the firm and its reputation,&quot; saying the charges were &quot;unfounded in law and fact.&quot;  The SEC claims that Goldman, as the Wall Street Journal puts it, &quot;deceiv[ed] clients by selling them mortgage securities secretly designed by a hedge-fund firm run by John Paulson, who made a killing betting on the housing market&apos;s collapse.&quot; </p>

<p>Paulson, who made a $1 billion after the collapse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/business/17abacus.html?ref=business">was not charged</a>, because he didn&apos;t misrepresent investors.  Paulson&apos;s spokesman said, &quot;While it&#x2019;s unfortunate that people lost money investing in mortgage-backed securities, Paulson has never been involved in the origination, distribution or structuring of such securities...  There&#x2019;s no question we made money in these transactions. However, all our dealings were through arm&#x2019;s-length transactions with experienced counterparties who had opposing views based on all available information at the time.&quot;  (You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://blogs.reuters.com/reuters-dealzone/2010/04/16/read-goldman-sachs-abacus-pitch-book/">read the pitch book</a> for the collateralized debt obligation, Abacus, that was created.) </p>

He had a lot of loud parties that would disturb the neighbors below him,&quot; but the apartment wasn&apos;t flashy, &quot;He was cheap. He didn&apos;t spend much money.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg News reports that Goldman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a52BBUru4.hM">warned that the SEC wanted a bring a case</a> nine months ago, raising questions whether they should have told stockholders about it.  Business Insider&apos;s Henry Blodget thinks the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-hold-on-the-secs-first-major-fraud-allegation-against-goldman-seems-very-weak-2010-4">case against Goldman is weak</a>, but does think the case against Tourre is stronger, though &quot;not a slam dunk.&quot;  And Matt Taibbi, the Rolling Stone contributing editor who described the firm as a &quot;great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money&quot; discussed the charges  yesterday (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beb2jBijo-s&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">video </a>) and pointed out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002072340/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/business/24trading.html">Times mentioned</a> how banks like Goldman bundled bad debt and won back in December.</p>
