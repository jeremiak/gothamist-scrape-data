<p>This evening, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will address the Democratic National Convention in a speech that many hope will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051428/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/08/26/2008-08-26_hillary_clintons_speech_could_be_a_gamec.html">unite her supporters with those of</a> presumptive presidential nominee Barack Obama.  </p>

<p>Republican candidate John McCain used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051428/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/24/obama_biden_ticket_makes_its_debut.php">Clinton&apos;s earlier criticism of Obama in an attack ad</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051428/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/25/giuliani_on_obamas_vp_the_strong_ch.php">Rudy Giuliani said</a> Obama should have chosen Clinton instead of Joe Biden, attempts to drive Clinton supporters to the Republican side.  Yesterday morning, Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051428/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/08/25/2008-08-25_hillary_clinton_slams_john_mccain_ads_th.html">told the New York delegation</a>, &quot;I understand that the McCain campaign is running ads trying to divide us, and let me state what I think about their tactics and these ads: I&apos;m Hillary Clinton and I do not approve that message,&quot; and emphasized the party&apos;s unity.</p>

<p>However, last night, Newsweek&apos;s Howard Fineman suggested on MSNBC the tension between Clinton and Obama was &quot;real.&quot;  And today, former president Bill Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051428/http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/bill-clinton-in-denver-again-undercuts-obama-2008-08-26.html">told an audience in Denver</a>, &quot;Suppose you&apos;re a voter, and you&apos;ve got candidate X and candidate Y. Candidate X agrees with you on everything, but you don&apos;t think that candidate can deliver on anything at all. Candidate Y you agree with on about half the issues, but he can deliver. Which candidate are you going to vote for?&quot; The Hill reports that Clinton then said, after a paused, &quot;This has nothing to do with what&apos;s going on now.&quot;</p>

<p>Senator Clinton will be introduced by her daughter Chelsea.  AMNY wonders if the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051428/http://www.amny.com/news/politics/am-chelsea0826,0,7360726.story">former First Daughter has a future in politics</a>.</p>
