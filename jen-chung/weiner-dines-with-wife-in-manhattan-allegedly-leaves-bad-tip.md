The couple had brunch at La Bottega in Chelsea&#x2014;a waiter told the Daily News, &quot;No one was really positive that it was him, but then we saw the name on the credit card and we were like, &apos;Wow, it&apos;s really him.&quot; And the waiter revealed Weiner seemed &quot;really tense&quot; and left a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092433/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/29/are_you_named_on_this_website_outin.php">bad tip</a>.<p></p>

<p>Another witness claims Abedin, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&apos;s &quot;bodywoman&quot; who is reportedly pregnant, looked &quot;miserable&quot; as she had pizza, pasta and salad with Weiner; they also &quot;spent most of the meal chained to their cell phones, said the witness.&quot;  The News approached Weiner, who said, &quot;We&apos;re doing great, thank you.&quot; Of course, the News didn&apos;t ask about the burning question posed by its rival: WTF was Weiner doing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092433/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/24/weiner_nycs_worst_political_husband.php">buying crappy flowers last week</a>.</p>

<p>The couple, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092433/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/the_queens_apartment_where_weiner_s.php">who live in Queens</a>, was later spotted at Baskin Robbins, where Abedin ordered mint chocolate chip ice cream and Weiner got mocha.  </p>
