<p>Two days ago, the police said they wanted to question a man about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173757/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/knicks_fans_accused_of_beating_up_g.php">possible hate crime attack near Madison Square Garden</a>, when a gay couple was allegedly beaten by Knicks fans.

<p>On Sunday night, Nick Porto, 28, and his boyfriend Kevin Atkins, 22, had been walking on Eighth Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets when a group of Knicks fans harassed them. Porto had posted on Facebook, &quot;A group of Knicks fans were upset about the game and they just decided to &#x2018;fag bash&#x2019; the two of us,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173757/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130506/midtown/gay-couple-assaulted-by-rowdy-knicks-fans-cops-say">and said</a>, &quot;They called us f----ts. They made fun of my jeans &#x2014; I made the jeans myself, for that day,&quot; and when he asked why the group was bothering them, &quot;Fists started flying. I was on the ground, and the only thing I could do, I reached out and grabbed someone&apos;s hair.&quot;</p>

<p>Porto suffered a broken nose while Atkins&apos; wrist was broken. The police described one person of interest as a being a Hispanic male about 6&apos; with brown hair and a tattoo on his left forearm, last seen wearing a white t-shirt, white sneakers, jeans and a &quot;Knicks&quot; #7 jersey. The video shows a few other persons of interest also wearing #7 jerseys.<br>
