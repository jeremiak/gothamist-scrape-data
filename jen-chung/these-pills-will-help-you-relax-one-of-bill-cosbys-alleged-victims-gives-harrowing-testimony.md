<p>The sexual assault trial of Bill Cosby is underway, and his accuser will return to the witness stand today to continue cross examination from the entertainer&apos;s lawyers. Andrea Constand testified yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://pagesix.com/2017/06/06/andrea-constand-gives-graphic-testimony-at-bill-cosby-trial/">that Cosby gave her pills and wine</a> before sexually assaulting her, alleging: &quot;I said, &#x2018;What are they, are they natural, are they herbal?&apos;&quot; and she said he told her, &quot;These will help you relax. They are your friends. They will take the edge off.&quot;</p>

<p>While Constand had originally come forward in 2005 about the 2004 meeting at Cosby&apos;s Pennsylvania home, the Montgomery County district attorney did not seek charges, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20151231_Source__Montco_DA_to_announce_result_of_Cosby_probe.html?c=r">reportedly due to lack of evidence</a>. In 2016, after an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/cosby_victims_nymag_feature.php">avalanche of sexual assault allegations</a> and details from depositions during Constand&apos;s civil suit against Cosby (he settled with her) were released, Montgomery County prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/billy_cosby_arrest_rape.php">reopened their case against Cosby</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/bill_cosby_mug_shot.php">arrested him for indecent assault</a>. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, Constand recalled that when she was operations manager for Temple University&apos;s women&apos;s basketball team, Cosby was an avuncular figure to her: &quot;He was a Temple friend, somebody I trusted as a mentor and somewhat of an older figure to me.&quot; </p>

<p>Constand, who was 30 at the time, was at Cosby&apos;s Elkins Park home to discuss new professional opportunities. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/06/06/mother-testifies-in-support-of-her-daughters-allegation-of-sexual-assault-by-bill-cosby/?utm_term=.10a80dd720a6">She said after taking the pills</a>, &quot;I told Mr. Cosby that I had trouble seeing him. I could see two of him,&quot; and recalled that her &quot;mouth was cottony.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://pagesix.com/2017/06/06/andrea-constand-gives-graphic-testimony-at-bill-cosby-trial/">From Page Six</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I was jolted conscious, jolted awake, and I felt Mr. Cosby&#x2019;s hand groping my breasts, under my shirt,&#x201D; she recalled. &#x201C;I felt his hand inside my vagina, moving in and out. And I felt him take my hand, place it on his penis and move it back and forth.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Did you ask him to stop?&#x201D; asked Montgomery County prosecutor Kristen Feden.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t able to,&#x201D; Constand said. &#x201C;In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move and my legs to move, and those messages were frozen. They didn&#x2019;t get there. They were limp and I wasn&#x2019;t able to get there, to fight, to get away.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then, she added, her voice quavering, &#x201C;I wanted it to stop.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>When she tried to confront him, &quot;He looked at me and said, &#x2018;I thought you had an orgasm, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;&#x2009; I said, &#x2018;I did not, I just want to know what you gave me.&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait&#x2019; and he wanted to speak to me near where the incident occurred. I realized he was not going to tell me what he gave me that night. I was under the impression it was herbal but he was evasive with me so I left.&quot;<p></p>

<p>One of Cosby&apos;s lawyers, Angela Agrusa, said during the cross-examination, &quot;You were befriending him because he was going to be able to give you some resources to get into broadcasting.&quot; Agrusa also questioned Constand&apos;s 2004 police account that she did not spend time alone with Cosby before the incident in his home. &quot;[D]efense attorneys have proof, including Constand&#x2019;s later interviews with police, in which she describes private meals with the entertainer before January 2004 and a visit to his hotel room at a Connecticut casino. The defense also has phone records that show Constand placing more than 50 calls to Cosby in the months after the alleged incident,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/06/06/mother-testifies-in-support-of-her-daughters-allegation-of-sexual-assault-by-bill-cosby/?utm_term=.602766c146c0">the Washington Post reports</a>.</p>

There was a lot, 16 months, to try to compress.&quot; When Argusa pointed out that she contacted Cosby after the incident, she said she did it for her job, &quot;I thought it would look negative on me and being a representative of coach [Dawn] Staley at the university... He was a trustee.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/cosby/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-trial-day-2-20170606.html">From Philly.com</a>:</p><blockquote>Asked by Feden, the prosecutor, on Tuesday how she felt seeking a favor from the man who she claims attacked her, Constand blinked back tears.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;It was a very big burden on me, but one that I didn&#x2019;t have the courage at the time to tell my family about,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;And so, I just went along with it.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Constand now lives in Canada and is a massage therapist.<p></p>

<p>Cosby, is now 79 and claims he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://time.com/4757042/bill-cosby-blind-evin-interview/">is blind</a>. He faces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://www.philly.com/archive/jeremy_roebuck/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-case-against-bill-cosby-20170523.html">three felony charges of aggravated indecent assault</a>. He told a radio station last month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024063857/http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/us/bill-cosby-says-he-wont-testify/index.html">that he will not testify</a>, &quot;What people want to say, want you to say, and how they maneuver&#x2014;yes, I do have lawyers to protect me, &apos;objections,&apos; &apos;sustained&apos;&#x2014;but I just don&apos;t want to sit there and have to figure out what I believe is a truthful answer as to whether or not I&apos;m opening a can of something that ... my lawyers are scrambling.&quot;</p>
