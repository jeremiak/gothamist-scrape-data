<p>A five-year-old boy suffered &quot;multiple trauma&quot; after falling out of an amusement ride at Coney Island. Luna Park staff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206180920/http://pix11.com/2013/08/14/child-injured-in-coney-island-roller-coaster-accident/#axzz2bzZleeaz">says he climbed out</a> from under his seat&apos;s lap bar.</p>

<p>According to the FDNY, they received a call at 6:51 p.m. about the incident at West 12th Street and the Boardwalk. The child had been on the Sea Serpent ride, which is a kiddie roller coaster. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, while a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206180920/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Boy-Falls-Out-Kiddie-Roller-Coaster-Coney-Island-Denos-Brooklyn-219672111.html">35-year-old woman</a>, possibly the boy&apos;s mother, was also taken to a hospital.</p>

<p>Dennis  Vourderis, Vice President of Deno&apos;s Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206180920/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9206601">said of the accident</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;A young rider on the Serpent coaster who met the height requirement unfortunately crawled under the lap retaining bar tonight, and jumped off the ride before it had stopped. Our prayers for a speedy recovery are with the young man and his family.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;Preliminary reports are a large cut to his left leg and he began receiving treatment immediately from staff on premises while medical attention was summoned.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ride is an inspected approved ride and there has never been an incident before in its 15 year history here at Coney. We are checking the lap bar of the car the young man rode tonight as well.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
