<p>Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway was already booked as a guest on <em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em> yesterday when news broke that U.S. intelligence officials had briefed both President Obama and President-elect Trump that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114404/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/trump_russian_intelligence_blackmail.php">Russia might have &quot;compromising&quot; information about Trump</a>. And though it seems the interview occurred just before (or too soon after) Buzzfeed published unverified details about the &quot;compromising&quot; dirt on Trump, Meyers still did an excellent job challenging Conway&apos;s efforts to spin and distort the news:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just in: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114404/https://twitter.com/sethmeyers">@SethMeyers</a> asks Kellyanne Conway about the bombshell allegations surrounding Trump and Russia. See her interview on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114404/https://twitter.com/hashtag/LNSM?src=hash">#LNSM</a> tonight. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114404/https://t.co/5Fr4FdQQp5">pic.twitter.com/5Fr4FdQQp5</a></p>&#x2014; Late Night (@LateNightSeth) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114404/https://twitter.com/LateNightSeth/status/818992275149688834">January 11, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171023114404js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114404/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/seth-meyers-confronts-kellyanne-conway-over-trump-russia-briefing-reports-n705606">Here&apos;s a partial transcript</a> via NBC News:</p><blockquote>She said Americans &quot;should be concerned that intelligence officials leaked to the press and won&apos;t go and tell the president-elect or the president of the United States himself &#x2026; they would rather go tell the press.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;But the report was about them going to the President-elect,&quot; Meyers said.</p>

<p>&quot;And it says that they never briefed him on it, that they appended two pages to the bottom of his intelligence briefing,&quot; Conway responded.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe it&apos;s that they did brief him on it,&quot; Meyers corrected.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he says he&apos;s not aware of it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Well &#x2026; that concerns me!&quot; Meyers replied.</p></blockquote>Here&apos;s the whole interview below. <p></p>

<p>There&apos;s a part when Meyers asked, &quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t we care that the Russians tried to interfere? I sometimes fear that the president-elect has no curiousity as to the amount they tried&#x2014;&quot; for Conway to cut in, &quot;That is completely false. He has enormous curiosity. I&#x2019;m there every day with him. He has a number of different meetings every day, briefings and otherwise. And he was curious enough to figure out America. He knew America was&#x2014;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s a pivot right there, Kellyanne! By the way, nobody does it better,&quot; Meyers conceded.</p>
