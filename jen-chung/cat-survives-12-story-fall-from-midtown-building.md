<p>Thank goodness this story has a purrfect ending: A Manhattan cat owner discovered his cat was missing from his 15th floor apartment&#x2014;and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014713/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/15/cat-survives-12-story-plunge-at-manhattan-apartment-building/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">found him on the third floor overhang</a>... alive!</p>

He&#x2019;s dead.&apos;&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>With help from a building porter, Jacobs climbed out onto the overhang and was happily shocked to find Gizmo purring.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He looked so relieved to see me,&#x201D; Jacobs said. &#x201C;He was scared and just crying and screaming.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Luckily, Gizmo only suffered minor injuries. Many cats are able to survive falls from great heights (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014713/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/01/cat_survives_26-story_fall.php">like 26 stories</a>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014713/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_righting_reflex">because of their reflexes</a> and ability to right themselves.
