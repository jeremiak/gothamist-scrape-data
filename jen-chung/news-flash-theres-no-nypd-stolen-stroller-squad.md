<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2011_06_buggyguard.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305071151im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_buggyguard.jpg" width="300" height="345"> <br> <i>The Buggyguard in action</i></div> Back in May, WCBS 2 looked at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305071151/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/12/new-york-mom-invents-buggy-guard-after-having-two-strollers-stolen/">phenomenon on stroller thefts</a>.  Well, maybe it&apos;s less a phenomenon and more a logical result of unsecured high-end baby strollers being parked on streets (one Bay Ridge family had two strollers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305071151/http://mobile.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/35/30_35babybuggybandit.html">stolen from them</a>), tempting bait to anyone looking for a chic and inexpensive ride for a child.  Now, there is definitive word from the NYPD that strollers thefts do not rate its own crime division.<p></p>

<p>NY Times reporter Elissa Gootman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305071151/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/nyregion/the-stolen-stroller-an-urban-bourgeois-problem.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">reveals her stroller went missing</a>, &quot;Yes, it was left outside, on a not-so-quiet street in Brooklyn. No, it was not locked up. Yes, I am fully aware of the fraught nature of complaining about the loss of a $400 stroller, one that epitomized privilege, and all that is loathsome about urban bourgeois parenting to begin with.&quot;  She contacted the ever-helpful NYPD public information office to find out if stroller thefts were a trend: A cop &quot;suggested that I put my &apos;very unusual request&apos; in an e-mail, but warned, &apos;Your answer will probably be &#x2018;we can&#x2019;t accommodate you.&apos;... <strong>We don&#x2019;t have a Stolen Stroller Squad</strong>.&quot;  Even i   Later on, another police spokesperson said stolen strollers are &quot;not a problem here in the city, period... I believe it was a problem out West.&quot; Or in Toronto, where cops issued an alert telling, duh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305071151/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/780873">parents to bring their strollers inside</a>!</p>

<p>Fun facts: Strollers over $1,000 would be treated as grand larceny, while those under $1,000 would be petty larceny. One mom who had two strollers stolen from her Florida back yard and front porch invented a stroller lock&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305071151/http://www.buggyguard.com/">Buggyguard</a> which features animal-shaped locks&#x2014;plus the animals come with different colored bow ties!</p>
