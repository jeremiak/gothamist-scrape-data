<p>A woman who had been jogging in a Queens park was found dead last night. The cause of death has not yet been determined&#x2014;the official police statement on the incident says there were &quot;no obvious signs of trauma,&quot; but police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325180305/http://nypost.com/2016/08/03/jogger-murdered-after-evening-run-in-queens/">tell the Post</a> that the victim &quot;appeared to have been strangled and her jogging pants were pulled partway down.&quot;</p>

<p>Investigators say Karina Vetrano, 30, was reported missing by her father when she didn&apos;t return from her 5 p.m. run. in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325180305/https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/spring-creek-park-b165">Spring Creek Park</a> in Howard Beach. &quot;After an extensive search of the area, an unresponsive adult female was discovered in the marshland area within the vicinity of 161 Avenue and 78 Street,&quot; police said, adding that she was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>

<p>Vetrano&apos;s cell phone was found by a bike path, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325180305/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/missing-jogger-30-found-dead-marsh-queens-home-article-1.2736413">according to the Daily News</a>, and police &quot;discovered her body closer to the shoreline around 11 p.m., following a search that lasted nearly four hours.&quot;</p>

<p>A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325180305/ttp://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/missing-jogger-30-found-dead-marsh-queens-home-article-1.2736413">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;If the weeds were not that tall, we would of seen the girl jogging on the path ... You can grab that girl, and we wouldn&apos;t know it...I hear there&apos;s a couple of shanty houses out there.&quot; The same neighbor told the Post that Vetrano would run with her father before he was injured: &quot;He asked her, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t go in there.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Vetrano, who graduated from St. John&apos;s, was a caterer at the Vetro Lounge. </p>

<p>&quot;A parent&apos;s nightmare to have the police knocking on your door and finding this out,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325180305/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/03/queens-missing-jogger-body-found/">another neighbor lamented</a>. </p>
