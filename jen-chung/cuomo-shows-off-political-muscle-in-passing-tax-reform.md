<p>After changing his mind on changing taxes and signaling he wanted to raise taxes for the wealthy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209140347/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/03/governor_cuomo_warms_up_to_higher_t.php">just over the weekend</a>, Governor Cuomo ushered in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209140347/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/cuomo_legislature_announce_tax_cuts.php">tax cuts for the middle class and a tax hike for the wealthy</a>.  Passed by the State Senate (unanimously!) and Assembly last night, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209140347/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/nyregion/cuomos-tax-overhaul-follows-a-familiar-path.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times notes</a>, &quot;The remarkably rapid progress of the tax revisions &#x2014; without a single public hearing or town-hall-style meeting &#x2014; provided the most striking illustration to date of Mr. Cuomo&#x2019;s policymaking strategy: information is tightly controlled, negotiations are carried out behind closed doors and the debate is limited to just a few people.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209140347/http://davidgrandeau.blogspot.com/">David Grandeau</a>, former director of the state lobbying commisson, tells the Times, &quot;If you admire pure power politics and accomplishing things, which is what a leader does, you have to give the guy credit for the way he pulls these things off. You can argue that it&#x2019;s not good for democracy when we have things done this way, but if you really want to be honest with yourself, the greatest form of government to accomplish things is a dictatorship. Democracy is a pain.&quot; In other words: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209140347/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/31/steamroller_spi.php">Steamrolling works, if you do it right</a>.</p>

<p>Republican State Senator James Tedisco of Schenectady said, &quot;I think it&#x2019;s as bad as you can get in terms of reneging on a promise to be more open, more transparent. Pretty soon they&#x2019;ll just say, &#x2018;Stay home, and just send in your votes when we bring the bills out.&#x2019;&quot;  Of course, Tedisco is in a tough position, because the State Senate Republicans have been anti-tax.  Majority Leader Dean Skelos (Long Island) was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209140347/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203501304577085000228714134.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTTopStories">spinning it this way to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;We&apos;re cutting taxes, in my opinion,&quot; because those making more than $2 million will now have a tax rate of 8.82%, down from the expiring millionaire&apos;s tax of 8.97%. </p>
