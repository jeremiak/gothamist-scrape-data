<p>A few hours after CBS announced that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826054826/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/10/stephen_colbert_late_show.php">would take over <em>The Late Show</em> from David Letterman</a>, Stephen Colbert addressed the news on <em>The Colbert Report</em>: &quot;This man has influenced every host who came after him and even a few who came before him&#x2014;he&apos;s that good... I do not envy whoever they try to put in that chair. Folks, those are some huge shoes to fill.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert opened by noting Letterman&apos;s retirements, &quot;I am gonna miss this good man. Dave has been on the air my entire adult life. <em>Late Night</em> debuted by my first year of college. I learned more from watching Dave than I did from going to my classes, especially the ones I did not go to because I stayed up till 1:30 watching Dave.&quot;</p>

<p>A half hour earlier, Jon Stewart discussed the big move and showed a clip of Colbert when he was on The Daily Show, &quot;By the way we spent all day looking up old stuff of Stephen on the Internet, it&apos;s really fun&#x2026; I mean, working, we were working. Truly one of the great pleasures of doing this show has been trying to maintain professional composure whilst Mr. Colbert is making me laugh uncontrollably.&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart was very proud: </p><blockquote>The exciting news today is that I no longer need a cable subscription to have the privilege of watching Stephen Colbert. Our good friend Stephen Colbert will be heading to CBS to take over <em>The Late Show</em> from&#x2014;for at least me&#x2014;the comedian broadcaster who is the best there ever was, David Letterman&#x2026; And here&apos;s the exciting thing for me and I think Stephen Colbert is up to the challenge.<p></p>

<p>While we wish Dave the absolute best for a well-earned retirement, there is no greater joy than to seeing a genuinely good man who works as hard as he can every day and deserves all the success in the world actually get that success. For Stephen we&apos;re just thrilled.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;m looking forward to: Being able to walk down Broadway and look up at the Ed Sullivan Theater marquee and see &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.&quot; Assuming of course that is  is where they tape it. There is of course a theater across from us here which I believe is currently referred to as The Hustler Club. </p></blockquote>Letterman himself is happy about his successor: He said, &quot;Stephen has always been a real friend to me. I&#x2019;m very excited for him, and I&#x2019;m flattered that CBS chose him. I also happen to know they wanted another guy with glasses.&quot;<p></p>
