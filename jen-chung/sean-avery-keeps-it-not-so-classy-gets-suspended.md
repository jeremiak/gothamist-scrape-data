But for all his antics, he was never suspended before--until now.</p>

<p>Avery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011030815/http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3740267">has been suspended indefinitely</a> for taking shots at fellow players and his ex-girlfriends.  The morning of his game against the Calgary Flames, Avery spoke to reporters (after making sure a camera was present):  &quot;I&apos;m just going to say one thing.  I&apos;m really happy to be back in Calgary; I love Canada. <strong>I just want to comment on how it&apos;s become like a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall in love with my sloppy seconds. I don&apos;t know what that&apos;s about, but enjoy the game tonight.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>A little background: Avery used to date both actress Elisha Cuthbert (24, Old School, an episode of MTV Cribs featuring Avery) and model Rachel Hunter (ex of Rod Stewart and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011030815/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVJmwYKy7eM">Stacy&apos;s Mom</a>).  Now Cuthbert is dating Calgary defenseman Dion Phaneuf (ESPN adds she was &quot;romantically linked to Mike Komisarek of the Montreal Canadiens) and Hunter is dating Jarret Stoll of the L.A. Kings.  So, while fighting isn&apos;t a big deal, talking smack is, so the NHL suspended him for &quot;inappropriate public comments, not pertaining to the game.&quot;</p>

<p>The Stars agreed, with their owner Tom Hicks saying, &quot;Had the league not have suspended him, the Dallas Stars would have. This organization will not tolerate such behavior, especially from a member of our hockey team. We hold our team to a higher standard and will continue to do so.&quot; Hey, Hicks, at least he didn&apos;t shoot himself in the thigh accidentally...right?</p>
