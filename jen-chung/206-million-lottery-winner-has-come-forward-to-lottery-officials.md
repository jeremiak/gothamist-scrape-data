                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_11_lotteryticket.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010328im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_lotteryticket.jpg" width="300" height="226" class="image-left"> </span>The elusive winner of the huge $208 MegaMillions have been confirmed by the NY State Lottery, but the winner&apos;s identity is still a mystery.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010328/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/official-mega-millions-winner-comes-forward-1.3442898">Newsday reports</a> that the winner &quot;has come forward with the ticket purchased at King Kullen, said a spokesman for the supermarket chain.&quot;</p>

<p>The winning ticket, with numbers 23, 32, 33, 39, 43 and mega-ball 8, was bought at a King Kullen in Middle Island last month, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010328/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/28/206_million_lottery_ticket_bought_a.php">winner kept quiet</a>.  The supermarket&apos;s employees have been wondering if the winner might be a colleague.</p>

<p>Some winners try to emerge with as little attention as possible (partly due to predatory people who want their hands on their lottery cash), but public appearances are required by winners.  An MTA worker who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010328/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/29/mega_millionaire_picks_up_check_qui.php">won a $133 million drawing</a> ($55 million lump cash) first got a lawyer, who told him not to speak to the media.</p>
