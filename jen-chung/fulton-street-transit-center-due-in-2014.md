<p>The long, long-awaited Fulton Transit Center will be completed in 2014. Well, that&apos;s what the MTA thinks&#x2014;though MTA Chairman Dale Hemmerdinger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133228/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05212009/news/regionalnews/transit_hub_blood_oath_170309.htm">claims MTA construction chief Michael Horodniceanu</a> &quot;has, at least to me, signed it in blood.&quot; Why in blood?  Because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133228/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/nyregion/21fulton.html?ref=nyregion">project is seven years late</a>.</p>

<p>The plans for the Fulton Transit Center, which would provide connections for the 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, E, J, M, Z, R and W subway lines, were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133228/http://gothamist.com/2004/05/26/fulton_street_transit_center_design_unveiled.php">first unveiled in 2004</a>, but last year, the MTA said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133228/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/29/goodbye_fulton.php">construction costs escalated</a>. Then some federal money helped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133228/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/30/federal_money_for_fulton_street_tra.php">breach a gap in the budget</a>.  The NY Times reports that Horodniceanu vowed, &quot;I expect to deliver that with the exact dates that you have.&quot;  And the glass dome&#x2014;the oculus&#x2014;at top will be four-stories tall.</p>
