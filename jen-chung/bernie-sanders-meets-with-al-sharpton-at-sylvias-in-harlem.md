</div></div>					<p>After his resounding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708080504/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/native_new_yorkers_for_prez.php#photo-4">primary win in New Hampshire</a>, Senator Bernie Sanders made his way back to New York City for some important meetings. First was breakfast (or just tea?) at Sylvia&apos;s with the Rev. Al Sharpton.</p>

<p>Sanders apparently asked for the meeting, as he looks to win over more African American voters ahead of the primary in South Carolina, where Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is leading in polls. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708080504/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/09/bernie-sanders-to-huddle-with-al-sharpton.html">Daily Beast first reported</a> the planned meeting yesterday: &quot;By meeting with Sharpton at Sylvia&#x2019;s Restaurant&#x2014;the very place then-Sen. Barack Obama sat down with the preacher in 2008&#x2014;Sanders is sending a message to Clinton forces: Don&#x2019;t sleep.&quot; (In 2007, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708080504/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/30/barack.php">Sharpton met</a> with then-Senator Barack Obama at Sylvia&apos;s.)</p>

<p>When the two Brooklyn natives appeared outside the soul food temple, the crowd erupted into cheers for Sanders:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708080504/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bernie-sanders-meets-rev-al-sharpton-harlem-article-1.2526678">Sharpton said</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve asked him very bluntly about Flint. I&apos;ve asked him very bluntly about affirmative action. I&apos;ve asked him very bluntly about the issues of police brutality and police misconduct, things I want to hear... I think it is very important that he sent a signal that on the morning after a historic victory &#x2014; it&apos;s the widest margin we&apos;ve seen in the history of New Hampshire &#x2014; he would come to Harlem and have breakfast with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton will be meeting with Sharpton next week. Harlem is also where President Bill Clinton set up his Clinton Global Initiative offices.</p>

<p>Then Sanders went to a taping of The View, where he discussed Wall Street (&quot;How many people in Goldman Sachs will now have a criminal record? Zero. Some kid in New York City picked up with marijuana today will have a police record for the rest of his life.&quot;), the Flint water crisis (an &quot;unspeakable tragedy&quot;), the GOP candidates, his Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s flavor and support from African American voters:</p>

<p>Tonight, Sanders will appear on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. </p>
