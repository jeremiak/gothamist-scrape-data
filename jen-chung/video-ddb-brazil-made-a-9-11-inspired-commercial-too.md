<p>DDB Brazil&apos;s efforts to invoke the tsunami by way of the September 11 attacks go much further than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083759/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/01/wwf_never_forget_the_tsunami.php">print ad concept</a>&#x2014;there&apos;s even an extremely disturbed and messed up TV ad.  The video is below and we warn you, it may be distressing&#x2014; it shows a plane flying into the World Trade Center&apos;s Twin Towers, the Twin Towers on fire, and many planes over lower Manhattan.  It&apos;s basically like a nightmare.</p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LBfJckEmnvw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083759oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/LBfJckEmnvw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>The agency apparently made a pitch for the World Wildlife Fund&apos;s business&#x2014;and never got it (the WWF never approved the ad&apos;s production or publication and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083759/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/01/wwf_never_forget_the_tsunami.php">strongly denounced the ad</a>)&#x2014;yet still entered the disturbing print ad into the One Show competition.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083759/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/02/ad_agency_responds.php">DDB Brazil said</a> earlier, &quot;The &#x2018;Tsunami&#x2019; ad for World Wildlife Fund Brazil was created by a team at DDB Brazil in December 2008. The team in question is no longer with the agency. DDB Brazil apologizes to anyone who was offended or affected by the ad. It should never have been made and it does not portray the philosophy of the agency.&quot; They might need to issue another statement with the surfacing of this TV concept ad.</p>
