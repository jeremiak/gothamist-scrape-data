<p>According to the NYPD, they responded to a 911 call in the 26th Precinct at 9:41 p.m. on Wednesday, October 29. A 27-year-old had returned into her building&#x2014;WCBS 2 says she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012251/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/10/30/police-man-assaulted-woman-in-columbia-university-student-housing/">had just come back from a jog</a>&#x2014;when a man followed her inside. </p>

<p>The police say that while in the vestibule area, the suspect knocked down the woman and fondled her. He also tried to remove her bra. The victim&apos;s screams apparently made him flee.</p>
