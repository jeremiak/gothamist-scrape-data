<p>A healthy, 5.2 pound infant was discovered crying in the nativity scene of a church in Richmond Hill, Queens on Monday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402031327/http://nypost.com/2015/11/24/newborn-baby-found-in-nativity-scene-at-queens-church/">Father Christopher Heanue said</a>, &quot;The baby was brand new. He still had the umbilical cord attached. It&#x2019;s a beautiful baby boy.&quot;</p>

<p>A custodian, Jose Moran, at Holy Child Jesus Church found the newborn on Monday around 1 p.m. He told the Daily News, &#x201C;I was in the church sweeping. Then I hear a child crying. I didn&#x2019;t make much of it. I thought there was somebody in the church with a child.&quot; </p>

<p>But the crying continued; he said, &quot;I looked around and didn&#x2019;t see anyone. That got me curious. I followed the cries. I walked to the little nativity home we had installed inside the church ... I couldn&#x2019;t believe my eyes. The baby was wrapped in towels. He still had his umbilical cord. He was next to the Virgin (Mary).&#x201D;</p>

<p>Churches are considered safe havens where parents may &quot;abandon a newborn baby up to 30 days of age anonymously and without fear of prosecution -- if the baby is abandoned in a safe manner.&quot; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402031327/http://ocfs.ny.gov/main/safe/info.asp">NY State&apos;s Safe Haven Law</a>, &quot;A parent is not guilty of a crime if the infant is left with an appropriate person or in a suitable location and the parent promptly notifies an appropriate person of the infant&#x2019;s location.&quot; </p>

<p>The police are investigating.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402031327/http://abc7ny.com/news/newborn-boy-left-in-queens-churchs-nativity-scene/1097986/">Father Heanue said</a>, &quot;God has a way of working mysteriously because I believe when this woman who came in with this child, saw this church, this empty home, this home in which we&apos;ll welcome Jesus in just a few short weeks, I believe she found in it a home for her child.&quot;</p>

<p>One parishioner told WABC 7, &quot;To hear something like this totally shocked me and I&apos;ve never heard anybody leaving a newborn, and I&apos;ve been here for 25 years, never... I was crying just watching the news. To me, I call him baby Jesus already, so he&apos;s like a child is born, that&apos;s the way I look at it, in the manger of Holy Child Jesus Church.&quot;</p>

<p>Father Heanue added that many parish families have offered to adopt the baby.</p>
