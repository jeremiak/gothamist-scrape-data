<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://www.panynj.gov/">Port Authority</a> released its letter and report to Governor David Paterson about progress at the World Trade Center site.  The NY-NJ agency was given control of the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/25/silverstein_say.php">two years ago</a>, but building at the site has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/30/port_authority_confirms_delays_bill.php">been stymied by delays</a> given the complexity and cost of the project. </p>

<p> Now, P.A. Director Chris Ward believes that everything&apos;s set to have the project move forward and noted the progress since his June report.  But what we like best is the timeline with the &quot;probabilistic&quot; dates of completion (back in 2003, then Governor Pataki said Freedom Tower <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19tower.html">would be completed by 2008</a>!) and the new projects costs.  All told, the project will cost $1 billion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://www.wnbc.com/news/17607161/detail.html?dl=headlineclick">more than previously estimated</a>.   Governor Paterson said of the report, &quot;We know what we are building, how long it will take and how much it will cost.&quot; <br>
The WTC Memorial will be <i>mostly</i> done for September 11, 2011 commemoration (the visitor&apos;s center might not be open in time), but it will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/10/02/2008-10-02_port_authority_extra_75m_needed_to_finis.html">cost another $75 million</a> and the site will be surrounded by construction. This didn&apos;t make Mayor Bloomberg happy, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/10/bloomberg_wants_action_at_ground_ze.php">previously written an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal</a> demanding action at Ground Zero--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105032/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10022008/news/regionalnews/wtc_owners_rewrite_expectations_at_groun_131831.htm">he said</a>, &quot;Fully completing the memorial by the 10th anniversary of 9/11 remains our goal and this plan doesn&apos;t accomplish that.&quot;</p>
