</div></div>					<p>The explosion of confetti along the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219110921/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/crowds_gather_for_giants_ticker_tap.php#photo-2">Giants&apos; Super Bowl XLVI Ticker Tape Parade route</a> was beautiful. And messy. The Department of Sanitation got right to work on its &quot;giant&quot; task (yes, the DSNY&apos;s press release says &quot;giant&quot; task!):</p>

<blockquote>Once the victory parade and City Hall ceremony were over - - featuring the Department&#x2019;s award-winning Emerald Society Pipes and Drums band and Honor Guard - - a team of Sanitation Workers swept into the &#x2018;Canyon of Heroes&#x2019; and around City Hall Park to clean up shredded, recyclable paper and confetti thrown from windows and rooftops.  The Department had approximately 336 men and women assigned to the parade cleanup.  They operated 30 mechanical sweepers, 14 collection trucks, 129 backpack leaf blowers, and other street cleaning equipment in order to clear the streets.  Any recyclable paper swept up following the parade was recycled. 

<p>Sanitation Commissioner John J. Doherty said, &#x201C;The Department has a long-standing tradition of cleaning up after victory parades.  We congratulate the New York Giants on their phenomenal Super Bowl victory, and are honored to be a part of the celebration.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Before today&#x2019;s event, the last &#x2018;ticker tape&#x2019; parade in New York City was held on November 6, 2009 for the New York Yankees in their World Series victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.  That parade generated 56 tons of parade debris, of which 18 tons of paper was recycled. </p>

<p>The 2008 Giants Super Bowl Parade generated 34.2 tons of ticker tape and other debris.</p></blockquote><p></p>
