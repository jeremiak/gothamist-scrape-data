<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_05_lawsuit.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413074711im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_05_lawsuit.jpg" width="135" height="101" class="image-right"> </span>Queens Assemblywoman Margaret Markey (D-Queens) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413074711/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/nyregion/04abuse.html?ref=nyregion">revising a proposed bill</a> that extends the statue of limitations for lawsuits and allows victims of sexual abuse sue public entities, as well as private ones.  The NY Times reports, &quot;The change would give people who say they were abused in public schools, for example, the same opportunities to sue as those claiming abuse in religious or private schools.&quot;  The legislation has raised the ire of the Brooklyn Diocese, whose bishop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413074711/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/31/brooklyn_bishop_opposes_child_moles.php">allegedly threatened to shut down schools and churches</a> in state lawmakers&apos; districts if they supported the bill. The United Federation of Teachers told the Times that since it &quot;supports any reasonable measures that seek to protect children, so we are not opposed to this modification,&quot; but the New York State Council of School Superintendents said, <strong>&quot;We would have a concern about litigation arising that would be hard to respond to because witnesses could have disappeared or even died in years past.&quot;</strong> </p>
