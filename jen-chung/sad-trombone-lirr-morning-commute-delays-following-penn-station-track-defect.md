<p>You know how there was that story from yesterday, about how Penn Station <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427185301/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/26/penn_station_amtrak.php">was supposed to get worse before it gets better</a>? Well, the worsening is already underway this morning, as Long Island Rail Road commuters have been dealing with delays following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427185301/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hour-Long-Delay-on-Upper-Level-of-George-Washington-Bridge-420580253.html">a Penn Station &quot;track defect.&quot;</a></p>

<p>According to NBC New York, &quot;Several trains were canceled -- and subsequently reinstated -- before 7:40 a.m. and others were diverted to Atlantic Terminal or Hunterspoint Avenue because of what transit sources described as a broken track tie with Track 18.&quot; The track repair was reportedly completed so quickly that canceled trains were then uncancelled, but residual delays ensued anyway.</p>
