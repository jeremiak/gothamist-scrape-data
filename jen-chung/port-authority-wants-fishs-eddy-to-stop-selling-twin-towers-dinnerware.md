<p>A cutesy illustration of New York City&apos;s skyline, circa 1977 to September 10, 2001, is now the target of a cease-and-desist order from the Port Authority. Housewares chain Fishs Eddy sells plates, mugs, placemats, etc., that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015315/http://www.fishseddy.com/browse.cfm/2,102.html">show various NYC landmarks,</a> like the Flatiron Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Twin Towers&#x2014;and the Port Authority is unamused.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015315/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/nyregion/port-authority-of-new-york-and-new-jersey-tells-store-to-drop-9-11-items-.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1">According to the NY Times</a>, the Port Authority also objected to a line of dishes that shows the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels:</p><blockquote>In a letter to Fishs Eddy dated July 24, Veronica Rodriguez, a lawyer for the authority, asked the store to stop selling anything with these &#x201C;assets&#x201D; on them, and to &#x201C;destroy all materials, documents and other items bearing the assets.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Your use of the Port Authority&#x2019;s assets on dinnerware and other items is of great concern to the Port Authority,&#x201D; she wrote.</p>

<p>...[The 212 dinnerware art] is no mere harmless, poignant city scene, in the eyes of the Port Authority, which said the dinnerware would &#x201C;evoke thoughts of the Port Authority, the twin towers, W.T.C. and the September 11th terrorist attacks.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>We&apos;d argue that seeing the new World Trade Center in the skyline reminds us of the September 11 attacks, too. (Why can&apos;t we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015315/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/22/photo_finally_you_can_buy_a_911_che.php">just have post-9/11 cheese plates</a>?)<p></p>

<p>Fishs Eddy co-owner Julie Gaines told the Times, &quot;Are they going to stop everyone from using the trade center in the skyline? If so, they&#x2019;d better get going.&quot; She added, &quot;If they hurt this pattern, they hurt us&quot; because that particular skyline series of dishes has been a longtime favorite.</p>

<p>Gaines, though, seems to be triumphant against the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015315/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB897434998149805000">1998 cease-and-desist</a> she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015315/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/27/garden/design-notebook-what-next-a-fee-for-looking.html">got for having the Chrysler Building</a> in the skyline&#x2014;the Art Deco landmark is still on the 212 plates!</p>
