<p>The fires have been in an area that is home to one ethnic group. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427041036/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Forest-Hills-Firebug-Arson-Suspect-Queens-New-York-Construction-356019621.html">One homeowner told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I feel that we&#x2019;re under attack. It&#x2019;s some kind of sort of also terrorist attacks going against Bukharan Jews.&quot;</p>
