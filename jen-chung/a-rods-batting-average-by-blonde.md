<p>People magazine only looked at Alex Rodriguez&apos;s batting average during his romantic involvements <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529161803/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/22/mets_hope_to_even_subway_series_ton.php">with Madonna, Kate Hudson, and Cameron Diaz</a> (his current girlfriend/whatever), so the Post decided to offer a <em>comprehensive</em> look at how well the slugger does with his various blondes&#x2014;adding ex-wife Cynthia and stripper Joslyn Morse (she of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529161803/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/30/arod_just_cant.php">&quot;Stray-Rod&quot; cover</a>) into the mix.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529161803/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/go_go_rod_evUumAyRV6rQBY3eNZ70GJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post says</a>, &quot;Yankee fans thirsting for first place should urge Alex Rodriguez to reunite with Joslyn Morse, the blond bombshell who busted open his marriage during the 2007 season,&quot; because &quot;his brief stint with Morse brought out his best game... The slugger had an explosive swing while hanging with Morse, swatting a home run every 11.7 plate appearances and smacking an average of .880 RBIs per game. The Post revealed their late-night meet-ups on May 30, 2007, but the get-togethers dated to at least the start of season -- a 50-game span.&quot; But keep in mind A-Rod was still married to C-Rod at the time, so maybe he does better when he&apos;s got two ladies&apos; attention?</p>

<p>As for Hudson, even though the Yankees won a World Series while he was dating her, but &quot;A-Rod posted his worst batting average, .286, and was second-worst in average home runs per appearance and only third in RBI output.&quot;  </p>
