Christine O&apos;Donnell, surprise victor in the Delaware Republican Senate party, was then known as a Christian activist and appeared frequently on Maher&apos;s show.  In this clip, O&apos;Donnell confessed/bragged, &quot;I dabbled into witchcraft &#x2014; I never joined a coven. But I did, I did. &#x2026; I dabbled into witchcraft. I hung around people who were doing these things. I&#x2019;m not making this stuff up. I know what they told me they do.&quot;</p>

<p>Then she added, &quot;One of my first dates with a witch was on a satanic altar, and I didn&#x2019;t know it. I mean, there&#x2019;s little blood there and stuff like that. &#x2026; We went to a movie and then had a midnight picnic on a satanic altar.&quot; Yada yada yada !  Maher, who showed the clip on his HBO program, Real Time, joked, &quot;I created her... You owe me Christine O&#x2019;Donnell,&quot; and referred to her strict abstinence stance, &quot;She does not have a mean bone in her body, or any other bone in her body.&quot;  He also wants O&apos;Donnell to appear the show, pointing out he has plenty of clips, &quot;I&#x2019;m just saying, Christine, it&#x2019;s like a hostage crisis, every week you don&#x2019;t show up, I&#x2019;m going to throw another body out.&quot;</p>

<p>However, it&apos;s unclear if the upstart candidate wants to deal with answering questions about the clip.  O&apos;Donnell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133408/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2010/09/did-dabbling-in-witchcraft-make-christine-odonnell-disappear-this-morning.html">ducked appearances on talk shows</a>&#x2014;CBS&apos;s Face the Nation asked her campaign if the cancellation was due to the witchcraft revelation, but the campaign said, &quot;Campaigns about what she did as a teen is hardly a worry to her or the people of Delaware.&quot; Still, Bush&apos;s brain Karl Rove said on Fox News that she &quot;can&#x2019;t simply ignore it. She&#x2019;s got to deal with it and explain it.&quot; </p>
