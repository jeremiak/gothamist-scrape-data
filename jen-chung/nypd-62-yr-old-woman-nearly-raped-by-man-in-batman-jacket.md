<p>According to the NYPD, the incident took place at 1 a.m. on November 20: The victim, a 62-year-old woman, was in &quot;the rear lobby of her building when the suspect approached her and attempted to rape her. The victim was able to fend off the suspects who fled the scene. The victim refused medical attention on scene.&quot;<br>
