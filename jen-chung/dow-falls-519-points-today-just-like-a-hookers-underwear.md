<p>Ultimately, Wall Street decided today was a down day, with the Dow Jones falling 519.83 points today (-4.62%), wiping out its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208210245/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/09/wall_street_roller_coaster_dow_clos.php">Tuesday gains of 429 points</a>.  The Nasdaq fell 101.47 points (-4.09%) and the S&amp;P; 500 lost 51.77 points (-4.42%).  It&apos;s unclear if the Post will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208210245/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/10/get_used_to_stock_market_volatility.php">use another hooker cover</a>, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208210245/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903918104576499843400963316.html?mod=WSJ_Home_largeHeadline">Wall Street Journal sorta namechecks</a> Steve Soderbergh&apos;s upcoming movie, &quot;U.S. stocks slumped as investors were squeezed between fears of further contagion among European banks and the Federal Reserve&apos;s gloomy economic outlook.&quot;</p>

<p>An economist at Barclays Capital in New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208210245/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html?hp">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;Today it&#x2019;s fears about French banks and France,&quot; and referred specifically to French bank Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, which fell 18% today, &quot;SocGen is the name that is really driving trading.&quot;  And the portfolio manager at the Pax Balanced World Fund told the WSJ, &quot;The market can go from euphoria to depression at the flick of a switch. People are concerned about France&apos;s ratings, and the banks are under an extreme amount of pressure.&quot;<br>
