</div></div>					<p>The police have released a new video of the suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012717/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/10/breaking_smoke_bomb_thrown_into_gre.php">threw a smoke bomb into a Greenwich Village restaurant</a> on Friday night. You can see him slowly opening the subway grate&#x2014;prompting one pedestrian to walk around the grate&#x2014;and then emerging to toss the device:</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150510012717if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/108832120" width="640" height="458" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The suspect then quickly ducks back underground. (This subway grate connects to the West 4th Street subway station.) </p>

<p>The smoke bomb was thrown into Bar Pitti, which is located at 268 Avenue of the Americas and has a popular sidewalk seating area, around 5:49 p.m. It&apos;s also a celebrity hangout:</p>

<p>The above video is taken from neighboring restaurant Da Silvano; here&apos;s video from Bar Pitti:</p>

<p>Da Silvano&apos;s manager denies his restaurant was behind the attack; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012717/http://nypost.com/2014/10/14/manager-says-his-eatery-isnt-behind-west-village-smoke-bomb/">the Post reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Da Silvano owner Silvano Marchetto and his former business partner, Bar Pitti&#x2019;s Giovanni Tognozzi, have been beefing over stolen meatball recipes and corporate back-stabbing since 2002.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I know about the fighting, but I haven&#x2019;t heard anything about it in a very long time,&#x201D; said the manager, who identified himself as Alessio. Police sources said they do not believe that the rivalry played a role, but have ruled nothing out.</p></blockquote>The Post adds, &quot;The bomb was made by a UK company and is sold on Amazon.com and eBay for as little as $8.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Cops describe the suspect as around 20 years old, with blond wavy hair. He was last seen wearing black gloves, black baseball cap, and a multi colored t-shirt. Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
