<p>Morales had been waiting to see Salters for an appointment.  According to the Daily News, he &quot;sat stone-faced in a waiting room until his name was called shortly before 7 p.m. He then calmly walked into a cubicle in an adjoining office, took aim at Salters and squeezed off a single shot.&quot; Cofield, who said that meeting with parole officers take about a half hour, said that there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065905/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/parole_officer_shot_killed_by_parolee_OgqVwd9jf0aaSfJfdRRqRP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">no security screening at the offices</a>&#x2014; there&apos;s just a list of banned items (like weapons).  </p>

<p>Salters is in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital.  Morales was arrested and charged with attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon&#x2014;a 9mm Ruger was recovered at the scene.  </p>
