<p>Some asshole decided to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094818/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Car-Into-House-Brooklyn-Couple-Pinned-Hurt-Hospital-Driver-Lose-Police-210811081.html">drive a SUV THROUGH A STEEL GATE</a>, across a lawn and INTO A FRONT PORCH, hitting a couple sitting on their stoop last night. Mission accomplished, he then fled the scene on foot.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the corner of DuMont Avenue and Hinsdale Street in Brownsville, Brooklyn. The couple was pinned against the wall&#x2014;the 59-year-old suffered minor injuries while 60-year-old man suffered a broken leg. A friend of the couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094818/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/09/man-woman-struck-injured-by-suv-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I was in the window when it happened. The guy opened the door of the truck, jumped out of the truck, and jumped out the front, and ran away,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094818/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/hit_run_rocks_klyn_home_7YvPdEt1RQwsdZw5RhXPMP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">said of the male victim</a>, &quot;I could see the bone sticking out of his leg.&quot;</p>

<p>The police tried to follow the driver, but weren&apos;t able to catch him; he remains at large. It appears he was not the owner of the car.</p>
