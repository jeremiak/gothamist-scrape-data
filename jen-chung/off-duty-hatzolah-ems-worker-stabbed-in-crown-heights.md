<p>A 34-year-old man who works as a volunteer EMS with the Hatzolah service in Brooklyn was stabbed while walking in Crown Heights last night. The suspect may have been wearing a mask.</p>

<p>Police say the victim, who was off-duty, was walking on Eastern Parkway around 8:30 p.m., between Nostrand and Rogers Avenues, when he felt a pain in his back. He turned around and saw male running away, but did not get a look at the alleged stabber, police say. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306201953/http://crownheights.info/crime/506239/two-orthodox-jews-stabbed-in-crown-heights/">Crown Heights Info reports</a>, &quot;The man radioed for help from his fellow Hatzolah volunteers, and then managed to walk himself to the intersection of Eastern Parkway and Rogers Avenue, leaving a trail of blood behind him. He collapsed just as a Hatzolah ambulance arrived at the scene.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Kings County and then Methodist Hospital to treat a two-inch laceration in his right shoulder; he received staples and is expected to survive. </p>

<p>The police investigation is ongoing.

<p>Hatzolah is the volunteer ambulance service in mainly Jewish neighborhoods, but serves the whole community. A police spokesperson told us the NYPD&apos;s Hate Crime unit is involved in the investigation, but it&apos;s currently unclear if the stabbing will be classified as a hate crime. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said, &quot;With the stabbings that are taking place in Israel, we cannot be relaxed when you investigate something of this magnitude, we need to determine if it is a hate crime, and we need to use all the video footage and whatever we can to apprehend the person.&quot;</p>
