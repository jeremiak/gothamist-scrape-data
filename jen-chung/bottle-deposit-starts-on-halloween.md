Governor Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143417/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/107845/judge--bottle-deposit-back-on-tap/">said</a>, &quot;The expansion of this legislation not only provides our State with much-needed revenue, but will also help us to keep our neighborhoods and parks clean.&quot;</p>

<p>The law was supposed to go into effect in June, but some bottlers had argued that it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143417/http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=804526&amp;category=BUSINESS">going into effect too soon</a>, especially since NY State requires bottles sold here to have a special UPC. Which means some distribution and logistical issues; Environmental Leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143417/http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/04/09/new-yorks-nickel-water-bottle-deposit-raises-ire-of-distributors-retailers/">points out</a>, &quot;For instance, a distributor can&#x2019;t simply restock New York shelves with product from a New Jersey warehouse unless it bears the unique code.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143417/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/10/businesses_scramble_to_prepare.html">Post-Standard explains</a>, &quot;For consumers, the change is simple enough. Beginning at 12 a.m. Saturday, they will pay a nickel deposit on bottles of water, just as they do for soda and beer. They will get the deposits back when they return the bottles to the store or to a redemption center. Deposits will not be required on water that has sugar added, or on containers of 1 gallon or more.&quot;</p>

<p>Distributors will have to give NY State <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143417/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/nyregion/24bottle.html">80% of all unclaimed deposits</a>.  </p>
