</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211123454/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/realestate/commercial/26flatiron.html">NY Times has a feature</a> on the loyalty of the Flatiron building&apos;s commercial tenants, even though the landmark features a very awkward layout.  &quot;The elevator bank, the waiting area and the stairway eat up an unusual amount of space&quot; and an executive from St. Martin&apos;s Press, whose parent company MacMillan publishers is six-and-a-half years through its 15 year lease, said, &quot;We&#x2019;ve used every nook and cranny. You&#x2019;re lucky if you get 70 percent of the floor space.&quot;</p>

<p>Built in 1902 from a Daniel Burnham design, there are downsides, like how the men&apos;s and women&apos;s bathrooms are on alternating floors, and upsides, such as the building&apos;s narrow shape which allow most employees to have windows, plus fun history (&quot;The swirling winds generated by its shape are said to have inspired the phrase &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211123454/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23_skidoo_(phrase)">23 skidoo</a>&#x201D; &#x2014; what police officers would say as they dispersed the men who gathered outside to linger and watch for women&#x2019;s skirts to blow up as they passed&quot;). </p>

<p>St. Martin&apos;s publisher Matthew Shear boasted, &quot;You see these strange little offices. There&#x2019;s nothing cookie-cutter here. I mean, did you see the 21st floor? It&#x2019;s like a place you&#x2019;d put your mad aunt,&quot; while Alice Spaberg Alexiou, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211123454/http://www.amazon.com/Flatiron-York-Landmark-Incomparable-Arose/dp/0312384688?tag=gothamist03-20">authored an upcoming book</a> about the building, said, &quot;The Flatiron has always obsessed people. And I think it always will, now that it&#x2019;s landmarked. Maybe it has something to with the fact that it&#x2019;s a triangle. Triangles are magical. There&#x2019;s something almost religious about it.&quot;</p>
