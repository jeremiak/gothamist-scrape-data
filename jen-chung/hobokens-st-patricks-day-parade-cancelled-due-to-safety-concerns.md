<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150719034101/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/hoboken_warns_st_patricks_day_revel.php">Hoboken warned revelers</a> that they could be subject to a $2,000 fine for incidents like &quot;consumption of alcohol/open container in public, urinating in public, maintaining a nuisance (disorderly and unsafe house parties), and disorderly conduct &amp; improper behavior.&quot;  Hoboken had issued 500 summons during the 2010 parade, and in 2009, the city&apos;s public safety director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150719034101/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/09/hoboken_st_pattys_parade_rooftop_pe.php">said of the parade</a>, &quot;On Washingtion Street, bottles were thrown onto the people below. A girl and a guy were performing sex in a window when the parade was going by. One person spit in the face of a fireman. There were young, young girls that were blind drunk standing in the middle of the streets, so drunk that they didn&apos;t know where they were.&quot;  Here&apos;s video from the 2009 parade:</p>

<p>The parade had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150719034101/http://www.nj.com/hobokennow/index.ssf/2012/01/hoboken_st_patricks_day_parade_6.html">moved to a weekday for 2012</a>, but organizers noted many participants have day jobs&#x2014;&quot;Who&apos;s going to take a day off from work to march in a parade? It&apos;s not their profession -- it&apos;s something they love to do because they love music and their heritage.&quot; It&apos;s unclear if the St. Patrick&apos;s Day Committee will resurrect the parade if it&apos;s moved back to the weekend. Well, there&apos;s always the Staten Paten (Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150719034101/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/march_is_st_patricks_month.php">celebration</a>.)</p>
