<p>According to the Daily News, &quot;Transit advocates credit Roberts for a series of reforms, like asking bus and subway riders to rate service on their lines and rank their priorities,&quot; but a &quot;few board members have expressed exasperation with delays that continue to plague the subway system.

The subways and buses can drive New Yorkers nuts, but Howard Roberts worked hard for a saner system.&quot; The Straphangers also cite other accomplishments like providing faster bus service (the first-ever &quot;Select Bus Service&quot; routes in the Bronx and Manhattan), the subway rider report cards, and adopting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623152237/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/21/subway_floodfig.php">new flood strategy</a>.</p>
