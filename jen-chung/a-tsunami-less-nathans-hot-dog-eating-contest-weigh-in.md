</div></div>					<p>Today, the contestants for Nathan&apos;s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest weighed in at City Hall.  While Joey &quot;Jaws&quot; Chestnut, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310224700/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/04/joey_chestnut_retains_mustard_belt.php">reigning champ for three straight years</a>, showed off his Mustard Belt, it wasn&apos;t the same without his archrival, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310224700/http://gothamist.com/tags/takerukobayashi">Takeru &quot;The Tsunami&quot; Kobayashi</a>, the Japanese phenom who has won the contest six times.  Kobayashi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310224700/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/01/kobayashi_contest_organizers_are_tr.php">claimed that a contract dispute</a> with contest organizers was keeping him out of the July 4th event, Mayor Bloomberg stepped into the fray, saying, &quot;Well, you know what they say: If you can&#x2019;t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310224700/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/27/web_gk_mayorslam_2010_07_09_bk.html">According to the Brooklyn Paper</a>, Bloomberg&apos;s jab drew &quot;gasps from the press corps.&quot; International Federation of Competitive Eating executive director George Shea said Kobayashi wants more money, &quot;We have never stopped negotiating with Kobayashi to bring him here. We want him here. Nathan&#x2019;s wants him here. The fans want him here. And he himself has said he wants to be here. So why won&#x2019;t he work out [a contract] with us that will bring him here?&quot; </p>

<p>As for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310224700/http://joeyjawschestnut.com/">Chestnut</a>, he said, &quot;I&apos;m fasting hard, practicing hard, and recovering, paying attention to my body. I&apos;ve been running more, trying to get a little bit healthier, but I love to eat, this is what I do.&quot; This from a man who won a Deep Fried Asparagus Contest. And on his website, Chestnut gave his thoughts about the Kobayashi Kontroversy:</p><blockquote>&quot;I am three days away from my biggest contest of the year and I was thrown a curve ball.  Apparently kobayashi has not committed to competing on Sunday.  I know iti shouldn&#x2019;t let it affect my training and I&#x2019;m not. Over and over I am being asked about koby and I give the same a answer&#x2026; &apos;I don&#x2019;t know if he is eating,  but if he does I will be ready&apos;&#x2026; I respect koby&#x2019;s ability, but I also know that he will do anything to win, including faking an injury. So I would not be surprised if koby showed at the last second in hopes of catching his competitors off guard. <strong>I am using the possibility of a koby sneak attack as motivation to push hard in the final stretch of training.</strong>&quot;</blockquote><br>
The contest is outside of Nathan&apos;s Famous at Surf Avenue in Coney Island on Sunday.  Festivities start around 10:30 a.m., but ESPN starts the broadcast at noon.  And Nathan&apos;s is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310224700/http://www.ifoce.com/news.php?action=detail&amp;sn=807">donating 100,000 hot dogs</a> to the Food Bank for New York City.<p></p>
