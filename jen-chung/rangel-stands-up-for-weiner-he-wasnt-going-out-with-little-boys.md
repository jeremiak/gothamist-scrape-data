Rangel outside City Hall today (Azi Paybarah/Politicker NY)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Finally, Rep. Charles Rangel, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164228/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/rangel_censure_was_embarrassing_pai.php">censured by the House of Representatives</a> last year, has weighed in on fellow Congressional member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164228/http://gothamist.com/tags/weinergate">Anthony Weiner&apos;s woes</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164228/http://www.politickerny.com/2011/06/10/anthony-weiners-problem-is-the-media-says-rangel-video/">According to Politicker NY</a>, Rangel told reporters, &quot;Not one person has given any reason for a resignation. The Constitution is abundantly clear&quot; on proper Congressional member conduct.  </p>

<p>He also added, &quot;He wasn&#x2019;t going with prostitutes. He wasn&#x2019;t going out with little boys. He wasn&#x2019;t going into men&#x2019;s room with broad stances. I mean, All of those I understand; I&#x2019;m 80 years old. But high-tech stuff like this, I can&#x2019;t respond. But I know immoral sex when I hear it from other members, and no one has screamed for their resignation. So I don&#x2019;t know why they&#x2019;re selecting Anthony.&quot;</p>
