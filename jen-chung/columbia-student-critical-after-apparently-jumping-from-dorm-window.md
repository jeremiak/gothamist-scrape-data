<p>A 19-year-old student at Columbia University was hospitalized after apparently jumping from an eighth floor dormitory window last night. The student, identified as Brandon Marco, was found on third-floor scaffolding outside Wien Hall.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 8:30 p.m. at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011124/http://housing.columbia.edu/housing-options/residences/wien-hall">11-story dorm</a>, which is at 411 West 116h Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011124/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/columbia-university-student-apparently-jumps-dorm-room-article-1.2046526">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;He wandered into the room of a fellow student, just down the hall from his, acting irrationally and apparently under the influence of drugs, police sources said. The occupant of that room, a young woman, became alarmed when Marco suddenly removed all of his clothes.&quot; </p>

But the student had already leaped out the window.&quot;</p>

<p>Marco was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where he is in critical but stable condition. A source tells the Daily News &quot;that Marco was suffering from severe internal bleeding and that his condition was &apos;very critical.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>A student told the Post, &quot;He was always super friendly and nice to me. I know he&#x2019;s social and has a lot of friends.&quot;</p>
