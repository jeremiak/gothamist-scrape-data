</div></div>					<p>Former mayor Michael Bloomberg (also known as &quot;Mike Bloomberg&quot; on Twitter) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015502/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/mike_bloomberg_flying_to_tel_aviv_t.php">landed in Israel</a> after flying from New York on a <em>commercial</em> El Al flight. His decision to eschew his usual private plane was to show his support for flights going to Israel and to criticize the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015502/http://dcist.com/2014/07/faa_bans_us_airlines_from_flying_to.php">FAA&apos;s ban on American flights</a> to and from the country. </p>

<p>&quot;Halting flights here&#x2014;when the airport is safe&#x2014;hurts Israel and rewards Hamas for attacking Israel,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;Hamas wants to shut down the airport; we can&#x2019;t let that happen. I&#x2019;m a pilot&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve always believed the FAA does a great job&#x2014;and still do. But on this issue, I think the agency got it wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg also said of the airport in Tel Aviv, &quot;Ben Gurion airport is the best protected airport in the world. It is safe and secure and flights from all over the world are landing here... Israel&#x2014;like every other nation&#x2014;has a right to defend itself and defend its borders against those who cross it to attack it. In the U.S., if hostile forces crossed over our border from Mexico or Canada, we would respond with overwhelming force to destroy those who are seeking to destroy us. Israelis should not be expected to live under the constant threat of rocket attacks without their government doing something about it.&quot;</p>

<p>He also made the rounds to CNN just now:</p>

<p>In spite of the criticism, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015502/http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=16714">FAA has extended the ban</a>.</p>

<p>Bloomberg has been meeting with Israeli leaders, like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres. Here is his full statement:</p><blockquote>&quot;First, I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for welcoming me here. He&#x2019;s been a great friend of New York City and America, as have the Israeli people.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I flew here to show solidarity with the Israeli people, who have come under attack from Hamas, and to show that it&#x2019;s safe to fly in and out of Israel.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;ve always been a strong supporter of Israel. When New York City and the United States were attacked on 9/11, the people of Israel stood with us. They know what it&#x2019;s like to be attacked by terrorists, and they know that one of the best things you can do to defeat the terrorists is to refuse to stop living your life - to refuse to give in to the terrorists.</p>

<p>&quot;Halting flights here - when the airport is safe - hurts Israel and rewards Hamas for attacking Israel. Hamas wants to shut down the airport; we can&#x2019;t let that happen.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;m a pilot - and I&#x2019;ve always believed the FAA does a great job - and still do. But on this issue, I think the agency got it wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Ben Gurion airport is the best protected airport in the world. It is safe and secure and flights from all over the world are landing here.</p>

<p>&quot;It was an overreaction for the FAA to halt U.S. flights here - and a mistake they should correct.</p>

<p>&quot;Israel - like every other nation - has a right to defend itself and defend its borders against those who cross it to attack it.</p>

<p>&quot;In the U.S., if hostile forces crossed over our border from Mexico or Canada, we would respond with overwhelming force to destroy those who are seeking to destroy us. Israelis should not be expected to live under the constant threat of rocket attacks without their government doing something about it.</p>

<p>&quot;The Obama administration has rightly made it clear that Israel has right to defend itself - and I&#x2019;m glad that Secretary Kerry flew here today to meet with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.</p>

<p>&quot;He was right to fly in, and I hope he will report back that the airport is safe and that the FAA should reverse its decision.</p>

<p>&quot;Today, I&#x2019;ll be visiting with some Americans who have been stranded here as a result of the FAA&#x2019;s decision, before flying home.</p>

<p>&quot;But let me just add: The attacks by Hamas are the cause of a lot of death and suffering both in Israel and Gaza, and my heart goes out to all the families that are affected. Thank you.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
