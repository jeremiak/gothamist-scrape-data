</div></div>					<p>The FDNY is still fighting a fire that started yesterday afternoon in the Jackson Heights section of Queens. While the fire was brought under control before midnight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162812/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9511369">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;Hot spots persisted through early Tuesday, and two tower ladders were dousing the building with water.&quot;</p>

<p>The fire broke out before 5:45 p.m. at a commercial building on 37th Avenue and 74th Street whose tenants include Plaza College, offices and a restaurant. Huge flames and black smoke shot out of the third floor windows. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162812/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/21/4-alarm-fire-burns-at-jackson-heights-office-building/">A witness told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;We actually thought it was an accident. It sounded like two cars that hit, and like the glasses had popped. So we just opened the window and looked down.&quot;</p>

<p>About two hundred firefighters were on the scene. A pharmacy owner told WCBS 880, &quot;We all just ran out. We locked the door behind us. And it just kept spreading. They can&#x2019;t get it under control.&quot; The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162812/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/fire-erupts-commercial-building-queens-article-1.1764219"> fire was under control at 11:40 p.m.</a>, and two people were injured, a minor and a firefighter.</p>
