The baby had initially been reported missing from Kings County Hospital: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213842/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10272008/news/regionalnews/mystery_over_babys_death_135460.htm">According to the Post</a>, the mother told ER workers &quot;she had taken him there and wanted to see him,&quot; but when the hospital couldn&apos;t find any record of the baby, they contacted the police who went to the mother&apos;s apartment in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213842/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/nyregion/27babyxx.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a> that the mother has two other young children, &quot;about 2 and 3 years old.&quot;  The authorities removed the children from the apartment: &quot;They were in pajamas and seemed unstartled by the activity swirling around them: the police, the news cameras.&quot;</p>
