<p>Everyone loves iPads&#x2014;especially thieves!  As if stealing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018080953/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/ipad-carrying_jogger_mugged_in_cent.php">them from joggers</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018080953/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-09-26/news/30234245_1_subway-crime-subway-felonies-subway-riders">oblivious subway passengers</a> wasn&apos;t enough, a crew in Brooklyn decided to go straight to the source: The Best Buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018080953/http://stores.bestbuy.com/1886/">at Gateway Plaza</a>.</p>

All that, in under four minutes.&quot;  Police suspect that it could have been an inside job &quot;because some of the store&apos;s security cameras, and some in the shopping plaza that houses the store, were not working at the time, police sources said.</p>

<p>If only brand-new iPads <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018080953/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/08/rest_easy_new_york_iphone_thief_nab.php">had iGotYa</a>!</p>
