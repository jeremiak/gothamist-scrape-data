The Post reports that Justin Larson, 26, is in critical condition at New York Hospital Queens, with &quot;broken ribs, bruising on the brain, and a collapsed lung.&quot;</p>

<p>A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065141/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2008/07/26/2008-07-26_another_fan_falls_from_escalator_at_shea.html">told the Daily News</a> Larson was &quot;attempting to slide down a bannister in the D section&quot; when he fell around 10 p.m.  A friend of Larson&apos;s said to the Post, &quot;<strong>We were just goofing off, having fun</strong>... Justin hops onto the escalator that was broken. He got stuck near the top and <strong>he fell backwards...and slammed his head on the concrete</strong>.&quot;   A driver outside the stadium who heard the fall told the News, &quot;It was a terrible sound.  I never want to hear that again.&quot;  </p>

<p>The escalators are turned off during the 7th inning (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065141/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/27/last_nights_actions_movin_on_up.php">last night&apos;s game</a> went into extra innings, ending well after midnight) and fans are asked to exit Shea via the ramps.  And earlier this year, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065141/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/16/fatal_fall_from.php">fell to his death</a> from the escalators at Shea.</p>
