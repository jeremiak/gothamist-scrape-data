<p>According to investigators, the incident occurred on Monday at 4:07 p.m. A 44-year-old deaf and mute male was on a southbound F train when another man walked over to him and struck him in the face numerous times with his hands. </p>

<p>The police say the victim got out at the 18th Avenue subway station while the suspect remained on the train. The victim was treated at Maimonides Hospital for lacerations to his bottom lip.<br>
 <br>
Police, who believe the attack was random, distributed a photo of the suspect, which was taken by another subway rider. The suspect is described as being in his 50s or 60s, 5&apos;9&quot; to 6&apos; tall and wearing a white tee shirt, blue jeans and black sneakers.<br>
 <br>
