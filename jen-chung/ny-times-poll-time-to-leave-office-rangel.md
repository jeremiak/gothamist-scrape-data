<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:230px; "> <img alt="2010_08_rangel10.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063420im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_08_rangel10.jpg" width="230" height="204"> <br> <i>Rangel at a campaign event last month (Bebeto Matthews/AP)</i></div> Hey, it&apos;s time for another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063420/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/03/ny_times_67_of_nyc_residents_says_m.php">NY Times poll.</a>  This one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063420/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/nyregion/04rangel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">asked registered voters in Manhattan</a> about Rep. Charles Rangel: &quot;70 percent of Manhattan voters want him to end his Congressional career: 46 percent said he should give up his campaign and step down at the end of his term, and 24 percent said he should resign now. Twenty-three percent said he should seek a new term.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s a caveat with the poll: The poll was conducted of voters (195 total) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063420/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/nyregion/04mpoll.html?ref=nyregion">in <em>all</em> of Manhattan</a>, while Rangel&apos;s district, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063420/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York&apos;s_15th_congressional_district">the 15th</a>, is only upper Manhattan, plus Rikers Island and a small part of Queens.  A Flatiron District resident said, &quot;I feel he should have known that you can have only one rent-stabilized apartment and it has to be your primary residence. Having four is not legal,&quot; referring to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063420/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/29/no_deal_house_unveils_ethics_charge.php">one of Rangel&apos;s many ethics woes</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think he should resign because the term is almost over anyway, but he should not run again.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, an Upper West Side resident said, &quot;I am in his district, and everyone here says the same thing. We think he is well qualified. He is always available and has done a good job for his community. The fact that we&#x2019;ve kept him there for a long time should speak for itself. Why would we change now? We voted for him for a reason.&quot; Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063420/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/03/2010-09-03_pick_either_rangel_or_powell_yuck.html">Daily News found</a>, &quot;Harlem voters say their two top contenders for Congress - incumbent Charles Rangel and Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV - leave them with a choice between bad and worse. &apos;Everybody wishes there were better options,&apos; said Pax Williams, a 33-year-old party promoter who plans to vote for Rangel because &apos;you don&apos;t want to get anyone worse.&apos;&quot;  The primary is on September 14.</p>
