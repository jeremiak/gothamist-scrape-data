<p>The authorities are investigating a threatening letter that was sent to the Manhattan home of Eric Trump, son of presidential candidate and provocateur Donald Trump. Trump&apos;s wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801195631/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/threatening-letter-sent-to-donald-trump-son-eric-trump/">reportedly opened the envelope</a>.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, FBI and NYPD are participating in the investigation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801195631/http://abc7ny.com/politics/suspicious-letter-sent-to-trump-son-in-nyc;-anonymous-targets-trump/1251510/">The NYPD said</a>, &quot;At approximately 7:15 p.m., the NYPD responded to a residential building at 100 Central Park South to investigate a report of a suspicious letter received by a tenant. The letter has been removed and is being examined by law enforcement authorities. No injuries have been reported in connection with this incident.&quot;</p>

<p>According to CBS News , &quot;A source close to the investigation said the letter had a Massachusetts postmark and warned that if Donald Trump doesn&apos;t withdraw from the race for the Republican presidential nomination -- paraphrasing -- harm will come to the kids.... [The source] said the envelope contained suspicious white powder that&apos;s been sent to a lab for testing. The source said a preliminary field test indicated the substance didn&apos;t appear to be hazardous.&quot;</p>
