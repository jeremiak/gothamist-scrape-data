</div></div>					<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173244/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindsaylohan">Lindsay Lohan</a> appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote her role in <em>Scary Movie 5. </em>And you can always count on Letterman to say the things we all want to say to Lohan, like, &quot;You look remarkably well!&quot;, &quot;Aren&apos;t you supposed to be in rehab now?&quot; and &quot;What are they going to work on when you walk through the door?&quot; to which Lohan said, &quot;Don&apos;t you watch anything that goes on? What are you a tabloid now?&quot; and &quot;<strong>We didn&apos;t discuss this in the pre-interview, I&apos;m just saying.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>But she handled it well, answering, &quot;To be honest, I&apos;m happiest when I&apos;m working and healthiest, and I think this is an opportunity for me to focus on what I love in life and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a bad thing. I think it&apos;s a blessing.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173244/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/letterman-grills-lohan-rehab-article-1.1312226">Here&apos;s a little more</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Now, do you have addiction problems?&#x201D; Letterman continued, still grilling the actress, who&apos;s been to residential rehab five times before.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Now you sound like Dr. Phil,&#x201D; Lohan answered, scoring a laugh.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Yeah, I&#x2019;m sorry. Is it, like, alcohol? Do you drink too much?&#x201D; Letterman asked.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve discussed this in the past,&#x201D; Lohan said stiffly.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Did we really? When did we discuss &#x2014; now I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;s having the blackouts ... I oughta be at rehab. For the love of God, what is wrong with me?&#x201D; he said as he laughed.</p></blockquote>Letterman also referenced some of his previous jokes about her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173244/http://laist.com/2013/03/29/lindsay_lohan_lifted_clothes_from_t.php">alleged bad behavior</a>, &quot;Lindsay Lohan appeared on the Today Show morning. The appearance went well&#x2014;only one camera went missing&quot; and the whole session was like therapy, with Lohan tearing up! (Letterman gave her a tissue.)<p></p>

<p>Fun fact: Lohan first met Letterman when she appeared on Late Night with David Letterman (his NBC show) in 1992, as &quot;things you find on the D train.&quot;</p>
