<p>Police are seeking five people who allegedly attacked a street vendor on a Bronx sidewalk earlier this week, beating him until he was in critical condition.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on May 2nd, at 5 p.m., near East 149th Street and Third Avenue. The 52-year-old vendor was approached by the group who &quot;punched him in the head and face numerous times. When the victim fell to the floor unconscious the individuals continued to assault him.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185528/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/05/04/bronx-street-vendor-attack/">assault was sparked</a> when one of the suspects tried to take a purse without paying earlier in the day, and the vendor objected and prevented the theft. The group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185528/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Group-Men-Gang-Up-Brutally-Beat-Victim-Mott-Haven-Bronx-Fractures-Skull-Brain-Bleeding-NYPD-421254533.html">reportedly returned</a> to confront the vendor. </p>

<p>The victim was hospitalized with a fractured skull and bleeding in the brain. He is in critical condition.</p>

<p>The suspects fled south on Third Avenue. They are all described as being in their 20s. Police say the first suspect was last seen wearing a red baseball cap, a red hooded sweater and blue jeans; the second suspect had  glasses and was last seen wearing a black baseball cap, a black t-shirt and black jeans; the third suspect was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, blue shorts and black sneakers; the fourth had glasses and was last seen wearing a gray t-shirt and red pants; and the fifth was last seen wearing a pink baseball cap, a pink sweater and black jeans.</p>

<p>Police released surveillance footage of the attack:</p>

<p>A witness who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185528/http://abc7ny.com/news/bronx-street-vendor-critically-injured-after-attack-at-his-stand/1950690/">filmed the attack told WABC 7</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t know if [one of the suspects] was offended by something [the vendor] said but he started screaming, &apos;I&apos;m from around here, I&apos;m from around here.&apos; And then like a couple seconds later I just heard him yell, &apos;Right now, right now!&apos; And then that&apos;s when he ran across the street and came back with about four or five of his buddies right there.&quot;</p>

<p>The witness continued, &quot;In the beginning, [the vendor] got knocked down to the floor, the victim, and then he got right back up and that&apos;s when the dude in the red sweater knocked him out in one punch, and that&apos;s when everyone else gave him like two haymakers right there, and he didn&apos;t move after that.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently others who saw the attack were too scared to intervene, the witness said. &quot;Honestly everybody was so terrified they didn&apos;t even dare to get close to that group after they started beating the guy up, but as soon as they were gone everybody ran and started helping the guy.&quot;</p>
