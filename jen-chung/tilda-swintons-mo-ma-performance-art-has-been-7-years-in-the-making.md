(See update below&#x2014;she&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/25/tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_at_moma_a.php#photo-1">back on Monday, March 25</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://www.frithstreetgallery.com/artists/works/cornelia_parker/2/the_maybe">&quot;The Maybe&quot;</a> was originally staged by Swinton in 1995, at the Serpentine Gallery in London, in collaboration with the artist Cornelia Parker. Swinton later staged it in Rome and Paris, without Parker.  </p>

<p>MoMA Chief Curator at Large Klaus Biesenbach revealed to us that discussions for bringing &quot;The Maybe&quot; to the MoMA started when Swinton was working on another museum project. Back in 2005, she started filming her scenes for the MoMA-Creative Time film installation, Doug Aitken&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2007/aitken/flash.html">sleepwalkers</a>, which involved eight films projected on the MoMA&apos;s exterior walls (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/17/doug_aitkens_sl.php">it premiered in 2007</a>). Biesenbach said, &quot;We were sitting in a trailer... and we talked about &apos;The Maybe,&apos;&quot; and he mentioned to her that the museum wanted to bring back &quot;historic&quot; performance art. </p>

<p>Biesenbach, of course, is the man behind the museum&apos;s blockbuster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/marina.php#photo-1">Marina Abramovic retrospective</a>, which included a piece where Abramovic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/29/the_artist_is_presentthrough_monday.php#photo-1">sat across from museum vistors</a> for 736 hours and 30 minutes in the atrium. </p>

<p>&quot;The Maybe&quot; will appear randomly at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://moma.org/">MoMA</a>, in different locations, throughout the year. <b>Update</b>: She&apos;s there again, Monday, March 25&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152404/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/25/tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_at_moma_a.php#photo-1">details here</a>.</p>
