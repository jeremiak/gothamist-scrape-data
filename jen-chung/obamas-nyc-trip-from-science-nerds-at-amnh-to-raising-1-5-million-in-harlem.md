</div></div><p>President Obama was in New York City yesterday, to much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/obamas_harlem_visit_rankles_a_few.php">excitement and dismay alike</a>.  First, he visited the American Museum of Natural History for the Science and Engineering Fair and then he headed to the United Nations, to join former president Bill Clinton to dedicate the new U.S. Mission to the United Nations. Finally, his night was capped off by raising $1.5 million for Democrats at a $30,800-head dinner at the Red Rooster in Harlem. While some criticized the hefty price for the dinner, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/30/2011-03-30_residents_line_the_streets_of_harlem_hoping_for_a_glimpse_of_president_obama.html">Harlem resident told the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>If I had it, I would pay for the dinner, too. I&apos;m so proud he came to the ghetto to represent us.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://collegenow.cuny.edu/sciencefair/">NYC Science &amp; Engineering Fair</a>, where he and Mayor Bloomberg met with teens under the big whale, Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/152537-obama-stops-by-nyc-science-far">told the students</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve been traveling around the country talking about how America can win the future... Whenever I get a chance to go to a science fair, I go... I want you to know that you are the key to our success. You&apos;re going to be able to find a job because there&apos;s going to be a great advantage for the skills you&apos;re learning. So you should all be extraordinarily proud of the work you&apos;re doing.&quot;  The United Nations event was a bit more sober&#x2014;the new U.S. Mission was named after former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown who died in a plane crash during a trade mission&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Obama-helps-dedicate-Ron-Brown-building-in-NYC-1313398.php#ixzz1I5tRrhZ3">Obama saluted Brown as a trailblazer</a>, &quot;He lived that American creed that if you work hard enough, if you&apos;re willing to put your shoulders to the wheel, there is nothing you cannot do.&quot;</p>

<p>In Harlem, Obama entered the Red Rooster (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/03/continuing-coverage-president-obama-makes-the-rounds-in-nyc-before-arriving-at">here&apos;s the menu</a>, foodies) through a back alley and then through the restaurant&apos;s kitchen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/29/2011-03-29_obama_cheered_in_new_york_during_visit_to_un_with_bill_clinton_ahead_of_pricey_f.html">to a standing ovation</a>.  He mentioned the Japanese earthquake and the U.S.&apos;s role in Libya saying, it&apos;s &quot;a day we&apos;re thinking about our troops overseas... This is a challenging time... I could not do what I do, making the best possible decisions I can for American people, without knowing that I had so many people rooting for me.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185921/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/us/politics/30obama.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Neither the White House nor the Democratic National Committee identified attendees who were giving the maximum allowed by federal law. The group was expected to include not only wealthy African-Americans but also a fair number of the usual Democratic donors from Wall Street&#x2019;s largely white male ranks &#x2014; a group that Mr. Obama has alienated by his administration&#x2019;s efforts to tighten government regulations after industry abuses contributed to the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008.&quot;  </p>

<p>The night ended with a private reception at the Studio Museum of Harlem where President Obama met with past Democratic donors.</p>
