<p>The police are looking for suspects in the beating, which they consider a hate crime.  Sucuzhanay and his brother had been walking near Kossuth Place and Bushwick Avenue&#x2014;arm in arm because they were drunk&#x2014;when a SUV pulled up.  The vehicle&apos;s passengers yelled anti-gay and anti-Hispanic epithets at them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427000732/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/12/13/2008-12-13_victim_in_hate_assault_jose_sucuzhanay_h.html">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The attackers jumped out of the car and smashed a beer bottle over Jose Sucuzhanay&#x2019;s head, hit him in the head with an aluminum baseball bat and kicked him...
