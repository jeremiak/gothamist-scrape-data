<p>Mayor Bloomberg is gearing up for this Sunday&apos;s tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks by heralding downtown&apos;s turnaround.  At an Association for a Better New York breakfast this morning, he proclaimed, &quot;As we look back on the past decade, and as the picture of what has happened here comes into sharper focus, I believe the re-birth and revitalization of Lower Manhattan will be remembered as one of the greatest comeback stories in American history. And I believe it will stand as our greatest moment to those we lost on 9/11 and to our unshakeable faith in the moral imperative of protecting and preserving a free, open, democratic society.&quot;</p>

<p>In his speech (which you can watch below; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011036/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr319-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">full text here</a>), he also made an effort to mark a new era for the once-devastated site, &quot;We will never forget the devastation of the area that came to be known as &#x2018;Ground Zero.&#x2019; Never. But the time has come to call those 16 acres what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11th Memorial and Museum.&quot;</p>
