<p>Mayor Bloomberg is sticking to his story that he won&apos;t run for President in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160114060614/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/11/more_speculation_about_bloomberg_20.php">2012</a>.  During a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160114060614/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/10/bloomberg_to_give_presidential_lect.php">&quot;presidential lecture&quot;</a> at his girlfriend Diana Taylor&apos;s alma mater, Dartmouth College (the &quot;presidential&quot; refers to Dartmouth president Jim Yong Kim), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160114060614/http://wbztv.com/wireapnewsnh/In.Dartmouth.lecture.2.1809104.html">he explained</a>&#x2014;jokingly&#x2014;that his positions &quot;[cut] off half the country...<strong> I&apos;m pro-choice. I&apos;m pro-gay rights. I&apos;m pro-immigration. I&apos;m against guns. I believe in Darwin. </strong>It&apos;s down to Diana, my mother and me left, and I&apos;m not sure about my mother.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he emphasized, &quot;No, I&apos;m not running. Make that clear,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160114060614/http://thedartmouth.com/2010/07/16/news/bloomberg">and  said</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m gainfully employed. I&#x2019;ve made a commitment [to serving as mayor] for the next 1,263 days... Arguably being the mayor of New York is the best political job in the world. We have our own foreign policy, I&#x2019;ve got the eighth biggest army in the NYPD, we&#x2019;ve got a budget that&#x2019;s bigger than most countries&#x2019; GNP.&quot; </p>

<p>However, Bloomberg also discussed the White House during a Q&amp;A;:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160114060614/http://thedartmouth.com/2010/07/16/news/bloomberg"> The Dartmouth reports</a> that he spoke of expanding the power of the executive branch, &quot;The President [of the United States] can impose, the President can cajole, the President can influence. But it&#x2019;s Congress that writes the legislation. The public&#x2019;s safeguard is every four years at the ballot box.&quot;</p>
