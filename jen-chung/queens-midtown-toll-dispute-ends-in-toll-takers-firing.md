<p>The drama happened last year, when a driver hand crumbled bills to Bridge &amp; Tunnels officer Daniel Bell.  Bell refused them, saying the driver, FBI agent Wilfred Rattigan, had to straight them himself.  Rattigan asked to see a supervisor, so Bell asked for his boss to come. Then the fed &quot;perfectly unfolded the bills to pay the $4.50 toll.&quot;  Bell claimed he had to wait for the supervisor, and then the incident got ugly.  From the Post: </p><blockquote>The agent then reached under his seat and pulled a black bag onto his lap. Bell, 38, asked what was inside the bag, and Rattigan responded, &quot;A weapon - and here is my identification,&quot; according to hearing documents.<p></p>

<p>The toll collector then ordered Rattigan to take his hands out of the bag, but Rattigan continued to pull out his ID.</p>

<p>Bell drew his pistol and ordered everyone in the car to place their hands on the dashboard or the seat in front of them.</p></blockquote>A number of other officers descended on Rattigan&apos;s car with their guns drawn!  Rattigan was able to leave when it was confirmed he was an FBI agent, but naturally he filed a complaint with the MTA.  <p></p>

<p>Bell, who had a number of rudeness complaints against him, was ultimately fired.  Though a judge found he was justified in drawing his gun, she believed Bell should have accepted his Rattigan&apos;s money.  Bell is currently appealing the decision.  As for Rattigan, the Post reports he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831084508/http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2003/07/arabmuslim-lawsuits-v-the-fbi.html">sued the FBI in 2004</a>, &quot;claiming that the bureau discriminated against him after he converted to Islam and that it failed to provide him with the resources to investigate terrorism properly after 9/11.&quot;</p>
