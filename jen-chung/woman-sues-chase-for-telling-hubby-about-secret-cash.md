                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_chasebank.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074702im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_chasebank.jpg" width="130" height="113" class="image-right"> </span>A Chase bank employee is being blamed for dropping the dime about a Long Island dentist&apos;s $800,000 individual account to her husband.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074702/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04272009/news/regionalnews/wife_avings_suit_166397.htm">NY Post reports</a> that while Nazita Aminpour and David Shamash &quot;have a joint account at a Chase branch in Kew Gardens, Queens,&quot; Aminpour also had the secret account.  Well, secret until a bank employee cold-called Shamash, <strong>&quot;telling him he should take his small fortune out of the low-interest account and make other investments with Chase.</strong>&quot; Aminipour&apos;s suit says that once Shamash heard about the money, he &quot;began harassing [Aminpour], asking for money from the funds that he can invest in the stock market and to cover a margin call he had on his stock account.&quot; The suit adds that Shamash &quot;alienat[ed]&quot; Aminipour until she gave him $155,000 &quot;to save her marriage and restore order in the marital home.&quot;  Aminipour says Chase violated non-disclosure laws and wants the bank to pay her the $155K plus legal fees.  </p>
