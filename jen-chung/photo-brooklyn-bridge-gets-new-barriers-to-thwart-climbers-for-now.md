<p>After two high-profile and embarrassing incidents where people scaled the Brooklyn Bridge&apos;s cables and climbed to the towers, the city is trying to make sure thrill-seekers get their kicks another way. A reader just sent us this photo of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006212813/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/29/nypd_bridges.php">new barriers</a> (seen on the left), which the Department of Transportation has placed next to the entrances.</p>

<p>On July 22nd, the American flags atop the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006212813/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/surrender_brooklyn_mysterious_white.php">two towers were replaced with white flags</a> (thankfully not a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006212813/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/23/this_time_it_was_a_flag_next_time_i.php">bomb or a comb</a>) by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006212813/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/12/german_brooklyn_bridge_flag.php">some German artists</a>. Then on August 24th, a Russian tourist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006212813/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/24/video_man_arrested_for_mid-day_stro.php">decided to walk up to a tower</a>. He wanted to take a selfie, but he got arrested.</p>
