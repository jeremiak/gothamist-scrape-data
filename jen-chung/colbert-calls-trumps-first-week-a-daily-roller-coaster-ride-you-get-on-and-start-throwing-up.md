<p>Last night, Stephen Colbert returned to <em>The Late Show</em> after a week-long break. &quot;You ever regret going on vacation?&quot; he asked. &quot;&apos;Take the week off,&apos; they said. &apos;America will still be here when you get back,&apos; they said. &apos;How much could he do in a week?&quot; </p>

<p>Pointing out that many people said not to worry too much and &quot;let&apos;s wait and see,&quot; Colbert summed up America&apos;s current situation thus: &quot;The line moves really fast on this ride. Every day, you just get back on the roller coaster and start throwing up.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he added, &quot;You&apos;ve got to give the guy credit &#x2014; he can really get a lot of things undone. From ObamaCare to climate change to torture, he&apos;s already moved the country back to 2004. If this keeps up, pretty soon I&apos;m going to launch <em>The Colbert Report</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>The monologue was both humorous and searing. Colbert referenced the five-year-old Iranian boy who was detained for hours, &quot;or as Kellyanne Conway calls it, alternative daycare.&quot; Explaining why there were tens of thousands of people protesting at airports, &quot;this would be upsetting if you were one of the people who thought about it...&quot;</p>

<p>And about the airport protests, Colbert quipped, &quot;Do you understand how angry people have to be to VOLUNTARILY go to JFK?&quot;  </p>

<p>Colbert was also perplexed by Bannon&apos;s appointment to the regular principals meetings of the National Security Council&#x2014;and the explanation that he had been &quot;in the Navy.&quot; &quot;Great, in the Navy,&quot; Colbert said. &quot;Now we just need to add the construction worker, the leather man, and the Indian chief and hold the meetings at the YMCA. Mike Pence is not going to like that part.&quot;</p>

<p>On the <em>Daily Show</em>, Trevor Noah and Hasan Minhaj discussed the ban. Minhaj, who is Muslim, said, &quot;In the past, America has had lots of issues with Muslims and immigration, but Trump is taking this thing to a whole new level. Other presidents were just dipping their toes in the pool, but Trump straight-up did a cannonball and then felt up the lifeguard.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tonight at 11/10c, Trevor and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303080054/https://twitter.com/hasanminhaj">@hasanminhaj</a> discuss Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303080054/https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBan?src=hash">#MuslimBan</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303080054/https://t.co/kmlMKhjZLt">pic.twitter.com/kmlMKhjZLt</a></p>&#x2014; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303080054/https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/826248658366533632">January 31, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>When Noah remind Minhaj that he&apos;s an American citizen, so the ban doesn&apos;t affect him, Minhaj exclaimed, &quot;YET! We&apos;re on day 11, man! That&apos;s it, where do you think this is going to go? It&apos;s like watching the first episode of <em>Breaking Bad</em> thinking, &apos;Oh, it&apos;s just a science teacher cooking meth. It can&apos;t get any crazier.&apos; But it does!&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303080054/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/31/seth_meyers_trump_clip.php">Seth Meyers used <em>Late Night</em> to describe</a> Trump&apos;s administration as a &quot;government of incompetent authoritarians with nothing but contempt for many of the very basic constitutional principals this country has cherished since its founding.&quot;</p>
