A prosecutor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121644/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ex-nypd-confesses-killing-wife-cops-article-1.1763182">said that Canty told a detective</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry... I love my wife. She was cheating on me and she&apos;s a whore.&quot;<p></p>

They were in the street screaming &apos;please, please help!&apos; They were banging on the cars.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121644/http://nypost.com/2014/04/20/former-cop-shot-wife-10-times-as-their-two-kids-watched-officials/">Jessica Canty was shot 10 times</a>: &quot;[O]nce in the stomach, twice in her right arm, three times in her chest and four times in her right armpit.&quot;</p>

He tried to claim the car was his.

<p>Neighbors described the couple&apos;s relationship as tumultuous. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121644/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/young-woman-fatally-shot-queens-article-1.1762031">One said</a>, &quot;He told more than one person&#x2014;&apos;I&apos;m gonna kill this bitch one day.&apos;&quot;</p>
