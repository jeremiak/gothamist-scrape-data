<p>The 60-foot long mural and a second replacement mural by artist Kenny Scharf have been stolen from an East Harlem park&#x2014;and now police have video of a suspect in the second theft. </p>

<p>The banner, called NEVERENDINGOGO, was commissioned specifically for the East River Park by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828012432/http://www.esplanadefriends.org/">Friends of the East River Esplanade</a>, and placed at East 116th Street. According to the NYPD, at about 8 p.m. on August 20, &quot;the suspect took a banner with artwork on it from off a fence, placed it in a small sport utility vehicle and fled northbound on the FDR Drive.&quot;</p>

<p>The male suspect is described as being 25-35 years old and was last seen wearing a multi-colored T-shirt (it looks like a tie-dye), black shorts and black sandals. He was accompanied with a female with blond hair who was not captured on video. </p>

<p>Police say their car was a black or gray Honda Element.</p>

<p>The first mural was installed on June 22, but was stolen a few days later. Jennifer Ratner of Friends of the East River Esplanade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828012432/http://pagesix.com/2016/06/27/2000-kenny-scharf-mural-stolen-in-east-harlem/">told Page Six</a>, &#x201C;It was attached by steel ties by a professional installer.&quot; She believed the thieves &quot;had to come with wire cutters and, I&#x2019;m assuming, a ladder. There were dozens of ties.&quot; </p>

<p>The replacement mural&#x2014;at the cost of $2,000 (which makes this a grand larceny)&#x2014;was made and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828012432/http://pagesix.com/2016/08/21/2000-kenny-scharf-mural-stolen-again/">installed in July</a>, apparently with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828012432/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160712/east-harlem/new-kenny-scharf-mural-worth-2k-replaces-one-that-was-stolen">more &quot;security&quot; in consideration</a>. But after this one was stolen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828012432/http://patch.com/new-york/harlem/east-harlem-art-installation-woth-thousands-stolen-second-time">Ratner admitted to Patch</a>, &quot;We tried really hard, but I can&apos;t say we will do it again.&quot;</p>

<p>Scharf also painted faces on a brick column near the banner; the column is presumably too heavy to move.</p>
