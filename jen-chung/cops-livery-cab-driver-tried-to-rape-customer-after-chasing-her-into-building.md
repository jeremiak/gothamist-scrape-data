<p>The police are looking for a livery cab driver who allegedly tried to rape a customer, and police have released a video of the driver chasing her into her Astoria building.  </p>

<p>Last Friday, July 13, at 1:35 a.m., the 20-year-old passenger had left the cab and sat on front stoop of a building near 30th Street and 34th Avenue in Queens. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164141/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Livery-Cab-Driver-Rape-Attempt-Passenger-Astoria-Queens-Video-162789056.html">According to NBC New York</a>, &quot;he driver rounded the block twice, then stopped and asked her to join him for a drink, according to a law enforcement source. When she refused, he chased her into her building.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver got into the vestibule, grabbed her from behind, and attempted to rape her.&#xA0; The victim was able to break free during the struggle. The driver fled the scene and the victim was treated for minor injuries.</p>

<p>Police describe the suspect as a Hispanic male, 20-25 years old, 5&apos;4&quot; and 150 lbs, last seen wearing a black shirt with dark pants and frameless eye glasses.  Cops also say he was driving a light-colored Lincoln Town Car.</p>

(p.s. no reflection on this individual case, which has a different fact pattern than most i&apos;ve seen as a former prosecutor)&quot;</p>
