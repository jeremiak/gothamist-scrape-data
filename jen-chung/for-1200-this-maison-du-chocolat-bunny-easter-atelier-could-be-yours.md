<p>Have you been looking for a decadent chocolate Easter display that costs about a month&apos;s rent? Of course you are&#x2014;so look no further than the amazing &quot;Easter Aterlier&quot; from Maison du Chocolat!</p>

<p>Look at those adorable bunny rabbits made out of milk, white and dark chocolate! Plus the atelier is all chocolate too&#x2014;the cabinets are white and dark chocolate, the floor tiles are milk chocolate, miniature pastries in colored white chocolate and dark chocolate and the spoon is dark and milk chocolate. There are also praline eggs! Here is the company&apos;s description:</p><blockquote>To celebrate Easter 2014, Nicolas Cloiseau, Master Chef of La Maison du Chocolat has crafted a magical chocolate atelier run by playful Easter bunnies.<p></p>

<p>Turning upside down the world of sculpted chocolate, in Cloiseau&#x2019;s childlike vision, mischievous bunnies rub elbows with a delectable assortment of colossal chocolate<br>
pastries, &#xE9;clairs and macarons. The scene is brimming with many cherished signature pieces: the pastry rolling pin, a symbol of the timeless cakes of La Maison du Chocolat, the impeccable chef&#x2019;s apron, stretched wide around the waist of an egg, colorful macarons, filled with signature chocolate ganache.</p>

<p>The happy, wide-eyed bunnies, with candid expressions, and smiles that reach from ear to ear, are ready to work, with gigantic spoons for arms, and their long ears, cheekily peeking through crisp white chef toques.</p></blockquote>The atelier measures L 17.3 in x W 12.2 in x H 10.6 in and weighs 11 pounds. That&apos;s over $109 per pound&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914164057/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/04/brooklyn_rents_cant_stop_wont_stop.php">perfect for contemplating your rent increase</a>.<p></p>

<p>There is only ONE Easter Atelier in the U.S. So act now or else you&apos;ll have to eat whatever Russell Stover bunny is left in the CVS aisle.</p>
