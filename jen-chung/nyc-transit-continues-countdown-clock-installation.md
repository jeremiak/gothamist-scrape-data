</div></div>					<p>Over the past week, NYC Transit has been posting photographs of the countdown clocks&#x2014;or PA/CIS system&#x2014;in some IRT train stations, which will help customers know how much longer they&apos;ll have to wait for the train. Remember, MTA Chairman Jay Walder thinks they&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522062948/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/08/are_subway_riders_down_with_countdo.php">take some of the angst out </a>of your commutes!  The MTA believes that all 152 IRT stations (not including 7) will be activated by 2011, while 75 will be activated by year&apos;s end. There is no schedule, because as the NYC Transit answered one rider&apos;s query about when countdown clocks would be installed at Grand Central-42nd Street and 23rd Street on the 6 line via Twitter, &quot;Don&apos;t have schedule; activations based on stability of platform in a given zone.&quot;</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, NYC Transit spokesman Paul Fleuranges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522062948/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/13/countdown_clocks_spreading_in_brook.php">explained that the rollout depended on testing</a>...and that the investment was made years ago, so there&apos;s no turning back!  </p>
