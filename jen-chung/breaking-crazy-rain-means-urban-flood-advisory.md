<p>The National Weather Service just issued an &quot;URBAN FLOOD ADVISORY&quot; for NYC (except Staten Island) until 11:30 a.m., noting that thunderstorms in the area may produce 1.5 inches of rain/hour and will cause street and highway flooding.  And maybe subway flooding? Yikes.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: While the storm seems to be over, there&apos;s a bit of flooding in certain areas, namely the FDR Drive.  Some vehicles are disabled due to a foot of water on the road!</p>
