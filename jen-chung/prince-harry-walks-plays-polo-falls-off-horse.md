</div></div><p>Prince Harry wrapped up his trip to the States by joining in a Central Park race with the Achilles running group and by playing in a charity polo match at Governors Island, where there was a momentary scare when he fell off a horse (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://www.etonline.com/news/2010/06/88657/">video</a>). But that didn&apos;t attract from his appeal:  One 50-year-old polo spectator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/the_royal_thrown_fCtvYoTJ9b2bYIRpaMl3TK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz0sBeIyMix">told the Post</a>, &quot;I thought he looked gorgeous. He looked so sexy -- even more so when he fell off the horse. What could be better in a man? He does not look injured. Looks like he was on an unfamiliar horse.&quot;  Yeah, blame the horse!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://www.achillesinternational.org/">Achilles International</a>, which works with disabled runners, has a group that trains and sponsors injured veterans participate in races.  The 25-year-old prince<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/27/2010-06-27_prince_harry_races_in_central_park_as_part_of_achilles_hope_and_possibility_race.html">joined the participants in a 1.77 mile</a> course. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/27/2010-06-27_prince_harry_races_in_central_park_as_part_of_achilles_hope_and_possibility_race.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Afghanistan veteran Marine Corporal Todd Nicely, who lost both legs and much of both arms in March when he stepped on an IED, said having the prince there with him made his first race after being injured even more meaningful.&quot; Nicely said, &quot;He seemed really interested, and asked a lot of questions. I made a joke that we should stop and get some ice cream.&quot;</p>

<p>Over at Governors Island, Prince Harry faced against Nacho Figueras&apos;s Black Watch team in a polo match that benefited the prince&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://www.sentebale.org/">Sentebale Fondation</a> with a fancy crowd (Ivanka Trump! Mayor Bloomberg! Val Kilmer!) on hand.  Prince Harry&apos;s team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128101736">lost to Black Watch, 6-5</a>, but the day was about supporting the charity, which helps children in Lesotho, many of whom are orphaned from the AIDS crisis.  The prince said that the U.S. has always protected the downtrodden, the poorest, those most in need of help in the world. And to me, this is what the United States stands for.&quot;</p>

<p>On Friday, Prince Harry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/26/prince_harry_joins_west_point_cadet.php">visited West Point and the Intrepid</a> and, on Saturday, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081457/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/27/prince_harrys_mets_game_pitch_barel.php">threw out the ceremonial first pitch</a> at the Mets game, visited UNICEF, and held another fundraiser.</p>
