<p>A worker making a food delivery to a Bronx apartment building earlier this month was viciously attacked by two people who took his cellphone and money. Police are still searching for the two robbery suspects, and the NYPD now is hoping the public can help track them down.</p>

<p>The incident occurred just before 11 p.m. on February 2nd, when the 21-year-old delivery man went to 2802 Olinville Avenue. Video released by the NYPD shows a man and woman confront the victim soon after he enters the lobby, first shoving and then punching and kicking him.    </p>
