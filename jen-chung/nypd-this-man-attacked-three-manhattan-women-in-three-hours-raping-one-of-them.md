<p>Police are searching for a man accused of a terrifying series of assaults on women Thursday morning. All the attacks occurred in lower Manhattan, between 5:40 a.m. and 8:45 a.m.: One woman was robbed and nearly raped, another was robbed and a third was raped.</p>

<p>The NYPD says the first incident occurred when the man followed a 33-year-old woman into her building on James Street, just two short blocks from NYPD Headquarters. Once they were inside, the man allegedly grabbed the woman and tried to rape and rob her. But she fought him off, and he fled the location. She was uninjured.<br>
 <br>
Two hours later, at 7:40 a.m., police say the same man followed a 24-year-old woman into her Broome Street building, grabbed her by the shoulders and ripped her I.D. from her hand. She screamed, and he fled. No injuries were reported.</p>

<p>At 8:45 a.m., the man approached a third woman, age 40, as she entered her Lower East Side apartment on FDR Drive. Police say he emerged from the stairwell as she was opening her door, and he tried to &quot;engage her in conversation.&quot; As they spoke, he forced her into her apartment and raped her. He fled the scene and remains at large. The victim was treated and released at an area hospital. <br>
 <br>
Police released surveillance video of the suspect from the third incident; he is described as being in his mid-twenties to mid-thirties and 5&apos;9&quot; to 5&apos;10&quot; tall.</p>
