<p>The police are hoping the public can help them find two suspects accused of assaulting a 72-year-old man walking down a West Village street yesterday afternoon. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, it happened at 5:29 p.m. on August 11th: Security camera video shows a male standing in front of 99 Jane Street, with his back turned to an elderly man walking toward him. When the 72-year-old steps behind him, the male suspect abruptly turns and sucker-punches the old man, sending him falling onto the ground.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to a hospital for lacerations and pain to his head and face. Police say the victim fled the scene, along with a second suspect who was waiting across the street. </p>

<p>The police describe the suspects as two black males in their early 20s. The surveillance footage shows the first suspect. </p>

<p>This assault seems to resemble a pattern of attacks from last year described as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503163937/http://gothamist.com/tags/knockoutgame">&quot;knockout game,&quot;</a> in which participants sucker-punch unsuspecting victims. It&apos;s unclear from the NYPD&apos;s press release whether investigators believe this attack fits a broader pattern of &quot;knockout game&quot; attacks (former Police Commissioner Kelly has previously said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503163937/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/video_nypd_investigating_knockout_s.php">it was unclear if it even was a pattern</a>).</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503163937/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.<br>
