<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203081919/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/47-year-old-man-left-fighting-life-hit-and-run-driver-mows-sunset-park-brooklyn-article-1.1015773?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News</a>, The driver ignored passerby&#x2019;s pleas to stop after barreling into the man... The impact was so hard it sent the man up in the air about 15-20 feet,&quot; a witness said. The witness, who called 911, screamed for the driver to stop but the car kept going.  </p>

<p>The driver then apparently hit other cars&#x2014;a witness told WCBS 2, &#x201C;I heard a squeak so I quickly picked my head up and I see a car on the sidewalk and I said &#x2018;what the hell&#x2019; and just smashed into another two cars and drove off&quot;&#x2014;before being abandoned.  Investigators found the damaged vehicles without its license plates in Borough Park.</p>

<p>The victim is reportedly fighting for his life after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203081919/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8527923">suffering head trauma</a>. </p>
