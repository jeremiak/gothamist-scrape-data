<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421133110/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9128982">According to WABC 7</a>, Sherlon Smikle, 33, actually had his service weapon taken away from him and was reassigned a few weeks ago, due to a domestic dispute with his wife, Lana Morris, 46, who worked as a school safety agent. Last night on  Camden Avenue in the St Albans section of Queens, Smikle shot Morris four times on the sidewalk, according to witnesses. </p>

<p>Neighbors rushed to help Morris;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421133110/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-nypd-shoots-wife-death-kills-article-1.1364543"> one said</a>, &quot;There were shell casings all over the ground. She was laying by the side of the curb.&quot; Morris was pronounced dead at Queens General Hospital.</p>

<p>Smikle&apos;s body was found inside the house, with a gunshot wound. A gun, reportedly a shotgun (and not a police-issued gun), was also found inside the house. The couple reportedly had an 8-year-old child.</p>

<p><em>If someone you know exhibits warning signs of suicide: do not leave the person alone, remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt, and call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.</em></p>
