Police say that real estate attorney William Parente asphyxiated his family before killing himself and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055025/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-lidead2312682066apr22,0,6146622.story">Newsday reports</a> that the FBI has &quot;opened an investigation into [his] financial dealings.&quot;</p>

<p>The Parente family was visiting their eldest daughter, Stephanie, 19, a student at Loyola College.  The entire family was seen eating breakfast together on Sunday morning.  According to the Baltimore Sun, sometime after that, Parente killed wife Betty, 58, by beating her and then choking her.  &quot;At a later point, he killed his 11-year-old daughter,&quot; Catherine and then, &quot;apparently sometime late Sunday afternoon, the 19-year-old daughter arrived at the hotel room and was killed.&quot;  Then Parente committed suicide by cutting himself.</p>

<p>A Loyola classmate of Stephanie&apos;s called the police on Sunday night, worried that she hadn&apos;t returned.  Hotel employees found the family in the room; the Sun also reports, &quot;The bodies of the wife and daughters apparently had been moved after the killings and were found lined up on a king-sized bed, police said... Police said they believe Parente used one or more of several objects recovered from the room to beat his wife and daughters.&quot;</p>

<p>The NY State Attorney General&apos;s office had received a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055025/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-limont2212679223apr21,0,4934814.story">complaint from Queens lawyer Bruce Montague over Parente&apos;s investing practices</a>.  Montague had invested almost $450,000 with Parente in high-risk, high-returns investments but, after the Madoff Ponzi scheme scandal, decided to take his money out. Parente&apos;s two checks to Montague bounced on Tuesday. The AG&apos;s office hasn&apos;t started a formal investigation.</p>

<p>The Parentes&apos; friends and neighbors are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055025/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-limass2312682079apr22,0,2055826.story">shocked by the murder-suicide</a>.  Betty Parente was on the board of the Tri-town Auxilliary of the United Cerebral Palsy of Nassau County and volunteered the American Cancer Society and Girl Scouts. Stephanie Parente was a sophomore majoring in speech pathology at Loyola and volunteered at Habitat for Humanity and a school in Maryland while Catherine Parente was a sixth grader who played basketball, soccer and lacrosse.</p>
