					<p>The &quot;Fearless Girl&quot; statue, a bold stand for corporate feminism/P.R. stunt by an investment firm and advertising agency is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fearlessgirl/">killing it on Instagram</a> as she stands across from the famed &quot;Charging Bull&quot; statue in Manhattan&apos;s Financial District. However, she may need to find a place to defiantly stand if the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/blaz_bullish_on_fearless_girl.php">ends up keeping her around</a>.</p>

<p>The statue, created by Kristen Visbal, was placed in Bowling Green, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/bowling-green/monuments/1750">across from the &quot;Charging Bull&quot;</a>, by State Street Global Advisors, to promote the idea that more women should be on corporate boards. Though there are only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/03/08/there-bull-message-behind-fearless-girl-statue/yb5MtonhyQwkXrGFqkfnnN/story.html">three women on State Street&apos;s 11-person board</a> and their top executive ranks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/too-bad-that-statue-of-a-girl-staring-down-the-wall-street-bull-is-a-pr-stunt-by-wall-street-patriarchs-9749317">feature 20-30% women</a>, local New York politicians like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/14/fearless_girl_statue_charging_bull.php">Public Advocate Letitia James</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-maloney-and-women-leaders-call-for-fearless-girl-statue-to-become">Representative Carolyn Maloney</a> want to make the statue a permanent fixture.</p>

<p>The sculptor of the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://chargingbull.com/chargingbull.html">Charging Bull</a>,&quot; Arturo Di Modica, wasn&apos;t impressed with the new statue, calling it a publicity grab versus being art. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/charging-bull-artist-girl-statue-advertising-trick-article-1.3003271">From the Daily News</a>:</p><blockquote>Di Modica said his bull &#x2014; which he paid for with his money &#x2014; was made for everyone.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I did it for all the American people,&#x201D; he fumed during a phone interview from his Church Street art studio. &#x201C;Not designed for men, women or gay.&#x201D;...</p>

<p>&#x201C;[State Street] took advantage,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not right! They are insulting all the American people and me and my work.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The bull was also never supposed to have a permanent residence near Wall St. Di Modica spent $350,000 out of pocket, then put the sculpture right by the New York Stock Exchange in December 1989. He never obtained a permit, and the art was later shipped off to Queens.</p>

<p>But city officials changed their minds and moved it to the current spot.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I put it there for art,&quot; he told MarketWatch, which first reported his opposition to the new installation. &#x201C;My bull is a symbol for America. My bull is a symbol of prosperity and for strength.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Women, girls, that&#x2019;s great, but that&#x2019;s not what that (my sculpture) is,&#x201D; he adde.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://nypost.com/2017/03/24/fearless-girl-may-get-a-new-nyc-home/">Now the Post reports</a>, &quot;A high-level officer from State Street Global Advisors, which commissioned the work, met on Friday with... Di Modica, who is threatening to sue the company for copyright infringement if it&#x2019;s not moved after April 2, according to sources. Di Modica has already made State Street take down photographs that include his statue on the company&#x2019;s site.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio said last week that he&apos;d be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/blaz_bullish_on_fearless_girl.php">open to extending the permit for &quot;Fearless Girl&quot;</a> past the current April 2 end date. For those of you who are interested in a statue saluting an actual New York City woman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328162733/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/fearless_women_statues.php#photo-1">we have some suggestions</a>.</p>
