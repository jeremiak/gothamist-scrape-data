Why, just recently, this young lady made good on her bid to offer her body (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153500/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/17/jeremy_lin_linterested_in_getting_c.php">we hope she&apos;s Christian!</a>) to the new Knicks star with this media-friendly sign, &quot;Jeremy, I Want You LINside Me.&quot;  This brings up the real question: Has Jeremy Lin jumped the shark?<p></p>

<p>NY Post columnist Andrea Peyser confesses, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153500/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/good_guy_knick_hero_linfectious_QFsSNsS6NLZKD7j2dHlNCO#ixzz1mvslDWR2">I&#x2019;ve caught a wicked case of Linphomania</a>.&quot;  She notes: </p><blockquote>Here&#x2019;s something you may not know about Lin, the new Knick powerhouse and humble human who burns up the court while giving recession-battered New Yorkers, devout Christians, single women (guys, too) and wonky nerds something to shout about:<p></p>

<p>He&#x2019;s short. The point guard stands four inches below the average NBA player, and is fully 15 inches shorter than retired Chinese basketball mountain Yao Ming. Still, at 6-foot-3 in stocking feet, with 5-foot-6 parents, there&#x2019;s no telling where he came from.</p></blockquote> OMG, she&apos;s delving into NBA stats and genetics!  (FWIW, Jason Kidd, the great Dallas Mavericks point guard, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153500/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jason_kidd/">is 6&apos;4&quot;</a> so 6&apos;3&quot; really isn&apos;t short for that position.) Peyser is a little worried, though, &quot;I hope success doesn&#x2019;t destroy Jeremy Lin, a true American original. Of course, Lin is leaving his brother&#x2019;s downtown couch and renting a place in sleepy White Plains. This guy can&#x2019;t get into trouble if he tries.&quot; Keep in mind, this is coming from a woman who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153500/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/andrea_peyser_still_doesnt_understa.php">doesn&apos;t understand why someone should be punished for killing a pet</a>.<p></p>

<p>Lin himself is trying to tamp down the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153500/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-guard-jeremy-lin-plea-taiwanese-media-respect-family-privacy-article-1.1025533?localLinksEnabled=false">over-the-top lintiest in his family in Taiwan</a>: He said <br>
&quot;The special request I have is for the media back in Taiwan to give (my family) space, because they can&#x2019;t even go to work without being bombarded, without people following them. I want people to respect their privacy.&quot; His grandmother is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153500/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/sports/basketball/jeremy-lins-grandmother-watches-along-with-taiwan.html">totally being hounded by the paparazzi</a>!</p>
