                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_mrsmet.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818075913im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_mrsmet.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Mrs. Met on July 3 (Mets)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After the speculation about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818075913/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/27/photo_is_mrs_met_mr_mets_wife_mothe.php">reappearance of Mrs. Met last month</a>, the Mets officially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818075913/https://twitter.com/Mets/status/352616948795854848/photo/1">welcomed her back on July 3</a>. </p>

<p>According to the Post, the Mets issued a statement explaining, &quot;Mrs. Met has been busy taking care of her family at home in Flushing, Queens, and working part-time as an event planner. She is the newest member of our team.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mets Police&apos;s Shannon Shark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818075913/http://metspolice.com/2013/06/26/breaking-mrs-met-costume-appeared/">had noticed Mrs. Met initially</a> and asked sports fan Paul Lukas (who interviewed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818075913/http://www.uni-watch.com/2011/06/14/an-interview-with-a-former-mlb-mascot/">original Mrs. Met Lynn Farrell</a>) about the new incarnation of Mr. Met&apos;s better half:</p><blockquote>SS: what do you think about Mrs. Met wearing a different uniform than Mister? I like it. I hate when my wife makes us dress alike.<p></p>

<p>PL: Agreed! She should get to have her own style.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Sadly, not everyone remembers Mrs. Met. Rusty Staub told the Post, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know anything about a Mrs. Met. Mr. Met, everyone knew him, but I don&#x2019;t recall anything relating to a Mrs. Met.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818075913/http://metsblog.com/metsblog/the-return-of-mrs-met/">was at Thursday&apos;s game too</a>&#x2014;she&apos;ll probably be at Citi Field for the All-Star Game! Hope she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818075913/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/mets-ace-amazin-espn-magazine-body-issue-article-1.1391872?localLinksEnabled=false">caught this issue of ESPN magazine</a>.</p>
