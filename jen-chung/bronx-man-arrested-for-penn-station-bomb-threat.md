<p>Yesterday, police arrested a 19-year-old Bronx man for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140711/http://manhattan.ny1.com/content/top_stories/126688/sources--bronx-teen-threatened-to-blow-up-penn-station">allegedly threatening to blow up</a> Penn Station and other transit hubs.  And it turns out Jonathan Avalos is no stranger to the NYPD or making threats: He was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140711/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/22/memo_to_teens_making_crank_calls.php">arrested last year</a> for threatening to kill President Obama and Police Commissioner Kelly.  </p>

<p>Between Sunday and Tuesday, Avalos allegedly made four calls to the Port Authority tip line: NY1 reports, &quot;During the calls, sources say Avalos said he was going to set off a grenade in Manhattan&apos;s Penn Station. He also allegedly threaten to blow up Newark Penn Station and the 175th Street station of the A Train.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140711/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/06/2010-10-06_jonathan_avalos_who_threatened_to_kill_obama_and_commish_kelly_busted_over_penn_.html#ixzz11g68Hsf5">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;An investigator called him Tuesday night, and police paid a visit to his Bronx home, but he wasn&apos;t home. Avalos called back Wednesday, and said he was planning to detonate the explosives by the end of the day.&quot; </p>

<p>The Port Authority&apos;s investigators convinced him to meet them near Yankee Stadium, where he was arrested. Avalos was charged with four counts of aggravated harassment.  </p>
