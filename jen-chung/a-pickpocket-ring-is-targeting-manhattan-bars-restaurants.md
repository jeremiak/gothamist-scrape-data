<p>Police are hoping the public can help them identify a trio of suspects wanted for a series of at least 13 grand larcenies in Manhattan. In each incident, the suspects take a victim&apos;s wallet, handbag, briefcase or laptop while it&apos;s unattended. </p>

<p>The NYPD has released images of the three suspects. The photos on the left are from a December 30, 2015 grand larceny that occurred at a bar at 65 West 54th Street (the Warwick Hotel) when a 40-year-old woman left her purse unattended. </p>
