										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2017_01_aamono1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021837im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_01_aamono1.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (NBC)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><em>Saturday Night Live</em> host Aziz Ansari addressed the pain of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021837/http://dcist.com/2017/01/donald_trump_inauguration_live.php">Donald Trump&apos;s new presidency</a> during his monologue, and elegantly, effectively and hilariously addressed fears and the new &quot;casual white supremacy&quot; that has emerged. Ansari referenced the women&apos;s marches all over the world, &quot;Yesterday, Trump was inaugurated. Today, an entire gender protested against him,&quot; and also added, &quot;Pretty cool to know, though, he&#x2019;s probably at home right now watching a brown guy make fun of him though, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Just as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021837/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/dave_chappelle_points_out_america_e.php#photo-1">Dave Chappelle helped put things in perspective</a> with his monologue during the <em>SNL</em> right after the election (of Trump&apos;s surprising win, given the polls, &quot;I know the whites, you guys aren&apos;t as full of surprises as you used to be&quot;), Ansari made some great points, like how Islam wouldn&apos;t seem so scary to people if &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; were the soundtrack to news stories about Muslims and how he really wants all these new racists&#x2014;the &quot;new, lower-case K.K.K. movement&quot;&#x2014;who have emerged to go back to pretending they aren&apos;t racist anymore. &quot;I&#x2019;m so sorry we never thanked you for your service. We never realized how much effort you were putting into the pretending. But you gotta go back to pretending.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021837/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/25/aziz_ansari_donald_trump_makes_me_a.php">Ansari wrote a NY Times op-ed</a> about how the possibility of President Trump was frightening to him, given that Trump would want to ban Muslims like Ansari&apos;s parents. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021837/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/arts/aziz-ansari-monologue-transcript-snl.html?_r=0">He said last night</a>:</p><blockquote>I&#x2019;m talking about these people that are running around saying stuff like, &#x201C;Trump won! Go back to Africa!&#x201D; &#x201C;Trump won! Go back to Mexico!&#x201D; They see me: &#x201C;Trump won, go back &#x2014; to where you came from.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Yeah. They&#x2019;re not usually geography buffs.</p>

<p>Is that the plan, by the way? We&#x2019;re all going to move? All the minorities? Forty-some percent of the country? Every minority&#x2019;s going to move?</p>

<p>Beyonc&#xE9;&#x2019;s going to move? Beyonc&#xE9; ain&#x2019;t moving.</p>

<p>I ain&#x2019;t moving. Okay? My parents moved from India to South Carolina in the early &#x2019;80s. They didn&#x2019;t move until nine years ago. You know where they moved? North Carolina. They love it here. They&#x2019;re not leaving.</p></blockquote>Suggesting that Trump make a &quot;real speech&quot; instead of Tweeting how much <em>SNL</em> sucked, Ansari referenced how President George W. Bush, after 9/11, managed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021837/https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010917-11.html">bring the country together in a speech</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021837/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liudIJFg8UQ">video</a>) by saying, &quot;Islam is peace.&quot; &quot;I was sitting there and I&#x2019;m watching this speech and I&#x2019;m like, &apos;What the hell has happened? I&#x2019;m sitting here wistfully watching old George W. Bush speeches?&apos;&quot; Ansari recalled. &quot;Just sitting there like, &apos;What a leader he was!&apos; Sixteen years ago, I was certain this dude was a dildo. Now, I&#x2019;m sitting there like, &apos;He guided us with his eloquence!&apos;&quot; <p></p>

<p>He ended, &quot;I want to leave you guys with a serious thought. I know there&#x2019;s a lot of people that are worried right now. This is a weird time. If you&#x2019;re excited about Trump, great. He&#x2019;s president. Let&#x2019;s hope he does a great job. If you&#x2019;re scared about Trump and you&#x2019;re very worried, you&#x2019;re going to be okay, too. Because if you look at our country&#x2019;s history, change doesn&#x2019;t come from presidents. Change comes from large groups of angry people. And if Day 1 is any indication, you are part of the largest group of angry people I have ever seen.&quot;</p>
