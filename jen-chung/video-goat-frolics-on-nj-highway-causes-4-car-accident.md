<p>How long does it take first responders to remove a goat from the Pulaski Skyway in NJ? About 90 minutes on a Tuesday morning. We learned all this today, when a rascally creature was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025852/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/05/goat_causes_accident_and_bring.html">&quot;hopping over the hoods of cars&quot;</a> and causing a four-car accident (luckily no one was injured).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025852/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/05/post_304.html">According to the Jersey Journal</a>, &quot;For nearly an hour, the goat&#x2014;named &apos;Sky&apos; by the Jersey City Police Department&apos;s Emergency Services Unit that helped capture her&#x2014;ambled back and forth between the Skyway ramps for Broadway and Tonnelle Avenue after police closed the roadway in both directions.&quot; ESU only captured the goat when she became tired.</p>

<p>Sky had a USDA tag in her ear, but no one has stepped forward to claim her. The Jersey Journal adds, &quot;An employee at American Halal Meats, a slaughter house on Raymond Boulevard in Newark, said that his company was not missing any goats. The employee, who said his company slaughters 150 goats a day, was relieved that this goat was not hurt.&quot; She&apos;s at a farm in Wantage, NJ now. If no one claims her, she&apos;ll stay there as a lucky goat.</p>
