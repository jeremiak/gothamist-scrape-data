---

	
										<p>Is the unofficial first rule of Mayor Bloomberg-Press Fight Club &quot;Don&apos;t ask Mayor Bloomberg about term limits&quot;?  That&apos;s what it seems like when you watch this video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083622/http://www.politickerny.com/3769/bloomberg-term-limits-state-economy">PolitickerNY&apos;s Azi Paybarah</a>. Bloomberg, at a press conference touting how the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083622/http://www.nyc.gov:80/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2009a%2Fpr241-09.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">received $32 million</a> in federal stimulus money for job training, said of the economy, &quot;<strong>I&#x2019;m reasonably optimistic that we&#x2019;ve turned the corner</strong>&quot; on the recession.  So Paybarah asked if, since the economy was turning around, that meant Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083622/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/02/mayor_bloomberg_makes_his_third_ter.php">oversold his pitch for overturning term limits</a>&#x2014;which the mayor didn&apos;t think was a &quot;serious&quot; question.</p>

<p>Paybarah&apos;s video is above (and a clearer one from MyFoxNY is after the jump) and here&apos;s the transcript from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083622/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/a-question-that-bloomberg-seriously-deflects/">CityRoom</a>:</p><blockquote>Mr. Paybarah: If the economy is turning around, as you said, does that mean the rationale for changing term limits&#x2014;-<p></p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg: I don&#x2019;t know why &#x2026; if we have a serious question&#x2026;<br>
[At this point, Mr. Paybarah tried to finish his question, but he was cut off by the mayor.]</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg: The rationale for extending term limits is that the City Council passed it and the voters will have a chance on Nov. 3 to say what they want. I don&#x2019;t think we have to keep coming back to it. &#x2026; If you have a serious question about the economy I will be happy to answer it.</p></blockquote>And then Bloomberg looks at Paybarah and says, &quot;You&apos;re a disgrace.&quot;  Previously, Bloomberg avoided questions from reporters at an event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083622/http://www.politickerny.com/pslideshow/view/2194/2201">by noticing Paybarah&apos;s haircut</a>.<br>
