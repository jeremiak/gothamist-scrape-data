According to the AP, &quot;Toys R Us will operate FAO Schwarz&apos;s flagship store in New York City and a second store at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. FAO Schwarz&apos;s Web site and catalog will continue to use the company&apos;s name.&quot;  Toys R Us chairman and CEO Jerry Storch said, &quot;We will work tirelessly to preserve the distinctiveness and integrity of the FAO Schwarz stores and brand as we grow the business and, indeed, take the brand to even greater heights.&quot; However, Storch did not details the financial agreement.  FAO Schwarz has filed for bankruptcy protection twice and last year announced it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150519030127/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/17/business/17macys.html">would sell toys in Macy&apos;s stores</a>.</p>
