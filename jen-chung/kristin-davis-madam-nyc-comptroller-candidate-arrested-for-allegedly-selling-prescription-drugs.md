<p>Kristin Davis, the one-time Manhattan Madam Manhattan who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824221644/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/23/spitzer_was_a_client_of_east_side_m.php">claimed that Eliot Spitzer was a client</a>, was arrested today for allegedly selling prescription drugs. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said, &quot;As alleged, Kristin Davis sold dangerous and highly-addictive prescription pills to a known drug dealer on repeated occasions in exchange for cash. Prescription drug abuse is the fastest-growing drug problem in this country, resulting in more overdose deaths than heroin and cocaine combined, and this Office has a zero tolerance policy towards anyone who helps to spread this plague at any level.&quot;</p>

<p>The press release from Bharara&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824221644/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/August13/DavisKristinArrestPR.php">details what happened</a>:</p><blockquote>On three separate occasions from January 2013 to March 2013, DAVIS sold hundreds of prescription pills containing amphetamine, alprazolam, zolpidem, and carisoprodol to a person she knew from prior purchases and sales to be a drug dealer. <p></p>

<p>Unbeknownst to DAVIS, the person was a cooperating witness (the &#x201C;CW&#x201D;) with the FBI and equipped with a recording device. During these sales, DAVIS was recorded saying that the pills she was selling were &#x201C;Ambien,&#x201D; &#x201C;Soma,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Xanax.&#x201D; On a fourth occasion, in April 2013, DAVIS arranged for another individual to sell approximately 180 oxycodone pills to the CW.</p></blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824221644/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/madam-kristin-davis-arrested-selling-pills-article-1.1419045">Daily News adds</a>, &quot;Last year, Davis began a barter system of buying drugs, offering 240 Adderall pills for 120 ecstasy pills, the indictment charges.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Davis also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824221644/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/19/ny_governors_debate_send_in_the_clo.php#photo-1">ran for governor in 2010</a>&#x2014;during a debate, she called Albany politicians the &quot;biggest whores&quot; and added, &quot;The key difference between the MTA and my former escort agency is that I operated one set of books and my former agency delivered on time and reliable service.&quot;</p>
