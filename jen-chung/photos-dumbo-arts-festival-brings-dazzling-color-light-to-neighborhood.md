There are video projections on the archway beneath the Manhattan Bridge, sculptures, and drummers performing.</p>

<p>Photographer Scott Lynch took in last night&apos;s offerings and recommends checking out the statues in the Brooklyn Bridge Park as well as the Photoville containers on Main Street (especially Ivan Forde&apos;s). He adds that the &quot;snapping, flapping canopy hanging over Water Street&quot; is very fun that several &quot;open studios&quot; have some interesting things as well, &quot;including a crazy group show called Fabrika 7, held in a cavernous abandoned warehouse.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034320/http://dumboartsfestival.com/find-art">event schedule</a>.</p>
