<p>Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota shocked cat lovers when he said that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022030/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/joe_lhota_would_have_let_subway_kit.php">wouldn&apos;t have stopped subway service to rescue kittens</a> that were on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022030/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/video_adorable_kittens_frolic_on_su.php">tracks of a Brooklyn subway station</a>, which basically made him the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022030/http://nyopoliticker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dn-lhota-original.jpg">sociopathic candidate</a>. Now he&apos;s trying to backtrack!</p>

<p>Subway service was briefly suspended during &quot;Kittens Gone Wild 2013&quot; (and the cats were found<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022030/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/subway_kittens_finally_rescued_will.php"> after it was restored</a>; they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022030/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/05/subway_kittens_living_it_up_in_broo.php#photo-1">chilling at a foster home now</a>), but Lhota&apos;s apparently anti-kitten stance gave rival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022030/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/nyregion/catsimatidis-campaigns-with-heart-tongue-and-checkbook-unfettered.html?pagewanted=all">John CATsimatidis an opportunity</a> to rail against Lhota&apos;s Grinchy persona. At yesterday&apos;s Republican mayoral debate, Lhota insisted, &quot;I never said I wanted to kill a cat,&quot; explaining, &quot;I&#x2019;m not the anti-kitten candidate. We have thousands of cats &#x2014; literally thousands of cats &#x2014; that are in the subway system every single day, day and night, scurrying across the tracks, and they don&#x2019;t get killed.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Thousands of cats in the subway system</em>? It&apos;s one thing for there to be feral cats who hang out near tracks, but if there are thousands of cats <em>in the subway system</em>, why haven&apos;t we seen more of them? We need some fact-checking on this&#x2014;and in the mean time, can we mention how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022030/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/27/mta_revenue.php">cats-as-station masters would be awesome</a>?</p>
