<p>Last week, a Vietnam War veteran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015648/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2014/07/good_news_lowes_employees_come.html">wrote to the Staten Island Advance</a>, to share an experience he had at the Lowe&apos;s Home Improvement Center in Mariner&apos;s Harbor. While at the store on July 7th, Michael Sulsona&apos;s old wheelchair broke (again). He explained that &quot;three employees, David, Marcus and Souleyman jumped to my assistance immediately. They placed me in another chair while they went to work...  They took the wheelchair apart and replaced the broken parts and told me, &apos;We&apos;re going to make this chair like new.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Sulsona explained, &quot;In 1971, I stepped on a land mine in Vietnam and lost both legs above the knee. For the past two years, I have been waiting to receive a new wheelchair from the Veterans Administration. In addition, I have been told that I am not entitled to a spare wheelchair.&quot; So he appreciated effort of the three Lowe&apos;s workers, who worked after the store closed to make sure he could get around, &quot;The actions of these three employees at Lowe&apos;s showed me there are some who still believe in stepping to the plate. They didn&apos;t ask any questions, didn&apos;t feel the need to fill out any forms or make phone calls. Someone needed help and they felt privileged to be given the opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>The VA is now sending Sulsona <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015648/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/vietnam_vet_michael_sulsona_re.html#incart_m-rpt-1">a new custom wheelchair</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015648/http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/lowes-employees-built-this-vet-a-new-wheelchair?bffb">VA told Buzzfeed</a> they were &quot;sorry to hear about the reported circumstances surrounding Mr. Sulsona&apos;s request for a new wheelchair. We quickly investigated and can report the veteran&apos;s new custom wheelchair was delivered to him today and it along with his back up will be serviced by the VA as needed.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015648/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/vietnam_vet_michael_sulsona_re.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Sulsona told the Advance today</a>, &quot;I&apos;d hate to cheapen what these guys did, but isn&apos;t that their job? I should have had the chair I was entitled to, but because of red tape, I never got a chair until now.&quot; But he&apos;d rather focus on the Lowe&apos;s employees who helped him, &quot;I think it&apos;s really important that we all be like these people who wanted to help me; things would be so much easier.&quot;</p>
