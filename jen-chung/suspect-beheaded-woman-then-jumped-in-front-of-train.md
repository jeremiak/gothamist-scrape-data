<p>Police in Long Island are investigating two deaths that appear to be connected: investigators suspect that the beheading of a woman in Farmingdale is linked to a man&apos;s fatal jump in front of a Long Island Rail Road train.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012322/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/police-probe-link-between-farmingdale-homicide-victim-and-nearby-lirr-train-death-1.9558179">According to Newsday</a>, &quot;Shortly before 8 p.m. Tuesday police received a call to 130 Secatogue Ave., where they found the body of a homicide victim, a woman in her 60s, outside the apartment building at that address, said Det. Michael Bitsko, a police spokesman. A second victim, a male in his 30s, was struck and killed by a Long Island Rail Road train about 1,000 feet away from the homicide scene. He was hit at about 8:20 p.m., police said.&quot; </p>

<p>Initially, police thought the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012322/http://pix11.com/2014/10/28/person-jumps-in-front-of-lirr-train-after-allegedly-beheading-woman-in-farmingdale-sources/">beheading was a Halloween prank</a>. </p>

<p>A witness who saw the female victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012322/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/police-investigate-murder-suicide-farmingdale-article-1.1990870">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;The body&#x2019;s feet were at the curb, the shoulders were at the middle of the street. The head was across the street... I&#x2019;ve seen some gruesome stuff in my years of living ... but nothing like this. I didn&#x2019;t expect to see something like this, especially not out here.&quot; A police source tells the Daily News &quot;the woman&#x2019;s head may have been kicked across the street after the murder.&quot;</p>

<p>LIRR passengers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012322/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/10/29/police-probe-possible-link-between-womans-murder-train-fatality-in-farmingdale/">held on the train for hours</a> while police investigated.</p>

<p>The police say there is a link between the woman and man; it&apos;s believed they may have been mother-and-son. <br>
