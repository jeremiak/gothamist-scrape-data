<p>Last night, David Letterman greeted his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173217/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/10/stephen_colbert_late_show.php">successor to the Late Show</a>, calling him the &quot;very talented and always entertaining Stephen Colbert.&quot; Colbert appeared in black, Warby Parker-ish glasses and promised, &quot;I&apos;m gonna do whatever you have done!&quot; to which Letterman said, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Obviously, I&apos;m thrilled and honored to be taking over for you,&quot; Colbert said, his enthusiasm evident. Letterman agreed, &quot;They could have easily just hired another boob like me!&quot;</p>

<p>They also took a selfie:</p>

<p>Colbert revealed that he was once offered an internship in 1986 with the original Late Night with David Letterman on NBC, but didn&apos;t take the job because it didn&apos;t pay (oh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173217/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/the_nytimes_to_listen_to_itself_and.php">how times have changed</a>). </p>

<p>Also, in 1997, Colbert and his writing partner Paul Dinello applied to be writers on the Late Show, but by the time the Late Show got back to them&#x2014;four months later&#x2014;they had already taken a job with <em>Strangers with Candy</em>. But Colbert dusted off the Top 10 List he and Dinello compiled. Letterman was rattled, however, when the Top 10 graphics appeared for Colbert, &quot;Hey, he doesn&apos;t have the job yet!&quot;</p>

<p>The NY Times wrote:</p><blockquote>Mr. Colbert wore black-framed glasses and was not in character, and the two hosts seemed to enjoy each other&#x2019;s company, laughing frequently and ribbing without fear. Their conversation was friendly and enlivened by moments of mock-tension where the two squabbled over the details of the transition. &#x201C;When are you leaving?&#x201D; Mr. Colbert asked bluntly at one point. After a laugh, Mr. Letterman, who has been no more specific than saying he will leave the show in 2015, responded: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s it worth to you?&#x201D;</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Letterman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173217/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/03/david_letterman_retiring.php">is retiring next year</a>; it&apos;s unclear if the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173217/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/10/will_ny_state_give_late_show_millio.php">will stay in New York</a>.</p>
