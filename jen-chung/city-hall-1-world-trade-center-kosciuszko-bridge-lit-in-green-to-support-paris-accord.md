					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606165202/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">President Trump&apos;s</a> decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606165202/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/01/trump_paris_accord_climate.php">withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord</a> has drawn criticism from many, many corners. Among the critics were Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo, who ordered that various prominent structures be lit up green to emphasize their opposition to climate change. </p>

<p>In a press statement about 1 World Trade Center and the Kosciuszko Bridge being lit green, Cuomo said, &quot;World: the Empire State stands with you. Tonight New York shines green for our planet, our health, and our children&apos;s future.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the governor said, &quot;The White House&apos;s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord has devastating repercussions not only for the United States, but for our planet. This administration is abdicating its leadership and taking a backseat to other countries in the global fight against climate change.&quot;</p>

<p>In pledging to pull the commitment to the Paris carbon reduction goals, Trump is having the U.S. join Syria and Nicaragua as the world&apos;s only non-signatories. According to the terms of the climate deal, the withdrawal won&apos;t become effective until shortly after the 2020 presidential elections. In response, Cuomo issued an executive order mandating that New York abide by the standards of the climate accord, and created a coalition with the governors of California and Washington to seek to get other states to abide by the standards.</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio tweeted a photograph of City Hall, also bathed in green light, writing, &quot;City Hall shines green tonight because New York City will honor the goals of the #ParisAgreement.&quot; His statement about the president&apos;s decision read in part, &quot;President Trump can turn his back on the world, but the world cannot ignore the very real threat of climate change. This decision is an immoral assault on the public health, safety and security of everyone on this planet. New Yorkers are already experiencing hotter summers, more powerful storms and rising seas, which disproportionately affect already vulnerable communities.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, there were a few critics who question how committed New York&apos;s leaders really are:</p>

<p>Also, on a related note, environmental activists regularly point out that upward and outward-facing lighting of the sort being used to illuminate the bridge and buildings is a waste of energy, and is disruptive to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606165202/http://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/wildlife/">entire ecosystems</a>.</p>
