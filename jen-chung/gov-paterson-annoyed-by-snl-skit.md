My life is an actual plot from a Richard Pryor movie.</b>&quot;&#x2014;Paterson himself was not one of them.  </p>

<p>The governor was more upset with how blind people were portrayed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222959/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/12/14/2008-12-14_gov_paterson_not_amused_by_saturday_nigh.html">telling the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>I can take a joke. But only 37% of disabled people are working and I&apos;m afraid that that kind of third-grade humor certainly adds to this atmosphere.</strong>.. Let&apos;s just say I don&apos;t think it helped,&quot; and his office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222959/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/ny-epaterson1214,0,7432091.story">issued a statement slamming the show</a>, too:</p><blockquote>The governor engages in humor all the time, and he can certainly take a joke. However, this particular Saturday&apos; Night Live&apos; skit unfortunately chose to ridicule people with physical disabilities and imply that disabled people are incapable of having jobs with serious responsibilities. The governor is sure that Saturday&apos; Night Live,&apos; with all of its talent, can find a way to be funny without being offensive. Knowing the governor, he might even have some suggestions himself.</blockquote>Well, obviously Paterson needs to appear on the next show!  <p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, NBC was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222959/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/nyregion/15skit.html?ref=nyregion">unable to find anyone available to comment</a> about the skit.  The Weekend Update segment featured two Paterson bits (videos after the jump): First had Paterson discussing what he was looking for in a Senate replacement for Hillary Clinton (and fumbling with a chart) and the second featured Paterson accidentally walking into the camera shot.</p>

Obviously, the governor of New York is blind, and he&apos;s doing the job. Whenever you have a portrayal that calls the basic capacity of [blind people] into question, that&apos;s a potential problem.&quot; </p>

<p>NY Magazine&apos;s Daily Intel was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222959/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/12/hey_fred_armisen_screw_you.html">offended by the skit</a>; coincidentally, the print edition of NY Magazine says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222959/http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2008/52946/">reason #5 to love New York</a> is &quot;<strong>Because a Legally Blind, Formerly Adulterous Onetime Recreational Coke User Can Be Governor</strong>&quot; with a photo of Paterson holding up papers really close to his face. [Reason #6 is &quot;Because When We Flame Out, We Do So in Spectacular Fashion (though perhaps not as spectacular as some)&quot;&#x2014;cue Spitzer image]</p>
