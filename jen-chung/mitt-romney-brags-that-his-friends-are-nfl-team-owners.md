<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2012_02_romneyjohnson.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031915im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_romneyjohnson.jpg" width="300" height="380"> <br> <i>Jets owner Woody Johnson and Mitt Romney have beaucoup bucks</i></div> Republican presidential sorta frontrunner Mitt Romney was trying to show that he&apos;s familiar with regular people topics like football.  But it failed horribly!  <p></p>

<p>While calling into a sports radio talk show in Birmingham, Alabama, Romney discussed Peyton Manning&apos;s free agency with host Paul Finebaum.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031915/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/discussing-manning-romney-touts-ties-to-football-team-owners/">From The Caucus</a>: </p><blockquote>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m surprised to hear that Denver&#x2019;s thinking about him,&#x201D; Mr. Romney said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want him in our neck of the woods, let&#x2019;s put it that way.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got a lot of good friends, the owner of the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets, both owners are friends of mine,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;But let&#x2019;s keep him away from New England.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Really?  Did Romney not learn his lesson from bragging about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031915/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/26/mitt-romney-nascar-team-owners_n_1303029.html">knowing NASCAR team owners</a>? As Finebaum said, &quot;Someone must have lost a screw to allow you on this program.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Last night, on the Daily Show, Jon Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031915/http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-march-12-2012/indecision-2012---win-dixie">mocked Jeff Foxworthy&apos;s support of Romney</a>, &quot;If your favorite kind of fireworks is firing people at work... If you have a car on your front lawn &apos;cause your garage only holds five cars, if you go to the diner and order your eggs faberg&#xE9;, if you think &apos;Cloverfield&apos; was a movie about your butler &#x2014; you might be a Romney!&quot;</p>
