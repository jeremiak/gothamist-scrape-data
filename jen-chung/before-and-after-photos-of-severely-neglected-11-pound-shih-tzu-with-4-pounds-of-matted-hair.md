</div></div>					<p>A little Shih Tzu dog is learning how to walk again after he was found abandoned and in bad shape in a Long Island home. </p>

<p>According to Suffolk County SPCA chief Roy Gross, the dog was brought to the shelter last week with his hair severely matted, overgrown nails and a strong, offensive odor. The dog, now named Ziggy, was unable to walk because of his hair&#x2014;the Babylon Animal Shelter&apos;s director said it was worse case of matting he&apos;d ever seen&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015414/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/25/spca-dog-found-inside-abandoned-li-house-could-barely-walk/">Gross told WCBS 880</a>, &quot;The dog looked like an old mop.&quot;</p>

<p>It took three hours for staff to remove four pounds of hair from the 11-pound dog.</p>

<p>The dog was found in an empty Lindenhurst home and neighbors said the previous tenants didn&apos;t have a dog, leaving Gross to suspect Ziggy was abandoned there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015414/http://www.longisland.com/news/07-24-14/scspca-reward-neglected-dog.html">There&apos;s a $2,000 reward offered</a> for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case; anyone with information is asked to call the Suffolk County SPCA at 631-382-7722.</p>

<p>Ziggy is undergoing physical therapy and will be up for adoption after he completes it.</p>
