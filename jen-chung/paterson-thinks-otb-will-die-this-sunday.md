While the city is ready to close the branches and lay off workers, the Daily News reports, &quot;The question now, as one lobbyist says, is whether the city&apos;s OTB is &apos;really dead, or Freddy Krueger dead.&apos;&quot;  Well, Governor Paterson thinks it&apos;s <em>really dead</em>.<p></p>

<p>On John Gambling&apos;s radio show, Paterson, who had<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185847/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/paterson_ready_to_bail_out_otb.php"> offered a plan</a> to keep OTB alive, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185847/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/15/2010-04-15_gov_paterson_bets_that_offtrack_betting_will_close_down.html">said</a>, &quot;We made our last best offer, which was an offer that did not involve taxpayer money,.  I guess competitive interests or somebody didn&apos;t like the plan, so the Legislature went home and didn&apos;t pass it, so they are scheduled to expire on Sunday,&quot; adding that any solution could not include taxpayer money, &quot;Everybody&apos;s solution to their problem in the recession is for taxpayers to bail them out. We used to have a choice; now we can&apos;t do it.&quot;</p>
