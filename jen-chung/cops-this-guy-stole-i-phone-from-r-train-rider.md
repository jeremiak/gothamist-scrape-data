<p>People, the MTA and NYPD really don&apos;t want you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120428/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/of_course_the_nypd_has_an_apple_cri.php">get your electronic gadgets stolen</a>&#x2014;that&apos;s why they make warnings and PSAs about keeping your valuables out of sight when you ride mass transit. Case in point: A person snatched an iPhone out of an unsuspecting subway rider&apos;s hands last week.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, on Wednesday, June 19, at 8:25 p.m., a 34-year-old woman on a northbound R train was approached by a male who grabbed her iPhone. The police say she &quot;struggled to hold on to the phone before the suspect successfully removed it from her hands and fled the subway as it stopped at the Canal Street station.&quot;  The victim was not injured during the confrontation. </p>

<p>The police released photos of the suspect, who is described as being 16-18 years old. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (84&lt;77). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120428/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM </a>or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
