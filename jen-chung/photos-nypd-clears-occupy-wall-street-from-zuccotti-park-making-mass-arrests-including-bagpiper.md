</div></div>					<p>Occupy Wall Street is continuing its<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/at_least_four_detained_at_occupy_wa.php#photo-1"> six-month anniversary action today</a> by trying to remain in Zuccotti Park overnight. Hundreds are in the park&#x2014;around 600-700, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/RDevro/status/181204442010488833">according to Ryan Devreaux</a>, who also photographed a tarp going up and protesters who &quot;moved in.&quot;  Of course, we know that the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/01/occupy_the_new_year_hundreds_clash.php#photo-1">doesn&apos;t act kindly towards tents</a> in Zuccotti, since a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/judge_rules_against_occupy_wall_str.php">judge ruled against them</a>, but it&apos;s been up for 20 minutes so far. And here&apos;s what it sounds like in the park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/dontbeaputz/status/181193582059864065">via Jeff Smith</a>:</p>

<p>The protesters are also practicing marching techniques: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/ANIMALNewYork/status/181202746907688962/photo/1">According to Animal New York&apos;s Bucky Turco</a>, &quot;Occupy protesters are doing training exercises. NYPD seem confused as they run, form walls, &amp; then sit down.&quot;  Plus, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/ANIMALNewYork/status/181151968574709760/photo/1">there&apos;s cake</a> AND <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/ANIMALNewYork/status/181191834381463553">Michael Moore</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/RDevro">Devreaux Tweeted</a> right before 11 p.m.: &quot;The tent in the middle of the park continues to fill with people planning to stay the night. Lots of energy here.&quot;  Watch it live via TimCast:</p>

<p>Earlier today, a number of people were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/at_least_four_detained_at_occupy_wa.php#photo-1">arrested during the daytime action</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/arrests-made-as-protesters-mark-occupy-wall-streets-six-month-anniversary/">CityRoom&apos;s Colin Moynihan wrote</a>: </p><blockquote>Then the police began grabbing and arresting people, taking into custody at least half a dozen. Officers surged into the crowd, dragging protesters toward the street, as people yelled objections.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;They were grabbing people randomly,&#x201D; Zachary Kamel said, adding that his girlfriend, Lauren DiGoia, had been arrested while dancing on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>One sergeant grabbed a woman wearing a green shirt by the bottom of her throat and shoved her head against the hood of a car. A moment later, another officer approached and forcefully pressed her head against the car before placing her into the back of a police truck.</p></blockquote>Random arrests?  That&apos;s... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/29/video_police_arrest.php#photo-1">normal for the NYPD when it comes to OWS-related actions</a>.  Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/arrests-made-as-protesters-mark-occupy-wall-streets-six-month-anniversary/">CityRoom&apos;s photograph</a> shows a protester&#x2014;who was allegedly asked if he was a terrorist&#x2014;holding a sign that says &quot;Bad Cop &#x2014;&gt; No Donut.&quot;<p></p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: Apparently the cops just tore down a tarp and were unhappy when a posse of bagpipers joined the park.  Via Jeff Smith, here&apos;s what the bagpipers (and apparently arrests/detainment) sound like (hint: turn the volume down):</p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751if_/http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F40115553&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>

<p>A Great Big City<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://www&lt;a href=/" https:="" twitter.com="" #!="" occupywallstnyc"=""></a>.flickr.com/photos/agreatbigcity/6845547354/&quot;&gt; posted video of cops going into the park to take down the tent.  Ryan Devreaux <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/RDevro/status/181215638814081024">clarifies the tent-bagpiper sequence of events</a>: &quot;As everyone went to check out the police-on-bagpiper action, cops moved in and tore down the tent.&quot; Apparently the bagpipers are from France.</p>

<p>Now a second tent has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/katz/status/181217379768995840">been erected</a> and there are &quot;solidarity tents&quot; in the air.  Andrew Katz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/katz/status/181219850394402816">just Tweeted</a>, &quot;Mic check: Guy overheard NYPD planning to come in with a &quot;wedge&quot; formation&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/RDevro">Devreaux adds</a>, &quot;Police are mobilizing around Zuccotti&apos;s perimeter as a few hundred protesters stand their ground in the center.&quot; Brookfield Properties has asked the crowd to leave the park.  And 1st Precinct Commanding Officer Edward Winski said the park is closed, that people will be arrested for trespassing.</p>

<p><b>Update 11:30 p.m.</b>: Police entered Zuccotti and started tearing down the structures and, from what it looked like on the Livestream, pushing people down.  Those in the park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/ANIMALNewYork/status/181222893408092160">say it&apos;s &quot;pandemonium&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/katz/status/181223346787201025">protesters are &quot;livid.&quot;</a> But the cops are just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/judge_rules_against_occupy_wall_str.php">enforcing &quot;the rules&quot;</a>... that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/17/nyclu_joins_legal_fight_for_occupy.php">the NYCLU says are illegal</a>.  Dozens have been arrested/detained by police.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309084751/https://twitter.com/#!/macfathom/status/181133711801188353">Devreaux just Tweeted</a>, &quot;Police are barricading the park. It&apos;s cleared. I witnessed countless violent arrests. No way to estimate numbers.&quot;  Occupy Wall Street points out that setting up barricades on the &quot;on the south side of #LibertySq&quot; is &quot;against court orders.&quot;</p>
