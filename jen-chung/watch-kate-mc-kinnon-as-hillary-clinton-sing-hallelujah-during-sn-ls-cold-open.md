<p>After last week&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013545/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/06/alec_baldwin_kate_mckinnon_snl.php#photo-1">giddy pre-election cold open</a>, which presciently had Alec Baldwin&apos;s Donald Trump marveling that he was still a viable competitor (&quot;America, you must really hate this lady!&quot;), this week&apos;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em> began more simply. It was Kate McKinnon, dressed as Hillary Clinton, sitting at a grand piano and singing the Leonard Cohen&apos;s &quot;Hallelujah.&quot;</p>

The performance is both tribute to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013545/http://laist.com/2016/11/10/leonard_cohen_has_died.php">late Canadian songwriting legend</a> as well as Clinton, with lyrics like &quot;love is not a victory march&quot; and &quot;I did my best, it wasn&apos;t much&quot; taking on new meanings. At the end, McKinnon turned to the audience, saying, &quot;I&#x2019;m not giving up, and neither should you.&quot;
