                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_07_fdny2014.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822172145im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_fdny2014.jpg" width="640" height="465" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Way back in May, the FDNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822172145/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/photos_sneak_peek_at_the_fdny_2014.php">cruelly teased us with photos of ripped firefighters</a> from the upcoming 2014 FDNY Calendar of Heroes. Now our wait is over at last: The calendar goes on sale today&#x2014;and if you can head to midtown Manhattan, you can get your copy signed by one of the hunks.</p>

<p>Firefighters who posed (shirtless, might we remind you) for the $15.95 calendar will be on 7th Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets, between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., signing calendars. If you can&apos;t make it there, you can also buy the calendar at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822172145/http://fdny-firezone.hostedbyamazon.com/dp/0615820603">online</a> or at the FDNY Fire Zone Store. </p>

<p>All proceeds from the sale of the calendar go directly to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822172145/http://www.fdnyfoundation.org/">FDNY Foundation</a>, the not-for-profit arm of the FDNY which was established to promote fire safety education for residents of New York City and to provide professional development, training and education for FDNY members.</p>
