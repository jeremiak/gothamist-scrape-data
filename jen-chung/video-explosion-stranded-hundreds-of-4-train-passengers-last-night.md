<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131017/http://twitter.com/#!/NYCTSubwayScoop/status/128647255300382720">NYCT Subway Scoop Tweeted</a>, &quot;#ServAdv: Downtown #4 turning at Bowling Green due to a smoke condition. Expect delays&quot;  For the over 400 riders on that 4 train, it turned into an unnerving experience. Our own James Thilman was on the train at 9:30 p.m. and says it &quot;suddenly stopped between Bowling Green and Borough Hall. Quickly filled with smoke, people got a little jumpy (only a few screamers). We sat for well over an hour and were then transferred to another train and sent back to Bowling Green,&quot; which is where many people decided to give up on the MTA for the evening.  </p>

<p>The Village Voice&apos;s Steven Thrasher was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131017/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/on_being_trapped_4_train.php">also on the train and has a long description</a>. Here&apos;s what happened at the begining:</p><blockquote>About a minute after pulling out of Bowling Green station at full speed, I felt a bump. Hearing a &quot;pfizz,&quot; the train came to a halt.<p></p>

<p>Had we hit something? Had someone pulled the emergency cord?</p>

<p>I realized that we were underwater. I&apos;m not normally a claustrophobic type, but I suddenly felt very nervous, and we were under a few hundred (thousand?) feet of water.</p>

<p>Then, the car started to fill with smoke.</p>

<p>It was the most frightening thing I&apos;d ever experienced.</p>

<p>The man next to me pulled out a gas mask and winked at me. I had the terrifying feeling that every time I&apos;d made fun of terrorism being overblown was going to come back and haunt me.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s OK,&quot; he said. &quot;I work in construction.&quot;</p>

<p>I found this not particularly likely or reassuring.</p></blockquote>The passengers, which included very young children, were taken off the stopped train and transferred to a rescue train. Thrasher writes, &quot;For whatever reason, I ended being the next to the last person on the entire train getting off. There was a putrid, acrid, smokey smell passing between each car, like a hundred soldering torches were lit. When we finally got to go to the rescue train, the gap between the two was about a foot. MTA workers were telling us to watch the gap. Three firefighters were there, getting ready to investigate the &apos;explosion&apos; and needing to put out the fire, whose location wasn&apos;t certain.&quot; He also took some video:<p></p>

<p>The MTA tells us the smoke condition is still &quot;under investigation.&quot;</p>
