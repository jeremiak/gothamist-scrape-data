<p>While their official move <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413163204/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/islanders_making_major_announcement.php">isn&apos;t until 2015</a>, the Islanders will play the first hockey game in Brooklyn this fall! The Isles will meet the New Jersey Devils in a preseason game on September 21 at the Barclays Center. Barclays Center CEO Brett Yormark called it a &quot;sneak peak&quot; for Brooklyn to see its &quot;future hometown NHL team&quot;</p>

<p>Isles GM Garth Snow was also pumped, &quot;Over the past 40 years, Nassau Coliseum has been one of the best buildings to attend and watch a hockey game. Our fans create an atmosphere that is second to none where you can feel the energy inside the Coliseum when the team makes a big play. I&#x2019;m excited for our fans to bring that energy and have the ability to enjoy an Islanders game while taking advantage of the world class amenities at Barclays Center, that stand above and beyond what any other arena provides.  This preseason game will be their first opportunity to do so.&quot;</p>
