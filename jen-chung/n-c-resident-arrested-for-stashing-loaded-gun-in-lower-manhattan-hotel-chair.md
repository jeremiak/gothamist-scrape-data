And it turns out he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163744/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/21/idiot_who_left_loaded_gun_in_chair.php">was indeed from the South</a>: Bobby Jackson, 59, of Fayetteville, North Carolina has been charged with criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment.</p>

<p>Apparently Jackson stashed his gun at the World Center Hotel near the 9/11 Memorial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163744/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/tourist_hid_gun_in_hotel_chair_so_h.php">because guns aren&apos;t allowed at the Memorial</a>. A relative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163744/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/a-disturbing-mystery-is-solved-and-a-tourist-is-in-custody/">told City Room</a> that he put the gun there because he wanted to get back to his tour group, &quot;He&#x2019;s not perfect by any means, but he&#x2019;s a good man. He&#x2019;s a God-fearing man. If what had happened there had happened here, and it hadn&#x2019;t been times like now, everything would be O.K., because everybody would know him.&quot; Yeah, because leaving loaded guns in public places is totally cool in the South!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163744/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/a-disturbing-mystery-is-solved-and-a-tourist-is-in-custody/">According to City Room</a>, &quot;Mr. Jackson owns a pressure-washing business in Fayetteville and does security work, which is why he owns a pistol, said the relative, who asked to remain anonymous.&quot; When the NYPD investigated the incident, Jackson allegedly asked 9/11 Memorial staff if cops or off-duty cops could bring their guns (no). </p>

<p>Jackson didn&apos;t have a permit to carry a gun in New York&#x2014;hence the criminal possession of weapon charge&#x2014;which suggests cops are being pretty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163744/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/dont_bring_your_gun_to_the_911_memo.php">consistent in arresting tourists who bring guns to New York</a>. Anyway, Jackson&apos;s relative told City Room, &quot;He thought that whoever found it, they would contact him and want a reward. He is not a crook.&quot; Seriously? Did his gun has his name and phone number on it? </p>
