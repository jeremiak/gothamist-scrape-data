<p>Mayor Bloomberg was probably thinking he could discuss his praiseworthy Hurricane Irene preparations during his weekly radio show today.  Instead, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161550/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/bloomberg-cancels-radio-talk-amid-furor-over-aides-resignation/">he cancelled his appearance</a> over the controversy of how former Deputy Mayor Stephen Goldsmith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161550/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/deputy_mayor_goldsmith_makes_a_quic.php">resigned his position:</a> While the Mayor&apos;s office said that Goldsmith was pursuing &quot;private-sector opportunities in infrastructure finance,&quot; Goldsmith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161550/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/ex-deputy_mayor_goldsmith_may_left.php">actually resigned because he had been arrested</a> for domestic violence in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>According to the arrest report (see below), his wife Margaret called the police to their Georgetown townhouse on July 3 (&quot;C-1 reports she got into a verbal altercation with S-1, her husband. C-1 stated to S-1 &apos;I should have put a bullet through you years ago&apos;. At that time S-1 shoved C-1 into the kitchen counter. C-1 stated to S-1 &apos;Your not going to do this to me again, I&apos;m calling the police.&apos; S-1 then grabbed the phone from C-1&apos;s hands and threw it onto the ground, breaking the phone.&quot;). Goldsmith spent two days in jail and his wife did not press charges. Margaret Goldsmith told the Post yesterday that the arrest was a &quot;big mistake. I can only tell you it was an enormous misunderstanding. It just got out of control,&quot; and insisted that her husband wasn&apos;t planning on resigning from the Bloomberg administration before the incident but he felt it would have been distracting to the Mayor.  </p>

<p>Since Goldsmith immediately told Bloomberg about the arrest, other officials are upset that the mayor got to whitewash the reason why Goldsmith departed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161550/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/09/domestic-violence-bust-not-blizzard-fail-blew-deputy-mayor-stephen-goldsmith-o">Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer said</a>, &quot;I am deeply troubled by the news that one of the Mayor&apos;s highest-ranking aides resigned weeks ago after being arrested in a reported domestic violence incident, and spent two nights in jail -- but we are only learning this today, in a belated newspaper account. The Mayor and his staff should give a full accounting of what they knew and when they knew it.... The Deputy Mayor for Operations isn&apos;t just another aide -- the position is directly responsible for oversight of the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies that routinely confront the issue of domestic violence.</p>

<p>City Comptroller John Liu chimed in, &quot;It appears the Mayor was not upfront with New Yorkers. He should take the next opportunity to level with the City about the events surrounding the Deputy Mayor&#x2019;s resignation.&#x201D; And there was also NYC Public Advocate Bill de Blasio: &quot;While Deputy Mayor Goldsmith&#x2019;s resignation was more than appropriate given the circumstances, New Yorkers deserve a full airing of the facts known to the Administration.&quot;  Keep in mind, these three are 2013 mayoral hopefuls.</p>

<p>A domestic violence advocate, Liz Roberts of Safe Horizon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161550/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/nyregion/bloomberg-hid-reason-for-goldsmiths-resignation-domestic-violence-arrest.html?ref=nyregion">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;If we are going to hold the regular people of New York City accountable for not being violent in their relationships, we need to hold our senior leaders and officials, too,&quot; and called this incident &quot;troubling.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor spokesman Marc La Vorgna said, &quot;We have nothing to add to Mrs. Goldsmith&apos;s account of the incident, but it was clear to the Mayor and Mr. Goldsmith that he could no longer serve at City Hall, regardless of his guilt or innocence.&quot;</p>
