										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_04_paiello.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193947im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_paiello.jpg" width="300" height="378"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Paige Aiello</i></div> The family of a missing young woman said that her purse was found on the George Washington Bridge on Wednesday. However, authorities have not found Paige Aiello&apos;s body yet, and her fate remains a mystery. <p></p>

<p>Aiello, a College of New Jersey student whose 22nd birthday was yesterday, was last seen on Tuesday afternoon, when her father picked her up from campus. (Aiello had lived on-campus but had been depressed lately and was staying at home in Hillsborough recently.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193947/http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2013/04/missing_tcnj_student_paige_aie.html#incart_m-rpt-1">The Star-Ledger reports</a>, &quot;When her mother returned home at 2:45 p.m., Paige Aiello was gone and had taken her mother&apos;s 2006 grey Audi A4 without permission, according to the Somerset County Prosecutor&apos;s Office. The family reported her missing to Hillsborough police at 7:45 p.m.&quot;</p>

<p>The next day, the car was found at a parking garage in New Bunswick, NJ, near a NJ Transit station.  Also on Wednesday, her purse,&#x2014;&quot;containing her car keys and mobile phone&quot;&#x2014;was found on the south walkway of the upper level of the George Washington Bridge. The parking garage and GW Bridge are 45 miles apart. </p>

<p>A law enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193947/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/student_vanishes_9MdMRwDYC6XLDnff1au0WO">told the Post</a>, &quot;You certainly have some indication it&#x2019;s a suicide by the fact that her purse was found on the bridge. But her body has not been found, and that&#x2019;s somewhat unusual.&quot; Still, sources tell the tabloid that if Paige did jump, &quot;it could take up to a week for her body to wash up as far north as Haverstraw or as far south as Battery Park.&quot;</p>

<p>Aiello is the captain of the College of New Jersey&apos;s tennis team, but had suffered a herniated disc recently and was apparently upset about that. Her dad, Chris Aiello, also said that his daughter tutored at school, but lately felt she &quot;wasn&#x2019;t helping the students. She hit a wall. She was somewhat distraught. She&#x2019;s a very high achiever.&quot; He noted that she was attending Rutgers Law School in the fall (she was accepted to eight other law programs), &quot;The only issue in college was whether she was graduating summa cum laude or magna cum laude.&quot;</p>

<p>Her sister told the Star-Ledger, &quot;She&apos;s a perfectionist, she&apos;s a very driven kid... I think she bit off a little more than she could chew this semester.&quot;</p>
