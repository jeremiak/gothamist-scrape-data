										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_04_nushawn2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151251im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_nushawn2.jpg" width="215" height="161" class="image-left"> </span>Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&apos;s office is attempting to block the release of a Brooklyn man who knowingly infected over a dozen females with HIV.  Nushawn Williams, who has served a maximum sentence of 12 years, was scheduled to be freed from prison yesterday, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151251/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/nyregion/14nushawn.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Mr. Cuomo&#x2019;s office is seeking to keep him in custody under a three-year-old state law that permits the civil confinement of sex offenders.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151251/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/he_notorious_hiv_LDeXO9beDfAWYYjoQzqKpN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Health officials believe Williams had sex with at least 43 women upstate in Jamestown and another 28 in New York City after learning he was HIV-positive in September 1996. Of those, 13 contracted HIV and two have given birth to children with the virus.&quot;  Williams was dubbed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151251/http://www.newsweek.com/id/97360">modern-day &quot;Typhoid Harry&quot;</a> and later pleaded guilty to statutory rape and reckless endangerment. </p>

<p>The state could win civil confinement if it&apos;s believed that Williams would spread HIV if released. An inmate told health officials reviewing the case, &quot;He planned to intentionally infect more women with the highly infectious disease upon his release both through sexual contact and infected needles.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151251/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/13/2010-04-13_state_officials_push_to_commit_nushan_williams_who_knowingly_spread_aids_to_a_me.html">Daily News adds</a>, &quot;Williams, 33, didn&apos;t change much behind bars, having thrown bodily fluids at other inmates and been sanctioned 21 times for violent conduct, threats, fighting, and possession of drugs and weapons.&quot;</p>
