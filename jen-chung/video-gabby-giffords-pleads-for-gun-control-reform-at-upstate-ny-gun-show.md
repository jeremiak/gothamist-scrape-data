<p>Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords visited a gun show in Saratoga Springs on Sunday. This was her first visit to a gun show since she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130828/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/08/democratic_congresswoman_gabrielle.php">shot in the head in January 2011</a>, during an attack at an event with constituents in Tucson, Arizona that left six others dead. And she begged others to join her in stopping gun violence and encouraging reform, &quot;We must never stop fighting. Fight! Fight! Fight! Be bold! Be courageous!&quot;</p>

<p>Giffords and her husband astronaut Mark Kelly were there with NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130828/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/gabby-giffords-visits-upstate-gun-show-article-1.1484297">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Giffords and Kelly attended the show to praise a &#x201C;code of conduct&#x201D; Schneiderman worked out with the state&apos;s gun show operators and to call for similar cooperation nationwide to reduce gun violence. Under the New York State agreement, gun show operators must post signs informing buyers that an instant background check must be completed before a firearm can be bought, tag all guns brought into the show, limit the number of entrance and exit doors so weapons can&#x2019;t be sneaked in or out, and inform law enforcement in advance so local cops can patrol parking lots to deter illegal sales.&quot; </p>

<p>Giffords and Kelly were greeted by some applause, but some others also booed them (from a distance). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130828/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/giffords-attend-1st-gun-show-shooting-20556771">According to the AP</a>, &quot;Kelly bought a book on Colt revolvers, and said later he probably would have bought a gun if he had had more time. He said both he and his wife are gun owners.&quot; Kelly added, &quot;It&apos;s great to see government and licensed firearms dealers working together to solve a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130828/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/cuomo_signs_sweeping_gun_control_bi.php">New York passed sweeping gun control legislation</a>.</p>
