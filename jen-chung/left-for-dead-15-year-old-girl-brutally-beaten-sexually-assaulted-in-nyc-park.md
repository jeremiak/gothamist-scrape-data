<p>Police are searching for the suspect in a sexual assault that took place early yesterday morning in the Bronx. A 15-year-old girl was found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013339/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2016/10/girl-15-attacked-beaten-in-bronx.html">&quot;with extensive physical injuries&quot;</a> at Bronx Park, and NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013339/http://abc7ny.com/news/15-year-old-girl-beaten-sexually-assaulted-after-leaving-subway-in-bronx/1571833/">said she was attacked</a> &quot;rather dramatically... We believe she fought very hard.&quot;</p>

<p>Investigators say that around 4:40 a.m. on Monday the victim &quot;met an unknown male at the Gun Hill Road subway station and the two walked together to Bronx Park, near the corner of Bronx Boulevard and East 213 Street.&quot; There, she was attacked: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013339/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/25/bronx-teen-attacked-suspect/">WCBS 2 reports </a>that her &quot;head was stomped [on] and teeth [were] knocked out before being sexually assaulted.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim regained consciousness hours later, and while &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013339/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/25/bronx-teen-attacked-suspect/">[s]tumbling and in and out of consciousness</a>,&quot; she walked back towards Gun Hill Road, where a concerned person drove her to Montefiore Hospital. &quot;Her head injuries are extensive and have caused memory loss, causing her to have trouble recollecting the traumatic events,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013339/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2016/10/girl-15-attacked-beaten-in-bronx.html">according to A Walk in the Park</a>.  </p>

<p>The suspect, who fled eastbound on East 213 Street, is described as being approximately 25 years old and 5&apos;10&quot; tall with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a black Champion hooded sweatshirt bearing the &quot;C&quot; logo, blue jeans, gray Timberland boots and black gloves. He also had scabs on his lips. Authorities released this surveillance video of the suspect from 3575 Bronx Boulevard, a few blocks from the attack.</p>
