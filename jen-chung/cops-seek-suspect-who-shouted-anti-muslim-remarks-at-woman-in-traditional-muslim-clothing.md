<p>Police are hoping the public can help them find a woman who allegedly yelled anti-Muslim remarks at a Muslim woman last week in the Bronx.</p>

<p>The victim, 33, was near Unionport Road and East Tremont Avenue around around 12:45 p.m. on April 28, 2017, when she was approached by another woman who yelled anti-Muslim statements at her, police said.</p>

<p>The victim was wearing traditional Muslim clothing at the time. </p>

<p>The suspect, who fled towards Morris Park Avenue, was described as a woman around 50 years old who was last seen wearing a black jacket, with a pink stripe on sleeves, beige hat, khaki pants and a purple handbag. Authorities released surveillance video of her:</p>
