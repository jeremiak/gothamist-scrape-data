</div></div>					<p>A handsome German shorthaired pointer was proclaimed Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club&apos;s Annual Dog Show. The dog, whose full name is GCH Vjk-Myst Garbonita&apos;s California Journey, is also mercifully known as CJ. He&apos;s the third pointer to take the honors in the competition&apos;s history.</p>

<p>The NY Times reported on CJ&apos;s reaction to his major win:</p><blockquote>C. J. appeared to have grasped [Best in Show judge Richard] Meen&#x2019;s advice to relax. When he won, he was impassive, looking out at the crowd as if he might have anticipated the outcome. Or maybe his serious demeanor was another way to show his shock. His handler, Valerie Nunes-Atkinson, was more emotional, kissing Meen and rival handlers, then dropping to her knees to hug and kiss C. J.</blockquote>And what was Meen looking for, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423210410/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/16/westminster_dog_show_photos.php">thousands of dogs competed </a>in hopes of being the top dog, let along one of the seven in the Best in Show Ring?<p></p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BIS Judge Dr. Meen on what he was looking for in tonight&apos;s winner: &quot;A dog that takes me back into the past of what they were bred to do.&quot;</p>&#x2014; Westminster Dog Show (@WKCDOGS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423210410/https://twitter.com/WKCDOGS/status/699816048560836608">February 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>CJ&apos;s handler, who is also his breeder and co-owner, confirmed, &quot;He loves it here. He was born this way. At 6 weeks, he walked across the living room floor and we said, &#x2018;Oh, my.&#x2019; He has that sparkle that makes you stop and look at him. He&#x2019;s my heart dog.&quot; </p>

<p>The other dogs were pretty adorable too, like Bogey the Samoyed who won the working group:</p>
