<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_03_sheecar.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141220im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_03_sheecar.jpg" width="132" height="111" class="image-right"> </span>NYPD detective turned Fox 5 reporter Mike Sheehan is saying &quot;neigh&quot; to charges that he was allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141220/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/31/fox_5_reported_arrested_after_hitti.php">drunk when he drove into a mounted police officer on Monday night</a>.  Sheehan&apos;s lawyer Thomas Monagan said, &quot;It is Mr. Sheehan&apos;s position that the horse ran into his car,&quot; according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141220/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/03/31/2009-03-31_mike_sheehan_cop_turned_tv_newsman_on_wr-1.html">Daily News, which has a photo of the car</a> showing a damaged driver&apos;s side window.  Cops say Sheehan drove into the horse and cop on Varick at N. Moore Street in Tribeca, leaving the cop with a bruised leg and the horse with cuts, bruises and scrapes; they add that Sheehan refused to take a Breathalyzer test.  Monagan said, &quot;How do you hit a horse with the side of your car? You can&apos;t,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141220/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04012009/news/regionalnews/manhattan/news_guys_whoa_162311.htm">pointed out that a police officer&apos;s initial report</a> found that Sheehan&apos;s breath did not smell of alcohol but then the cop apparently changed his story the next morning to say the newsman had &quot;slurred speech and the smell of alcohol on his breath.&quot; (P.S. NYPD horses are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141220/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/18/law_order_mount.php">referred to as 10-foot cops</a>.)</p>
