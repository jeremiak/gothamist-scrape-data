<p>Six fancy watches and other jewelry whose value totals $109,000 were stolen from a Gravesend apartment earlier this week, and now the police hope the public can help identify the burglary suspect.</p>

<p>The break-in took place on Sunday, April 2nd, just after midnight. The authorities say that the suspect forcibly entered an apartment&#x2014;by breaking into a kitchen window&#x2014;near 28th Avenue and Harway Avenue in Brooklyn. Once inside, cops say the suspect snatched the following pieces of jewelry from an unlocked display case in a bedroom: a Panarai watch valued at $10,500, a Jacob the Jeweler watch valued at $17,500, a Breitling Super Avenger watch valued at $6,500, a Breitling Navitimer watch valued at $4,500, a Rolex Datejust valued at $28,000, a Bentley watch valued at $11,000, a necklace with cross valued at $12,000, a ring valued at $7,000 and a bracelet valued at $12,000.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect allegedly fled the home with the items in a white bag. The home was empty at the time of the burglary, and when the resident, a 46-year-old man, returned home hours later, he called the police at 3:10 a.m. </p>

<p>The NYPD released surveillance video of the suspect:</p>
