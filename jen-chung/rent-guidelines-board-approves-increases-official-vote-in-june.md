<p>As expected, the Rent Guidelines Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164214/http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/political_news/160390/rent-guidelines-board-approves-range-for-rent-hikes">approved rent increases</a> for rent-stabilized apartments in New York City. The board, in a 5-4 vote, okayed moving forward with 1.75 to 4 percent hikes for one-year leases and between 3.5 to 6.75 percent increases for two-year leases. </p>

<p>The final vote on June 21 will determine what the increase will ultimately be (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164214/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/28/rent_hikes_approved_tenants_and_lan.php">last year&apos;s vote</a> had 3.75% increases for 1-year-leases and 7.25% increases for 2-year leases), but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164214/http://www.housingnyc.com/html/about/meetings.html">there are three meetings before then</a> if you want to have your say&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164214/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/20/rent_stabilised_hikes_face_45_8_hik.php#photo-3">it gets really rowdy!</a>  </p>

Still, he promised, they would turn out in droves in June. &apos;There will be a lot more theater for the next vote,&apos; Mr. Wood said.</blockquote><p></p>
