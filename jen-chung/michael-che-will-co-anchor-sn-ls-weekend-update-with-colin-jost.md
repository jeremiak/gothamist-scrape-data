<p>Nearly five months after it was announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013755/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/28/the_daily_shows_new_correspondent_i.php">he would be joining The Daily Show</a>, comedian Michael Che will return to SNL to become the new Weekend Update co-anchor, alongside Colin Jost.</p>

<p>This means that Cecily Strong, who hosted alongside both Jost and Seth Meyers (before Meyers left to host <em>Late Night</em>), is out. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013755/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/business/media/new-comic-to-anchor-update-on-snl.html?ref=media&amp;_r=0">NY Times&apos; Bill Carter reports</a>:</p><blockquote>After trying out what he said were &#x201C;a number of different combinations&#x201D; in the last few weeks, Lorne Michaels, the show&#x2019;s creator and executive producer, said he had selected Mr. Che, 31, who worked on the show last season as a writer, to be the partner of Colin Jost, who began co-anchoring &#x201C;Weekend Update&#x201D; in the middle of last season.<p></p>

<p>Mr. Michaels said that Mr. Che, who has had a career as a stand-up comedian in New York, formed a close relationship last year in the writers&#x2019; room with Mr. Jost, one of the show&#x2019;s two head writers.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Michael is a strong writer, and he&#x2019;s really funny,&#x201D; Mr. Michaels said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s always difficult to make changes and make &#x2018;Update&#x2019; different from what&#x2019;s gone before.&#x201D;...</p>

<p>&#x201C;This is about a new era, what feels appropriate for now,&#x201D; Mr. Michaels said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why we did a lot of combinations and tests, and this is kind of where we came out.&#x201D; For the first time, the &#x2018;Weekend Update&#x201D; segment will have two men at the anchor desk.</p></blockquote>Earlier, Che had been reflecting on the day:<p></p>

<p>But he just Tweeted:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>i wanna thank Jon &amp; the entire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013755/https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow">@TheDailyShow</a> staff for letting me do this. i had a FANTASTIC time there. 1st class all the way</p>&#x2014; Michael Che (@CheThinks) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013755/https://twitter.com/CheThinks/status/510242442474291200">September 12, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Strong is staying on the cast, and apparently she asked to leave Update so she could appear in sketches. Michaels said, &quot;It struggled to find an identity last season. Because what had come before had been pretty brilliant.&quot;</p>

<p>In other cast news: three of last year&apos;s rookies, Brooks Wheelan, No&#xEB;l Wells and John Milhiser were cut from the show (but Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney both survived); according to the Times, &quot;Mr. Michaels said that he would probably be making one or two more additions to the cast this season but that he had not yet reached a decision.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, Che was recently on The Daily Show, in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013755/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/27/jon_stewart_fox_news.php">segment about Ferguson, Missouri</a>:</p>
