<p>The 31-year-old man who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012706/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/01/williamsburg_bridge_death.php">found dead on an outer roadway</a> of the Williamsburg Bridge on the morning after Halloween was reportedly visiting NYC from Austria. Police sources say the tourist was dressed as a character from Stanly Kubrick&apos;s adaptation of Anthony Burgess&apos;s novel <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>. </p>

<p>The man was discovered just before 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning on the Brooklyn side of the bridge and pronounced dead at the scene. Police had been investigating whether he was struck by a car or fell from an elevated walkway. </p>

<p>Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012706/http://nypost.com/2016/11/02/tourist-found-dead-on-roadway-was-dressed-as-clockwork-orange-character/">tell the NY Post</a> they believe the man was inebriated and somehow fell or jumped from the pedestrian walkway that extends above the bridge roadway. After landing on the roadway, he was struck by a driver who &quot;was not charged, telling cops he was unaware that he had hit a person.&quot; </p>

<p>The man&apos;s hat was next to him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012706/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/young-man-found-dead-outer-roadway-williamsburg-bridge-article-1.2853493">according to the Daily News</a>, which reports that the man was in town for a wedding and was staying in Brooklyn. </p>

<p>A tipster who saw the body Tuesday morning told us, &quot;I thought it was a Halloween prank, until police showed up and covered him up.&quot;</p>
