<p>At around 1:15 a.m. MTA police officers fired at a 2006 Hummer that didn&apos;t stop at the Verrazano Narrows Bridge toll plaza. And it&apos;s believed the vehicle was carjacked at gunpoint.</p>

<p>The NYPD had asked the MTA&apos;s Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Police  to be on the lookout for a 2006 Hummer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164335/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/breaking_tbta_officers_fired_f.html#incart_m-rpt-1">From the Staten Island Advance</a>:</p><blockquote>One law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said that when the officers approached, they heard a loud bang that sounded like a gunshot, and someone inside threw a woman out of the Hummer. That sound is what spurred the officers to open fire, the source said.<p></p>

<p>The source also suggested that the vehicle might have been involved in something more serious than a carjacking -- it may have been reported in connection with a homicide, and a license plate reader picked it up as it passed through the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel, the name for the former Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.</p>

<p>A female passenger tried to flee and was arrested at the toll plaza, Ms. Baldeo said. Her identity was not immediately released to media, and her role in the drama was unclear Monday night.</p></blockquote>The male driver fled and eventually abandoned the vehicle on Targee Street. The Advance&apos;s source &quot;said that multiple people were still inside when the vehicle sped off, and that it crashed on Targee.&quot;<p></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164335/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/07/police-investigate-shooting-near-verrazano-narrows-bridge/">no reported injuries so far</a>. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
