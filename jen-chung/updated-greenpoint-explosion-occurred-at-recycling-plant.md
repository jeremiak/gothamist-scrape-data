Can&apos;t see anything but can hear sirens and fire trucks heading to the scene.  Don&apos;t know what happened.  I work at Diamond St. &amp; Meserole Ave., could feel the building shake.</em>&quot; &quot;<em>I live on Monitor St near McGolrick Park. There was just a very loud boom that shook the ground.  Now I hear sirens. All the neighbors are out on the street.  Any idea what happened?</em>&quot;  Did anyone else hear it?  Or does someone know?  We&apos;re also checking with authorities.  </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The 94th Precinct didn&apos;t have any information available but did say there were units at the scene.</p>

<p><b>Update 4:45 PM</b>: Mystery solved:  The Office of Emergency Management tells us that an acetylene tank at a recycling facility at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322022409/http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=540+kingsland+ave+brooklyn+ny&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=540+Kingsland+Ave,+Brooklyn,+NY+11222&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=mLezS9yqM4PGlQfDq8G7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA">540 Kingsland Avenue</a> exploded after getting hit by a &quot;piece of machinary.&quot; At this time, it&apos;s believed that there are only minor injuries.  So what&apos;s acetylene?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322022409/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene">According to Wikipedia</a>, &quot;Its singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized. Samples of concentrated or pure acetylene can easily react in an addition-type reaction to form a number of products.&quot; Thank God it wasn&apos;t one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322022409/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/11/ohny_spotlight_newtown_creek_water.php?gallery0Pic=5">sewage digester eggs</a>&#x2014;they are just across the street!</p>
