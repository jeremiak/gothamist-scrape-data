<p>Democrat Kathy Hochul won the 26th Congressional special election upstate in Buffalo, defeating Republican Jane Corwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093713/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/23/all_eyes_upstate_with_tight_special.php">in a Republican stronghold</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093713/http://www.buffalonews.com/topics/chris-lee/special-election/article432808.ece">Buffalo News reports</a>, with the headline, &quot;Hochul takes House seat in stunner,&quot; that Hochul &quot;defied political experts who had given her little chance of success, ground out a stunning and surprisingly comfortable victory,&quot; with 48% of the vote to Corwin&apos;s 42% with 87% of the districts reporting. And it&apos;s all thanks to one Congressman&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093713/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/09/rep_lee_resigns_after_leaked_craigs.php">shirtless photos and Craigslist date-searching</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093713/http://gawker.com/#!5755071/married-gop-congressman-sent-sexy-pictures-to-craigslist-babe">thanks, Gawker</a>!) and another Congressman&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093713/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/shutdown_looms_as_gop_courageously.php">Medicare overhaul ideas</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093713/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/nyregion/democrat-capture-house-seat-in-special-election.html?hp">NY Times paints this picture</a>, &quot;Democrats scored an upset in one of New York&#x2019;s most conservative Congressional districts on Tuesday, dealing a blow to the national Republican Party in a race that largely turned on the party&#x2019;s plan to overhaul Medicare. The results set off elation among Democrats and soul-searching among Republicans, who questioned whether the party should rethink its commitment to the Medicare plan, which appears to have become a liability as 2012 elections loom.&quot;</p>

<p>One woman told the Times, &quot;I have almost always voted the party line. This is the second time in my life I&#x2019;ve voted against my party.&quot; Another Republican who voted for Hochul said, &quot;The privatization of Medicare scares me.&quot; </p>

<p>On Monday, House Majority Whip Eric Cantor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093713/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrat-hochul-wins-ny-special-election/2011/05/24/AFwPGqAH_story.html?hpid=z3">told reporters</a>, &quot;I know this town loves to take signals from individual races. I think the best signal you can take is the 63 seats that we picked up in November,&quot; and then blamed Corwin&apos;s faltering numbers on the presence of Jack Davis, a previous Democrat candidate who ran on the Tea Party line.</p>
