<p>Police have arrested the two teens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132915/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/03/brooklyn_subway_beating.php">accused of attacking a 78-year-old woman</a> at a Brooklyn subway station&#x2014;and it turns out their mothers turned them in after seeing the surveillance images released by the authorities.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, on Thursday afternoon, at 3:30 p.m.,two girls approached the elderly victim on the southbound platform inside the Franklin Avenue subway station in Bed-Stuy. Police say the girls attacked the woman, beating her on the face, head, and body before fleeing the station on a southbound train. </p>

<p>The girls had been in a dispute with the woman on the train: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132915/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-hunt-2-teens-attacked-woman-78-brooklyn-article-1.2659602">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Norma Trotman, 78, asked one of the girls to remove her feet, which were up on a seat, so she could sit down on a Manhattan-bound C train Thursday. The girl refused and she and her friend started quarreling with the tired senior. When the elderly woman got off at the Franklin Ave. station in Bedford-Stuyvesant about 3:30 p.m. the creeps jumped her on the platform, kicking her in the head and all over her body, according to cops.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132915/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/03/elderly-woman-assaulted-brooklyn/">A Good Samaritan named Ted Hamilton</a> saw the victim being attacked, &quot;The girl attacked her from behind &#x2014; hit her in the face, knocked her down, and then another girl came and restrained the girl that was hitting her. She just told her to watch her back. That was it.&quot; </p>

<p>Hamilton carried Trotman upstairs from the platform and called the police. Trotman was treated at a hospital and later released.</p>

<p>The girls&apos; mothers turned brought them to the police; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132915/http://nypost.com/2016/06/03/two-teens-who-beat-up-elderly-woman-on-train-surrender/">the Post reports</a>, &quot;The two moms &apos;were probably offended like anyone else&apos; who heard about the senseless attack, one law-enforcement source said. &apos;And when they recognized their daughters, they were probably appalled.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Jazmine Watson, 16, was arrested as was a 15-year-old girl. Both have been charged wtih assault.</p>

<p>Trotman&apos;s son told the News, &quot;She&#x2019;s in pain. She&#x2019;s in a lot of pain,&quot; and said of the attack, &quot;What can I say? It happens to the best and the worst of us.&quot;</p>
