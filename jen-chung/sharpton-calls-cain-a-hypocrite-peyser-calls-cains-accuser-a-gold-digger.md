                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_11_cainpost.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216051537im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_cainpost.jpg" width="365" height="279" class="image-left"> </span>The revelations from Sharon Bialek that Republican frontrunner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216051537/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/4th_herman_cain_accuser_he_grabbed.php">Herman Cain allegedly grabbed her genitals</a>, pushed her head toward his crotch and said, &quot;You want a job, don&apos;t you?&quot; back in 1997 have provoked the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216051537/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/jobless_shameless_gal_going_for_EODvX4qUTV8XoJwYqVF0LJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">NY Post&apos;s Andrea Peyser to paint the blond mother as a gold digger</a> AND harsh on her make-up: &quot;Sharon Bialek is 50, out of work and, according to one who knows her, she&#x2019;s a smooth operator living way above her means. From the look of her heavily painted face, she&#x2019;s also soon to be in acute need of a new tub of eyeliner.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, Peyser cites an unnamed acquaintance of Bialek to round out her story, &quot;According to someone who knows Bialek: &apos;She has a very infectious personality. It&#x2019;s easy to see how she won [Cain] over. But the reality of her situation is -- she&#x2019;s a complete gold digger. It&#x2019;s all about the money.&apos;  The friend said she comes from a lower-middle-income family, but lives in a posh apartment running from bill collectors. &apos;Most of her jobs ended in termination. It&#x2019;s always the employer&#x2019;s fault, not hers.... This is a lady who lives off the system. She is hellbent on finding a way of never having to work and living the lifestyle she wants to live, a very affluent lifestyle. In my next life, I want to come back as her.&apos;&quot; Peyser also tries to question Bialek&apos;s allegations, &quot;Now, I love a good romantic farce as much as the next bored housewife. But the question remains: Why sit on this seeming sexual assault for 14 years?&quot;  </p>

<p>Cain himself has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216051537/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/08/video_herman_cain_spins_sexual_assa.php">trying to cast Bialek in an unflattering light</a>, mentioning her brushes with bankruptcy, and has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216051537/http://newsone.com/nation/associatedpress4/herman-cain-sexual-harassment-race/">blaming his sexual harassment allegation troubles on race</a>.  Which the Rev. Al Sharpton finds laughable.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216051537/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/al-sharpton-slams-herman-cain-hypocrisy-double-standard-racism-claims-article-1.974427?localLinksEnabled=false&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29">Sharpton told the Daily News</a>, &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s the height of hypocrisy for Herman Cain to say three weeks ago that race was no longer a major factor in this country. Now that he&apos;s a target, he gets on Fox and says &#x2018;Yes, race has something to do with it.&#x2019;&#x201D; Sharpton added, &quot;So let me get this right: there is no racism for those that are disproportionately unemployed or disproportionately incarcerated, but it&#x2019;s race if four women come forward and say you allegedly harassed them?&#x201D;</p>
