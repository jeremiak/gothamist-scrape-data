<p>Here are some more details:</p><blockquote>Amtrak service between New York and Washington is unaffected. The Springfield Shuttle will operate as scheduled.<p></p>

<p>Passengers who have paid but choose not to travel due to this service disruption can receive a refund or a voucher for future travel. Some tickets booked online that have not yet been printed can be modified or canceled on Amtrak.com or by using the free Amtrak mobile app.</p>
