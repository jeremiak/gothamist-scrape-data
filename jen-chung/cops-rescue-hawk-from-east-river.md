<p>Two NYPD Harbor Unit officers saved a majestic hawk from the water yesterday morning. Apparently they were alerted to the &quot;distressed&quot; bird when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073555/http://nypost.com/2015/11/29/nypd-rescues-distressed-hawk-from-east-river/">the Post reports</a>, &quot;they saw a flock of seagulls converging on a spot under&quot; the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p>Officers Christopher Kessinger, 26, and Steven Khaykin, 30, saw the hawk trying to flap its wings but unsuccessfully fly out. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073555/http://nypdnews.com/2015/11/eagle-eyed-cops-rescue-hawk/">According to the NYPD</a>, Kessinger put on &quot;cloth gloves coated with plastic&quot; and pulled the bird out of the water and into the boat.&quot; Then he and Khaykin dried the bird off with a towel. The police say, &quot;In the process of drying the bird off, it hopped back on Officer Kessinger&#x2019;s arm, where it stayed for several minutes.  The bird then flew off towards Manhattan in the direction of Battery Park.&quot;</p>

<p>Kessinger said, &quot;He was just hanging out. He calmed down and knew we were not going to hurt him.&quot; One question: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073555/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/firefighters_cop_cat_oxygen.php">Do they make oxygen masks</a> for hawks? </p>
