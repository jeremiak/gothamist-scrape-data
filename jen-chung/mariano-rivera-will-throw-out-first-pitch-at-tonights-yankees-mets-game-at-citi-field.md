<p>Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera, the greatest closer of all time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/exit_sandman_marino_rivera_announce.php">is retiring after this season</a> and he&apos;s been embarking on a farewell tour, meeting with fans and employees of opposing teams during Yankees&apos; road games. Yesterday, he met Mets&apos; fans and staffers and, tonight, the Mets have asked him to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/https://twitter.com/BryanHoch/status/339484459424444416">throw out the game&apos;s first pitch</a>. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/https://twitter.com/Mets/status/339501475820630016">The game is still on</a>, so far...)</p>

<p>Mets COO Jeff Wilpon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/https://twitter.com/AdamRubinESPN/status/339484631902588928">also told him</a>, &quot;I wish we could see you in the World Series, but I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s going to happen.&quot; </p>

<p>The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/sports/baseball/mariano-riveras-farewell-tour-comes-to-citi-field.html?_r=0"> NY Times described Rivera&apos;s visit</a> with Mets fans and employees&#x2014;and how special it was:</p><blockquote>For the past 27 seasons as a Mets season-ticket holder, 76-year-old Gloria Feit has watched her team routinely overshadowed by the hated Yankees. It has not always been for Feit to be a Mets fan, especially because her husband is a Yankees fan.<p></p>

<p>It was painful watching the 2000 World Series and seeing Mariano Rivera throw the final pitch that would break many Mets fans&#x2019; hearts. Few players better represent the Yankees&#x2019; dominance over their city rivals than Rivera, who has converted 20 of 22 save opportunities against the Mets. For many Mets fans, Rivera will always symbolize a period when the Yankees undoubtedly were the kings of New York.</p>

<p>Yet when the opportunity came for Feit to be a part of a small gathering of Mets fans and employees to meet with Rivera as part of his farewell tour, Feit did not hesitate to accept.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s one of the best,&#x201D; Feit said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how I&#x2019;d feel if it were any other Yankee. He&#x2019;s probably the exception.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>He&apos;s also met with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/http://www.freep.com/article/20130407/COL38/304070244/Jeff-Seidel-Yankees-closer-Mariano-Rivera-s-rare-talent-worth-celebrating">Detroit Tigers fans</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130511&amp;content_id=47269862&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb">Kansas City Royals fans</a>, and Cleveland Indians fans. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/11/mariano-keeps-it-classy-in-cleveland-thanks-indians-staffers-for-memories/">WCBS 2 reported</a> about the meeting in Cleveland:<blockquote>&#x201C;Where&#x2019;s the drummer?&#x201D; Rivera asked.<p></p>

<p>He wanted to finally meet the man who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730175235/http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110909&amp;content_id=24436870&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;c_id=cle">kept a steady sports beat in Cleveland</a> for 40 years, the guy sitting at the top of the bleachers year after year pounding away to spark a rally.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Right here,&#x201D; John Adams said, raising one of his drum sticks so the New York legend could see him in the back of the room.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Hey, you the man,&#x201D; Rivera said. &#x201C;Being loyal, being there day in and day out. I really respect that.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Adams replied: &#x201C;This is stress relief for me. And you&#x2019;ve given me a lot of stress.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Um, it&apos;s dusty in here. <p></p>
