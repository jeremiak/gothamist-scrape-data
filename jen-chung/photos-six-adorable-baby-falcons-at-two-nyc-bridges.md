                            <p>Some super-cute news from the MTA: Six peregrine falcon chicks were born last month at the top of the two bridges. The Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge welcomes three baby birds of prey while the Throgs Neck Bridge also had three!</p>

<p>Falcons love NYC&apos;s tall buildings and bridges because it gives them a better view to hunt prey. The MTA said:</p><blockquote>This year marks the 30th year of participation by MTA Bridges and Tunnels in the State Department of Environmental Conservation&#x2019;s nesting program, which began in New York City in 1983. New York City Department of Environmental Protection&#x2019;s Wildlife Studies Division Specialist Chris Nadareski coordinates the program in the city, climbing high atop various buildings and bridges each year to band and record the falcons.<br>
 <br>
The newest MTA peregrines include two males and a female at Marine Parkway Bridge and two females and a male at the Throgs Neck Bridge. The Marine Parkway peregrine chicks hatched 215-feet atop the bridge&#x2019;s Rockaway tower and the Throgs Neck chicks hatched 360-feet on the bridge&#x2019;s Bronx tower. <br>
 <br>
&#x201C;Other than providing the nesting box, our primary goal during mating season and until the chicks leave the nest is to stay out of their way,&#x201D; said Marine Parkway Maintenance Superintendent Carlton Cyrus. There are no other costs associated with housing the peregrines.</blockquote>Peregrine falcons, which are on the NY State DEC&apos;s endangered birds list (they were nearly wiped out in the 1960s because of pesticides), mate for life. <p></p>
