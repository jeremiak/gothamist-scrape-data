Others camp out overnight in lower Manhattan in hopes of getting an application for a union job.<p></p>

<p>Hundreds of people are waiting to get 750 applications for a spot with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters local 157 training program. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032557/http://pix11.com/2013/08/17/hundreds-camp-out-for-days-for-chance-at-dream-job/#axzz2cKRHCVL0">According to PIX 11</a>, &quot;The carpenter hopefuls have brought tents, sleeping bags and hammocks plus coolers of food and drinks to get them through what is for some up to 175 hours of waiting for a shot at getting a job that can pay up to $50 an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>The first person in line has been there a week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032557/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9210289">He told WABC 7</a>, &quot;It&apos;s tough, no showers, you&apos;re sitting here all day, walking around. But you know what, the end result is the pot of gold, which is to get my name on that ticket so I can get called for an interview, and to really show the dedication, because I&apos;ve been here all week.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032557/http://nycdistrictcouncil.com/for-immediate-release-carpenters-recruit-apprentices.aspx">According to the union</a>, &quot;One hundred (100) application cards will be available for linoleum, resilient, tile and carpet layer, one hundred fifty (150) application cards will be available for carpenter (pile driver/dockbuilder) and, five hundred (500) application cards will be available for carpenter.&quot;</p>
