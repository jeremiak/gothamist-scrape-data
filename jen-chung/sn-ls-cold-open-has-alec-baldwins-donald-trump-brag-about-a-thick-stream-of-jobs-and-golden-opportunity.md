</div></div>					<p>If you were hoping that <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, back after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015217/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/18/trump_putin_snl_cold_open.php">four-week break</a>, would bring up the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015217/https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia?utm_term=.qi0DeQMbJ#.txyWaB2X4">extremely unverified</a> but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015217/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/trump_russian_intelligence_blackmail.php">extremely crazy</a> dossier about compromising info Russian intelligence has on Donald Trump, you&apos;re in luck. The cold open tackled the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015217/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/11/watch_trump_press_conference.php">President-elect&apos;s surreal press conference</a>, featuring Alec Baldwin promising, &quot;Yes, this is real life, this is really happening. On January 20, I, Donald J. Trump, will become the 45th president of the United States. And then, two months later, Mike Pence will become the 46th.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But really, Baldwin&apos;s Trump did not want to talk about the &quot;pee pee. It wasn&#x2019;t as cool as it sounds.&quot; Still, a reporter, played by Vanessa Bayer, persisted, &quot;Did you guys, like, all pee or just watch them pee?&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015217if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_Gf0mGJfP8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>&quot;Trump&quot; pivoted to talk about the economy and American people, &quot;I am going to bring back a thick stream of jobs back to this country. The biggest, strongest, steadiest stream you&#x2019;ve ever seen. This country will be literally showered with jobs. Because I am a major wiz at jobs. It will be a golden opportunity for me as president to make a big splash. I know you&#x2019;re in. How about you? You&#x2019;re in? You&#x2019;re in? You&#x2019;re in?&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously the challenge for <em>SNL</em> was to parody an event that was already its own circus. So they brought in Donald Jr. and Eric Trump (&quot;You could tell they&apos;re good businessmen because how slicked back their hair is&quot;); his tax lawyer Sheri A. Dillon (&quot;Look at all these papers! If he wasn&apos;t divesting, how could there be so many dang papers?&quot;); Steve Harvey (&quot;I do government now&quot;); and Vladimir Putin, with a visual aid.</p>

<p>There was also a reference to how some Trump supporters (really, Obama haters) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015217/https://imgur.com/gallery/rWIhcx6">don&apos;t realize that ACA and Obamacare</a> are one in the same. After a reporter (Sasheer Zamata) asks how he can repeal Obamacare without a replacement, &quot;Trump&quot; explained, &quot;I actually do have a replacement plan, O.K.? I just read about it this week. It&apos;s a terrific plan. Just great. It&apos;s called the Affordable Care Act.&quot;</p>

<p>The reporter points out, &quot;That&apos;s the same thing as Obamacare and if you repeal it, twenty million people will lose their health insurance. I mean, people could die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, sweetheart, I&apos;m about to be president, we&apos;re all going to die,&quot; Baldwin as Trump retorted. </p>

<p>Five days.</p>
