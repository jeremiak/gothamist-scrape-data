(Ryan Seacrest)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>If you&apos;re going to be stuck in an elevator, it&apos;s probably helpful to have over 18 million followers on Twitter and Instagram, and a strong wifi signal. Radio and TV personality Ryan Seacrest helpfully kept everyone informed when they were trapped on an elevator this morning, which Seacrest was taking up to the Times Square New Year&apos;s Eve ball:</p>

<p>Seacrest hosts <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101163648/http://abc.go.com/shows/new-years-rockin-eve">Dick Clark&apos;s New Year&apos;s Rockin&apos; Eve with Ryan Seacrest</a></em>. In the elevator, his team can be seen frantically calling to the appropriate parties to let them know they are stuck, while he jokes about how a substitute for the show could be easily found, as all they need to do is count down from ten:</p>

<p>The <em>Good Morning America</em> team used his flight as fodder:</p>

<p>Mariah Carey is the headliner for the show&#x2014;she said, &quot;I am so excited to return to &#x2018;Dick Clark&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Rockin&#x2019; Eve with Ryan Seacrest&#x2019; and feel blessed to be a part of this year&#x2019;s magical celebration. I can&#x2019;t wait to perform once again for my incredible fans as we ring in the New Year together live from Times Square.&#x201D;</p>
