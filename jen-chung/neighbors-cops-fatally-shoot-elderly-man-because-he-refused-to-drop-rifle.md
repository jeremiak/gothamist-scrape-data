<p>Yesterday, the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164346/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/12/queens_man_who_allegedly_shot_daugh.php">fatally shot an 86-year-old</a> who allegedly killed his 65-year-old daughter. Police said that Jack Calvello was holding a loaded 12-gauge shotgun when they reached his home on 38th Street and asked him to drop the firearm. However, Calvello turned, still holding the rifle, and police shot him. </p>

<p>Neighbors agreed with that version of events. A teen who had been playing basketball <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164346/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/12/police-cop-shot-killed-86-year-old-man-who-pointed-gun-at-officers/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;[The cops] were coming up the stairs with the guns and they told him get out and he comes out with a gun. They told him drop it, and he doesn&#x2019;t and he shot him.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164346/http://nypost.com/2014/04/12/man-wielding-shotgun-killed-by-cops-after-shooting-daughter-dog/">He added</a>, &quot;We thought the guy with the rifle, if he would have fired, he would have hit us&#x2026;.the gun was pointed at us.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164346/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-shoot-armed-man-queens-apartment-nypd-article-1.1754362">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;A sergeant and an officer peeked through the front-door glass at the two-story home on 38th St. and saw Calvello coming toward them. The cops scrambled down four steps and shouted from the sidewalk. But Calvello kept charging toward them and refused to drop his weapon, prompting one of the officers to shoot him in the abdomen, police said.&quot;</p>

<p>Calvello had apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164346/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-shoot-armed-man-queens-apartment-nypd-article-1.1754362">called the police in the afternoon, saying</a>, &quot;I shot my daughter and my dog.&quot; After police officers shot Calvello, they found Carolann Matyka, 65, inside with a gunshot wound to the head. Matyka was pronounced dead at Elmhurst Hospital. The dog, a Yorkshire Terrier, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164346/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9501754">is being treated for a neck injury</a> and is expected to survive.</p>

<p>Another neighbor said of Calvello, &quot;He&apos;s a really nice guy. I see him pushing his shopping cart going to the supermarket. I even see his daughter walking his dog. Something that you never think would happen over here.&quot; </p>
