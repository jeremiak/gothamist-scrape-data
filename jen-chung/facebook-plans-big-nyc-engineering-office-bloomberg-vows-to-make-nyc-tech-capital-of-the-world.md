<p>Yesterday, Facebook announced plans to open a new engineering office in NYC next year&#x2014;and they will be hiring immediately.  Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://twitter.com/#!/MikeBloomberg/status/142716026805682176">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Facebook tapping into NYC&#x2019;s talent proves we&#x2019;re on our way to becoming tech capital of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>The mayor appeared with Senator Charles Schumer, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, and Facebook VP of Engineering Mike Schroepfer at the social media giant&apos;s Manhattan offices (they have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/12/02/facebook-goes-on-new-york-hiring-spree/?mod=WSJBlog">marketing and advertising there</a>) this afternoon, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/12/02/bloomberg_articlesLVLEIT0YHQ0X.DTL">Schreopfer said</a>, &quot;Operating at such a large scale, and innovating as quickly as we do, we need to recruit the most talented engineers in the world,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57335870-93/facebook-likes-big-apple-for-engineering-office/">adding</a>, &quot;This isn&apos;t a satellite office but a core part of our engineering stack.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg, who graduated with an engineering degree from Johns Hopkins (he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/dear_mayor_bloomberg_how_do_magnets.php">knows about magnets</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/26/bloomberg_think.php">believes science is good</a>), has been pushing for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/dear_mayor_bloomberg_how_do_magnets.php">development of a big tech campus in the city</a>.  He namedropped homegrown tech and social media companies, like Foursquare, Etsy and Gilt, said, &quot;I really do encourage all tech companies to do what Facebook is doing now, and make New York City your hub of operations... Don&apos;t wait until your competitors are already here.&quot;  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726154743/http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/12/02/facebook-prepping-for-massive-hiring-spree/">Schumer joked,</a> &quot;<strong>New York is pleased to call Facebook a friend</strong>,&quot; saying there was &quot;<strong>so much to like about Facebook&#x2014;get it?</strong>&quot;</p>
