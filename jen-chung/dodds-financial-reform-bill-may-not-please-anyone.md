										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:290px; "> <img alt="2010_03_cdodd.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223072135im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_cdodd.jpg" width="290" height="243"> <br> <i>Photograph of Senator Dodd from the AP</i></div> Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Connecticut) is set to unveil a financial reform bill that gives more power the Federal Reserve and includes &quot;legislation tougher on financial companies than was expected just a few weeks ago&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223072135/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703457104575122023705041834.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal</a>) and a &quot;new government watchdog for financial consumers [to] be housed within the Fed&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223072135/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62D1YI20100315">Reuters</a>).  And, to make matters more exciting, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223072135/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34387.html">Politico says</a>, &quot;Neither side will be satisfied by what Dodd&apos;s offering, and particularly the left.&quot;<p></p>

<p>President Obama had wanted the consumer protection agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, to be stand-alone, but Dodd put it inside the Fed like the GOP wanted. The agency would write rules on credit cards and mortgages, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223072135/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/business/15regulate.html?ref=business">NY  Times reports</a>, &quot;In a concession to liberals, states&#x2019; attorneys general could sue violators of those rules, and the agency would have enforcement powers over large banks, mortgage originators and servicers, and other large lenders.&quot; However, the consumer rules could be overturned by another &quot;council of regulators&quot; (a Republican idea).</p>

<p>Additionally, the bill will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223072135/http://www.cnbc.com/id/35873175">give the Fed oversight</a> of bank-holding companies &quot;and other firms with assets over $50 billion that pose a systemic risk to the system,&quot; like AIG. </p>
