<p>U.S. stock markets are plummeting&#x2014;the Dow is now down over 500 points (-4.41%) while the S&amp;P; 500 has fallen 4.76% and the Nasdaq has lost 5.24%. Why?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083930/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903596904576515871856592498.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, it&apos;s because of &quot;disappointing U.S. economic news and Europe&apos;s ongoing sovereign debt problems.&quot;</p>
