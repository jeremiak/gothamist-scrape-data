<p>No one is happy with Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s 2012 Fiscal Year budget, a $65.7 billion plan that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063641/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/nyregion/bloomberg-budget-calls-for-teacher-layoffs.html?ref=nyregion">will involve 5,400 city layoffs</a>&#x2014;4,100 of them coming from the ranks of teachers (a 5% reduction in city teachers).  A Brooklyn teacher whose job is threatened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063641/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/07/2011-05-07_our_kids_will_be_the_littlest_victims_say_parents.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I&apos;m really disappointed. With the population increases, I can&apos;t imagine what class sizes are going to be next year... The most vulnerable children will be hurt the most.&quot; For his part, Bloomberg blamed a lot of the mess on Albany and Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Bloomberg, who said, &quot;This budget is full of difficult decisions,&quot; explained, &quot;We are not immune to the realities in Albany and Washington. And the reality is, both places are keeping more of our tax dollars to close their own budget deficits. I am sympathetic to their need for budget cuts, but actions taken to close their deficits came without changing the burdens they impose on City taxpayers.&quot;  In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063641/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011a%2Fpr141-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">per the city&apos;s press release</a>, here&apos;s the &quot;State and Federal Disinvestment in NYC&quot;:</p><blockquote>The last 10 years have seen the State and Federal governments&#x2019; share of the City&#x2019;s budget continue to decline.<p></p>

<p>In FY 2002, the combined State and Federal share of the City&#x2019;s budget was 36 percent. In FY 2012, the combined State and Federal share of the City&#x2019;s budget will be only 27 percent.</p>

<p>If the City continued to receive the same percentage of its total budget from State and Federal resources as it did in FY 2002, the City would have received an additional $6.1 billion in State and Federal support FY 2012.</p>

<p>An additional $6.1 billion of State and Federal resources would have reduced the local tax burden for services or New York City taxpayers by 15 percent, or an additional $6.1 billion in State/Federal resources would have eliminated the need for any of the actions in the 10 rounds of budget saving actions taken since 2008.</p></blockquote><br>
Bloomberg also blamed rising costs on...pensions and benefits (one example was that half of the NYPD&apos;s costs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063641/http://twitter.com/#!/azipaybarah/status/66509604024098816">were in pensions and benefits</a>).  He also suggested bringing in more revenue by adding more traffic cameras.<p></p>

<p>The City Council still needs to approve the budget, and it&apos;s possible Bloomberg will pull back on cuts in order to win support, but it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063641/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/nyregion/bloombergs-planned-teacher-layoffs-imperil-his-legacy.html?ref=nyregion">doubtful all the teachers&apos; jobs can be saved</a>.  </p>
