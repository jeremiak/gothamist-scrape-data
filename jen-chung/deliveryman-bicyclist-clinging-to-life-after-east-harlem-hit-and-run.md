<p>A restaurant deliveryman on a bicycle was struck by a car on Lexington Avenue near East 104th Street. The victim was taken to Cornell Hospital and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420193843/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/nyregion/man-critically-injured-in-hit-and-run.html?ref=nyregion">reportedly &quot;clinging to life.&quot;</a></p>

<p>According to police, the deliveryman was traveling southbound on Lexington Avenue, with traffic, when a white vehicle also going south on Lexington struck him near 104th Street. The car fled. The victim, who apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420193843/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9507727">delivers for a Chinese restaurant </a>on Third Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420193843/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/nyregion/man-critically-injured-in-hit-and-run.html?ref=nyregion">was in cardiac arrest</a> when responders arrived.</p>

<p>If you have ever been on Lexington Avenue in East Harlem, you&apos;ll know that Lexington inclines steeply from 103rd Street to 102nd Street, which might inspire some drivers to start revving up. </p>
