<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235942/http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/">Tribeca Film Festival</a> has announced what movie will kick off the festivities on April 18: <em>Five-Year Engagement</em>, about an engaged couple, played by Jason Segel and Emily Blunt, and their journey to the altar.  The couple even has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235942/http://tomandviolet.com/blog/#.T05I9WDgJNQ">wedding website</a> and a video from groom-to-be Tom:</p>

<p>The movie was written by Segel and Nicholas Stoller&#x2014;Stoller also directed (the pair last teamed up for <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>, which Segel wrote and Stoller directed)&#x2014;and other stars include Rhys Ifans, Chris Pratt and Alison Brie. Further &quot;bro&quot; credit comes in the form of producer Judd Apatow. Stoller said, &quot;When Jason and I met during the production of Undeclared, we couldn&#x2019;t have imagined that one day we would write a comedy that would open such a prestigious film festival as Tribeca. We are so honored that the festival organizers have given us this platform to premiere the film. <strong>To be honest, this is all just a ploy to stand on top of a building with Robert De Niro and look out over New York City at dusk.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235942/http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/">Tribeca Film Festival</a> runs from April 18 through April 29, and the rest of the feature film slate will be announced next week, split between March 6 and March 8.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235942/http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/tickets/">Advance selection ticket packages and passes go on sale</a> on Monday, March 5, for American Express cardholders; the general public has a crack at them on March 12.
