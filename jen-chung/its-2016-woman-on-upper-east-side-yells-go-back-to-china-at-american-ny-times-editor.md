title: It's 2016: Woman On Upper East Side Yells, 'Go Back To China' At (American) NY Times Editor

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_10_mluo12.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_10_mluo12.jpg" width="275" height="275"> <br> <i style=" width:275px; ;display:block"> Michael Luo (Twitter)</i></div> An editor at the NY Times used Twitter to recount an extremely disturbing incident that unfolded in Manhattan today. Or it just sums up what America has turned into, a depressing cauldron of resentment and ignorance. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://twitter.com/michaelluo/status/785155341839458304">Michael Luo tweeted</a>, &quot;Well dressed woman on Upper East Side, annoyed by our stroller, yells: &quot;Go back to China...go back to your f---ing country.&quot; #thisis2016.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://twitter.com/michaelluo/status/785172914358349824">he continued</a>, &quot;I ran after the woman and confronted her and said I was born in this country.  But I felt silly. How to prove this country is mine too?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://twitter.com/palafo/status/785184245337776128">A colleague asked</a>, &quot;Any contrition or apology from her?&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://twitter.com/michaelluo/status/785185120839958528">Luo replied</a>, &quot;Uh no. She pulled out her iPhone 6 Plus and threatened to call the cops.&quot;</p>

<p>Luo told us he and his family were headed to lunch with another family. They had stopped in front of a restaurant, debating whether to go in. &quot;We were over to the side of the sidewalk but this woman was walking past and aggravated we were in her way,&quot; he recalled. That&apos;s when she first yelled, &quot;Go back to China!&quot;</p>

<p>He approached her, asking &quot;Really? Go back to China?&quot; and she threatened to call the police. &quot;I walked back to the restaurant and she yelled after me, &apos;Go back to your f---ing country.&apos;&quot; To that, Luo said, &quot;I was born in this country,&quot; before heading into the restaurant.</p>

<p>After the exchange, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://twitter.com/michaelluo/status/785178347760418816">he shared</a>, &quot;Now my 7 year old, distressed by what happened, keeps asking, &apos;Why did she say, &quot;Go back to China?&quot; We&apos;re not from China.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Last week, Fox News  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/05/fox_news_chinatown_video.php">aired a willfully racist, anti-Asian segment</a> set in Chinatown, ostensibly to take the temperature of how people felt about the presidential election, since Donald Trump kept mentioning China negatively. The clip only ended up ridiculing Asians, conflating Asian cultures and further confirming that Fox News has no desire to connect with people besides whites. </p>

<p>&quot;This sort of thing, of course, happens all of the time. But for some reason, this time, I just felt this real sadness about it and was really dwelling on this question of Asian American identity and belonging,&quot; Luo said to us. His Tweets reflect that:</p>

<p>And don&apos;t worry&#x2014;there are white supremacists attacking Luo on Twitter now, because that&apos;s what The World Is Today. </p>

<p><b>Update 1</b>: Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed his support for Luo:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://twitter.com/michaelluo">@michaelluo</a> - Shouldn&apos;t have to affirm it, but EVERYONE belongs in NYC. What doesn&apos;t belong here are comments like you heard today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://t.co/8DvdLgdwhv">pic.twitter.com/8DvdLgdwhv</a></p>&#x2014; Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/https://twitter.com/BilldeBlasio/status/785214142487601152">October 9, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170916221134js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p><b>Update 2 </b>: The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916221134/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/nyregion/to-the-woman-who-told-my-family-to-go-back-to-china.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=7&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">published an open letter from Luo to the woman</a>:</p><blockquote>You had on a nice rain coat. Your iPhone was a 6 Plus. You could have been a fellow parent in one of my daughters&#x2019; schools. You seemed, well, normal. But you had these feelings in you, and, the reality is, so do a lot of people in this country right now.<p></p>

<p>Maybe you don&#x2019;t know this, but the insults you hurled at my family get to the heart of the Asian-American experience. It&#x2019;s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day. That no matter what we do, how successful we are, what friends we make, we don&#x2019;t belong. We&#x2019;re foreign. We&#x2019;re not American. It&#x2019;s one of the reasons that Fox News segment the other day on Chinatown by Jesse Watters, with the karate and nunchucks and broken English, generated so much outrage.</p></blockquote><p></p>
