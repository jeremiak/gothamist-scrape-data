<p>While Giants fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012743/http://nypost.com/2014/10/12/everything-goes-wrong-for-giants-in-philly-humiliation/">were miserable</a> after the 27-0 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles (a game which also saw Victor Cruz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012743/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/sports/football/giants-momentum-crashes-in-blowout-loss-to-eagles.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0">suffer a knee injury</a>), Eagles fans were obviously much happier. So exultant, in fact, that one fan allegedly ran off with another fan&apos;s prosthetic leg.</p>

<p>Philadelphia musician Sonny Forriest Jr., a Vietnam veteran, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012743/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Man-Claims-Woman-Stole-His-Prosthetic-Leg-Outside-Eagles-Game-278972641.html">spoke to NBC Philadelphia</a> about the bizarre incident. He said &quot;he was singing in the parking lot around 8:30 p.m. when the theft took place. Forriest Jr., who began using a motorized wheelchair after losing his leg, said he had taken off his prosthetic leg during his performance. He was packing up his car to get going when a group of people danced around him.&quot; He said, &quot;There were some friends who were partying with the leg, then they put it back.&quot; </p>

<p>But then, he said a woman in her 20s wearing Eagles clothing &quot;jumped in my lap. She gripped my leg and I didn&#x2019;t even know it. I looked down and she took my leg! Then she disappeared! A young lady came up, snatched my leg off my chair and took off!&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012743/http://6abc.com/news/veterans-prosthetic-leg-stolen-outside-the-linc/347775/">Forriest told WPVI</a>, &quot;She said, &apos;I will pay you for it.&apos; I said, &apos;That&apos;s all right, baby, go ahead and have a good time.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Forriest filed a police report and, around midnight, the leg was found by a SEPTA train conductor on the Broad Street Line. </p>

<p>Police believe the woman was intoxicated and that two other women helped her commit the dastardly deed (which is still not as bad as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012743/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/16/phillies_fan_allegedly_forced_himse.php">Phillies fan who intentionally puked on a child</a>). The veteran got his leg back and doesn&apos;t think the woman needs to be charged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012743/http://6abc.com/news/veterans-prosthetic-leg-stolen-outside-the-linc/347775/">&quot;but [thinks] someone should talk to her about her actions.&quot;</a></p>
