<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_lincclose.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041521im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_lincclose.jpg" width="365" height="233" class="image-left"> </span>Drivers heading to NJ via the Lincoln Tunnel this morning got a rude awakening because a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041521/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/lincoln-tunnel-closure-20110325-KC">tractor-trailer overturned on the helix</a> in Weehawken, NJ around 5:30 a.m., causing the Port Authority to close the NJ bound tunnels.  MyFoxNY reports, &quot;Only buses are being allowed through the north tube into New Jersey and there is no inbound express bus service.&quot; Drivers are being told to use the Holland Tunnel or George Washington Bridge instead.</p>

<p>Because the Lincoln Tunnel to NJ is closed, traffic is diverted onto local roads to get to the Holland Tunnel and GWB, so it&apos;s probably been fun for all drivers.  NJ Transit is honoring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041521/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/25/lincoln-tunnel-traffic-slowed-by-overturned-truck/">bus passes on its trains</a>, too.</p>
