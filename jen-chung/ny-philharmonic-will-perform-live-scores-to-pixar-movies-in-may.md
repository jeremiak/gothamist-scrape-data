<p>John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, said, &quot;Music, to me, is one of the most important things to give a movie emotion. Lighting, color, and music are all things I use as a storyteller.&quot; Like the cheese and strawberry scene from <em>Ratatouille</em>&#x2014;or most any scene from <em>Wall&#xB7;E</em>:</p>
