<p>A pair of burglars struck the Indonesian Consulate in Manhattan early yesterday morning, taking advantage on an unlocked door. The NYPD has now released surveillance footage of the suspects, who stole a seemingly random array of items.  </p>

<p>Police say that at around 1 a.m. on August 22nd, a man and a woman snuck into the consulate, located at 5 East 68th Street, through an unlocked side door. While inside, they allegedly took &quot;a case of Vodka, a Samsung tablet, a suitcase full of clothing and keys to a van. The suspects used the van keys to drive off in a 2004 tan colored Honda Odyssey.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The male suspect is described as being 18-25 years old, last seen wearing gray sweatpants and dark colored sandals (he appears to have a black shirt on his shoulder), and the female suspect is described as being 18-25 years old, with black hair,  last seen wearing a black and white striped tank top, dark colored pants and white sneakers. Here&apos;s surveillance footage from inside the consulate:<br>

It&#x2019;s random. I feel very surprised and disturbed.&quot;<br>
