<p>After learning her two-year-old daughter died in an apartment fire, a 20-year-old woman was charged with reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child. The fire was extinguished at 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning, but the mother, Leila Aquino, reportedly didn&apos;t ask firefighters where her daughter was until 9:30 a.m.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2015_02_leilaaquino.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801210732im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_02_leilaaquino.jpg" width="320" height="320"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> Leila Aquino (Facebook)</i></div> Aquino is apparently a stripper who finished work when she returned to the building at 755 Monroe Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801210732/http://nypost.com/2016/02/23/2-year-old-girl-killed-in-fire-at-bed-stuy-home/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;When Aquino arrived home to find the tragic scene, she was carrying a box that contained $980 &#x2014; all in $1 bills, tips she had earned from her night of dancing at a gentleman&#x2019;s club, sources said. When she learned that her child was dead, Aquino collapsed to the ground in tears.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The body of Kaleenah Muldrow was found under a bed; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801210732/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/firefighters-find-dead-body-early-morning-brooklyn-blaze-article-1.2540944">the News says</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s believed the tot hid [there] in a panic when the fire started&quot; around 6:30 a.m. </p>

<p>Aquino allegedly claimed that Kaleenah was with a babysitter. The baby&apos;s father, Kason Muldrow, was at the scene and spoke to Aquino before cops took her in for questioning. He said Aquino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801210732/http://abc7ny.com/news/mom-charged-after-2-year-old-daughter-found-dead-in-brooklyn-fire/1214759/">told him that their child was with a babysitter</a>: &quot;That&apos;s what she said ... but who is to say there was really a sitter? I&apos;m not 100 percent convinced she ever had a sitter.&quot; </p>

<p>The News adds, &quot;Aquino and Kaleenah lived in the third-floor apartment of the building, which is owned by Muldrow&#x2019;s father. Muldrow moved out after the couple broke up.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Post&apos;s sources, &quot;[T]he baby sitter denied that claim, saying, in fact, that she had stopped working for Aquino earlier this month because the pole-dancing mom owed her money. When confronted with the conflicting information, Aquino broke down and admitted she had been working at a strip bar overnight.&quot;</p>

Kason Muldrow said, &quot;It&apos;s like a nightmare.&quot;</p>
