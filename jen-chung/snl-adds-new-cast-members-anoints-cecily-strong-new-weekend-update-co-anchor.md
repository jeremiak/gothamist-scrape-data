<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162402/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/19/videos_saturday_night_live_bids_far.php">three big departures</a> last season and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162402/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/really_seth_meyers_will_take_over_l.php">another planned for February</a>, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> creator Lorne Michaels has been busy making sure the show will be ready for its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162402/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/09/tina_fey_will_host_snls_39th_season.php">39th season premiere </a>on September 28th, with host and ex-cast member/head writer Tina Fey. Michaels <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162402/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/business/media/saturday-night-live-setting-its-new-cast.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">confirmed names of new cast members with the NY Times</a>, and revealed that Cecily Strong will co-anchor Weekend Update with Seth Meyers.</p>

<p>From the Times:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Cecily, from the first show, was right there,&#x201D; Mr. Michaels said. &#x201C;She exploded.&#x201D; One of her regular characters was a visitor to the &#x201C;Update&#x201D; desk &#x2014; the Girl You Wished You Hadn&#x2019;t Started a Conversation With at a Party.<p></p>

<p>Mr. Michaels said his general plan was to have Ms. Strong share the &#x201C;Update&#x201D; desk with Mr. Meyers for the season&#x2019;s initial shows and then segue into a solo role later, maybe in the first season &#x2014; but maybe not. If possible, Mr. Michaels would like to see Mr. Meyers stay on &#x201C;Weekend Update&#x201D; even after he moves to &#x201C;Late Night,&#x201D; starting on Feb. 24.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Seth is a unique case,&#x201D; Mr. Michaels said, noting that the new late-night show would not have a Friday edition, letting Mr. Meyers potentially drop in and work that day and Saturday on &#x201C;Update.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Beck Bennett, John Milhiser, No&#xEB;l Wells, Kyle Mooney and Brooks Wheelan will be the new cast members. SNL writer Mike O&#x2019;Brien is also joining as a cast member while Tim Robinson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162402/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/03/videos_saturday_night_live_2.php#photo-9">a cast member last year</a>, will join the writing staff.<p></p>

<p>Michaels also commented about viewers being upset about cast departures whenever there&apos;s a big turnover, &quot;People attach to the cast they see in high school. In those years they generally can&#x2019;t drive. They don&#x2019;t have any money. Staying up late is exciting. Being with friends up late is really exciting. So they&#x2019;re very connected to the cast they see then.&quot;</p>
