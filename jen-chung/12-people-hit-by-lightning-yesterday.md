One of those people was fatally hit--a 38-year-old NJ man who was laying on a Sandy Hook beach with friends (two of them were also hit).  Five men who had been playing soccer in HIcksvile but took shelter from the storm under a tree were also hit when lightning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904063101/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/nyregion/28lightning.html?ref=nyregion">struck the tree</a>.  Four other were injured during a lightning strike in Cape May, NJ.  While a National Weather Service meteorologist told the NY Times, &quot;It was just a stormy day,&quot; a National Parks Service spokesman said of the lightning on Sandy Hook, &quot;I&#x2019;ve been here for 17 years, and it has never occurred on my watch.&#x201D;</p>
