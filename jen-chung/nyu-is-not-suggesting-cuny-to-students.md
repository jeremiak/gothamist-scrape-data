<p>A reader sent us a scan of a flier she found at NYU&apos;s student center, &quot;<strong>It&#x2019;s a flier for a NYU financial aid plan that basically tells students that can&#x2019;t afford NYU to go to CUNY</strong>,&quot; and points out it&apos;s crazy that &quot;NYU can&#x2019;t give its students decent financial aid even though John Sexton flies to Abu Dhabi every other week and we keep buying new buildings all over the city.&quot;  The school&apos;s tuition is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113172715/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/nyu_tuition_to.php">around $50,000</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;re getting confirmation from NYU about the flier (full version after the jump), which almost seems like it could be fake, but it seems legit to our reader, who added, &quot;&apos;In and Of the City&apos;&quot; is something NYU&apos;s administration talks about a lot to new students &#x2013; it&apos;s a selling point they use for people coming from the suburbs who are really enchanted with &apos;NYU the dream school.&apos; NYU has really terrible financial aid, and I guess they&apos;re just kinda giving up on getting people to stay.  I mean, we&apos;re like dead last among private universities for financial aid, but they just keep building new buildings.  Sexton does say a lot of stuff like this all the time&#x2026; dunno, I&apos;m just fed up.  <strong>NYU isn&apos;t just a dream school&#x2026; it&apos;s almost like a nightmare</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: NYU spokesman John Beckman tells us the flier is a fake, &quot;<strong>Another satirical triumph for desktop publishing</strong>...I am sure the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113172715/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/12/fake_new_york_times_hits_readers.php">fake NY Times headline</a> about the Iraq war will inspire many others.&quot;</p>
