Brown had allegedly been trying to aim for his son Jaden&apos;s mother, but hit his son instead and then fled as the paramedics were called.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602110533/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05042009/news/regionalnews/toddler_stabbing_dad_busted____in_drag__167606.htm">Post reports</a> that an anonymous tip led the cops to Brown, who was in Bed-Stuy at Pulaski Street and Marcy Avenue: &quot;<strong>To their surprise, Brown was decked out in women&apos;s clothing -- a disguise to avoid being arrested</strong>... A clean-shaven Brown, who was charged with attempted murder and assault, was wearing a black, shoulder-length wig, a brown coat with fur on the collar and wrists and jeans.&quot;  A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602110533/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/05/04/2009-05-04_on_the_run_for_stabbing_2yearold_son_man_caught_dressed_in_drag.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;<b>He was trying for the Tina Turner look but it didn&apos;t work.</b>&quot;  Jaden is in serious but stable condition; his uncle (and Brown&apos;s brother) said, &quot;He&apos;s doing all right&quot; and that other family members were glad Brown was arrested.</p>
