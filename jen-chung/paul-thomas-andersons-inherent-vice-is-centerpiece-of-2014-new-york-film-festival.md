<p>The New York Film Festival is slowly revealing its lineup, and now the Centerpiece has been announced: Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s adaptation of Thomas Pynchon&apos;s <em>Inherent Vice</em>, which stars Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Benicio Del Toro, Owen Wilson, Martin Short, Jena Malone, Joanna Newsom, and  Katherine Waterston.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Every new Paul Thomas Anderson movie is an event, an experience&#x2014;when the lights come up, you feel like you&#x2019;ve been somewhere, and come back with your mind altered,&quot; said New York Film Festival Director and Selection Committee Chair, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015558/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/kent_jones.php">Kent Jones</a>. &quot;Inherent Vice is a journey through the past, bringing the texture of the early 70s SoCal counterculture back to full blown life. It&#x2019;s a wildly funny, deeply soulful, richly detailed, and altogether stunning movie.&quot; </p>

<p>Anderson, who previously showed <em>Boogie Nights</em> and <em>Punch Drunk Love</em> at the NYFF, wrote the screenplay based upon the novel. While there&apos;s no trailer for the film online, here&apos;s a trailer for the book from Penguin Books (&quot;Part noir, part psychedelic romp, all Thomas Pynchon&#x2014;private eye Doc Sportello surfaces, occasionally, out of a marijuana haze to watch the end of an era&quot;): </p>
