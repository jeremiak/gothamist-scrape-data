The NYCHA oversees over 177,000 apartments in 340 development in all five boroughs&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520042412/ihttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/nyregion/14nycha.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times says</a> this makes John Rhea, who used to work at Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan Chase, &quot;in effect, the city&#x2019;s biggest landlord.&quot; Bloomberg said, &quot;John&apos;s experience makes him the perfect person to lead our efforts to create long-term financial stability at the Authority, and to ring in a new era of transparency and agency responsiveness to improving resident and community quality of life.&quot;  However, some critics of the Bloomberg administration were upset with the pick: City Councilwoman Letitia James issued a statement questioning Rhea&apos;s lack of &quot;experience in managing a low-income public housing authority of this size and scale...particularly at a time when private equity firms are purchasing under-performing housing developments, and converting them to luxury housing throughout the City&quot; while Councilwoman Rosie Mendez told the Times, &quot;<strong>All I see is a Wall Street person with an investment banking background and with no experience in housing management or development.</strong>&quot;</p>
