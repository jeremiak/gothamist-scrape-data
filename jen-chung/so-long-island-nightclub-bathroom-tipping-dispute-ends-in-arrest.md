After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145902/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=649843058364589&amp;set=a.191245280891038.56119.191223474226552&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1">hosting a communion party</a>, two clubgoers go into a fight over... tipping the bathroom attendant.<p></p>

<p>The early Sunday fight actually didn&apos;t occur in the bathroom&#x2014;apparently the debate was so intense it continued to the parking lot. That&apos;s where Kashmire Dawson, 24, of Amityville, is accused of using a camera tripod &quot;like a baseball bat&quot; when hitting another woman in the arm. The victim was treated for a cut while Dawson was charged with assault and possession of a dangerous weapon.</p>

The spokesman said he did not know Dawson&apos;s stance on the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Good Housekeeping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145902/http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/etiquette/tipping-restroom-attendant-dec06">recommends tipping bathroom attendants</a>. The Efficient Drinker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145902/http://www.efficientdrinker.com/blog/tipping-bathroom-attendant/">interviewed a bathroom attendant who said</a>, &quot;If you&#x2019;re washing your hands, I&#x2019;ll add some soap.  It&#x2019;s stupid to wash your hands without soap, but if I don&#x2019;t step up, nobody uses the soap. Can&#x2019;t put a price on that.  Need to get paid.&quot;</p>
