<p>The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that cell phone use while driving should be banned while driving.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118132919/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/technology/federal-panel-urges-cellphone-ban-for-drivers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The recommended ban applies to hands-free devices, a recommendation that goes further than any state law to date. The agency said it is recommending that drivers be allowed to use their phones for emergency purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>NTSB chairman Deborah A. P. Hersman said, &quot;No call, no text, no update is worth a human life,&quot; and noted that the number of accidents and fatalities due to distracted driving was too much to ignore, &quot;This is a difficult recommendation, but it&#x2019;s the right recommendation and it&#x2019;s time.&quot; </p>

<p>The NTSB&apos;s recommendation came during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118132919/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2011/gray_summit_mo/index.html">meeting to discuss a 2010 accident in Gray Summit</a>, Missouri where the 19-year-old driver of a pickup truck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118132919/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/post/ntsb-seeks-nationwide-ban-on-driver-use-of-personal-electronic-devices/2011/12/13/gIQAekvBsO_blog.html">sent 11 texts in 11 minutes</a>, including one before hitting a Volvo truck-tractor.  Then one school bus hit the truck and another school bus hit the first one: &quot;As a result of this accident sequence, the driver of the GMC pickup and one passenger seated in the rear of the lead school bus were killed. A total of 35 passengers from both buses, the 2 bus drivers, and the driver of the Volvo tractor received injuries ranging from minor to serious. Eighteen people were uninjured.&quot;<br>
