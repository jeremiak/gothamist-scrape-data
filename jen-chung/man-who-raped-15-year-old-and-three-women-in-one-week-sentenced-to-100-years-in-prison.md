<p>A man who was already convicted of rape in 2009 was found guilty of four 2013 rapes over one week, and now a Brooklyn judge has sentenced him to 100 years in prison. In a statement announcing Dexter Bell&apos;s sentencing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325061632/http://pix11.com/2015/11/23/bk-man-gets-life-in-prison-for-raping-3-women-girl-in-weeklong-spree/">Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson said</a>, &quot;This serial rapist, who committed four rapes within one week, including one of a 15-year-old girl, is a sadistic and violent sexual predator who is simply not fit to walk the streets ever again. That&#x2019;s why he must spend the rest of his life behind bars.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2015_11_dexterbell.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325061632im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_11_dexterbell.jpg" width="250" height="304" class="image-right"> </span>Two years ago, police were searching for a man who raped a 25-year-old woman in an alley and then, four days later, a suspect who raped a 21-year-old woman in another alley. Then, three days later, the same suspect sexually assaulted a 19-year-old woman in a stairwell and a 15-year-old girl in an elevator. All the incidents occurred in Crown Heights.</p>

<p>The suspect would chat up the victims before attacking them. The authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325061632/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/video_brooklyn_serial_rapist_seen_n.php">released a surveillance video</a>, and a tip led the authorities to Bell, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325061632/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/20/brooklyn_serial_rape_suspect_found.php">was at his grandmother&apos;s house</a>.</p>

<p>Bell was previously convicted of raping a 17-year-old girl in 2008.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325061632/http://nypost.com/2015/04/29/rikers-inmate-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-female-officer/">gave a statement</a> before his sentencing, &quot;What Dexter Bell did to me changed my life forever. Even after two years, I don&#x2019;t feel as safe. Bell deserves to go to jail for a very long time. Not just because of what he did to me but so he never does this to anyone else ever again.&quot; </p>

<p>The 15-year-old victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325061632/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-rape-predator-100-years-article-1.2444874">also offered a statement</a>, which was read by a prosecutor, &quot;I was only 15 years old. Why would you do that to me? How would you feel if someone did this to you? How would you want someone to treat your mother, sister, or your daughter?&quot;</p>
