A total of 14 people were shot in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx from Saturday night to Sunday morning.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, three teens were shot at  Thomas Jefferson Park in East Harlem around 10 p.m. They were taken to local hospitals, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/nyregion/2-killed-and-dozen-are-injured-as-weekend-shootings-plague-new-york.html?_r=1">the NY Times reports,</a> &quot;The police described them as affiliates of a local crew, though it remained unclear if the sorts of turf rivalries long a problem in that corner of Upper Manhattan had sparked the violence.&quot;</p>

<p>Around 1:18 a.m. on Sunday, police in West Harlem stopped a car with four occupants after it went through a barricade at West 135th Street and 7th Avenue. According to the NYPD, the car was transporting a gunshot victim, apparently shot at St. Nicholas Terrace and West 126th Street, to the hospital. The police called an ambulance.</p>

<p>At 2:53 a.m., West Harlem police also responded to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/17/two_dead_in_harlem_drive-by_shootin.php">double murder of two men who were standing</a> outside the Fedel Gourmet Deli on Broadway at West 151st Street. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/18/nypd_release_video_of_harlem_double.php">shooter is seen on a surveillance video</a> brandishing his gun.</p>

<p>Early on Sunday, three men were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/bronxmillbrookhouses.shtml">shot at the Mill Brook Houses</a> on St. Ann&apos;s Avenue in the Bronx. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/nyregion/2-killed-and-dozen-are-injured-as-weekend-shootings-plague-new-york.html?_r=1">According to the NY Times</a>, the victims, &quot;ages 19, 24 and 29.. [a]ll survived; none were talking to detectives.&quot;</p>

<p>At 3 a.m. in Brooklyn, a man was shot at Van Buren Street and Lewis Avenue. </p>

<p>At 6 a.m. in Queens, two people opened fire in front of a house in South Jamaica, Queens, hitting four. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://7online.com/news/south-jamaica-shooting-leaves-4-wounded-2-critically/266817/">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;two men driving a silver Audi exited the vehicle and opened fire in front of 153-38 118th Avenue... A 27-year old man is in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and back, and a 26-year old man is also critical after being shot in the chest. Another man, 19, is in stable condition with a gunshot wound in the hand, and a woman, 23, is in stable condition after being shot in the hip.&quot;</p>

<p>A neighbor who was wakened by the gunfire on 118th Avenue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rappers-shot-killed-10-shot-weekend-boroughs-article-1.1906595">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;This is traumatizing. I feel like I live in the hood. If I was ever thinking about moving, this would make me move.&quot;</p>

<p>The Times points out, &quot;All told, at least 14 people in New York were struck by bullets overnight, adding to a tally of shooting victims that is an increase of more than 10 percent over last year, to more than 822 citywide. The increase has persisted despite efforts to tamp down potentially violent situations before they escalate.&quot; According to CompStat data through August 10 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014332/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cscity.pdf">PDF</a>), there have been 179 murders, a 11.8% decrease from the same period in 2013 which had 203 murders.<br>
