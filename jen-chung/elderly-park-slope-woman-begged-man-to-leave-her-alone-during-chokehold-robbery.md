<p>Police have released two videos of a suspect who allegedly robbed a 92-year-old woman inside her Brooklyn apartment building&apos;s vestibule before turning his gun on her neighbor and robbing him as well.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at around 1 p.m. on Wednesday, March 2nd, &quot;the suspect approached the [92] year-old female victim from behind as she entered the location, placed her in a chokehold and displayed a handgun. After he pushed her inside the location&apos;s vestibule he demanded her money. As the suspect took the female victim&apos;s money, a 50-year-old male came across the pair in the vestibule. The suspect pointed the handgun at the male victim and removed his money. The suspect fled the location with approximately $370.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim, Elizabeth Gioino, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716030018/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/03/03/91-year-old-woman-chokehold-robbery-brooklyn/">told WCBS 2</a> that she was returning home from the library when she was shoved and then choked. She begged him to go away, &quot;&#x2018;Please leave me alone! I&#x2019;m a sick woman! I&#x2019;m old enough! Leave me alone!&#x2019; He choked me three times, &#x2018;Give me the money, give me the money!&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t have any money.&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
The suspect, who is described as being 40-50 years old, 5&apos;10&quot;-6&apos; and 250 pounds, was captured on surveillance videos. He was last seen wearing a dark colored hooded sweater, a black jacket, a black wool cap, black gloves, light colored pants and dark colored shoes.</p>
