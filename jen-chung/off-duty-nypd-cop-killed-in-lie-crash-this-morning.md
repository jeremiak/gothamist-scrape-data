One driver was killed and it&apos;s now being reported that the victim was an off-duty police officer, Joseph Pritchard. <p></p>

<p>Apparently Pritchard&apos;s truck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145751/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/21788118/off-duty-nypd-cop-killed-in-lie-crash">was stopped in the right lane</a>, and then a box truck rear-ended him at 2:23 a.m. Both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145751/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/nypd-officer-killed-in-fatal-lie-crash-1.4898292">vehicles caught fire</a>. Pritchard, a five-year NYPD veteran who worked in Midtown South, was pronounced dead at the scene. It&apos;s unclear why he had stopped. </p>

<p>The box truck driver, Eduardo Garcia, 34, of the Bronx was taken to a hospital for minor injuries. Pritchard&apos;s truck and the box truck were impounded for safety checks.</p>
