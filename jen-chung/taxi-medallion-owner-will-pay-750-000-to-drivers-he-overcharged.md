<p>A greedy taxi medallion owner has been punished by the NY Attorney General&apos;s office for illegally asking drivers to overpay to use his taxis. AG Eric Schneiderman said, &quot;Taxi drivers work hard every day to keep New York moving and their earnings should not be squeezed by taxi companies which own or manage medallions.&quot;</p>

<p>His office explained, &quot;Many drivers lease their cabs on a daily basis from owners and leasing agents.  The TLC lease cap rules limit the dollar amount drivers may be charged for leasing medallions and taxicabs, in order to ensure a baseline level of take-home earnings for drivers. The rules also strictly limit add-on charges that can be imposed upon drivers and limit the purposes for which charges may be assessed. Overcharges by owners or agents chisel away at drivers&#x2019; limited income.&quot; </p>

<p>However, an investigation found the Style Management Corp., owned by Andrew Rosenberg, &quot;violated the TLC&#x2019;s lease cap rules by charging amounts in excess of the amounts allowed under law, and by rounding drivers&#x2019; credit card fare earnings to even dollar amounts, almost always rounding in Style&apos;s favor.&quot; Apparently that rounding allowed Style to take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904031447/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/taxi-medallion-owner-caught-fleecing-drivers-article-1.2579494?utm_content=buffer197a0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">an extra $159,000 over five years</a>.</p>

<p>Style, which is located on West 44th Street and owns 142 medallions, will pay $750,000 in restitution to drivers, plus other $95,000 in penalties. The company will also have to train managers and other staffers and post a notice about lease cap rules. </p>

<p>TLC Commissioner Meera Joshi praised Schneiderman&apos;s &quot;ongoing commitment to protecting the rights of hardworking taxi drivers as well as to the accountability that must be at the heart of our regulated industries.&quot; Referring to previous incidents, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904031447/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/taxi-mogul-pay-1-2m-alleged-rip-off-article-1.1552626">like four taxi companies caught ripping off drivers</a> in 2013, Joshi added, &quot;The Attorney General/TLC joint prosecution initiative continues to send a powerful message of support to TLC drivers, and an equally strong warning to those who would contemplate depriving them of their hard-earned pay.&quot;</p>
