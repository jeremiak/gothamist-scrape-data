Outside the Stonewall Inn, where riots in 1969 helped spark the gay rights movement, thousands gathered to enjoy the moment in the West Village.</p>

<p>Edie Windsor, the 84-year-old widow who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101441/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/edie_windsor_every_child_born_today.php">was the plaintiff in the lawsuit</a>, was there, and gave the speech she made earlier in the day celebrating this victory (a bittersweet one, since it was over her late wife&apos;s estate). As she left the stage, she said wistfully to people near her, &quot;I don&apos;t want to leave.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the joyful energy was tempered by the Supreme Court&apos;s Tuesday decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101441/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/25/supreme_court_strikes_down_provisio.php">strike down parts of the Voting Rights Act</a>. Rev. Joseph Tolton of Rehoboth Congregation in Harlem told the crowd, &quot;None of us are free until all of us are free,&quot; and Rep. Jerry Nadler also said, &quot;Yesterday was depressing, today is elating.&quot;</p>
