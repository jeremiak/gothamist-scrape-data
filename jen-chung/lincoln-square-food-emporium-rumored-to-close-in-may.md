<p>Employees at the Food Emporium on West 68th Street and Broadway claim that the huge supermarket will be shuttering soon. They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035845/http://www.westsiderag.com/2013/03/18/food-emporium-on-broadway-to-close-in-may">told the West Side Rag</a> that &quot;the decision was made at the corporate level, and that the store will close on May 4.&quot;</p>

<p>Food Emporium&apos;s parent company, A&amp;P;, put up its 16 Manhattan stores (including the huge Union Square and Queensboro Bridge locations) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035845/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/11/food_emporium_grocery_chain_someone.php">for sale last September</a>. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035845/http://www.northjersey.com/news/192433021_Supermarket_deals_could_have_ripple_effect_on_A.html">there has been interest</a>, A&amp;P; has remained mum on plans. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035845/http://www.srginsight.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;task=detail&amp;id=98">A supermarket trade paper</a> said that there was interest from Kings Food Markets for five stores; also, Fairway Market may also be in the hunt.</p>

<p>One supermarket consultant pointed out that CVS has been making inroads with Food Emporium customers by offering dairy products. Hopefully a supermarket will take its place&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035845/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/the_best_movie_theaters_in_nyc.php">Lincoln Square movie watchers</a> need a place to buy their candy!</p>
