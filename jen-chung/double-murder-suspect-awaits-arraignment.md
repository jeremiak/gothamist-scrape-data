The Staten Island Advance reports that Bellucci&apos;s relatives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163349/http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2010/10/prosecutors_may_delay_arraignm.html">requested that the arraignment be delayed</a> so they could attend the funeral of Arthur and Marian Bellucci this morning, but &quot;It is not clear now whether they&apos;ll be attending the arraignment.&quot;  Another source told the Advance that the schizophrenic Stuyvesant grad &quot;denied killing his parents during questioning with cops.&quot;</p>

<p>Bellucci was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163349/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/15/si_man_suspect_in_parents_killings.php">apprehended in Israel on Friday</a>&#x2014;the police believe he killed his parents on Tuesday night, then fled the country on Wednesday (the bodies were discovered on Wednesday night)&#x2014;while trying to buy a ticket to China, via Turkey.  Relatives told police that Bellucci was obsessed with Israel after his grandfather told him he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163349/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/17/si_murder_suspect_thought_he_was_je.php">adopted from Jewish parents</a> (it&apos;s unclear if that&apos;s true) and a Stuy classmate told the Post and Daily News Bellucci claimed he was in Mossad.  </p>

<p>He faces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163349/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/SI-Slay-Suspect-to-be-Arraigned-Today-105178509.html">two counts of second degree murder</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163349/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/si_slaying_suspect_charged_nGCflJRVGW7hZGrOqZ4fmM">Another source told the Pos</a>t that when Bellucci was at the 120th Precinct stationhouse, he came in babbling nonsense ... He almost seemed like he was doing an act,&quot; and an investigator said, &quot;We have everything on this guy except a signed confession. The DNA will seal the deal.&quot;</p>
