title: A Few More Fake New York Times Details

										<p><img alt="2008_11_faketimes5.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504110551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_11_faketimes5.jpg" width="290" height="197" class="left">The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504110551/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/12/fake_new_york_times_hits_readers.php">elaborate fake New York Times stunt</a> may have cost up to $250,000. Though the group claiming responsibility for printing and distributing over one million copies of a July 4, 2009 edition says their costs were $100,000, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504110551/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11132008/news/nationalnews/journali_sham_tweaks_times_138439.htm">NY Post&apos;s</a> experts believe that printing a 14-page, 4-color paper are closer to a quarter million for that many copies.  </p>

<p>Also, a number of groups were involved: A press release mentioned &quot;The Yes Men, the Anti-Advertising Agency, CODEPINK, United for Peace and Justice, Not An Alternative, May First/People Link, Improv Everywhere, Evil Twin, and Cultures of Resistance&quot; among others.<br>
 <br>
Another interesting wrinkle:  Apparently NY Times journalists contributed articles to the project, which the Yes Men co-founder Andy Bichlbaum said was &quot;our way of communicating what change should really look like.&quot;  Anti-Advertising CEO Steve Lambert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504110551/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/11/fake_new_york_times_has_a_conn.html">told the Daily Intel</a>, &quot;<strong>There were a few people from the Times &#x2014; we can&apos;t tell you who they are. They&apos;re respectable journalists.</strong>&quot;  Hilariously, when the Post&apos;s reporter asked Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis about that, she said, &quot;If you give me the names, I can check.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a mixed reaction from some readers: One person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504110551/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/12/2008-11-12_fake_new_york_times_announces_iraq_war_e.html">joked to the Daily News</a>, &quot;In this edition, did the New York Knicks finally win a championship?&quot; while a former Marine and Iraq veteran said, &quot;<strong>I feel like I&apos;ve got mud on my face.  This looks like the real thing.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>And there won&apos;t be another printing--Lambert said there are other things planned, but in the meantime, you&apos;ll have to settle for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504110551/http://nytimes-se.com/">website</a>.</p>
