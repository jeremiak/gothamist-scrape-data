<p>Here&apos;s the latest report of someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522081004/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/27/no_feet_on_seats_rule_remains_in_ef.php">being</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522081004/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/27/no_feet_on_seats_rule_remains_in_ef.php">ticketed</a> for taking up more than one seat:  In  his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522081004/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/nyregion/21about.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">&quot;About New York&quot; column</a>, Jim Dwyer writes about a 24-year-old who landed a $50 ticket for his 1:30 a.m. subway seat greediness on a nearly empty 2 train from Manhattan to Crown Heights.  Ryan David LaMont said at the Atlantic Avenue stop, &quot;An N.Y.P.D. officer stepped into the car, pointed at me and another guy who was sitting on the other end of the train. He told us, &apos;Get off the train.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>LaMont further explained, &quot;I had my legs up on the seat. <strong>My feet were draped over the edge. For one thing, it&#x2019;s courtesy not to put your feet on the seat.</strong> Also, I&#x2019;d heard someone else getting yelled at a few weeks earlier for having their feet on the seat.&quot;  Maybe he was thinking about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522081004/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/16/still_not_safe_to_put_feet_on_seat.php">Stuyvesant High School student who got ticketed</a> last month?  No matter, take up more than one seat and you&apos;re ticket bait!  </p>

<p>Tickets for subway seat hogs<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522081004/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/26/nypd_crackdown_on_subway_riders_usi.php"> increased 17% last year</a>; Dwyer points out that it&apos;s probably easier for the cops to &quot;stand on a subway platform and wait for a train to deliver offenders to them directly&quot; than trying to chase fare-beaters on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522081004/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/subway_fare_evasion_way_up_ticketin.php">subways</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522081004/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/18/mta_loses_8_million_from_bus_fare-b.php">buses</a>.</p>

<p>LaMont said, &quot;I wasn&#x2019;t drunk or rowdy. I was literally reading my book on an empty train. I didn&#x2019;t argue with them. I said, &#x2018;I understand what you&#x2019;re doing, but in what way was I obstructing someone else from sitting down?&#x2019; <strong>The officer said, &#x2018;Look, man, this is just what we&#x2019;re doing tonight.&#x2019;</strong>&quot;</p>
