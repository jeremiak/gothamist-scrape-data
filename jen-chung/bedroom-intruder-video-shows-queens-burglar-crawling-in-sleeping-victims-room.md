<p>Police are looking for a daring burglary suspect who was caught on surveillance footage crawling on the victim&apos;s bedroom floor...with the victim sleeping there.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred early yesterday morning at 2:20 a.m.: &quot;An unknown male suspect entered a private house in the vicinity of Union Street and 33rd Avenue. Once inside, the suspect made his way in to a bedroom occupied by the victim, a 42-year-old male. The suspect removed a Samsung S6 cell phone from on top of a bedroom dresser and fled on foot when the victim awakened.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect, who was last seen going westbound on 33rd Avenue, was described as 6&apos;2&quot; and 200 pounds, last seen wearing all black clothing and a black snow cap with the word &quot;diamond&quot; in red and white lettering on it. </p>

<p>Footage shows the burglar entering the home and later crawling around; apparently the burglar was there for at least 30 minutes. He also has a knife in his mouth. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325075348/http://abc7ny.com/news/video-home-invasion-suspect-creeps-around-bedroom-while-victim-sleeps/1099533/">A resident of the home told WABC 7</a> that the victim and his wife &quot;thought it might be one of the kids, but he looked to be much bigger than the kid.&quot;<br>
