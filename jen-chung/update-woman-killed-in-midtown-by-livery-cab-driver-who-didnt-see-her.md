<p><strong>[UPDATES BELOW] </strong>A group of good Samaritans did their best to try to save a 77-year-old woman who was struck by a livery cab driver in midtown Manhattan this morning, pinning her under the vehicle. However, the woman died at Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>Police say that the victim was crossing east to west at the intersection of Madison Avenue and 36th Street around 8:30 a.m. when she was struck by a livery cab driver making a left turn from 36th onto Madison. It&apos;s believed the woman was in the crosswalk.</p>

A group of about 10 people worked to lift the black sedan off of the bloodied woman and turned the vehicle onto its side.&quot; One of the good Samaritans explained, &quot;There was no other way we could remove the lady from underneath the car, so we lifted the car. It&#x2019;s pretty sad.&quot;</p>

<p>The livery cab driver remained at the scene and an NYPD spokesperson said no criminality was suspected at this time. The driver told the Post, &quot;When I turned on the green light I didn&#x2019;t see her.&quot; If that quote is accurate, the NYPD may have grounds to charge the driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201517/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/14/reckless_driving_nyc_nypd.php">with Failure to Yield</a> under New York&apos;s Right-of-Way Law. </p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The NYPD identified the victim as Carol Dauplaise, who lived a few blocks away on East 38th Street.</p>

<p><strong>Update 5 p.m.:</strong> The NYPD says the driver, 49-year-old Buddhi Gurung of Queens, has been arrested and charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care.</p>
