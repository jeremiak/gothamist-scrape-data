<p>Three days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220506/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/surrender_brooklyn_mysterious_white.php#photo-1">white flags mysteriously appeared atop the Brooklyn Bridge&apos;s towers</a>, the NYPD&apos;s Intelligence Bureau decided to head up there to check things out. NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220506/http://nypost.com/2014/07/25/nypd-terror-chief-scales-brooklyn-bridge-to-inspect-white-flag-site/">John Miller explained to the Post</a>, &quot;This is a chance to get the squad that&#x2019;s actually doing the investigation a first hand look... We want to look at the process for taking the flag up and down.&quot;</p>

<p>There were NYPD boats in the water with a helicopter hovering above during the climb (not to mention numerous NYPD vehicles on the bridge or at the entrances). However, Miller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220506/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/25/nypd-deputy-commissioner-john-miller-ascends-brooklyn-bridge-to-view-white-flag-crime-scene/">admitted to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;We learned what we went up there to learn, but we didn&#x2019;t find anything additional in terms of physical evidence.&quot; (And, yes, Miller, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220506/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/27/john_miller_returns_to_nypd_focusin.php">who was at CBS News before re-joining the NYPD</a>, did give the exclusive TV interview about this to WCBS 2.)</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a look at some NYPD cops climbing up the bridge&apos;s cable on Tuesday to capture a flag&#x2014;note how they walk through a gate at the beginning (the white flag team apparently got around the locked gate):</p>

<p>Police are still investigating who might have placed the 20 foot by 11 foot white flags after 3:30 a.m. on Tuesday. One hypothesis is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220506/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/brooklyn_bridge_white_flags.php">someone with knowledge of the bridge</a> and the tower was part of the group. DNA was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220506/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/25/cis_white_flags.php">apparently found at the scene</a>, and, per WCBS 2, cops are talking to construction workers at the bridge about their political views and &quot;gripes&quot;  with the government.</p>

<p>Miller told the Post that the exercise was very useful. &quot;We needed to know a little bit more about what happened once they got up there ... How long would it take in terms of time and target [and] the process of taking the flag that size up and down. I would say it&#x2019;s like the experience we&#x2019;ve had with these cases which is, you know, names come up names go down and you keep going through until something clicks together.&quot;</p>
