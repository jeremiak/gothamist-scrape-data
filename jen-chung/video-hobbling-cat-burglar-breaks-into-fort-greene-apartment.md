Police say that last month, a man &quot;entered a basement apartment in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn through an open window.&quot; </p>

<p>The incident occurred on May 24, at 9:45 a.m. While the suspect was inside the apartment, cops say that the tenant came home and &quot;startled him&quot;&#x2014;and he fled back through the window without anything.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a man with a cast on his right foot who was walking with a cane. </p>
