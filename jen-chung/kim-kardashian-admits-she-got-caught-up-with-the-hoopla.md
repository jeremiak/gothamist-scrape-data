<p>Kim Kardashian may be a shrewd entrepreneur, turning her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=ray+j+kim+kardashian">Ray J sex tape-infamy</a> into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://www.eonline.com/news/kardashians_made_65_million_last_year/226698">multi-million dollar family operation</a> that includes boutiques, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/25/kim_kardashian_sued_old_navy_to_sav.php">line of clothing at Sears</a>, perfumes, and much more.  But she&apos;s just like us, because, even though she&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/kim_kardashian_reportedly_filed_for.php">divorcing after 10 weeks of marriage</a> to NJ Net Kris Humphries, she &quot;married for love... I love with all of my heart and soul. I want a family and babies and a real life so badly that maybe I rushed in to something too soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Kardashian posted a letter on her website, &quot;This is probably the hardest thing I&#x2019;ve ever had to write. I see all of the support and I am so thankful for my fans, friends and family who are helping me through this difficult time. I am trying not to read all the different media reports but it&#x2019;s hard not to see all the negative ones&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/kim_kardashians_divorce_the_morning.php">NY Post much?</a>) and tries to reiterate that this wasn&apos;t some amazing publicity stunt to enhance her celebrity, &quot;I felt like I was on a fast roller coaster and couldn&#x2019;t get off when now I know I probably should have. I got caught up with the hoopla and the filming of the TV show that when I probably should have ended my relationship, I didn&#x2019;t know how to and didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint a lot of people.&quot; Like whoever got the $1 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/20/kim_kardashian_is_having_california.php">from People magazine for photos of the wedding</a>?</p>

<p>Kardashian certainly didn&apos;t disappoint E!, the network that airs numerous shows about her and her family: E! preempted its usual Sex and the City reruns and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/arts/television/kardashian-marriage-may-end-but-the-wedding-goes-on.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">rebroadcast her wedding to Humphries last night</a>.  The famously hard-working Kardashian is still honoring work commitments, like an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://www.eonline.com/news/kim_kardashian_puts_on_brave_face_in/272935">event in Australia to plug the Kardashian handbag collection</a>. She told a radio show there, &quot;I mean, you know, in a tough situation, I think I&apos;m trying to do the best that I can, and it&apos;s actually a bit of an escape to be able to come here.&quot;  This has also been an escape for acclaimed author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://twitter.com/#!/salmanrushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143446/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/11/02/even-salman-rushdie-tweeting-jokes-about-kim-kardashians-divorce/?mod=WSJBlog">shared his Kardashian-Humphries divorce Tweets yesterday</a>:</p>
