<p>Various reports say that Daniel Reilly, 36, &quot;carried on an eight-month affair with a former student that began when the girl was 13 years old&quot; (from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513131751/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9057974">WABC 7</a>) and that the relationship was &quot;consensual&quot;. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513131751/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/qns-teacher-accused-affair-student-article-1.1311257">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Reilly had taught the girl, now 14, when she was in elementary school, a spokesman for the Queens District Attorney said Monday night. He later transferred to I.S. 237 in Flushing, where he taught 6th grade English, the spokesman said. Reilly began sending the girl text messages last August. At the time the girl was only 13, the spokesman said.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim&apos;s sister found the text messages on her cellphone and told their parents, who then contacted the police. Police say the assaults<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513131751/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/08/nyc-public-schoolteacher-charged-with-sexual-assault-of-girl-14/"> did not occur on school grounds</a>. The Department of Education tells us that Reilly was immediately transferred from I.S. 237.</p>

<p>Reilly was charged with two counts of first-degree rape, 10 counts of second-degree rape and seven counts of endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
