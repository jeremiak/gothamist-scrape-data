<p>Last night, Albany (!) agreed on a deal to fund the MTA&apos;s capital program, which includes little projects like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/check_out_this_humungous_cavern_und.php#photo-1">Second Avenue Subway</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/11/check_out_these_crazy_pix_of_the_ne.php#photo-1">7 line extension</a>, the Eastside Access project to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/11/map_of_the_day_112.php">bring the LIRR to Grand Central Terminal</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/30/special_preview_inside_the_fulton_s.php#photo-1">Fulton Street Transit Center</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/03/5556790/cuomo-reaches-mta-deal-senate-republicans-abandon-their-threat-trig">Capital New York explains</a>, &quot;Essentially, what happened is that the M.T.A. needed another $13 billion to fund the remaining three years of the five-year, $22.2 billion capital program that began in 2010. And so the M.T.A. submitted a request to increase its bonding cap, in this case by $7 billion, to fund the remaining three years of that plan.&quot; And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57404605/ny-deal-will-fund-last-3-years-of-mta-capital-plan/">AP says</a>, &quot;The state will provide $770 million in new funds over three years. It also calls for a $2.2 billion loan request to the federal Rail Road Infrastructure Fund.&quot; However, State Senate Republicans wanted things like getting rid of the payroll mobility tax, slashing that $770 million from the plan, etc., but then they agreed to Governor Cuomo&apos;s deal. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/governor_cuomo_i_was_born_flexible.php">Steamrolling</a>?)  </p>

<p>The MTA issued a statement, &quot;The MTA is grateful for Governor Cuomo&apos;s leadership and commitment in recognizing the critical importance of funding mass transit, and in particular fully funding  our current Capital Program.   The MTA Capital Program not only provides for continued investment in our network, but also creates tens of thousands of jobs and generates economic activity across the entire state. With this funding, the MTA will continue to enhance our riders&apos; experience by investing in the future of our transportation network, as well as  bringing our assets up to a state of good repair.&quot;</p>

<p>While a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134709/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gov-cuomo-state-pols-finalize-mta-deal-ave-subway-projects-move-planned-article-1.105082">Daily News source says</a>, &quot;This represents the greatest commitment to the MTA from a governor in recent history,&quot; Transportation Alternatives was unhappy, because &quot;The State will contribute$2.1 billion to the $13.1 billion Capital Plan, forcing the MTA to take out more than $9 billion in debt.&quot;  TA&apos;s Executive Director Paul Steely White said, &quot;This deal is an express train to more MTA debt, higher MetroCard fares and less subway and bus service. When it comes to public transit, Albany only knows two plays: paying for it with more debt or robbing riders of hundreds of millions of dollars in dedicated transit funding. Both put the 7.5 million New Yorkers who rely on the bus and subway on the fast track to higher fares and more service<br>
cuts. Today&#x2019;s plan doubles down on the State&#x2019;s dangerous commitment to<br>
funding transit through debt. Governor Cuomo and the State Legislature must invest in transit through secure and sustainable sources of revenue.&quot;</p>
