title: One Lousy Runway Pothole Brings LaGuardia To Its Knees
---

	
										<p>There are big plans in the works to transform LaGuardia Airport from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163832/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/biden_says_laguardias_like_a_third.php">apt punchline</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163832/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/laguardia_reboot_ferry.php">billion-dollar dream</a>&#x2014;but in the meantime, it&apos;s still LaGuardia, where vacation dreams go to die, face down in a bowl of cold nachos at that depressing Southwest Terminal bar. Last night, a pothole in a runway caused heavy delays for air travelers as dozens of planes were stuck waiting to take off. </p>

<p>A reader stuck in Chicago told us that he was trying to fly home, but &quot;we were just told by the captain that there is a ground stop at LGA due to a pothole in the one operational runway. Literally unbelievable... Pray for me.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently a pilot spotted the pothole; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163832/http://abc7ny.com/travel/pothole-in-runway-caused-big-delays-at-laguardia-airport/1238900/">WABC 7 detailed</a> the exchange from air traffic control and the pilot:</p><blockquote>&quot;I&apos;m not sure it looks like something completely blew off,&quot; a pilot said.<p></p>

<p>&quot;He is reporting debris on the right side of the runway can we have someone check that out?&quot; ATC said.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m on the 22 deck heading over to the runway now,&quot; the pilot said.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold your position, need to get debris off the runway,&quot; ATC said. &quot;We need to get this stuff [off] the runway first.&quot;</p></blockquote>The pothole was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163832/http://nypost.com/2016/03/09/pothole-opens-on-la-guardia-runway-causing-major-delays/">apparently two feet by eight feet</a>. But one flier found a silver lining:<p></p>

<p>What caused this mess? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163832/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Plane-Blows-Out-Concrete-Runway-LaGuardia-Airport-Flights-Backed-Up-371589601.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;A plane landing at LaGuardia Airport blew out a chunk of concrete on the runway as it was coming down, and flights were backed up for over an hour as crews repaired the runway, airport sources say.&quot;</p>
