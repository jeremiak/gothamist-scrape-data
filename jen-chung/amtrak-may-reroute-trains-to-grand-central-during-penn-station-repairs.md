<p>As Amtrak tries to fix various problems that have frustrated commuters for the past few months <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022195220/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/02/amtrak_says_penn_station_commuters.php">by planning major track rehab</a> this summer, it turns out the transit agency is weighing another option: Diverting some train routes to Grand Central Terminal. </p>

<p>The summer plan would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022195220/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/02/amtrak_says_penn_station_commuters.php">involve &quot;significant service&quot; disruptions</a> as Amtrak looks to fix aging tracks and other infrastructure, reportedly between July 7th and July 25th, and again from August 4th to August 28th. The work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022195220/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/11/amtrak_ceo_says_penn_station_hell_w.php">may continue into 2018</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022195220/http://www.timesunion.com/tuplus-business/article/Penn-Station-track-work-leads-to-a-grand-switch-11143260.php">the Times Union reported</a>, &quot;To relieve pressure at Penn, Amtrak has been studying switching at least some of its trains from the Empire Corridor back to Grand Central. While Amtrak officials didn&apos;t confirm that some trains will use Grand Central, a source said train crews are being offered the opportunity to bid for those runs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be able to have that option and alleviate some of the sheer number of trains going into Penn Station &#x2026; is a good option. I&#x2019;m sure there are people who would enjoy this experience, but my understanding is it&#x2019;s only temporary,&quot; Gary Prophet, president of the Empire State Passengers Association, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022195220/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/05/16/with-repairs-looming-officials-plan-to-bring-amtrak-back-to-grand-central-112114">told Politico</a>.</p>

<p>The experience at<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022195220/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/where_to_eat_grand_central.php#photo-1"> Grand Central Terminal</a> is light years <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022195220/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/03/penn_station_problems.php">from Penn Station</a>. Amtrak President and CEO Charles &quot;Wick&quot; Moorman told NY State lawmakers last week that Penn Station handles &quot;1,300-plus weekday train movements on an infrastructure designed in 1910 for less than half the current volume. For perspective on this, Grand Central Terminal handles only roughly two-thirds the number of daily trains on double the number of train tracks, compared to Penn Station.&quot;</p>

<p>For every happy commuter on the Empire Corridor excited about this news... well, pour one out for those who use NJ Transit:</p>
