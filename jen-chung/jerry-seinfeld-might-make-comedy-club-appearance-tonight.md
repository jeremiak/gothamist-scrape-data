<p>Jerry Seinfeld <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517191001/https://twitter.com/#!/JerrySeinfeld/status/169177842352001024">just Tweeted</a>, &quot;Think I&apos;m going to drop in Gotham tonight and play around with some new stuff.&quot; We believe this is a reference to Gotham Comedy Club on West 23rd Street, where he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517191001/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/seinfeld_gives_surprise_performance_80fAMdMFTOTlIrQhoRzULI">given surprise performances before</a>.</p>

<p>The club can&apos;t confirm whether he&apos;s arriving, but you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517191001/http://gothamcomedyclub.com/">make reservations here</a> or call 212.367.9000 for reservations for the 8 p.m. show . </p>

<p>And here&apos;s Schmoopy at Gotham in 2009:</p>
