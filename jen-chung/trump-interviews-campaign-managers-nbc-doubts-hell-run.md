										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_04_trump2012pin.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316001022im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_trump2012pin.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i>A pin worn by someone at the Florida Tea Party rally where Donald Trump spoke (AP/ Palm Beach Post)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Donald Trump has been bragging about being<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316001022/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/17/trump_calls_laguardia_airport_third.php"> bigger (financially, of course) than Mitt Romney</a> and complaining that Laguardia like a third world airport&#x2014;when not getting down to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316001022/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/dont_worry_america_donald_trump_wil.php">bottom of President Obama&apos;s mysterious origins</a>.  But did you know that he&apos;s also been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316001022/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53344_Page2.html">interviewing campaign managers</a> and asking to set up meetings with evangelical leaders?  OMG, 2012 is going to be <em>yooooge</em>.</p>

<p>According to Politico, Trump seems to be just riding the extra publicity for his non-political endeavors, but other Republican consultants say things like he&apos;s making the &quot;types of moves that one makes if they&#x2019;re actually running,&quot; &quot;If he comes to Iowa and he engages in conversations in small groups of people one-on-one he might play well on that,&quot; and &quot;He gets mad that people aren&#x2019;t taking him seriously.&quot;  </p>

<p>Do &quot;people&quot; include NBC executives? If Trump were to run for president, he&apos;d have to give his Apprentice franchise a rest (or NBC would have to give equal airtime to other candidates&#x2014;think about it, The Biggest Loser with Mike Huckabee or Minute To Win It hosted by Sarah Palin).  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316001022/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/business/media/18trump.html?src=busln">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;No one at NBC has done much serious planning about what to do with &apos;The Apprentice,&apos;  because of what two executives cited as pervasive doubts that Mr. Trump would actually enter the race. &apos;This is Donald being Donald,&apos; said one senior executive who would be involved in any decision about how NBC handles the show.&quot;</p>
