Because I&apos;m disappointed in the way I acted.&quot;  </p>

<p>Brown had been on Good Morning America and was upset by questions from host Robin Roberts about his former girlfriend, Rihanna. Roberts had asked, &quot;Recently, the restraining order against you that Rihanna had issued has been relaxed. Have you seen each other, been around each other?&quot; referring to how Brown beat Rihanna in 2009 and later pleaded to felony assault.  Brown answered, &quot;Not really,&quot; and continued discussing his new album, but off-air, he was very unhappy.  Here&apos;s how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145016/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/chris-brown-apologizes-robin-roberts-bet-106-park/story?id=13200434">ABC News explains the incident</a>:</p><blockquote>A fuming Brown returned to his dressing room after the interview and performance of &quot;Yeah 3x,&quot; the lead single off his new album.<p></p>

<p>Then he came back down the hall, still backstage, and stopped upon seeing the person who produced the segment. Brown didn&apos;t have his shirt on.</p>

<p>The show&apos;s hair and makeup staff said they called security because they heard loud noises coming from Brown&apos;s dressing room.</p>

<p>At one point, a cooler was thrown and a window in the dressing room was broken. The thick glass was destroyed and strewn across the street below.</p></blockquote>ABC is not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145016/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/chris_brown_wont_face_charges_for_g.php">pressing charges against Brown</a>&#x2014;and GMA extended an invite for Brown to come back on the show. During today&apos;s BET interview, Brown said no one was injured and added that he thought the GMA appearance would focus on his new album, &quot;I felt like, &apos;OK, they told us this just so they can get us on the show so they can exploit me.&apos; You know, that&apos;s what I thought. I kind of took it very, very hard. And I kept my composure throughout the interview, although you could see me upset, you know. I kept my composure and did my performances, and when I got back, I just let off, like, steam in the back.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Brown has been doing a lot of apologizing lately&#x2014;nearly two weeks ago, after the earthquake in Japan, he Tweeted, &quot;For anyone I&#x2019;ve ever hurt,cursed out, yelled at, been rude too!! I sincerely apologize!! Life is beautiful and we are Beautiful People.&quot;  But he must be feeling good&#x2014;his album <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145016/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chris-brown-headed-first-no-170599">is headed for #1</a>.</p>
