Apparently, she made sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-holmes-secretly-rented-nyc-apartment-weeks-before-filing-to-divorce-tom-cruise-2012306">get a Manhattan apartment</a>&#x2014;separate from the couple&apos;s other property in the city&#x2014;before the filing.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/the_kate_escape_vlAzyRTaJ4a8EbKGBuH12M">According to the Post</a>, Holmes&apos; new rental is in Chelsea: &quot;Two building sources and a resident told The Post they&#x2019;ve spotted Holmes, 33, in a posh 19-story Seventh Avenue building, where rents range from $4,000 to $25,000 a month and celebs secure under-the-radar homes. &apos;I&#x2019;ve seen her every day for three weeks. It&#x2019;s been almost a month now,&apos; said one building source.&quot; The Posts the building is near 25th Street, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/06/katie-holmes-rented-new-york-apartment-divorce-filing">Radar&apos;s story</a> uses an image of the Chelsea Mercantile building, on Seventh Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets.  </p>

<p>The couple was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/18/suckers_for_a_t.php">married in a lavish, Italian ceremony</a> in late 2006, months after Holmes gave birth to their daughter Suri. But now Holmes is seeking sole custody of the six-year-old as well as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://laist.com/2012/06/29/casa_tomkat_the_homes_of_tom_cruise.php#photo-1">division of their many properties</a>.  Reports claim that Cruise, whose superstar status gives him eight-figure paychecks, was &quot;blindsided&quot; by the divorce; that Holmes is playing hardball <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://laist.com/2012/06/30/katie_holmes_tom_cruise.php">by filing for the split in New York</a>, since it&apos;s more friendly to giving sole custody; and that Holmes just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://laist.com/2012/06/29/sources_katie_holmes_just_wasnt_tha.php">wasn&apos;t that into Scientology</a>.</p>

<p>The pair <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516161240/http://laist.com/2012/06/30/katie_holmes_tom_cruise.php">did have a pre-nuptial agreement</a>, which allegedly would give Holmes $3 million per year of marriage, with a maximum of $33 million (if they were together for more than 11 years, she would allegedly receive half his estimated $250 million fortune).  A source told the Post, &quot;The deal was they&#x2019;d have an &#x2018;heir and a spare.&#x2019; But she&#x2019;s walking away before they had a second child... Katie thought that it would really help with her career. And that she&#x2019;d be Nicole Kidman. But then she was locked down at home, just playing baby mama.&quot;</p>
