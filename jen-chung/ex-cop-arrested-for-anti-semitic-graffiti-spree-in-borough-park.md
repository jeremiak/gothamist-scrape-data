<p>City Councilman David Greenfield said last night, &quot;The community is very disturbed to see these hate messages being spread right before the end of Shabbos. These kinds of acts can&#x2019;t be tolerated. We are working with the NYPD and Shomrim and we will do everything in our power to catch the person.&quot; City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito issued a statement this morning about the incidents as well: &quot;These anti-semitic crimes are outrageous, sickening and have no place in New York City&#x2014;period.&quot; </p>

<p>This morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624115025/https://twitter.com/NYCGreenfield/status/462943377919860736">Greenfield Tweeted</a>, &quot;NYPD has suspect in custody after working thru the night to solve this terrible crime of anti-Semitic graffiti sprayed throughout Boro Park!&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624115025/http://jpupdates.com/2014/05/04/breaking-person-of-interest-in-boro-park-hate-graffiti-spree-in-custody/">JP Updates reports</a> that the Shomrim gave the NYPD a license plate number seen in one of the videos. They say the suspect was then picked up this morning in Queens: &quot;The person in custody has been identified as a former NYPD officer from the 68th precinct. He was fired in 2007, cops say.&quot;</p>

<p>In a statement, Greenfield adds, &quot;The fact that the suspect is a former member of the NYPD is certainly shocking. However, it makes the NYPD&apos;s quick response in apprehending and arresting him even more impressive.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE / 4:40 p.m.]</strong> The NYPD has identified the suspect as 36-year-old Michael Setiawan. Setiawan, who lives in Bellerose, Queens, is charged with 19 counts of criminal mischief as a hate crime, 19 counts of aggravated harassment as a hate crime, and 19 counts of criminal mischief. </p>
