</div></div>					<p>After yesterday&apos;s two suspicious package reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/block_of_eighth_avenue_shut_down_ov.php">shut down a block</a> and then a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/photo_of_times_square_empty_for_sus.php">huge swath of Times Square</a>, people had mixed reactions to the disruptions.  One person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://wcbstv.com/local/times.square.suspicious.2.1681610.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Anything for safety,&quot; while a tourist from Atlanta said, &quot;It&apos;s disturbing that anything suspicious can cause an interruption and excitement and everything on Broadway.&quot; But people really do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/01/times_square_closed_after_police_fi.php">see something legitimately suspicious</a>!</p>

<p>The first suspicious package, around 9:40 a.m, which forced a block at 45th and 8th Avenue to be shut down was an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/lunch_bag_shuts_times_sq_as_jitters_9VtnSxCZWrAXaGMlDNcV3N">&quot;oversized brown bag&quot; containing...a ham sandwich</a>.  There was another around 2:28 p.m., about a truck at 45th and 10th Avenue; the police found the vehicle harmless.  But the highlight of yesterday&apos;s worries was a cooler left in a pedestrian plaza, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/photo_of_times_square_empty_for_sus.php">which caused an evacuation</a> between 44th and 47th Streets and  between 6th and 8th Avenues, and left an eerily empty Times Square.</p>

<p>Not only did the bomb squad&apos;s robot inspect the bag and take X-rays, both a bomb squad member wearing a special suit and helmet and an explosives-sniffing dog examined the cooler.  The bomb squad member, Kevin Canavan, &quot;discovered the cooler contained only a few bottles of Poland Spring water and a bag to hold a book,&quot; according to the Post.  NYPD spokesman Paul Browne <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/seeing-many-somethings/">said that on a regular day</a>, there are 90-100 calls about suspicious packages, while there were 150 yesterday, &quot;It will eventually taper off. People are being more vigilant. That&apos;s a good thing. We would rather err on the side of caution.&quot;</p>

<p>One Brooklyn resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221052030/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/07/2010-05-07_times_square_evacuated_as_nypd_investigate_suspicious_package_at_46th_street_and.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;What are you gonna do? I was on the 24th floor of the first Trade Center tower that was hit. After that, I&apos;ve got no worries.&quot;</p>
