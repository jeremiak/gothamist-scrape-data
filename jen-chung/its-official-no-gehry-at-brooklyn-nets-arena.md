<p>Last week, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140111222821/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/27/atlantic_yards_nets_arena_will_be_l.php">Daily News reported</a> that Atlantic Yards developer Bruce Ratner had hired Kansas City design firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140111222821/http://www.ellerbebecket.com/">Ellerbe Becket</a> to revise the Brooklyn Nets arena designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry.  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140111222821/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/nyregion/05gehry.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">NY Times confirms that Gehry is out</a>.</p>

<p>The Times says Gehry&apos;s design for the Barclays Center an &quot;exotic, glass-walled arena&quot; with a price tag of (at least) $1 billion was kicked aside for Ellerbe&apos;s $800 million plan: The firm &quot;specializes in convention centers, stadiums and arenas, and designed Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, where the Indiana Pacers play. <strong>Officials who have seen the design for the Brooklyn arena say that while it resembles Conseco Fieldhouse, it also bears a likeness to an &apos;airplane hangar.&apos;</strong>&quot;  The Times also reminds us, &quot;Mr. Gehry is still the master planner for the 22-acre development, which is at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues.&quot; Master planner? Isn&apos;t that the title they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140111222821/http://gothamist.com/2003/12/10/wtc_tower_to_be_tallest_building.php">gave Daniel Libeskind</a> for World Trade Center planning?</p>

<p>Ratner has stated he hopes to break ground on the arena this year; his opponents doubt that will happen.  </p>
