Then three other cars piled up. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823005749/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22917609/deadly-crash-on-tappan-zee-bridge">My Fox NY reports</a>, &quot;The Nissan flipped over before landing on its roof in the middle lane, said police. Another driver managed to swerve away from [the Explorer], but hit the overturned Nissan. A fourth vehicle rear-ended the flipped over vehicle, according to a police report.&quot;</p>

<p>The Explorer&apos;s driver, Michael Schechel, 69, who was also hospitalized, entered the NY State Thruway via Exits 10, 11 or 12. No charges have been filed yet.</p>

<p>The crash, at 9 p.m., closed down the northbound lanes and with the southbound lanes limited due to construction, there were delays for hours. The bridge wasn&apos;t fully reopened until 4 a.m.</p>
