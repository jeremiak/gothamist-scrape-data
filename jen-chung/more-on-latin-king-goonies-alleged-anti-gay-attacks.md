Now, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510002654/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/10/09/2010-10-09_gang_goes_on_sick_rampage_sodomizing_teen_with_plunger_and_forcing_another_to_bu.html">more details about the cruel attacks</a> which City Council Speaker Christine Quinn called &quot;appalling and are even more despicable because the victims were clearly targeted in acts of hate simply because they are gay.&quot; </p>

<p>On Sunday at 3:30 a.m., nine Latin King Goonies allegedly dragged a 17-year-old&#x2014;who hoped to join the gang&#x2014;into an abandoned house at 1910 Osborne Place, stripped him, slashed with a box cutter, beaten with a beer can, demanded to know the name of a 30-year-old man he slept with, and then sodomized him with a toilet plunger.  They let him go, but allegedly threatened to kill him if he told anyone about the attack; the victim went to the hospital but only said he was jumped and robbed.  </p>

<p>Then, at 8:30 p.m., the suspects grabbed another 17-year-old who also admitted to having sex with the same 30-year-old man, also beating and sodomizing this teen as well as robbing him.  They kept this victim while luring the 30-year-old to the apartment, claiming there was a party.  The 30-year-old arrived with 10 tall cans of the malt liquor Four Loko.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510002654/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/nyregion/09bias.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=nyregion">According to the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>The attackers forced the man to strip to his underwear and tied him to a chair, the police said. [The second teen victim] was still there, and the &#x201C;Goonies&#x201D; ordered him to attack the man. The teenager hit him in the face and burned him with a cigarette on his nipple and penis as the others jeered and shouted gay slurs, the police said. Then the attackers whipped the man with a chain and sodomized him with a small baseball bat. The beatings and robberies went on for hours...<p></p>

<p> The attackers forced the man to drink all 10 cans of liquor &#x2014; each about twice the size of a can of beer, with a higher alcohol content, 10 percent to 12 percent, according to Four Loko&#x2019;s Web site.</p>

<p>While the man was held captive and attacked, five of the Latin King Goonies went to his house, which he shared with his 40-year-old brother. Using a key taken from the 30-year-old to get inside, they found his brother in bed. They pulled a blanket over his head and hit him, demanding money. When he refused, one placed a cellphone to the brother&#x2019;s ear, and he heard the voice of his younger brother, who said he had been kidnapped and who pleaded, &#x201C;Give them the money.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The brother complied. The men took $1,000 in cash, two debit cards and a 52-inch television.</p></blockquote><p></p>
