<p>Earlier this year, a family noticed, via their nanny cam footage, that their nanny was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143725/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/06/video_staten_island_nanny_caught_hi.php">slapping and smacking their five-month-old baby girl</a>. Mamura Nasirova, 52, was arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a child. Now it turns out that abuse was much worse and that the baby&apos;s older brother was also a victim.</p>

Those cameras also documented Ms. Nasirova smacking the little girl&apos;s 17-month-old brother with her hand and a baby bottle on separate occasions, kicking him, shaking him, pulling his hair and slamming him onto the couch, according to court records and a law enforcement source.&quot;</p>

<p>The parents had taped the nanny because they had suspicions about her.</p>

<p>Nasirova pleaded guilty to two counts of child endangerment and will be sentenced to 10 months in prison. She may also be deported back to her native Uzbekistan. </p>
