Reader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153336/http://rokked.com/">Brian James</a> sent these photographs and tells us the package turned out to be harmless&#x2014;it was an empty suitcase!<br>
 Well, Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad <em>did</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153336/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/05/failed_times_square_car_bomber_gets.php">warn of impending terror</a> during his sentencing yesterday (in the wake of Shahzad&apos;s May 1 bomb, there were many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153336/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/photo_of_times_square_empty_for_sus.php">suspicious package reports</a>) and there have been concerns about Al Qaeda plots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153336/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/03/state_dept_issues_terror_warning_to.php">targeting tourist destinations in Europe</a> lately.</p>
