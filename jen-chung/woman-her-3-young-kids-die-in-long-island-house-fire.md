Jennifer McCusker, 41, was killed, as were her three children, seven-year-old  Aidan Tarbell and 2-year-old twins Brendan and Ava Jane Mistretta. Brookhaven Town Supervisor Edward Romaine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003205/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/mother-three-kids-killed-in-shirley-house-fire-1.6243107">said firefighters were incredibly upset</a>: &quot;They had never seen anything so horrific.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The fire occurred after 10 p.m. Police and firefighters say that McCusker had gone to the toddlers&apos; bedroom and managed to remove one child from the crib. She was hit by smoke inhalation while trying to get the other child. Newsday reports, &quot;Firefighters found.. McCusker... in the bedroom clutching one of her children.&quot;</p>

<p>The fire was intense. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003205/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/12/police-house-fire-leaves-several-injured-in-shirley/">neighbor said to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I heard loud popping noise and I came outside and the house was engulfed in flames. It was pouring out the windows, out the sides, it was nothing, nothing I could do.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another neighbor&apos;s sons, an EMT and a firefighter all tried to get into the house but couldn&apos;t because of the smoke and heat. </p>

<p>Neighbor George Flamme <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003205/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/nyregion/house-fire-on-long-island.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">spoke to the NY Times</a>; he &quot;described Ms. McCusker as &apos;one of the greatest people on earth.&apos; He said she had been caring for his 9-year-old son for the last three weeks, while he was in the hospital. He had only returned home a day before.&quot; He said, &quot;People need to know what a wonderful person she was. People have to understand that this is real life. We&#x2019;re living this.&quot;</p>

<p>The cause of the fire is being investigated.<br>
