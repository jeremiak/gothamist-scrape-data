<p>The NYPD is hoping the public can help them find a man wanted for public lewdness in Jamaica, Queens. Basically, he&apos;s showing off his junk from his Subaru. </p>

<p>According to police, it happened last Thursday, March 20, when two women in their 20s where walking on 120 Avenue near 198th Street. The women noticed a man in his car with his legs and feet on the dashboard. When they passed by, the NYPD says, &quot;The suspect followed the females and parked his auto in a place that made the victims pass him again. When they did, the suspect was now naked from the waist down with his legs on the dashboard.&quot;</p>

<p>The women fled the scene without any injuries. The police say the suspect is driving a grey and green 2003 Subaru Legacy. Anyone with information in regards to this public lewdness or the owner of the vehicle in the photos attached is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
