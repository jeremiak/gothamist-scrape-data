										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_twinn2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140821080010im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_twinn2.jpg" width="365" height="241" class="image-left"> </span>Last Saturday at 7:30 p.m., a 24-year-old man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140821080010/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/24/south_carolina_man_visiting_relativ.php">fatally shot on Nostrand Avenue near Glenwood</a>.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140821080010/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/25/surveillance_video_shows_fatal_shoo.php">graphic surveillance video showing Trevonne Winn talking on his cellphone</a> and then getting shot by a man was released, in hopes that more information about the suspect can be found. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140821080010/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/images_of_chilling_execution_zPjVQDAGt0orymbhwqVt9I">According to the Post</a>, Winn&apos;s mother was extremely upset by the video, because others on the street appear to simply be standing there and watching Winn twitch from his injuries, &quot;What kind of city is this? No one helped my child. Someone could have helped him and turned him over on his side to help him breathe... I saw that video. When I saw the video, I walked out of the room. That will be forever engraved in my memory. I saw my child fall on the floor, and nobody tried to help him.&quot;</p>

<p>Winn, who had been living in South Carolina, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140821080010/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/26/2011-04-26_brooklyn_slay_caught_on_video.html">was standing</a> &quot;outside his uncle&apos;s Crown Fried Chicken shop at 2085 Nostrand Ave. in East Flatbush&quot; when the shooting took place. A police source was also disgusted by the behavior of the on-lookers in the video, noting that one person even seemed to take a cellphone picture of the dying man.  Here are graphic videos of the shooting, suspect, and on-lookers from the Post and News:</p>

<p>His relatives said that it was likely a mistaken identity killing because he didn&apos;t know anyone and wasn&apos;t in a gang, but his girlfriend, Andreaka Broom, who is the mother of their one-year-old daughter and is expecting their second child, isn&apos;t so sure. Broom, an Atlanta resident, told the Post, &quot;I don&apos;t think this was a case of mistaken identity. I saw the video. The killer got a chance to look at him and analyze his face. In my heart of hearts, I know it&apos;s not mistaken identity.&quot; She added, &quot;He wanted to turn his life around. He hawked comedy-club invites and wanted to pursue a music career in hip-hop. That was his passion. So I don&apos;t really think he was up there long enough to be in a gang.&quot; </p>
