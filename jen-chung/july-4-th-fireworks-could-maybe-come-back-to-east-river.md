<p>Tomorrow&apos;s Macy&apos;s July 4th Fireworks Spectacular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124204/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/01/where_to_see_the_2011_macys_july_4t.php">will be held on the Hudson River</a> for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124204/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/13/suck_it_brooklyn_4th_of_july_firewo.php">third year in a row</a>, which has upset Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan residents with East River views/access.  But know this: Macy&apos;s tried to move the fireworks to the New York Harbor&#x2014;this year&apos;s display will celebrate the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124204/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/01/where_to_see_the_2011_macys_july_4t.php#photo-3"> Statue of Liberty&apos;s 125th birthday</a>&#x2014;but NYC officials doused that idea.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124204/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/nyregion/spurned-by-lady-liberty-macys-fireworks-show-stays-put.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;City officials rejected that plan, saying that Lower Manhattan could not handle the throngs of spectators who would be drawn downtown... The department-store chain&#x2019;s dashed hopes for a monumental backdrop for the display shows just how tricky it can be to navigate the logistical and political shoals of the city and its various, demanding precincts.&quot;  Additionally, Macy&apos;s tried to get the National Parks Service to agree to let Beyonce perform at the base of Lady Liberty, but the NPS didn&apos;t want any commercial use associated with the symbolic statue: &quot;Beyonc&#xE9; will still sing a couple of songs for NBC&#x2019;s national broadcast of the fireworks. But that performance, which was scheduled to be taped on Friday night, was relegated to a barge tied up about 100 yards from the eastern edge of Liberty Island, the Statue of Liberty&#x2019;s home.&quot;</p>

<p>Another issue is safety.  One reason given why Hudson River was more optimal than the East River&#x2014;the feelings of NYC residents who prefer the fireworks there aside&#x2014;is that it&apos;s wider.  Macy&apos;s spokesman Orlando Veras told the Times, &quot;We also have to think about a viewing location that is easily accessible.&quot; And he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124204/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/07/02/2011-07-02_firesworks02m.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;Macy&apos;s fireworks will continue to take place in and around all of New York City&apos;s waterways, as it has for the past 35 years, and will not be a permanent fixture in any one location.&quot;</p>

<p>So, keep the dream alive, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124204/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/brooklyn/markowitz_fuse_lit_over_brooklyn_PlTbdWeM1jLRd3nbpd59aP">Marty Markowitz</a>!
