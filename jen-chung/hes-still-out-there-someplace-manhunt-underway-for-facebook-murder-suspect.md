<p>An Ohio man who allegedly fatally shot a senior citizen and shared the footage on Facebook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-York-Warning-Facebook-Murder-Suspect-Steve-Stephens-Randomly-Shoots-Kills-Robert-Godwin-Cleveland-419600183.html#ixzz4eVhZUWi6">may be</a> in Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana or Michigan. Today, Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said of suspect Steve Stephens, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/04/17/multistate-manhunt-underway-for-suspect-in-facebook-homicide-video/?utm_term=.03f6f1b3687e">[He&apos;s] still out there someplace.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Stephens, 37, is accused of walking up to 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. in the Glenville section of Cleveland, Ohio on Saturday afternoon and killing him after asking him to say the name of an ex-girlfriend. Stephens then posted the video on Facebook. Here&apos;s a description of the video&#x2014;which was removed from Facebook three hours later&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/04/17/multistate-manhunt-underway-for-suspect-in-facebook-homicide-video/?utm_term=.03f6f1b3687e">from the Washington Post</a>:</p><blockquote>Police said Stephens had pulled his Ford Fusion to the side of a road in east Cleveland about 2 p.m. Sunday and said in the video: &#x201C;I found somebody I&#x2019;m about to kill.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m about to kill this guy right here; he&#x2019;s an old dude,&#x201D; Stephens said as he approached Robert Godwin Sr., who was out looking for aluminum cans on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Can you do me a favor?&#x201D; Stephens said to Godwin before asking him to say the name Joy Lane.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Joy Lane?&#x201D; Godwin responded.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; Stephens replied. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s the reason why this is about to happen to you.&#x201D;</p>

<p>He asked Godwin how old he was, then raised a gun and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The camera spun around; when the picture came back into focus, Godwin&#x2019;s body was on the ground.</p>

<p>The interaction lasted less than a minute.</p></blockquote>Stephens is considered armed and dangerous. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/https://clevelandpolice.wordpress.com/2017/04/17/aggravated-murder-warrant-issued-for-steve-stephens-bm-37/">The Cleveland police say</a>, &quot;If seen call 9-1-1. Do not approach.&quot; At one point during the video, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/us/facebook-live-shooting.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">he says</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m about to keep killing until they catch me.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In other Facebook videos and statuses, Stephens claimed to have killed up to 13-14 people. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170416/search-widens-for-facebook-murder-suspect">Williams said</a>, &quot;There are no more victims that we know are tied to him.&quot;</p>

<p>Godwin was the father of nine and grandfather of 14. His son, Robert Godwin Jr., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/http://www.cleveland.com/crime/index.ssf/2017/04/facebook_live_shooting_victims.html#incart_maj-story-1">told reporters</a>, &quot;I haven&apos;t watched the video. I haven&apos;t even looked at my cellphone or the news. I don&apos;t really want to see it.&quot;</p>

<p>Facebook removed Stephens&apos; profile page, and a spokesperson said, &quot;This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook. We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.&quot;</p>

<p>Stephens is a case manager at Beech Brook, which is a behavioral health agency for children, and in one video, he apparently held up his employee badge, saying, &quot;I&apos;m killing with my Beech Brook badge on too.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213449/http://fox8.com/2017/04/16/employer-of-man-wanted-in-cleveland-murder-on-facebook-we-were-shocked/">A spokesperson for Beech Brook said,</a> &quot;We were shocked and horrified to learn of this news today. We are hoping that the Cleveland Police will be able to apprehend Mr. Stephens as soon as possible and before anyone else is injured.&quot;</p>
