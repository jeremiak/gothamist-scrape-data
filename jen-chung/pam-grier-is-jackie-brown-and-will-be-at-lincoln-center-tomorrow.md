<p>Starting tomorrow, the Film Society of Lincoln Center is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/foxy-the-complete-pam-grier">screening all of iconic film and TV star Pam Grier&apos;s movies</a>. Grier will also be appearing at a few of the screenings, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/jackie-brown">tomorrow night&apos;s screening of <em>Jackie Brown</em></a>, which will be preceded by a Q&amp;A; between Grier and Simon Doonan (there are still tickets!!). </p>

<p><em>Jackie Brown</em> was Quentin Tarantino&apos;s 1997 full-length feature follow-up to <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, and his only script adapted from another writer&apos;s material. The film is a passionate tribute to Grier, whose roles as strong, take-no prisoners women in 1970s blaxploitation films <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/foxy-brown"><em>Foxy Brown</em></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/coffy"><em>Coffy</em></a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/sheba-baby"><em>Sheba Baby</em></a> led Tarantino to dub her the first female action star. </p>

<p>Grier has credited Tarantino for helping revive her career&#x2014;though the first time she met him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://movieline.com/2011/10/03/pam-grier-on-jackie-brown-quentin-tarantino-and-her-reign-as-the-queen-of-70s-action-cinema/">she said</a>, &quot;Yes, it was frightening! I thought he was a stalker. It was for Pulp Fiction, I&apos;m going in and all my posters are on his wall. I said, &apos;Did you put this up for me?&apos; He said, &apos;No, but I would have.&apos;&quot;  </p>

<p>She&apos;ll also be at the Friday midnight screening of the <em>Blacula</em> sequel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/scream-blacula-scream"><em>Screem, Blacula, Scream</em></a>. And before Saturday night&apos;s screening of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526051726/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/coffy">Coffy</a></em>, Grier will be doing a Q&amp;A; with director-producer Warrington Hudlin. </p>
