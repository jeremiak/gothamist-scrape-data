</div></div>					<p>The truthiest late night talk show host signed off last night, with a heartfelt sing-a-long performed by actors, anchors, writers, inventors, musicians, diplomats, artists, a President and even a very large yellow bird and his cookie-obsessed friend. Stephen Colbert kicked off &quot;We&apos;ll Meet Again&quot; with Jon Stewart, as Randy Newman played the piano:</p>
