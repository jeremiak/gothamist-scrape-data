Stiviano in Los Angeles last month (PacificCoastNews)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The police have charged a 40-year-old Long Island man in the Meatpacking District attack on V. Stiviano. Dominick Diorio &quot;surrendered to Nassau County police outside his house [in Old Bethpage] at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday and was turned over to NYPD detectives,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151158/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/v-stiviano-attacker-li-man-dominick-diorio-charged-in-assault-1.8330315?p=680149">Newsday reports</a>.</p>

<p>Stiviano, who gained infamy after her taped conversations shed light on former L.A. Clippers owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151158/http://laist.com/2014/04/26/la_clippers_owner_allegedly_tells_g.php">Donald Sterling&apos;s racist views</a>, had been in New York for an interview with Anderson Cooper (more on that later) when she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151158/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/02/v_stiviano_punched_in_meatpacking_d.php">allegedly punched and called the N-word</a> by two men outside the Gansevoort Hotel on Sunday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151158/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-allegedly-punched-v-stiviano-questioned-article-1.1815322">Her lawyer Marc Nehoray said</a> that when she &quot;was getting inside a cab, one of the assailants punched her in the face, calling her a &apos;f------ n----- bitch. Moments later, Ms. Stiviano was punched again by the same person while he was yelling, &#x2018;I am going to slaughter you.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>Passersby apparently tackled one of the men, and police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151158/http://nypost.com/2014/06/03/man-charged-with-hate-crime-against-stiviano/">tell the Post</a>, &quot;Cops found him sprawled out on the ground, drunk and bleeding and took him to the hospital. At the time they did not know he had allegedly struck Stiviano. But after she filed a complaint Monday, cops put Diorio in a line up Tuesday and the California woman IDed him.&quot;</p>

<p>Diorio was charged with felony charge of assault as a hate crime and a charge of aggravated harassment. When the Post went to to the home that Diorio lives in with his parents, his father said, &quot;Wow, I&#x2019;m not going to tell my wife about this. That&#x2019;ll just upset her. I don&#x2019;t know what to do.&quot; The second suspect is still at large.</p>

<p>Stiviano has been cooperating with authorities. While it was previously reported she suffered only minor injuries, her lawyer said she would be checked out by her doctor in Los Angeles for any broken bones in her face.</p>

<p>As for the CNN interview, Stiviano reportedly backed out because CNN had switched interviewers on her&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151158/http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/06/v-stiviano-cnn-interview-anderson-cooper-chris-cuomo/">Chris Cuomo is no Anderson Cooper</a>!</p>
