The Post says the FBI seized the documents hours before Bruno&apos;s Monday afternoon announcement. </p>

<p>In 2006, Bruno <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140230/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/20/fbi_probes_stat.php">announced that he was under investigation</a>, for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140230/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/06/23/2008-06-23_scandals_plagued_joe_bruno_who_once_clai.html">various deals involving land, racehorses, and labor unions</a>.  Interestingly, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140230/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/06/24/2008-06-24_joe_bruno_wanted_to_know_if_quitting_wou-1.html">Daily News reports</a> that Bruno&apos;s lawyer contacted the FBI to see if his stepping-down &quot;would help end&quot; the FBI probe. But the FBI did not make a deal.  And the Times Union says the documents were requested months ago, but the Senate &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140230/http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=698679&amp;category=CAPITOL">delayed responding to the request.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Bruno has spent the past 32 years in politics and is currently the most powerful Republican in NY State.  Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140230/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/nyregion/25bruno.html">Times notes Bruno&apos;s &quot;astonishing Albany jujitsu&quot;</a>--Bruno made himself the sympathetic figure against crusading Eliot Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140230/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/07/spitzers_scanda.php">during Troopergate</a>.  </p>
