</div></div>					<p>For many, the most stressful part of the holidays is just trying to get where you&apos;re going, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015445/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/22/ivanka_trump_jetblue_why_god.php">often air travel is the worst of all</a>. To help its customers have a little bit of joy amidst the travel chaos, United Airlines has dispatched comfort dogs to seven of its airports across the country. Just look at how cute they are at Newark Airport!!</p>

<p>These pups are from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015445/http://www.ccpettherapy.org/">Creature Comfort Pet Therapy</a>, a non-profit based in Morris Plains, NJ. They&apos;re at the United terminal today (they were also there yesterday and will be there tomorrow; the airline also had dogs at airports in Cleveland, Chicago, Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, and Dulles. </p>

<p>Man&apos;s (and woman&apos;s) best friend have been there &quot;during our busiest days of the holiday travel period,&quot; United Airlines spokesperson Maddie King told us. &quot;We&#x2019;ve seen great success from these dogs, and our customers have really loved seeing our four legged friends at the airports. We&#x2019;ve also had the dogs out for spring break travel and Thanksgiving.&quot; Yes, because pets offer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015445/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/pet_adoption_healing_power.php">many health benefits to humans</a>, like lower blood pressure and giving people more of a sense of tranquility. Actually, maybe airlines should <em>permanently</em> station dogs in airports.</p>

<p>Creature Comfort Pet Therapy&apos;s Erick Spronck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015445/http://abc7ny.com/travel/newark-airport-using-therapy-dogs-to-de-stress-travelers/1668593/">told WABC 7</a>, &quot;Our organization provides approximately 60-plus teams over three days,&quot; with dogs working two-hours shifts. &quot;Dogs do get tired after about an hour, two hours,&quot; he said. &quot;Then he&apos;ll be sleeping in the back of the car, big time.&quot;<br>
