<p>Last night, the NYPD announced it was starting a &quot;Operation Safe Cycle, a two week bicycle safety enforcement initiative,&quot; today, August 13, through Tuesday, August 26. So... does this mean <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228120927/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/misleading_by_example_epic_nypd_bik.php">more police cruisers in the bike lane</a>? Especially at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228120927/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/06/cops_park_in_bike_lane_for_emergenc.php#photo-2">dinner time, outside Papa John&apos;s</a>?</p>

<p>Here&apos;s what the NYPD said:</p><blockquote>The initiative will target the following hazardous violations that create a danger for pedestrians and bicyclists: failure to stop at a red light, disobey a traffic signal or sign, riding the wrong direction against traffic, riding on the sidewalk, and failure to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk. An additional focus will be given to motorists who obstruct bicycle lanes, which creates a hazardous condition for bicyclists.<p></p>

<p>The NYPD asks all persons bicycling and driving in the City to make safety a priority. The NYPD is committed to providing a safe environment for all New Yorkers.</p></blockquote>Will the police knock <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228120927/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/20/cop_allegedly_knocks_woman_from_bic.php">bicyclists off their bikes to ticket them</a>? Block the bike lane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228120927/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/27/cop_blocks_bike_lane_to_ticket_cycl.php">to ticket bicyclists</a>? Hand out tickets for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228120927/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/07/cop_tickets_cyclist_for_not_wearing.php">not wearing helmets</a> (should be a field day with Citi Bike users)?
