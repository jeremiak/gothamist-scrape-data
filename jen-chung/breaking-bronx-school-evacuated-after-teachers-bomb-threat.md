The Post reports the threat was &quot;called in to police by the teacher, who locked himself into a second floor computer room. Cops are communicating with the teacher, whose identity has not yet been released... The man told police he is protesting the mistreatment of teachers.&quot;</p>

Besides JHS 145 and New Millennium Business Academy, the  Urban Science Academy is also in the building&#x2014;with about 1,200 middle school students.  </p>

<p>Police spokesman Paul Browne tells CityRoom the teacher &quot;initially claimed he had planted a bomb, but that does not appear to be the case.&quot; Additionally, the teacher wanted to the principal &quot;ousted&quot; and &quot;said he was on a hunger strike because of some disciplinary case.&quot;  Apparently the teacher, who is the union chapter chairman, may have received a notice that he was being<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511042507/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/26/teachers_gettin.php"> transferred to a &quot;rubber room,&quot;</a> where teachers go and sit all day (while paid) when removed from their duties.  </p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  CityRoom says the teacher surrendered to cops around 11:15 a.m.; he was arrested.
