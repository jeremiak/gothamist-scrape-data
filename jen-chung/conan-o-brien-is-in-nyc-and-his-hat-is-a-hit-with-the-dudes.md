<p>Conan O&apos;Brien will be filming his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203647/http://teamcoco.com/conannyc">late-night talk show</a> from the Beacon Theatre this week, and he bought a new chapeau!  He just Tweeted, &quot;Bought this hat because i thought it would make me look cool in New York. So far, six men have asked me out.&quot; So it was TOTALLY worth the money!  Also awesome about his shows: O&apos;Brien will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203647/http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/10/30/conan-obrien-to-officiate-same-sex-wedding-on-upcoming-show/">officiating a same-sex marriage for one of his staffers</a>!</p>

<p>The NYC shows are to celebrate his one-year anniversary on TBS.

<p>At the Time Warner Center, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203647/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/conan_museum_coming_to_manhattan_te.php">second floor features the Conan Museum</a> (COCO MOCA) with artworks inspired by O&apos;Brien, plus the Conan Loveseat &quot;interactive robotic couch sculpture that talks to fans, hugs them and takes a picture for them.&quot;</p>
