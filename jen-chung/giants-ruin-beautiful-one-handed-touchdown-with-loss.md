</div></div>					<p>In the second quarter of the Giants&apos; home game against the Dallas Cowboys, Big Blue&apos;s 22-year-old rookie receiver Odell Beckham managed to snag a 50-yard pass from Eli Manning&#x2014;with one hand. Instantly, it was dubbed &quot;The Greatest Catch&quot; ever, or at least the greatest catch of the year:</p>

<p>It&apos;s up there with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011534/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/04/we_are_the_cham.php">David Tyree&apos;s 2008 Super Bowl catch</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011534/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/sports/football/dallas-cowboys-edge-the-giants-despite-odell-beckham-jr-spectacular-catch.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0">NY Times described the catch</a>:</p><blockquote>The ball was a blur and Beckham was falling awkwardly off-balance, a crash landing in the end zone turf only a millisecond away. It was impossibly optimistic &#x2014; a wide-eyed rookie&#x2019;s fantasy &#x2014; to even reach for the ball let alone consider catching it.<p></p>

<p>But Beckham knew better. With oversized hands and long fingers, he had practiced one-handed catches hundreds of times and had done so as recently as the pregame warm-ups to Sunday night&#x2019;s game.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I believed I could grab it,&#x201D; Beckham said. &#x201C;I just had to hold onto it. I&#x2019;ve done it before.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Still, when Beckham snatched the plummeting pass out of the air with just his index and middle fingers and his right thumb &#x2014; his back arched and the momentum of the ball pulling his outstretched arm backward and almost parallel to the ground &#x2014; the MetLife Stadium crowd gasped. With a national television audience watching, Beckham yanked the ball to his chest and fell to the ground with an astounding touchdown reception. In homes across the country, the incredulity of Beckham&#x2019;s athleticism was weighed and a debate began immediately &#x2014; not about whether Beckham&#x2019;s grab was among the greatest catches in N.F.L. history but whether it was the singular greatest catch in a football game at any level.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011534/http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2014/11/tom_coughlin_and_giants_teammates_rank_odell_beckham_jrs_catch_among_the_best_theyve_ever_seen.html#incart_river">Coach Tom Coughlin said</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve seen him make a lot of one-handed catches, to be honest with you. But none falling down like that, join away and being able to snatch the ball like that and then stay in bounds after being fouled. That was quite a thing, too. It gave us a great spark and it does that when people make plays like that. It excites the sideline, and the team gets excited about it, and we were.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Beckham said, &quot;I hope it&apos;s not the greatest catch of all time. I hope I can make more. It really means nothing without a win. We still go home at the end of the day with a loss. That&apos;s not fulfilling.&quot;</p>
