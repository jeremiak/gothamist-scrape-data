Mineo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141557/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-nysodo1026,0,2731648.story">who was rehospitalized</a> after the alleged October 15 attack; when asked how he felt, Mineo broke down, &quot;How do you think I&apos;m supposed to feel?  I was violated.&quot;  </p>

<p>Mineo says that when he ran into the Prospect Park (at Flatbush) station, trying to avoid cops who saw him smoking a joint, five officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141557/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/24/cops_accused_of_sodomizing_brooklyn.php">beat him and used a police radio antennae</a> to sodomize him, before taking him into a patrol car.  Mineo&apos;s lawyers say that he smeared blood in the car, but the NYPD, which denies that any misconduct occurred and claims to have looked into the accusation, says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141557/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/10/25/2008-10-25_rev_al_sharpton_makes_hospital_visit_pra.html">there was no blood in the car</a> (and the car didn&apos;t seem washed).</p>

<p>Both Mineo&apos;s lawyers and the NYPD have witnesses who back their sides of the story.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141557/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/nyregion/26police.html">NY Times spoke to one of the police witnesses</a>, a 12-year-old who was visiting his father, a token booth clerk at the station, &quot;<strong>The boy said that Mr. Mineo&#x2019;s pants were falling off as he was running.</strong>&quot;  The Times adds that a police official said &quot;the view of witnesses was obstructed at some crucial point.&quot;</p>

<p>The Brooklyn DA&apos;s office and NYPD&apos;s Internal Affairs are both investigating.  One person who is not sympathetic to Mineo&apos;s plight is Laura Boston.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141557/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10262008/news/regionalnews/ive_been_violated_by_cops_135392.htm">Post reports</a> that Mineo is charged in &quot;an April gang assault&quot; whose victims include Boston&apos;s 14- and 16-year-old sons.  She said, &quot;If the cops snapped off that radio antenna up his ass, I wouldn&apos;t give a f--- about that...  My son has dentures because of that man. Five guys beat up my sons, so it&apos;s right that it took five cops to beat him up.<strong> I don&apos;t wish him any harm or anything, but God don&apos;t like ugly.</strong> You get what you give, you know.&quot;</p>
