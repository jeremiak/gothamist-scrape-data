NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced that the upscale retailer agreed to settle a suit and to undertake a number of measures after his office&apos;s nine-month investigation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160524143907/http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-agreement-barneys-new-york-address-discrimination-against">Schneiderman said</a>, &quot;This agreement will correct a number of wrongs, both by fixing past policies and by monitoring the actions of Barneys and its employees to make sure that past mistakes are not repeated.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Last fall, two black customers claimed that they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160524143907/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/another_barneys_customer_says_she_w.php">accused of credit fraud</a> after buying items there. One, Kayla Phillips, said undercover cops had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160524143907/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/black-barneys-shopper-accused-buying-2g-purse-article-1.1494855">followed her after she bought a $2,500 Celine purse</a>: &quot;There were three men and a woman. Two of them attacked me and pushed me against a wall, and the other two appeared in front of me, blocking the turnstile. They were very rough.&quot;</p>

<p>Schneiderman&apos;s office found:</p><blockquote>- Door guards identified minority customers exclusively as warranting surveillance;<br>
- In-store detectives followed minority customers, even when the customers had been identified by sales associates as clients and frequent patrons of the store; <br>
- In-store detectives disproportionately asked sales associates to reprint receipts after minority customers made purchases in order to confirm the purchases were legitimate; <br>
- In-store detectives disproportionately called sales associates who handled and completed minority customers&#x2019; transactions in order to investigate the customers&#x2019; credit card use; and <br>
- Some sales associates avoided serving minority customers so they would not be contacted by loss-prevention employees seeking to investigate the use of credit cards by minority customers. <p></p>

<p>Additionally, the Attorney General found that Barneys maintained inadequate records of stops made by their loss-prevention employees, but despite these lapses, existing records showed a disproportionate number of African-American and Latino customers being detained for alleged shoplifting or credit card fraud.</p></blockquote>Barneys will:<blockquote>- Retain an independent anti-profiling consultant with expertise in the prevention of racial profiling in loss prevention and asset protection; <br>
- Establish new recordkeeping requirements on investigations, detentions and false stops conducted by loss-prevention employees;<br>
- Limit access to its closed-circuit TV areas by local law enforcement officers and maintain records of visits by local law enforcement officers;<br>
- Adopt new loss-prevention detention policies and a new anti-profiling policy;<br>
- Develop and conduct anti-profiling training for loss-prevention and sales employees;<br>
Investigate customer complaints of profiling; and <br>
- Pay $525,000 in costs, fees, and penalties.</blockquote><br>
