<p>Remember when NJ Governor Chris Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163329/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/chris_christie_wonders_if_nypd_is_a.php">complained about the NYPD&apos;s spying on Muslims in the Garden State</a>, &quot;This is the New York Police Department. I know they think their jurisdiction is the world. Their jurisdiction is New York City. My concern is this kind of obsession that the NYPD seems to have that they&#x2019;re the masters of the universe.&quot;  Well, now the NJ Attorney General says that the NYPD didn&apos;t do anything wrong! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163329/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/nypd_did_no_wrong_in_secretly.html">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;The review and its findings, which have yet to be made public, concluded there was no evidence to show the NYPD&#x2019;s activities in the state violated any New Jersey civil or criminal laws, according to officials in the attorney general&#x2019;s office who participated in the review.&quot; </p>

<p>Additionally, Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa &quot;will issue a general directive today to all state law enforcement agencies that will put in place new notification protocols that will be triggered when they learn of any law enforcement activity being conducted by out-of-state policy agencies within their jurisdiction. That directive comes after some questions were raised over whether the city of Newark, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163329/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/nypd_got_permission_to_spy_on_nj_mu.php">which was notified by the NYPD of its intelligence gathering operations</a>, told anyone else about it. Newark Mayor Cory Booker and the New Jersey State Police both have said they were unaware of the operation, although other state officials said they knew the New York Police were here.&quot;</p>

<p>A source said, &quot;Based on what we saw, their conduct was permissible. There was no evidence of illegal wiretaps or search and seizures. We&#x2019;re not seeing any seeing violations of law.&quot;  So,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163329/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/mayor_bloomberg_we_dont_need_no_sti.php"> Bloomberg</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163329/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/ray_kelly_meets_with_select_muslims.php">Kelly</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163329/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/battle_of_the_big_mouths_christie_f.php">King</a> 1, Christie 0? This victory seems hollow.</p>
