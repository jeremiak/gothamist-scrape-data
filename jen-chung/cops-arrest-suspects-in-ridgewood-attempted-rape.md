<p>Police say that the pair approached an 18-year-old woman who was walking in the vicinity of Putnam Avenue and Seneca Avenue shortly before 3 a.m. on Wednesday morning. One of the men punched her in the head, while the other choked her and covered her mouth with his hand, according to authorities. Then, one tried to sexually assault her as his companion tried to take her purse. Luckily, a passerby walking by scared the attackers into fleeing. </p>

<p>Franclin Velazquez, 21, was charged with attempted rape and sexual abuse while Joge Maldonado, 28, was charged with attempted rape, assault and sexual abuse.</p>
