<p>City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/quinn_still_a_mayoral_favorite_says.php">led polls</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/09/quinn_leads.php">for the Democratic mayoral race</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/09/de_blasio_still_has_big_lead_accord.php">up until the very end</a>, finished a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/quinn_sting_of_defeat.php">disappointing third</a> during last week&apos;s primary election. Now, she&apos;s poised to throw her support behind her former rival, Bill de Blasio.</p>

<p>Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/https://twitter.com/GunaRockYa/status/379952658733207552">will be at City Hall at 11:30 a.m.</a> to endorse de Blasio. Yesterday, Bill Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/democratic_unity_bill_thompson_conc.php">officially conceded to de Blasio</a> at City Hall, with Governor Andrew Cuomo present, in a big display of Democratic party unity. </p>

<p>Many believe that Quinn&apos;s campaign was hobbled by its ties to the Bloomberg administration and its policies (many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/25/times_endorses_quinn_for_mayor.php">newspaper endorsements touted that</a>). Bloomberg himself said he preferred Quinn in the Democratic race in a NY Magazine interview that was notable for how he also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920021720/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/bloomberg_calls_bill_de_blasio_camp.php">called de Blasio&apos;s campaign &quot;racist.&quot;</a></p>
