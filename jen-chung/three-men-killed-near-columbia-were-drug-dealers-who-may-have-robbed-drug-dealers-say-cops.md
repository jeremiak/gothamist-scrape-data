<p>The police believe that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034111/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/07/3_people_found_shot_dead_in_car_nea.php">three men found shot dead</a> in a 2012 BMW 750LI parked in Morningside Heights were drug dealers who were killed in retribution for ripping off other drug dealers.  No bullet holes were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034111/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/06/08/nypd-looking-for-clues-in-morningside-heights-triple-shooting/">found on the outside of the car</a>, leading investigators to suspect the shooter had been inside the vehicle, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034111/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Three-Shot-Killed-Parked-BMW-Morningside-Heights-Columbia-University-157960545.html">which was recently reported stolen</a>.</p>

<p>The bodies were discovered in the car at West 122nd and Claremont Avenue last night by people walking from the park&#x2014;they initially thought the men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034111/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120608/morningside-heights/triple-murder-near-columbia-was-revenge-for-drug-ripoff-sources-say">might have been sleeping but then saw blood</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034111/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/retaliation_have_massacred_near_5qtTK7hmXKuSFIYvX07I1M">Post reports</a>, &quot;Victims Luis Catalan, 25, Heriberto Suazo, 26, and Amaury Rodriquez, 30 &#x2014; all Manhattan residents &#x2014; were described as marijuana traffickers with extensive criminal records, Police spokesman Paul Browne told reporters today. The three men were shot dead execution-style at around 5:30 p.m. by a lone gunman one police source described as a &apos;cool customer.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The victims were identified as Amaury Rodriguez, 31, Heriberto Suazo, 26,  and Luis Catalan, 25.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034111/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-hunt-gunman-parked-bmw-bodies-columbia-university-article-1.1092014">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Suazo was arrested in September in Yonkers with 12 pounds of hydroponic marijuana in a Mercedes and his apartment, along with a loaded .25 caliber gun and a loaded .380 semiautomatic weapon. Catalan had 10 arrests on his record, eight of them sealed. One was for marijuana possession, another for driving without a license... Rodriguez spent two years in state prison on a gun rap and was released in January 2011.&quot;</p>

<p>Sources also told the News, &quot;The two front-seat victims were shot behind the ears and the man in the backseat was shot in the left temple &#x2014; all execution-style.&quot; Additionally, police did not find shell casings.</p>

<p>Catalan&apos;s grieving mother told DNAinfo that he had a year-old son, &quot;He was a good son. He was a good son... He used to call me 30 times a day, just to ask, &apos;How are you? How&apos;s the business? You never hear about a son telling his mother 24/7, &apos;I love you.&apos; &apos;I love you.&apos;&quot;</p>
