<p>A New Jersey high school student has been speaking out about a bullying incident that mocked her Muslim faith. On Facebook, Student Saira Ali shared a letter from her school district claiming that photographs taken of her, and posted to Snapchat with &quot;ISIS&quot; and an emoji, were <em>not </em>bullying. And after that sparked the predictable outrage, the school district said the first letter was a mistake and another letter was on its way to her and her family.</p>

<p>Ali wrote on Sunday, with an image of the letter from the Woodbridge School District,  &quot;Apparently, according to the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights Act, it&apos;s entirely acceptable to take pictures of strangers and post them on social media with derogatory, inaccurate, slurs...I guess this is what the world would be like if Donald Trump ever became president.&quot; </p>

<p>The photographs were taken during lunch at Colonia High School in June.</p>

It was hateful, it was biased, it was racist. It&apos;s our job to ensure we have a process in place to prevent this from happening again.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326181501/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2015/10/school_isis_slur_prompts_call_for_nj_review_of_mus.html#incart_river_home">The school district says</a> that it did consider the incident a crime of harassment and also contacted the police. However, they couldn&apos;t identify who actually took the pictures. </p>

His office believed that the fact there was no offender, there was no bullying. A second letter has been sent to the student&#x2019;s family clarifying matters, he said.&quot;</p>

<p>Two students were apparently disciplined and now all students are banned from using their cellphones during lunch.</p>

<p>Today, the teen posted a more hopeful message on Twitter:</p>
