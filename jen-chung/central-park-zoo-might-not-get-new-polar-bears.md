                            <p>As we mourn the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901081505/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/gus_the_central_park_zoo_polar_bear.php#photo-1">death of Gus the Central Park Zoo polar bear</a>, there&apos;s news about the future of the polar bear exhibit: It seems it may not have polar bears in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901081505/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/nyregion/gus-new-yorks-most-famous-polar-bear-dies-at-27.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The zoo has not decided whether it will try to find a polar bear at another zoo to occupy Gus&#x2019;s habitat. It might instead select a different species to go there, like a seal.&quot; </p>

<p>Gus became a national sensation when he would swim laps in his pool for hours, prompting armchair therapists to deem him &quot;depressed.&quot; An actual therapist determined he was just bored. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901081505/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/02/nyregion/about-new-york-stay-at-home-swb-8-into-fitness-seeks-thrills.html">From the NY Times in 1994</a>:</p><blockquote>Gus, insists Allison Power, the zoo spokeswoman, &quot;is actually healthy. It&apos;s just a mild neurosis.&quot; JUST A MILD NEUROSIS? CALL YOURSELF A NEW YORKER AND ALL YOU GOT IS A MILD NEUROSIS?<p></p>

<p>LIKE so many aspiring to the big time, Gus is not really a native New Yorker, but came here from somewhere else, specifically, Toledo, Ohio, which is in the Midwest. Officials at the Toledo Zoo insisted that Gus, who is 8 years old, behaved normally when he lived there.</p>

<p>&quot;He was perfectly fine,&quot; said Glenous Favata, then curator of mammals, who knew him as a young bear in the mid-1980&apos;s. &quot;He was with his mother.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmmmmm.</p></blockquote>The zookeepers planned more enrichment games to spark Gus&apos;s interest, as well as the attention of the other bears, Lily and Ida, who passed away before Gus. <p></p>

<p>Here are some videos of Gus and Ida:</p>
