<p>A Queens woman was fined $1,000&#x2014;and advised to retain an attorney&#x2014;after she posted details about a robbery trial while it was happening. How did she get the details? She was on the jury.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317022331/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/exclusive-queens-juror-fined-facebook-blabbing-article-1.2421830">The Daily News reports</a> that Kimberly Ellis &quot;began posting details of jury deliberations about a 2014 robbery case &#x2014; sometimes twice a day &#x2014; from the Kew Gardens courthouse... &apos;Everything about this process is inefficient,&apos; she complained in a Sept. 17 posting. &apos;I&#x2019;m trying to remain positive and centered but, truthfully, I&#x2019;m dying from boredom.&apos;&quot;</p><blockquote>After the jury began deliberating, Ellis continued dishing &#x2014; in detail &#x2014; on Facebook.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;God help me,&#x201D; she wrote in one posting. &#x201C;The other jurors don&#x2019;t trust the police and want to outright dismiss the confessions as well as the majority of the rest of the evidence. Tomorrow is going to be a very difficult day.&#x201D;</p>

<p>One of Ellis&#x2019; Facebook friends just happened to be a former federal and Brooklyn District Attorney&#x2019;s Office prosecutor &#x2014; and she blew the whistle on the over-sharing juror.</p></blockquote>According to the News, Queens Supreme Court Justice Ira Margulis said, &quot;Now, can you tell me why you did this?&quot; and Ellis answered, &quot;Well, I sometimes &#x2014; I suppose I forget it&#x2019;s so public and it&#x2019;s Facebook and it&#x2019;s something that I use a lot. And I&#x2019;m pretty quiet in my day-to-day dealings with people, so it&#x2019;s just a way for me to, you know, express myself.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Margulis then said, &quot;Even though you violated an expressed order from the Court not to do that?&quot; He ultimately booted her from the jury, telling her, &quot;It is in your best interests that you retain an attorney,&quot; and called a mistrial because there were no alternate jurors. It&apos;s believed that a re-trial will costs thousands, not to mention all the time spent by the prosecution, defense and witnesses put into the first one.</p>

<p>Ellis told the News, &quot;I continued my personal life as if I was not there to judge a trial. It was my first time as a juror, and I was naive.&quot; Hasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317022331/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/28/al_roker_tweets_from_inside_crimina.php">Al Roker taught us anything</a>? She added, &quot;I failed to make the necessary changes in my daily life...I feel terrible. I never meant to hurt anyone. I wasted a lot of people&#x2019;s time and money, and I deeply regret what I did.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317022331/http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2014/06/serving_jury_duty_its_ethical.html">American Bar Association ruled that it was ethical</a> for lawyers and investigators to peek at jurors&apos; social media activity, so they can &quot;probe for information that might signal leanings of potential jurors, or unearth juror misconduct during trials.&quot;</p>
