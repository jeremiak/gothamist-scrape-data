<blockquote>Manhattan: 1130 x 1300

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito will be marching. Mark-Viverito issued a statement this morning, &quot;Today, thousands of people from across the nation will march in solidarity for a sustainable future and a stronger earth. The People&apos;s Climate March is an opportunity for New Yorkers to come together and take a stand to combat climate change. From committing to reducing the footprint of New York City&apos;s municipal operations to making our air even cleaner, the City Council is proud of our on-going efforts to create a greener City. Together we can and will build a more environmentally friendly future that will last for generations to come.&quot;</p>

<p>Senator Kirsten Gillibrand issued a statement, too, &quot;The People&#x2019;s Climate March is yet another wakeup call for our country to become a global leader in the fight against climate change. There is no doubt that climate change is here, it is real, and we must develop policies that will reverse the troubling trends we are witnessing. By bringing together both businesses and environmental groups, this march sends a strong message that we must all work together and actually solve this problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Tomorrow is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161012083440/http://floodwallstreet.net/">Flood Wall Street</a>, a sit-in in the Financial District where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161012083440/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/17/climage_change_march_nyc.php">participants are looking to get arrested</a>.</p>
