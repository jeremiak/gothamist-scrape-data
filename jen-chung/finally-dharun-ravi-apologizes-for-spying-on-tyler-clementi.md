<p>Dharun Ravi is preparing to turn himself into jail officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/dharun_ravi_to_be_sentenced_for_spy.php">for his 30-day</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/dharun_ravi_may_serve_less_than_30.php">or less</a>) sentence for spying on his Rutgers roommate Tyler Clementi.  And today he issued a statement, &quot;I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/dharun_ravi_reports_to_jail.html">According to the Star-ledger</a>, since prosecutors are appealing the sentence (which they think is too light), Ravi does not need to enter jail on the date the judge recommended: &quot;[However] his lawyer said Ravi wanted to go through with it sooner rather than later. &apos;It&#x2019;s his decision,&apos; said the lawyer, Steven Altman. &apos;He wanted to get it over with.&apos;&quot; Here&apos;s the full statement:</p><blockquote>Last Monday, I was sentenced to 3 years probation, 300 hours of community service, a fine of more than $10,000.00, and 30 days in jail. Since the Middlesex County Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office appealed that sentence, the sentence does not have to start until the appeal is decided. Nevertheless, I decided to accept and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible. It&#x2019;s the only way I can go on with my life.<p></p>

<p>I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010. My behavior and actions, which at no time were motivated by hate, bigotry, prejudice or desire to hurt, humiliate or embarrass anyone, were nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions. I apologize to everyone affected by those choices. I am surrendering myself to the Middlesex County Correctional Facility on Thursday, May 31, 2012, to start my 30-day period of imprisonment.</p></blockquote>In September 2010, Ravi had set up a webcam in the dorm room he shared with Clementi and viewed Clementi and Clementi&apos;s guest during intimate encounters, and shared a link (unsuccessfully) to view the livestream via Twitter. Clementi killed himself by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/rutgers_students_appalled_over_vide.php">jumping off the George Washington Bridge</a> the day after the second time he was filmed. While prosecutors have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/trial_of_tyler_clementis_roommate_b.php"> portrayed Ravi as homophobic</a>, his lawyer and the witnesses speaking on his behalf said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/family_friends_of_dharun_ravi.html">was not homophobic</a>, instead claiming he was simply acting immaturely. But jurors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/justice_has_been_served_for_tyler_c.php">agreed with prosecutors</a>, finding that Ravi invaded Clementi&apos;s and his guest&apos;s privacy twice and meant to intimidate Clementi when he spied a second time.<p></p>

<p>Judge Glenn Berman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531061555/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/unclear_whether_dharun_ravis_30-day.php">decided upon the controversial sentence</a> citing of Ravi&apos;s &quot;colossal insensitivity... The word hate has never crossed my lips nor [Prosecutor Julia] McClure&#x2019;s. This individual was not convicted of a hate crime. he was convicted of a bias crime and there&apos;s a difference. I do not believe he hated Tyler Clementi. He had no reason to. But I do believe that he acted out of colossal insensitivity.&quot;  But he did note that Ravi never apologized during the trial.</p>
