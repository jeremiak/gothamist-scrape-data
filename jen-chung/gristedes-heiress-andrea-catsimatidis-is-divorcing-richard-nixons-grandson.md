<p>Four years ago, the tabloids were <em>gaga</em> (and slightly <em>eww</em>) about the romance between Andrea Catsimatidis and Christopher Cox. Now, they are getting divorced.</p>

<p>Catsimatidis, daughter of billionaire Gristede&apos;s mogul/oil baron/mayoral candidate John Catsimatdis, was just a 17-year-old high school student when she met Cox, then 28, the son of Tricia Nixon and NY State GOP chair Ed Cox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908070533/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/16/nixons_grandson_hearts_gristedes_su.php">and romance bloomed</a>. Did we mention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908070533/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/fashion/weddings/andrea-catsimatidis-and-christopher-cox-weddings.html?pagewanted=all">they met at her high school</a>? Anyway, as someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908070533/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/young_goper_PW2rQiH5SWynKiIg83XsxN">gossiped to the Post</a>, &quot;Everyone&apos;s snickering behind their back. She&apos;s a kid. He brings her to these very staid Republican events and she&apos;s in a miniskirt. It&apos;s the political equivalent of &apos;The Addams Family.&apos;&quot; Cox unsuccessfully ran for a Long Island Congressional seat in 2010.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908070533/http://nypost.com/2014/12/17/catsimatidis-daughter-files-for-divorce-from-husband-of-3-years/">According to Page Six</a>, Catsimatidis &quot;filed for divorce Wednesday against her husband of three years,&quot; specifically &quot;an uncontested divorce, meaning that the split&#x2019;s not likely to be protracted.&quot;</p>

<p>The end result is that Cox will no longer be part of the best Christmas card in the city:</p>

<p>Additionally, Andrea Catsimatidis has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908070533/http://gawker.com/anatomy-of-a-right-wing-bill-clinton-meme-1672708883">turned into a prop in a gross GOP meme</a>, where operatives have &quot;strategically&quot; cropped a photograph of her, her mother and President Bill Clinton.</p>
