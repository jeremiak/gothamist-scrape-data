<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_06_anlesent.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624053334im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_anlesent.jpg" width="365" height="252"> <br> <i>Le&apos;s mother, Vivian Van Le, center walks with attorney Joseph Tacopina, and an unidentified woman in June (AP)</i></div> The family of the Yale graduate student who was killed by a lab technician has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624053334/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-yale-annie-le-lawsuit-0907-20110906,0,1844041.story">filed a lawsuit against the school</a>, accusing the Ivy League institution of failing to protect women. A statement released lawyer Joseph Tacopina said that Yale had &quot;long taken inadequate steps to ensure the safety and security of women on its campus. Yale&apos;s persistent tolerance of sexual harassment and sexual assaults on campus caused students to file a Title IX Complaint against Yale University. And, just five days before she was to be married, Annie Le was a victim of that environment.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Le went missing in September 2009 days before her wedding. After a search for the missing 24-year-old, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624053334/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/14/missing_brides_body_thought_to_be_f.php">Le&apos;s body was found on what</a> would have been her wedding day, stuffed inside a wall at a Yale research building. Raymond Clark, a lab technician who was arrested based on DNA, keycard and video surveillance, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624053334/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/04/lab_tech_sentenced_to_44_years_for.php">pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 44 years in prison</a>, &quot;I stand here today taking full responsibility for my actions. I am truly, truly sorry for taking Annie&#x2019;s life.&quot;</p>

<p>Lawyers for Le&apos;s family also said, &quot;Based on Yale&apos;s negligence in, among other things, hiring, retaining and supervising Clark, and providing a safe and secure environment for Annie Le, Ms. Le endured a brutal physical and sexual attack, resulting in significant conscious suffering before her death, for which Yale is liable.&quot;</p>

<p>Yale released a statement saying there was no basis for the civil suit, &quot;Yale had no information indicating that Raymond Clark was capable of committing this terrible crime, and no reasonable security measures could have prevented his unforeseeable act. Annie Le&apos;s murder shocked and deeply saddened the entire Yale community. As a community we united to support and comfort her family and loved ones, and create a lasting memorial to her life. This lawsuit serves neither justice nor Annie&apos;s memory, and the University will defend against it as appropriate.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is Clark&apos;s statement from his sentencing:</p>
