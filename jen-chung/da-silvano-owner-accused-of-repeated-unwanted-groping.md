<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_11_dasilgroper.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119230600im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_dasilgroper.jpg" width="300" height="321" class="image-right"> </span>The owner of West Village celebrity-magnet restaurant Da Silvano was hit with sexual assault lawsuit.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119230600/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/try_da_meat_balls_mX7BKwQqQxh18qAldFepII">According to the Post</a>, parking garage manager Samuel Cruz claims Silvano Marchetto fondled his genitals twice. And the Post&apos;s lede is &quot;Maybe he just wanted to know if the noodle was al dente.&quot;</p>

<p>Marchetto has three Ferraris and an Audi at the West Third Street garage where Cruz works.  The first time, Marchetto, while waiting for a ride, &#x201C;turned around and rubbed plaintiff Cruz&#x2019;s penis with his hand.&#x201D; Cruz objected, but didn&apos;t press charges because he &#x201C;was hoping that this was a one-time event.&quot;  And then it allegedly happened again. From the Post:</p><blockquote>On Oct. 28, Marchetto &#x2014; who&#x2019;s married to New Yorker cartoonist and cancer survivor Marissa Acocella Marchetto &#x2014; allegedly repeated the stunt after again pulling his Ferrari into the garage.<p></p>

<p>After Marchetto made sure nobody was watching, Cruz claims he &#x201C;again reached out his hand and suddenly began to rub plaintiff Cruz&#x2019;s penis.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;However, this sexual assault was much more severe than the last, as defendant Marchetto actually grabbed and held onto plaintiff Cruz&#x2019;s penis, refusing to let go,&#x201D; the suit says.</p>

<p>Cruz claims he &#x201C;firmly demanded that defendant Marchetto stop this sexual assault,&#x201D; as he &#x201C;was not only offended and disturbed . . . but was also in real fear for his personal safety.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Cruz is suing for unspecified damages.<p></p>
