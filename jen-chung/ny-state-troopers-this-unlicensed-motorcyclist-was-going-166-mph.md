McCarthy</i></div> If the state police stop you and tell you that you were going at least 150 mph on the NY State Thruway while on your Suzuki motorcycle, would you tell the troopers that your ride can go easily top 190 mph?  Well, that&apos;s allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529114531/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/18067308/police-motorcycle-hit-170-mph-on-ny-state-thruway">what Nikkolaus V. McCarthy did yesterday</a>.<p></p>

<p>The NY State Police say that a trooper in Albany County spotted a speeding motorcycle&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529114531/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/02/state-police-motorcycle-clocked-at-166-mph-on-n-y-state-thruway/">going 166 mph</a>&#x2014; on the Thruway around 12:45 p.m.  He tried to slow down the motorcyclist, but was unable to do so. The trooper managed to get a description of the motorcyclist and license plate number&#x2014;and decided against pursuing the motorcycle because it was going so fast&#x2014;and alerted his colleagues, who found the motorcycle to be going between 150 and 170 mph at different points on the Thruway.  </p>

<p>Thruway maintenance workers also gave the troopers updates about the motorcyclist&apos;s whereabouts, and, 50 miles after it was initially spotted, troopers found McCarthy in New Paltz (he needed gas!).  Troopers told him how fast he was going and McCarthy allegedly bragged the Suzuki could go over 190 mph. </p>

<p>McCarthy was charged with third-degree fleeing police, reckless driving, speeding, and operating out of class&#x2014;<strong>because he did not have a motorcycle license</strong>. He is being held on $20,000 bail.</p>
