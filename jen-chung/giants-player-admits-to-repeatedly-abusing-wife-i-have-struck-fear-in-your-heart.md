<p>The NY Giants are reeling after SNY revealed that kicker Josh Brown admitted to terrorizing his now ex-wife. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025151448/https://www.sny.tv/giants/news/josh-brown-admitted-to-physically-and-emotionally-abusing-his-wife/206633850">The sports network explained</a> that he wrote about &quot;physically and emotionally abusing his wife and called himself a sex-addicted &apos;deviant&apos; who viewed himself as &apos;God&apos; and his wife as &apos;my slave&apos;, according to entries in his own journals, emails to his wife, and a letter he wrote to friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Over the summer, the NFL suspended Brown for one game, after it was revealed he had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025151448/http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2016/08/josh_brown_suspension_a_look_at_domestic_violence.html">arrested for domestic violence</a> in Washington state in 2015. The Giants, who knew of Molly Brown&apos;s claims of abuse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025151448/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/sports/football/ny-giants-kicker-josh-brown-domestic-violence.html">re-signed Brown</a> to a two-year $4 million contract in April, and owner John Mara told the NY Times in August, &quot;Based on the facts and circumstances that we were aware of at that time, we were comfortable with our decision to re-sign him. Nothing has happened in the meantime to make us question that decision.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the Giants haven&apos;t made any statements today about the extremely dark details from Brown&apos;s counseling &quot;Contract for Change&quot; journal, which was written in 2013 and also includes Brown&apos;s confession that he was abused as a young boy. From SNY:</p><blockquote>&quot;I have physically, mentally, emotionally and verbally been a repulsive man,&quot; Brown wrote in one of his journal entries. Just below that he circled the words &quot;I have abused my wife.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Josh went even further in a letter he wrote to friends in March, 2014, apparently as part of his counseling sessions with Molly, saying his issues with his behavior towards women date back to when he was &quot;molested as a young boy (around 6)&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been a liar for most of my life,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I made selfish decisions to use and abuse women starting at the age of 7 to fill this void. I objectified women and never really worried about the pain and hurt I caused them. My ability to connect emotionally to other people was zero. My empathy levels were zero.</p>

<p>&quot;Because I never handled these underlying issues I became an abuser and hurt Molly physically, emotionally and verbally. I viewed myself as God basically and she was my slave.&quot;</p>

<p>In one of the documents, which was apparently signed by both Molly and Josh and called a &quot;Contract for Change&quot; and dated March 28, 2013 -- more than two years before Josh was arrested -- Josh makes it clear exactly how he abused Molly. There are eight items listed in the signed contract, including &quot;I have physically, verbally and emotionally abused my wife Molly,&quot; &quot;I have controlled her by making her feel less human than me, and manipulated her with money&quot; and &quot;I have disregarded my step sons&apos; feelings and they have witnessed me abusing their mother.&quot;</p>

<p>...In many of the emails and journals, Josh seems to be apologetic and often filled with self-loathing for his actions. In an email dated May 11, 2013, he also appears to again admit to physical violence, writing &quot;I am sure there were several moments of panic for the boys and wondering if they were in a safe place with me. I am sure you were afraid to tell me how you truly felt because you feared my reaction. &#x2026; I have struck fear in your heart and not love, compassion or friendship. From the bruise on your leg when we argued &#x2026; to the zipper that caught you last April. I am ashamed and disgraced to call myself a husband.&quot;</p></blockquote>The NFL claims they tried to get information about Molly Brown&apos;s allegations, but were stymied:<p></p>

<p>Brown has previously called his arrest, in which charges were later dropped, &quot;just a moment,&quot; but now critics are calling him a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025151448/http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2016/10/giants_and_nfl_must_explain_decisions_on_josh_brow.html">&quot;monster.&quot;</a> The NFL, which has been previously criticized for how its handled domestic violence cases, apparently also knew about a 2016 Pro Bowl incident where Molly Brown and three children were taken to a different hotel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025151448/http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/giants/josh-brown-giants-kicker-admitted-to-abusing-his-wife-in-journal-entries-1.12478581">after Josh Brown tried to get into her room</a> against her will.

<p>The Giants are headed to London tonight for an overseas game. It&apos;s unclear if Brown will join the team.<br>
