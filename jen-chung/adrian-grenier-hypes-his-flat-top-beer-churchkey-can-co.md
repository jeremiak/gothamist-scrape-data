<p>Adrian Grenier is many things: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073320/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/16/adrian_grenier.php">New Yorker</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073320/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/12/the_gothamist_band_interview_the_honey_brothers.php">musician</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073320/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/adrian_grenier_puts_down_roots_at_g.php">food co-op shopper</a> and now we can add retro-flat top beer purveyor.  Grenier is co-founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073320/http://churchkeycanco.com/">Churchkey Can Co.</a>, which Men&apos;s Journal calls... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073320/http://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/drinks/the-instagram-of-beers-20120523">the Instagram of beers</a>.  So, it&apos;s fuzzy, precious and targeted to hipsters?</p>

<p>The beer is only available in Seattle and Portland right now, but it&apos;s reportedly coming to other markets later this summer.  And the venture has apparently attracted investors from the tech world.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073320/http://www.businessinsider.com/photos-from-adrian-greniers-launch-party-for-his-hipster-beer-company-2012-5?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Falleyinsider%2Fsilico">Grenier told Business Insider earlier this week</a>, &quot;There was a wide net of people from all different nooks and crannies of Silicon Valley who jumped on... We got a really great response. Tech investors tend to be a little younger and more willing to take risks. It&apos;s great and exciting for young guys in tech to get into something with old technology.&quot;</p>

<p>A six-pack of the Pilsner (Men&apos;s Journal describes it as a &quot;light, malty pilsner ever-so-slightly bittered by Saaz hops,&quot; goes for $9.99&#x2014;and comes with a churchkey opener.</p>
