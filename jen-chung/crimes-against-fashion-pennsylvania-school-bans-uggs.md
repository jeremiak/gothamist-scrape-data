<p>Middle school students were apparently breaking the school policy by taking their phones into class, via their fur-lined shoes.  Phones are allowed in the school: &quot;students may bring cell phones to school but they &apos;must be turned off &apos; and &apos;kept in the student&#x2019;s locker between 7:55 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.&apos;&quot;  In Cooper&apos;s letter, she said, &quot;Students may continue to wear outdoor boots to and from school to protect them from cold, snow and ice but need to change into a pair of sneakers or shoes before entering homeroom. Students may also continue to wear lace up, tight at the ankle, boots, shoes and high top sneakers.&quot; In other words, you ain&apos;t bringing your cellphone into class.</p>

<p>Parents reacted to the ban by venting on the Mercury&apos;s website: &#x201C;When the schools started paying to raise and clothe my children then maybe... maybe they can have a say in dictating my child&#x2019;s wardrobe. Totally ridiculous,&quot; and &quot;Just take them (cell phones) when they have them in class, give them a detention and be done with it. Making up 100 silly rules to deal with something that is inevitable is like swimming upstream.&quot; Yeah, it&apos;s not like NY Philharmonic conductor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050555/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/11/iphone_brings_new_york_philharmonic.php">Alan Gilbert can be there to shame those kids</a>.</p>

<p>NYC students&#x2014;and their parents&#x2014;took exception with the Department of Education&apos;s cellphone ban. However, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050555/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/23/court_upholds_b.php">court found the ban constitutional</a>, &quot;If adults cannot be fully trusted to practice proper cell phone etiquette, then neither can children.&quot;</p>
