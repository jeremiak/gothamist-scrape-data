										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2012_04_borohallbody1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131010im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_borohallbody1.jpg" width="300" height="318"> <br> <i>Photo from avid reader Alanna</i></div> Earlier this morning, subway riders at Borough Hall&apos;s northbound 4 platform in Brooklyn were startled by the presence of a dead body.  One person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131010/https://twitter.com/#!/LaurenYoung/status/195146566024167424">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Be nice to us: @bethpinsker and I both saw a dead body on the Borough Hall 4/5 platform this morning,&quot; while another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131010/https://twitter.com/#!/cinemist/status/195130286034534401">weighed in</a>, &quot;Walking past a dead body at Borough Hall station was the absolute last way I wanted to start my day.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>According to the MTA, they were notified about an &quot;outstretched&quot; male body on the platform around 7:10 a.m.  (It did not appear the person was hit by a train.) When EMS arrived, they pronounced the man dead at 7:22 a.m. and took him to Kings County morgue.  But not before an apparent investigation.</p>

<p>One subway rider said detectives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131010/https://twitter.com/#!/MrWallSt/status/195139628636971008">were on the scene</a> and the body was still seen by customers at 9 a.m. When we inquired about the body, NYPD&apos;s DCPI had no information about the death.</p>
