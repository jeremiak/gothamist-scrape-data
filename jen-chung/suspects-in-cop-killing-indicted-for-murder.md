<p>Yesterday, five men were indicted for the killing of police officer Peter Figoski, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223000435/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/12/nypd_officer_fatally_shot_in_face_d.php">was shot in the face</a> while responding to a Brooklyn home invasion on Monday. Lamont Pride, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223000435/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/nypd_arrested_alleged_cop_killer_tw.php">alleged shooter</a>, was charged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223000435/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYPD-Police-Officer-Shot-Getaway-Driver-Murder-Robbery-135724123.html">with first-degree murder</a>, while Michael Velez, Nelson Morales, Kevin Santos, and Ariel Tejada were charged with second-degree murder. </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed Morales <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223000435/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/14/cops_cheer_as_alleged_cop_killer_an.php">was the ringleader</a> and that the five men conspired to rob a man who lived in a Cypress Hills basement apartment on Pine Street. The Post, which says the robbery target was a &quot;known pot dealer,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223000435/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/all_suspects_indicted_in_officer_ipX0qdjMDdOAlmYIFfnkSO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">reports that Pride and Santos allegedly pistol-whipped the man</a>:</p><blockquote>The crew then grabbed more than $700 cash and a cheap wristwatch before starting to flee. The landlord called 911 and two cops arrived at around 2:15 a.m., followed closely by Figoski and his partner Glenn Estrada, 42.<p></p>

<p>As Pride and Santos hid in a storage room in the basement, the first two officers found the bloodied tenant along with Tejada and Morales &#x2014; who posed as neighbors who had raced over to help.</p>

<p>But cops got suspicious because the two men began describing &#x2014; a little too well &#x2014; the weapons used in the heist.</p>

<p>As the cops were talking to the trio, Pride and Santos slipped out of their hiding space and ran into Estrada and Figoski, police said.</p>

<p>While Estrada struggled with Santos, Pride shot Figoski in the face with the 9mm and ran off, police said.</p></blockquote>Velez, the alleged getaway driver, left the scene when police cars boxed his vehicle in: &quot;Cops were able to find Velez &#x2014; who was busted at his cousin&#x2019;s home &#x2014; after finding a surveillance video that showed him getting into the livery cab, which had a triangular sticker on it, sources said.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Patrolmen&#x2019;s Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch said, &quot;Today as we sit in this courtroom and we witness evil get indicted, the family of our hero police officer is now at a funeral parlor viewing the body... Whether you were holding that gun or you were helping the person that did, they decided they wanted to get away and they would kill a New York City police officer to do it.&quot;</p>
