<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093811/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/thompson_expected_to_concede_mayora.php">rumors swirled this morning</a>, Bill Thompson has officially dropped out of the mayoral race. The former comptroller appeared on the steps of City Hall with presumptive Democratic primary winner Bill de Blasio as well as Governor Andrew Cuomo. Thompson told the press, &quot;I&apos;m proud to stand next to a great New Yorker and throw my support behind him.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Thompson, who had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093811/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/bill_thompson_grows_a_pair_stays_in.php">insisting that every vote</a> from last Tuesday&apos;s primary<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093811/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/de_blasio_has_402_of_the_vote_but_t.php"> be counted</a>, did say it was a &quot;disgrace&quot; that the Board of Elections <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093811/https://twitter.com/NYDNHammond/status/379624204921876481">hadn&apos;t counted all the votes yet</a>, &quot;This electoral process has to be improved. We can&apos;t have what happened to me... happen to any other candidate.&quot; Then Thompson stressed that he and de Blasio have the same, progressive values and want to improve schools and save hospitals and make New York a &quot;city of opportunity once again.&quot; He asked his supporters to throw their allegiance behind de Blasio.</p>

<p>De Blasio said, &quot;There is nothing more beautiful than Democratic unity&quot; and expressed his deep, sincere respect for Thompson and thanked him, &quot;I&apos;m profoundly honored and profoundly humbled to receive the support of Bill Thompson and his coalition.&quot; He also praised Thompson&apos;s character, &quot;There&apos;s no man of greater integrity.&quot;</p>

<p>De Blasio had a special thank you to UFT president Michael Mulgrew, who was a staunch Thompson supporter. He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093811/https://twitter.com/NYDNHammond/status/379625673326735360">praised Cuomo</a>, &quot;What he has done for this state is nothing short of miraculous.&quot;</p>

<p>Cuomo went to the lectern and offered his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093811/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/stringer_steamrolls_spitzers_comeba.php">congratulations to Scott Stringer</a>, the Democratic candidate for Comptroller, pointedly remarking how Stringer won in spite of being outspent 2-1 by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093811/http://gothamist.com/tags/eliotspitzer">former governor whose name</a> shall not be uttered. Then Cuomo said Thompson&apos;s concession was graceful, calling it difficult to &quot;step back&quot; in order to step forward and said it was his &quot;honor&quot; to support de Blasio in the mayoral race. </p>

<p>The governor rallied the crowd, touting &quot;the great, progressive Democratic traditions that made this the greatest city&quot; and ending with &quot;Let&apos;s go team!&quot;</p>
