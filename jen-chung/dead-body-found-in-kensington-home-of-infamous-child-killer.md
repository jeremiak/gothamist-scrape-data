<p>Police officers discovered a man&apos;s body in a Brooklyn house on Friday afternoon, and reports say the dead man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://abc7ny.com/news/sources-brother-of-leiby-kletzkys-killer-found-dead-in-brooklyn-home/2063373/">may be the brother</a> of Levi Aron, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/29/levi_aron_gets_40_yrs-to-life_in_pr.php">kidnapped and dismembered an eight-year-old boy</a> in 2011.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/06/02/brooklyn-body-found/">Multiple</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brother-levi-aron-found-dead-closet-brooklyn-home-article-1.3216476">sources</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://nypost.com/2017/06/02/brother-of-man-who-dismembered-child-found-dead-in-closet/">say</a> that the body of Tzvi Aron was found in a basement closet of 466 East 2nd Street in Kensington. The Daily News reports that he was &quot;duct-taped, wrapped in a blanket and stuffed&quot; in the closet. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://nypost.com/2017/06/02/brother-of-man-who-dismembered-child-found-dead-in-closet/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Last month, Tzvi, who lived in the basement, had been threatened, police sources said... Tzvi had last been seen on Tuesday, sources said.&quot; </p>

<p>His body was apparently discovered by another brother around 2:45 p.m.; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brother-levi-aron-found-dead-closet-brooklyn-home-article-1.3216476">a neighbor told the News</a>, &quot;He ran out of the house screaming, &#x2018;my brother, my brother.&apos; It was spooky.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Aron family has also reportedly been subject to numerous threats since Levi Aron was linked to the death of Leiby Kletzy, which stunned Brooklyn&apos;s Orthodox Jewish community. The boy disappeared from Borough Park on July 11, 2011 and his dismembered remains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/13/missing_brooklyn_boy_found_dead_dis.php">were found days later</a>&#x2014;half in a dumpster in Greenwood Heights and half in a refrigerator inside 466 East 2nd Street. Prosecutors said that the growing search effort to find Leiby caused Levi Aron <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/nyregion/levi-aron-is-sentenced-to-40-years-in-killing-of-leiby-kletzky-8.html">to panic, kill</a> and finally dismember the child. Aron was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/29/levi_aron_gets_40_yrs-to-life_in_pr.php">convicted of kidnapping and murder</a> and is currently serving a 40-year prison sentence.</p>

<p>Police are continuing to investigate death of the man found on Friday. Another Kensington resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603164729/http://pix11.com/2017/06/02/brother-of-levi-aron-found-dead-in-brooklyn-home/">said to PIX 11 on Friday</a>, &quot;God had his ways. Whatever he does, we accept. We&#x2019;re Jews. It&#x2019;s a very wonderful, great Jewish family.&quot;</p>
