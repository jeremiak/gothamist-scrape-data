Lt. Santo Bevinetto ended up calling wildlife rehabilitator Bobby Horvath, who told him to &quot;come from behind and put a blanket over him and have a box ready.&#x201D; The News reports, &quot;The young hawk flew about 100 feet in the air before he crashed to the ground.&quot; </p>

<p>Horvath, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144137/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-firefighter-continue-saving-wildlife-long-island-home-wildlife-rehabilitator-article-1.1319551">who is also a firefighter</a>, said, &quot;He doesn&#x2019;t appear injured but he&#x2019;s too weak to hunt. We&#x2019;re giving him pain medication and will bring him to the veterinarian.&quot; Plus the hawk will get a diet of &quot;diced rodents&quot; to get stronger.</p>
