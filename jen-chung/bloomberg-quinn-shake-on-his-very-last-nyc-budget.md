<p>Last night, Mayor Bloomberg and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced they had agreed on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055214/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2013a%2Fpr218-13.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">$70 budget for the 2013-2014 fiscal year</a>. Notably, it includes &quot;an additional $58 million to the New York City Housing Authority, filling some of the gap caused by Federal sequester cuts.&quot;</p>

<p>The additional money for NYCHA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055214/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/184343/mayor--council-speaker-announce-budget-agreement">means 325 layoffs will be avoided</a> and 60 senior centers and community facilities will remain open. NY1 reports that some officials &quot;were still concerned about the cuts to the housing authority, but they said they would be working to make sure there would be long-term financial stability at the housing authority.&quot;</p>

<p>Overall, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055214/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/nyregion/city-budget-with-few-changes-from-last-year-is-quietly-approved.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;_r=0">budget is much like last year&apos;s</a>&#x2014;the NY Times notes, &quot;Spending will remain flat. Taxes are not going up. Firehouses are not going to be closed. Library services will not be reduced. Thousands of city-financed child-care or after-school slots will not be eliminated.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055214/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bloomberg-nyc-council-agree-70b-budget-article-1.1380677?localLinksEnabled=false">Bloomberg said</a>, &quot;It is never easy. The city has limited resources and seemingly unlimited demands on its services, and yet we have to come up with something that is fiscally responsible and balanced.&quot;</p>

<p>And Quinn, who pointed out that all pools would be also be open, praised the smooth path to getting things done, &quot;This budget process should serve as an example to our colleagues in government throughout the country, that if you focus on delivering and check the grandstanding at the door, you can accomplish a great deal - and that&#x2019;s what this is all about.&quot; </p>

<p>Translation: Kumbaya and vote for me! To which City Comptroller John Liu, who is one of Quinn&apos;s mayoral run rivals, said, &quot;On his way out the door, Mayor Bloomberg shows us with this budget agreement that he has left the biggest question&#x2014;expired labor contracts&#x2014;for another Mayor and another day. Explain to us again why he needed a third term? To pile up the mess? True, he restored most of his threatened cuts, and perhaps the people of the City of New York should be grateful for those crumbs. But the plain fact of the matter is, the Mayor stayed too long at the party, and history won&apos;t forgive him.&quot;</p>
