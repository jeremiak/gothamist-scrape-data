In it, he apologized for his past statements criticizing Israel&apos;s treatment of Palestinians (a few years ago, he wrote a book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305184628/http://www.amazon.com/Palestine-Peace-Apartheid-Jimmy-Carter/dp/0743285026">Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid</a>). Here&apos;s the letter:<br>
</p><blockquote>An open letter to the Jewish community at the season of Chanukah from former President Jimmy Carter:<p></p>

<p>The time of Chanukah and the Christian holidays presents an occasion for reflection on the past and for looking to the future. In that vein, I wish to share some thoughts with you about the State of Israel and the Middle East.</p>

<p>I have the hope and a prayer that the State of Israel will flourish as a Jewish state within secure and recognized borders in peaceful co-existence with its neighbors and with all the Moslem States, and that this peaceful co-existence will bring security, prosperity and happiness to the people of Israel and to the people of the Middle East of all faiths.</p>

<p>I have the hope and a prayer that the bloodshed and hatred will change to mutual respect and cooperation, fulfilling the prophetic aspiration that the lion shall lie down with the lamb in harmony and peace. I likewise hope that violent attacks against all civilians will end, which will help set a better framework for commencing negotiations. I further hope that peace negotiations can soon commence, with all issues on the negotiating table.</p>

<p>I have the hope and a prayer that just as Chanukah is the Festival of Lights, the State of Israel will fulfill its destiny as a light unto the nations.</p>

<p>We must recognize Israel&#x2019;s achievements under difficult circumstances, even as we strive in a positive way to help Israel continue to improve its relations with its Arab populations, but we must not permit criticisms for improvement to stigmatize Israel. As I would have noted at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but which is appropriate at any time of the year, I offer an Al Het for any words or deeds of mine that may have done so.</p>

<p>May we work and pray for that better day.</p>

<p>Hag Semach and Happy Chanukah.</p></blockquote><br>

In modern Hebrew it refers to any plea for forgiveness.&quot; Carter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305184628/http://jta.org/news/article/2009/12/22/1009863/carter-grandsons-race-not-reason-enough-to-apologize">also denies</a> that his grandson Jason&apos;s possible Senate run in Georgia prompted him to offer the Al Het.<p></p>

<p>The Anti-Defamation League&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305184628/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/12/24/2009-12-24_former_president_jimmy_carter_apologizes_in_open_letter_to_jewish_community_as_.html">Abraham Foxman said</a>, &quot;When a former president reaches out to the Jewish community and asks for forgiveness, it&apos;s incumbent of us to accept it. To what extent this is an epiphany, only time will tell. There certainly was a lot of hurt, a lot of angry words that need to be repaired. But this is a good start.&quot;</p>
