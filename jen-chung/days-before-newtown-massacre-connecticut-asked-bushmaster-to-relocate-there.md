<p>While Connecticut lawmakers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005948/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/29/gun_advocates_heckle_father_of_6-ye.php">are still</a> trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005948/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/nyregion/2-conflicting-agendas-arise-from-gun-safety-task-force-in-connecticut.html">pass gun legislation</a>, it turns out that officials in the Nutmeg State were previously trying to woo the company that makes Bushmaster AR-15 automatic rifles to relocate there. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005948/http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-bushmaster-decd-0230-20130319,0,7047902.story">Hartford Courant reports</a>, &quot;On Dec. 6, a top state economic development official sent the Freedom Group an offer for a $1 million loan at the low annual interest rate of 2 percent for 10 years &#x2014; plus other incentives for the company to move its headquarters, with 25 top executives, from Madison, N.C., to Stamford.&quot;</p>

<p>Eight days later, Adam Lanza calmly walked into the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005948/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/breaking_multiple_people_injured_in.php">shot 20 children and six teachers and school administrators</a>. Lanza killed himself at the scene and police later found his mother&apos;s body in her home.  The Courant reports, &quot;The department withdrew the offer on Dec. 18, four days after the Newtown massacre, according to records released in response to a Courant freedom of information request. The deal was yanked because of a combination of factors, one of them the announcement by the Freedom Group&apos;s owner &#x2014; the private equity and hedge fund group Cerberus Capital Management &#x2014; that it was putting the firearms maker up for sale.&quot;</p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner Ronald F. Angelo Jr., from Connecticut&apos;s Department of Economic and Community Development, told the Courant, &quot;It was a significant tragedy that was fresh on everybody&apos;s mind. If you take that into account, along with the very unknown structure and unknown condition of the Freedom Group because of the [announced] sale of that entity by its parent, it&apos;s too much of an unknown, too much of an unpredictable&apos; situation.</p>

Daily News columnist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005948/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/lupica-pols-spit-graves-newtown-vics-article-1.1293386">Mike Lupica says</a> this &quot;moment of Newtown&quot; is now lost: &quot;It was officially lost in Washington on Tuesday, lost to fear and lost to ignorance and lost to the NRA. One last time: If not a ban on assault weapons now, then when? Shame on them all.&quot;</p>
