<p>In January 2012, police officer Kevin Brennan was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233903/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/officer_shot_at_bushwick_houses_hun.php">shot in the head</a> while responding to an incident the Bushwick Houses. Yesterday afternoon, Brennan returned to go over his shooting with prosecutors. But then his partner, police officer Michael Burbridge, recognized two males who were wanted for a home invasion robbery.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_05_copsgooda.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233903im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_copsgooda.jpg" width="285" height="216"> <br> <i style=" width:285px; ;display:block"> Sergeant Brennan (left) and Police Officer Burbridge </i></div> According to the NYPD, Burbridge and Brennan stopped and arrested them, and Brennan found a loaded Hi-Point 9mm handgun on Joseph Roman. Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233903/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/spot_shot_survived_bullet_near_the_ZAtjYVMpJCJm3WimG7cGNJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Brooklyn">how the Post describes it</a>:<blockquote>The cops jumped out of the car, surprising Joseph Roman, 17, and Tyrell Woods, 23, both members of the Latin Kings street gang, and associates of Ortiz, law-enforcement sources said.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;When they came around, they jumped out like they were startled. They got grabbed before they could even run,&#x201D; said a law-enforcement source.</p>

<p>Brennan found a loaded 9-millimeter handgun in Roman&#x2019;s waistband, sources said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;They went to search them before putting them in the car and all of a sudden Kevin is yelling, &#x201C;Hot lunch, hot lunch&#x201D; &#x2014; which means he had a gun,&#x201D; said another law-enforcement source.</p></blockquote>Roman, 17, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon second degree, as well as criminal use of a firearm for the robbery. Tyrell Woods, 23, was also charged with criminal use of a firearm for the robbery.<p></p>

<p>Brennan, now a sergeant in the NYPD&apos;s intelligence division, was allegedly shot by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233903/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/ray_kelly_holds_bullet_that_struck.php">Latin Kings gang member Luis &quot;Baby&quot; Ortiz</a>. He said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233903/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/officer-shot-in-head-in-2012-makes-an-arrest-near-the-same-spot/?ref=nyregion">that yesterday&apos;s arrest</a> &quot;happened so fast, I wasn&#x2019;t thinking of anything. When Mike said they were wanted, we went to grab them and it was like old times again, when me and Mike used to work before I was hurt.&quot;</p>
