<p>A 25-year-old Hasidic man was stabbed without warning while walking on a Brooklyn street yesterday just before noon. NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420064510/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/10/man-stabbed-in-crown-heights/"> said</a>, &quot;He was dressed in Hasidic garb. Right now we&#x2019;re looking at it as a possible hate crime because he&#x2019;s dressed in that fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>According to police, the victim, Yehuda Brikman, was in front of 646 Empire Boulevard in Crown Heights when he was &quot;stabbed on the left side of his back by an unknown person. When the victim turned around, he saw a male running on the street away from him.&quot;</p>

<p>Brikman, who is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420064510/http://jpupdates.com/2016/02/10/jewish-man-stabbed-in-crown-heights/">son of a prominent rabbi</a>, was taken to Kings County Hospital where he is in stable condition after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420064510/http://jpupdates.com/2016/02/10/jewish-man-stabbed-in-crown-heights/">&quot;sustain[ing] a collapsed lung.&quot;</a></p>

<p>During a press conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was &quot;very concerned about&quot; the stabbing, and a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420064510/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/nyregion/police-see-possible-hate-crime-in-stabbing-of-jewish-man-in-brooklyn.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">tells the NY Times</a> that the NYPD is still investigating the stabbing of a Jewish emergency medical service volunteer in Crown Heights last fall, and investigators are exploring whether the cases are related.</p>

<p>In that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420064510/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/crown_heights_stabbing_ems.php">November 3 incident</a>, the off-duty Hatzolah worker was stabbed by a fleeing suspect and suffered a two-inch laceration in the shoulder. </p>

<p>The authorities released surveillance video of the suspect in yesterday&apos;s attack, describing him as between 20 and 30 years old, 5&apos;10&quot; and 180 pounds, and wearing a black bookbag, last seen wearing a dark colored jacket, blue hooded sweater, dark colored pants and black boots.</p>

The Anti-Defamation League, which is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the attacker, said, &quot;Brooklyn&#x2019;s Jewish community is once again suffering from apparent targeted acts of hate with this latest stabbing in Crown Heights. This alleged hate crime is just one in a series of traumatic attacks over the past several months in which Jews across the city, especially in Brooklyn, have been singled out for violence. While we have not documented a rise in the overall numbers of anti-Semitic incidents in New York City, we are seeing a troubling pattern in which members of the Jewish community in Brooklyn are experiencing the worst kind of anti-Semitism.&quot;</p>
