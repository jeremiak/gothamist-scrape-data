<p>Michael Douglas, for better or for worse, is best known as Gordon Gekko, the ruthless insider trader in  <em>Wall Street</em>, whose lifestyle and power tempt an innocent named Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen).  Gekko is, as Patton Oswalt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228090512/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/02/03/patton-oswalt-bs-report/">pointed out, one of those characters who backfired</a>, &quot;Oliver Stone wrote Gordon Gekko to be the most ultimately evil guy, and then to his horror, everyone started going like, <em>I&#x2019;m gonna get my suspenders!</em>&quot; Now, Douglas is trying to right wrongs by doing a PSA about insider trading for the FBI:</p>

<p>Douglas says, &quot;In the movie Wall Street I played Gordon Gekko, a greedy corporate executive who cheated to profit while innocent investors lost their savings. The movie was fiction, but the problem is real. Our economy is increasingly dependent on the success and integrity of the financial markets. If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is.&quot;  </p>

<p>The FBI also released video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228090512/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/fbi_arrests_two_in_disney_insider_SZWgjSrL1nRqqOnMrcECeO">its 2010 Walt Disney Co. investigation</a>, &quot;when a secretary and her boyfriend attempted to sell quarterly earnings reports to two undercover FBI agents in New York.&quot;</p>
