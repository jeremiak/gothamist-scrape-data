										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_11_firealarm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234207im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_firealarm.jpg" width="322" height="209" class="image-right"> </span>During last night&apos;s broadcast of the NBC Nightly News, a fire alarm kept interrupting the program.  Anchor Brian Williams deftly continued  introducing stories and reassuring viewers that it was simply a test and that no one at 30 Rock was in harm&apos;s way.  Mediaite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234207/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fire-alarm-interrupts-nbc-nightly-news-brian-williams-handles-like-a-pro/">crows that Williams handled it like a &quot;pro,&quot;</a> though we&apos;re pretty sure being a network news anchor means you&apos;re a pro.   Anyway, take a look for confirmation that Williams is as good as deflecting attention from a persistent fire alarm as he as at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234207/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/brian_williams_humorously_skewers_t.php">skewering NY Times trend stories on Brooklyn</a>:</p>

<p>NBC spokeswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234207/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2068016/NBC-TV-presenter-Brian-Williams-calmly-delivers-news-FIRE-ALARM-live-air.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">Erika Marshonall Tweeted</a>, &quot;This is the first fire alarm in our new NBC Nightly News studio. System should have been shut off - but clearly still working out the kinks.&quot;  The alarm last for much of the program.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it looks like NBC retaped the segment for its online version (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234207/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/#45484299">see here</a>).</p>
