<p>Police are searching for a callous hit and run driver who stole a minivan and ended up hitting a family in Brooklyn. A 12-year-old girl was killed while her mother and 9-year-old sister were hospitalized. A witness said the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723180745/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/stolen-minivan-hits-child-pedestrians-killing-article-1.1852695">driver was &quot;going 120 mph.&quot;</a></p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the family was waiting at a bus stop Flatlands Avenue and East 46th Street at 4:42 p.m. when a Dodge Caravan was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723180745/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/03/police-identify-suspect-wanted-in-fatal-brooklyn-hit-and-run/">careening out of control past Schenectady Avenue</a>. The minivan jumped the curb and knocked down the family. The driver fled the scene; a witness told WCBS 2, &quot;I saw the dude get out of the car, started walking then he took off at a fast pace and started running.&quot;</p>

<p>Others at the scene tried to help the family. Shamar Brooks told the TV station, &quot;There was [someone] actually under it and we lifted it up,&quot; while another said to WABC 7, &quot;Me and a couple of other guys pushed the car up onto the hydrant.&quot; Joey Sellers, 12, was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital while her 38-year-old mother, Marsha Landias, and little sister remain there in critical condition. Landias, who is a nurse at the hospital, was reportedly in surgery yesterday.</p>

An eyewitness said, &quot;He went through somebody&apos;s yard jumped the fence,&quot; he said. &quot;Jumped after him, then he jumped a second fence, I jumped after him again. People are heartless. How can you hit three kids and run? That&apos;s heartless.&quot;<p></p>
