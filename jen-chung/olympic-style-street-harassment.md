I asked a &apos;ranger&apos; in a pimped out smart cart to intervene, and he replied, <strong>&apos;Well, what did you get? You know you&apos;re a 10 in my book.&apos;</strong>&quot; Can someone else confirm--or even take a photograph of this judging in action?  (We&apos;ve only witnessed this with crusty old men at Coney Island.)  You can send us info/photos at tips(at)gothamist(dot)com. </p>
