	<p>Yesterday&apos;s rainstorms were a little more intense for our neighbors: Tornadoes were confirmed in New Jersey and Connecticut. And in Connecticut, an 18-wheeler was knocked down!</p>

<p>The National Weather Service says an EF-0 tornado touched down in Berkeley Heights, NJ for 10 minutes at 9:17 a.m., about 50 yards wide and 4.8 miles long. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130706003021/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/02/residents-cleaning-up-after-tornado-strong-storms-slam-region/">One resident described it as</a> &quot;Almost like a locomotive. Like a train coming through. It was pretty scary. You can only imagine if it was worse, what kind of damage it would do. We&#x2019;re not used to that type of weather in this area and hopefully we won&#x2019;t have it again.&quot; </p>

<p>Another told WCBS 2, &quot;It looked like a war zone. There were a number of trees that were  down, others were broken in half like toothpicks.&quot; Thousands of homes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130706003021/http://pix11.com/2013/07/01/tornado-touches-down-in-new-jersey-national-weather-service/#axzz2Xt9K6z7w">were left without power</a>.</p>

<p>Over in Connecticut, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130706003021/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-tornado-warning-0702-20130701,0,5651001.story">NWS said an EF-1 tornado touched</a> in Windsor, traveling 2.25 miles with a width of 200 yards. The Courant reports the tornado succeeded in &quot;toppling trees, taking down power lines, tearing apart an inflatable sports dome and ripping tobacco netting from fields and draping it across houses and I-91. Only one minor injury was reported &#x2014; the driver of a truck that was knocked over by the storm in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart store in East Windsor. A second truck was tossed onto its side on I-91.&quot;</p>
