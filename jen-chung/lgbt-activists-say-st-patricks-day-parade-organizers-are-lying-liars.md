<p>Organizers of the St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013825/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/03/st_patricks_day_parade_gays.php#photo-1">announced last week that one and only one gay group would be allowed to march</a> in next year&apos;s parade, prompting activists to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013825/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/03/irish_queers_st_patricks.php">question why only a single group</a> was selected. Now, those activists are applying for the 2015 parade&#x2014;not that they think they&apos;ll be allowed to march.</p>

<p>The lone LGBT group marching next year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013825/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/03/st_patricks_day_parade_gays.php#photo-1">is OUT@NBCUniversal</a>, which represents the network&apos;s LGBT employees. The group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013825/http://irishqueers.blogspot.com/">Irish Queers</a> argued last week:</p><blockquote>This is a deal that was made behind closed doors between parade organizers and one of their last remaining sponsors, NBC. It allows NBC&apos;s gay employees to march, but embarrassingly has not ended the exclusion of Irish LGBT groups. The parade organizers have said, astoundingly, that we &quot;can apply&quot; in years to come...<p></p>

<p>We welcome this small victory, but our call remains the same -- the parade must be open to Irish LGBT groups, not &quot;in subsequent years&quot; but now. (We remember too well how parade organizers used fake waiting lists to bury our applications before.)</p></blockquote>The group says that the parade wants sponsors like Guinness back; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013825/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/09/activists-nbc-group-should-skip-st-patricks-parade-if-other-lgbt-groups-not-okd-to-march/">Gabby Cryan of Irish Queers said</a>, &quot;This is not a policy change. This is a token gesture. This is not actually including the Irish lesbian and gay, queer community in New York City.&quot;<p></p>

<p>And John Francis Mulligan of Irish Queers emphasized, &quot;They say we are able to apply to march in 2016, and we remember this. This is the same playbook that they used in 1993, when they said &#x2018;apply to march,&#x2019; and then there&#x2019;s a waiting list. It went to the courts and there was no waiting list, and those lies were brought to the forefront then. And they&#x2019;re doing the same thing again.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, they mailed their application. But they&apos;re also going to ask Mayor Bill de Blasio not to march in next year&apos;s parade. Last week, de Blasio said, &quot;This is a city of inclusion. That&apos;s the values of this administration. It&apos;s the values of the people of this city. We need a truly inclusive parade. Whatever the details, this indicates progress. This is a step forward. But I need to know more before I can tell you how we&apos;re going to handle something six months from now.&quot;</p>
