<p>James Taylor said, &quot;The One Fund event at the Garden this May 30th is destined to be a true Boston landmark. From the promoters to the sound &amp; lights, to the performers and the Garden staff; everyone involved has responded from the heart in a spontaneous and simultaneous desire to be there, and to do what we can for the city we love. I am honored to be a part of it, and&#x2026;I can&apos;t wait.&quot; Taylor sang at the memorial for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707130242/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/one_boston_bomb_suspect_is_dead_as.php#photo-1">slain MIT security officer Sean Collier</a>:</p>
