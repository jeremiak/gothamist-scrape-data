But what happens when the Commander in Chief and the super popular teen singer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163220/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111123/midtown/justin-bieber-president-obama-visits-threaten-traffic-chaos">come to the Big Apple on the same day</a> during the holiday season?  It is making drivers freak out.</p>

<p>On November 30, Obama will be in town to raise some money while Bieber <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163220/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/11/the_tree.php">will be at the Rockefeller Christmas Tree lighting</a>.  DNAinfo reports that Gridlock Sam Schwartz has &quot;issue[d] what he&#x2019;s billed as the &apos;Biggest Gridlock Alert Day of Decade,&apos; warning residents to brace for the post-Thanksgiving twin-punches of the superstar visits. &apos;With masses of people in Midtown for the tree lighting and to see Justin Bieber, the President could&#x2019;ve picked a better day to visit.&apos;&quot; Yeah, can&apos;t the White House and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163220/http://twitter.com/#!/SCOOTERBRAUN">Scooter Braun</a> get their acts together and coordinate stuff?</p>

<p>Closures will include &quot;Fifth and Sixth Avenues from West 48th to West 51st streets, the FDR Drive below 63rd Street. Other avenues east of Seventh will also be affected.&quot;  Obama and Bieber were in NYC on the same day in June, but that&apos;s not the same at Christmas tree lighting night/ holiday season.  It&apos;s unclear if Obama and Bieber plan on meeting up to discuss <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163220/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/26/thanks_obama_justin_bieber_meets_wi.php">making another fan&apos;s day</a>.</p>
