</div></div>					<p>Grand Central Terminal is getting ready for its big Centennial next year, and it hopes to add two more restaurants in 2013.  Today, it&apos;s been announced that the MTA will ask restaurateurs to RFP for two <em>new</em> spaces in the glorious landmark building.</p>

<p>According to a press release, &quot;The MTA is making available the west side of Vanderbilt Hall (the former main waiting room) for an eatery whose operations include a casual sit-down restaurant and adjacent takeout area.  Also, an undeveloped space above the Terminal&#x2019;s popular Grand Central Market will be available later this year for development as a sit-down restaurant and bar. This is the first time these two large new spaces have become available for lease.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Vanderbilt Hall space has about 12,300 square feet. The second floor space above Grand Central Market is currently being used by the the Grand Central police&#x2014;that has about 4,700 square feet. The MTA&#x2019;s Director of Grand Central Terminal Development, Nancy Marshall, said, Vanderbilt Hall is visually stunning, and a restaurant above the vibrant Grand Central Market promises to have tremendous cachet.&quot;</p>

<p> About 750,000 people come into the Grand Central Terminal daily.  With the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/more_photos_of_the_grand_central_ap.php#photo-1">new Apple Store</a> and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162749/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/shake_shack_surprise_burger_mecca_m.php">in-the-works Shake Shack</a>, the MTA seems to be trying to make sure their digital and culinary needs are met.  MTA Chairman Joseph J. Lhota said, &quot;Grand Central will always be the greatest train station in the United States and the crown jewel of the MTA&#x2019;s transportation network. It&#x2019;s a focal point for the economic and social life of the region and a superb setting for the daily business of moving people. At the same time, over the past 15 years, it&#x2019;s also been transformed into one of the world&#x2019;s most well-known destinations for shopping and dining. These latest additions will only heighten its reputation.&quot;</p>
