<p>A reader sent us a photograph of a very relaxed subway rider vaping from 125th Street to 59th Street on a southbound 5 train last week. But while this image may be so blisteringly douchey that you need sunglasses just to look at it, did you know that e-cigarettes are not yet illegal on subways?!</p>

<p>While the MTA has (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114937/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/17/lirr_ecigs_ban.php">basically</a>) banned e-cigarettes from Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road trains, it hasn&apos;t decided on NYC Transit yet. Spokesman Kevin Ortiz told us, &quot;We&apos;re reviewing in light of new city law&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114937/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/29/now_albany_is_coming_for_your_e-cig.php">e-cigarettes are outlawed wherever smoking is</a>&#x2014;&quot;but we have not established a policy yet..&quot;</p>

<p>So... vape &apos;em while you got &apos;em, bro! Putting your feet on the subway seat, though&#x2014;WHAT KIND OF MONSTER ARE YOU?</p>
