Of course, while Big Gulps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163331/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/07/who_care_about_soda_when_we_can_all.php">are 50 ounces</a>, 7-Elevens may actually be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163331/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/13/snap_nanny_bloombergs_soda_ban_coul.php">exempt from the ban</a>! Still, Bloomberg isn&apos;t amused about the march and emphasized he just wants to save lives.<p></p>

<p>At a press conference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163331/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/bloomberg_announces_competition_to.php">about creating new housing today</a>, Bloomberg was asked about the demonstration and he replied, &quot;If you want to kill yourself, I guess you have a right to do it. We&apos;re trying to do something about that. We&apos;ve got to do something about this but they can have a march and they can make a joke out of it but there&apos;s a story in the post today where the hospitals are having to increase the size of their gurneys and strengthen them&#x2014; they can&apos;t even handle the patients some of the patients are so heavy.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163331/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/room_emergency_FhK46Hjs1jGiF8SOEeoLxN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">According to the Post</a>, &quot;So many grossly overweight patients are showing up at the city&#x2019;s municipal hospitals that administrators have been forced to buy heavy-duty equipment that can safely hold them &#x2014; from $5,500 wide-body motorized wheelchairs to a $650,000 X-ray machine for New York&#x2019;s XXXL-size customers.&quot;)</p>

<p>He added, &quot;This is going to be worse than smoking ever was. Smoking deaths in NYC are now down to 7,000 a year, obesity related diseased are 6,000 and skyrocketing while the smoking ones are coming down. In NYC alone we&apos;re going to spend $4 billion dollars of your money to treat obesity related diseases. If somebody wants to have a march, I suppose it&apos;s funny but it&apos;s so tragic that the humor escapes me.&quot;  But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163331/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/big_soda_wants_you_to_buy_enormous.php">Big Soda loves humor</a>!</p>
