<p>The Observer&apos;s political reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316054607/http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/rangel-learns-truth-about-judas-oh-my-god">Azi Paybarah writes</a>, &quot;If you&apos;re friend is called a &apos;Judas,&apos; it&apos;s probably not a good idea to keep using the metaphor,&quot; referring to Rep. Charles Rangel&apos;s remarks after a union leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316054607/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/02/si_rep_called_judas_for_voting_agai.php">likened Rep. Michael McMahon to &quot;Judas&quot;</a> for voting against health care reform.  Also not a good idea: Saying that Judas was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316054607/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/thepassion/articles/judas.shtml">forgiven when he wasn&apos;t</a>&#x2014;plus he went to hell (at least, that&apos;s what Dante says)!  Here&apos;s Paybarah&apos;s video of Rangel learning what happened to Judas:</p>
