<p>Roger Ailes has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084145/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/roger_ailes_officially_forced_out_o.php">only been forced out from Fox News</a>, the game-changing cable news network he founded in 1996, for a few days, but don&apos;t worry&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084145/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/trump_munch_scream.php#photo-1">future President of the United States of Trump</a> has his back&#x2014;and a job for him!</p>

<p>During Meet the Press, Donald Trump implied that the sexual harassment allegations against Ailes had to be made up. &quot;I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he&#x2019;s helped them,&quot; Trump said.</p>

<p>The GOP nominee was actually asked if Ailes, who famously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084145/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/01/the-donald-trump-roger-ailes-nexus">became Richard Nixon&apos;s media adviser</a> back in 1968, would work for his campaign. The Donald didn&apos;t comment, but coyly said &quot;a lot of people are thinking he&apos;s going to run my campaign&quot;:</p>

<p>This is a perfect move for a campaign that only just fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnns-hiring-of-corey-lewandowski-insults-the-press--and-women/2016/06/28/0cb2211c-3d4d-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html">for assaulting a female reporter</a> after Ivanka Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084145/http://nypost.com/2016/06/20/ivanka-forced-trump-campaign-to-fire-corey-lewandowski/">made her unhappiness known</a>. The depths of Ailes&apos; (allegedly!) awful behavior and the culture he (allegedly!) encouraged at Fox News was examined in a NY Times article, revealing that former Rudi Bakhtiar was essentially fired&#x2014;and silenced&#x2014;after refusing the (alleged!) come-ons of another colleague: </p><blockquote>Her break seemed to come in early 2007, she said, when she met for coffee in the lobby of her Washington hotel with a friend and colleague, Brian Wilson. He told her he would soon become Washington bureau chief and wanted to help her get the weekend job. Then he said, &#x201C;You know how I feel about you, Rudi.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Recalling the encounter in a recent phone interview, Ms. Bakhtiar said she was thrilled and told Mr. Wilson she would make him proud. But, she said, he repeated himself, asking, &#x201C;You know how I feel about you?&#x201D; When she asked him what he meant, he said, &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;d like to see the inside of your hotel room,&#x201D; adding that he wanted a friends-with-benefits relationship.</p>

<p>Bakhtiar politely rebuffed him, she said, apologizing for giving him any wrong impression. After that rejection, she felt caught in a whirlwind in which network executives canceled her Washington appearances, directed her to report her allegations to human resources and, a few weeks later, let her go, with Fox News chairman Roger Ailes telling her that her tenure was ending because of her performance.</p></blockquote>Wilson told the Times, &quot;I take strong exception to the facts of the story as you have relayed it to me, period. Beyond that, I will have no further comment.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084145/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/how-fox-news-fired-and-silenced-an-ailes-accuser.html">Bakhtiar offered NY Magazine&apos;s Gabriel Sherman more details</a>, including her interview with Ailes...and what happened after she was hired:</p><blockquote> Ailes himself made unwanted sexual comments during her first interview in 2005. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;Can you stand up for a second?&#x2019;&#x201D; Bakhtiar recalled. &#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Excuse me?&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;Just stand up. I want to see your legs.&#x2019; So I stood up and said, &#x2018;Is this part of the job requirement?&#x2019; He just laughed and said, &#x2018;No, no, no. Sit down.&#x2019;&#x201D;...<p></p>

<p>...When she returned from reporting in Tehran, where she covered the summit meeting between then-Iranian President Ahmadinejad and then Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Kamil al-Maliki, she began appearing on Fox &amp; Friends and serving as a general assignment correspondent. That&#x2019;s when the pressure from management to conform to Fox&#x2019;s hypersexualized aesthetic began. &#x201C;I would never wear skirts at work. One day they rolled in a bunch of skirts for me and said, &#x2018;These are a gift from Roger Ailes.&#x2019; They were all miniskirts,&#x201D; Bakhtiar recalled. &#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Are you forcing me to wear skirts?&#x2019; and they said, &#x2018;No, we&#x2019;re just suggesting. Roger really likes it. And you&#x2019;ve got nice legs. Why aren&#x2019;t you wearing skirts?&#x2019;&#x201D; After several weeks, Bakhtiar told Fox&#x2019;s programming head, Bill Shine, that she did not want to appear on Fox &amp; Friends anymore.</p></blockquote>Even though others at Fox News told her to speak up and file a complaint, Bakhtiar ended up taking a settlement from Fox News and signed a non-disparagement agreement. Fox News got in touch with her lawyer, and she told the Times, &quot;What are they going to do? Come after me for money? Garnish my wages? It&#x2019;ll make a bigger story out of it. I just feel like I shut up because I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt my career.&quot;<p></p>

<p>And in her interview with Sherman, Bakhtiar admitted, &quot;I was actually being part of the problem, because I didn&#x2019;t want to be the person in front taking the hit and losing my job... And in our business, unfortunately&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not like it didn&#x2019;t happen at CNN&#x2026; [But before Fox] nobody ever took the job away from me for it.&quot;</p>

<p>Fox News&apos; parent company 21st Century Fox is currently conducting an internal investigation about the allegations from Gretchen Carlson, which led to Ailes&apos; ousting:</p>
