<p>Last week, an off-duty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194451/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/peeping_cop_nypd_officer_arrested_f.php">police officer was arrested for unlawful surveillance</a>. At the time, it seemed like Miguel Gomez was allegedly spying on a 21-year-old neighbor in the Bronx. But now court papers say he was... spying on his own stepdaughter for &quot;sexual gratification.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194451/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/busted-spying-stepdaughter-sexual-pleasure-article-1.1292335?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports,</a> &quot;Officer Miguel Gomez, 41, secretly watched the 21-year-old getting dressed and having sex between May 28 and July 15 in the home she shared with the cop and her mom in the Bronx, according to court papers.&quot; </p>

<p>Gomez, who allegedly used a surveillance camera for the spying, was charged with three counts of unlawful surveillance and released on bail. He is not allowed to contact his stepdaughter. After the eight-year NYPD veteran&apos;s arrest, his mother told the News, &quot;My son is a very good boy and wouldn&#x2019;t do a thing like that,&quot; but it&apos;s unclear what she thinks now.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Gomez&apos;s lawyer Mark Panzavecchia says that there&apos;s only one video of the victim, which was apparently taken in the bathroom and there was no sexual activity. He told the Daily News, &quot;He denies it all. We&#x2019;re going to take a hard look at the evidence.&quot;</p>
