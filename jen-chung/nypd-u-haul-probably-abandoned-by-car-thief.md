NYPD spokesman Paul Browne <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153119/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/06/2010-05-06_simple_car_thief_behind_uhaul_truck_that_caused_bomb_scare_on_robert_f_kennedy_b.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+(NY+Local)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">said the vehicle was reported stolen</a> from a lot at East 138th Street.

Browne said, &quot;We think, preliminarily, that it&apos;s a conventional perp.&quot;</p>
