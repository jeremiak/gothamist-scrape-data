And at a meeting, LIRR President Helena Williams called one Queens LIRR station&apos;s elevator a &quot;vertical urinal.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511001145/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/elevator-woodside-queens-lirr-contstantly-breaking-account-urine-article-1.1286208">Daily News reports</a> that MTA officials said that the &quot;lift at the Woodside, Queens, LIRR and subway complex is constantly breaking down from damage caused by people peeing inside it.&quot; Williams explained, &quot;The mechanics of the elevator are constantly being contaminated.&quot; </p>

<p>There are five elevators at the Woodside LIRR and 7 subway station, but they are only functioning 58&amp; of the time. </p>

<p>And human pee isn&apos;t the only problem there! One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511001145/http://www.yelp.com/biz/lirr-woodside-station-jamaica">Yelper complained</a>, &quot;the last thing I want to have to worry about is dodging the birds who lurk in the rafters above most of the platform. they will strike when you least expect it. even though they say it&apos;s good luck (i don&apos;t know who &quot;They&quot; are, but they must have never been shit on..)- it&apos;s not pleasant at all! and in the summer the crap piles up and SMELLS. I don&apos;t really know what can be done to avoid this but its like a walking through a field of landmines some days.&quot;</p>
