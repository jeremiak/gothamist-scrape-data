<p>On Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/28/president-trumps-first-week-action">signed an order</a> to ban foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority nations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/316670-trump-refugee-ban-bars-green-card-holders-report">including those with green cards</a> for the U.S. However, with numerous people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/refugee_advocates_hold_rally_agains.php#photo-1">detained at airports</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/http://chicagoist.com/2017/01/28/photos_hundreds_shut_down_an_ohare.php#photo-1">dozens of protests</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/http://dcist.com/2017/01/photos_as_some_families_reunite_at.php#photo-1">across the country</a>, not to mention a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/right_now_hundreds_rallying_against.php">federal stay on the ban</a>, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/http://www.wsj.com/articles/green-card-holders-are-exempt-from-travel-restrictions-white-house-says-1485710137">said this morning</a>, &quot;As far as green card holders moving forward, [the ban] doesn&#x2019;t affect them.&quot;</p>

<p>While the Washington Post says it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-gives-no-sign-of-backing-down-from-travel-ban/2017/01/29/4ffe900a-e620-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html?utm_term=.12e9eaadda54">&quot;appeared&quot; that Priebus was walking back</a> the order, it was a definite change. Even The Only Real News Outlet Around, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222162728/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/29/federal-judge-grants-stay-to-allow-those-with-visas-to-remain.html">Fox News, reported</a> that &quot;A U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. That covers legal permanent residents -- green card holders -- and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday... They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.&quot; </p>
