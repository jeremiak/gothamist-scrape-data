But it also means the perverts are excited. The NYPD just released this photograph of a man accused of taking an upskirt photograph of a woman on a subway.<p></p>

<p>According to the police, on the afternoon of Wednesday, April 18th, a 24-year-old woman approached police officers who said that a man &quot;took a photograph beneath her skirt while they were riding a southbound #4 train approaching the Union Square station.&quot; The victim, in return, took a photograph of the suspect.</p>

<p>He&apos;s described as a Hispanic male, about 30-40 years old, around 5&apos;5&quot; and 150 pounds with brown eyes, short black hair and a mustache. He was also wearing a black and orange sweatshirt.<br>
 <br>
Anyone with information in regard to this crime is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).  The public can also submit tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628073603/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.  All calls are strictly confidential.</p>

<p>Another tip: Watch out for pervs on the subway stairs.  One summer, we spotted a sicko who kept &quot;dropping&quot; items on the steps at Broadway-Lafayette so he could look up women&apos;s skirts.  </p>
