The House is expected to approve the bill and the President Obama is also expected to sign it.  NY State, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145324/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/12/nyers_worry_about_unemployment_bene.php">already extended unemployment benefits</a> to 79 weeks for the longterm unemployed, would get another 20 weeks because its unemployment rate is higher than 8.5% (it was 8.9% in September; the NYC rate is 10.3%).  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145324/http://twitter.com/NYSLabor">NY State Labor Dept.&apos;s Twitter</a> has been keeping followers apprised of the bill&apos;s progress.  </p>
