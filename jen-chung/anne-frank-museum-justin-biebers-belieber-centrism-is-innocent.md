<p>Swaggy music phenomenon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120520/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/justin_bieber_visits_anne_frank_hou.php">Justin Bieber&apos;s visit to the Anne Frank House</a> last week resulted in a somewhat tone deaf guestbook deep thought: &quot;Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.&quot; Which thrilled his fans and upset a lot of others. But the Anne Frank Museum sees the glass at half full!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120520/https://www.facebook.com/annefrankhouse/posts/10151332657151717">Anne Frank House writes</a> on Facebook, &quot;The Anne Frank House was pleased to welcome Justin Bieber to the Anne Frank House last Friday. We think it is very positive that he took the time and effort to visit our museum. He was very interested in the story of Anne Frank and stayed for over an hour. We hope that his visit will inspire his fans to learn more about her life and hopefully read the diary.&quot; Yes, Bieber fans: Learn more about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120520/http://www.annefrank.org/">Anne Frank</a> and how she, her family and other Jews hid in a 500-square-feet space for two years, until the Nazis deported them to Auschwitz. That&apos;s way more important than hating Selena Gomez.</p>

<p>Of course, the museum also started the whole kerfuffle when it posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120520/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151330276206717&amp;set=a.140434316716.124300.139219566716&amp;type=1">about Bieber&apos;s visit and his remarks</a>. Anne Frank House spokeswoman Annemarie Bekker said they were &quot;a bit overwhelmed&quot; by non-Beliebers who think the pop star is an idiot. Bekker said, &quot;He&apos;s a 19-year-old boy taking the effort to come and see the museum, and we&apos;d like to point that out, and I think it&apos;s quite innocent what he put down.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, he also went to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120520/http://www.hermitage.nl/en/">Hermitage Museum</a>&#x2014;wonder if he wrote in the guestbook, &quot;Peter the Great was a great tsar Hopefully he would have been a belieber.&quot; </p>

<p>And the biggest question is whether Otto Frank would have taken Anne to a Bieber concert&#x2014;here&apos;s Justin singing, &quot;Baby, to his Dutch Beliebers.</p>
