<p>Care to enjoy some crostini with grilled squash, charred onion and mint in the beautiful backdrop of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015041/http://nybg.org/">New York Botanical Garden</a>? This Sunday&#x2014;and for two more Sundays in September&#x2014;chefs from Mario Batali and Joe Bastanich&apos;s restaurants are preparing &quot;family-style&quot; dinners at the Bronx oasis.</p>

<p>On August 10, Eataly chefs Alex Pilas and Fitz Tallon will be making a three-course dinner at the NYBG&apos;s outdoor Whole Foods Market Family Garden Kitchen. In addition to the crostini, the menu includes &quot;Casarecce Pasta with Pesto Trapanese and Pecorino&quot; for the main course and an &quot;Olive Oil Cake with Mascarpone and Carrots&quot; for dessert.  Ingredients for the meal are taken from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015041/http://www.nybg.org/education/edible-academy/batali-programs.php">Mario Batali&apos;s Kitchen Gardens at the NYBG</a>. </p>

<p>There are gardening and crafting activities before dinner, as well as cooking demonstrations before and during the meal. Here&apos;s a look at a dinner from last year:</p>
