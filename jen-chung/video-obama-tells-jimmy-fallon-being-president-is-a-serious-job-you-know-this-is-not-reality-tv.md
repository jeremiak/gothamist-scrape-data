<p>President Obama stopped by 30 Rock last night to tape a segment of The Tonight Show and  weighed in on Election 2016: GOP Bizarro Edition. When Jimmy Fallon asked if he thought Republicans were happy with their choice of overly-caramelized cr&#xE8;me br&#xFB;l&#xE9;e Donald Trump, the President replied, &quot;We are.&quot;</p>

<p>He added, after laughing, &quot;But I don&apos;t know... I don&apos;t know how they&apos;re feeling. (CHEERS)  So&#x2014;actually, you know what&#x2014;that was too easy. But the truth is actually I am worried about the Republican Party.&quot; From the White House press pool transcript:</p><blockquote>But democracy works. This country works when you have two parties that are serious and trying to solve problems. And they&apos;ve got philosophical differences and they have fierce debates and they argue and they contest elections. But at the end of the day, what you want is a healthy two party system.<p></p>

<p>And you know, you want the Republican nominee to be somebody who could do the job if they win. And you want folks who understand the issues. And where you can sit across the table from &apos;em and you have a principled argument. And ultimately can still move the country forward.</p>

<p>So I am actually not enjoying, and I haven&apos;t been enjoying over the last seven years, watching some of the things that have happened in the Republican Party &apos;cause there&apos;s some good people in the Republican Party. There are wonderful Republicans out in the country who want what&apos;s best for the country and may disagree with me on some things but are good, decent people.</p>

<p>But what&apos;s happened in that party culminating in this current nomination, I think is not actually good for the country as a whole. It&apos;s not something Democrats should wish for. And my hope is, is that maybe once you get through this cycle, there&apos;s some corrective action and they get back to being a center right party. And Democratic Party being a center left party. And we start figurin&apos; how to work together.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Also, to clear things up, Obama said, &quot;The main role I&apos;m gonna be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job. You know, this is not reality TV.&quot;</p>

<p>His appearance on The Tonight Show will air tonight at 11:35 p.m. on NBC; the musical guest is Madonna. </p>
