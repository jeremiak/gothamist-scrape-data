Tony Vanacore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130310075005/http://www.newrochelletalk.com/content/daring-armed-north-end-home-invasion-new-rochelle-foiled-home-health-care-worker-similar-cas">tells New Rochelle&apos;s Talk of the Sound</a>, &quot;God gave me the strength to go down those stairs and punch this guy.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130310075005/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/01/02/92-year-old-man-fights-off-home-invader/">According to WCBS 2</a>, the suspect &quot;entered Vanacore&#x2019;s home through the unlocked front door where he was met by Vanacore&#x2019;s caregiver, Mariana. Mariana and the intruder were struggling on a staircase when Vanacore got up and joined the fight.&quot;  Vanacore said, &quot;<strong>I pulled his hat off his head to see what the hell he looked like.</strong>  He had his hat down to his eyes, and then I ran up to dial 911. He ran up after me and shut the phone off and I re-dialed and he ran away.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, adding to the drama, was the gun that the intruder was wielding.  Vanacore&apos;s nurse actually grabbed it, because she didn&apos;t think it was real&#x2014;and she was right, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130310075005/http://www.newrochelletalk.com/content/daring-armed-north-end-home-invasion-new-rochelle-foiled-home-health-care-worker-similar-cas">it broke when she touched it</a>.</p>

<p>Vanacore proudly added, &quot;The funny thing is, I use a walker, but when all this was happening, I was running without no help and fighting with him because he was harming my caretaker. I gave him some pretty good shots. He gave me some shots too.  I got bruises.&quot; One tip: &quot;You keep your left hand out and counterpunch.&quot; He also said, after living in his home for over 50 years, he&apos;d finally start locking his front door.  </p>

<p>Police think the robbery attempt could be connected with other home invasions in the area.</p>
