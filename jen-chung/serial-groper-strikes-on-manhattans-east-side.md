He then allegedly assaulted a 27-year-old woman in the elevator of her building on East 56th Street near Third Avenue at 8:15 p.m.&quot;  Police say the suspect is around 5&apos;10&quot; and 200-240 pounds, in his 30s or 40s with long black hair (he may be Native American).  And an East Side resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201550/http://wcbstv.com/health/manhattan.serial.groper.2.1011076.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;It&apos;s scary. I have a 6-year-old daughter. Can you imagine some man comes up from behind and grabs you? Scary.&quot; </p>
