</div></div>					<p>Earlier today, relatives and friends of victims and city, state and federal officials gathered at Zuccotti Park to commemorate the events of September 11.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224952/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09112008/news/regionalnews/sept__11_lives_forever_in_our_hearts_128602.htm?page=2">Mayor Bloomberg said</a>, &quot;Today marks the seventh anniversary of the day our world was broken...a day that began like any other and ended as none ever has.&quot;  (Video below.)</p>

<p>This year is the final year for families to make the pilgrimage down to the &quot;pit&quot; Ground Zero, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224952/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/09/11/2008-09-11_the_last_pilgrimage_of_pain_to_the_pit_b.html">because of construction plans</a>.  One man who escaped the south tower told the Daily News, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t know where else to go,&quot; and a woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224952/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/the-ceremony-at-ground-zero/">told CityRoom</a> that since none of her son&apos;s remains were recovered, the pit is &quot;where he is buried as far as we are concerned.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a list of the 2,751 names (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224952/http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/pdf/2008/911_08_list_of_names.pdf">PDF</a>).  The World Trade Center Health Registry estimates that 70,000 people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224952/http://www.dbtechno.com/health/2008/09/11/study-finds-70000-developed-ptsd-due-to-911-attacks/">have post-traumatic stress disorder</a> due to the attacks.</p>
