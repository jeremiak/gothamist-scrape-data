<p>A man who was being escorted out of a Bronx deli by police officers grabbed one of the cops&apos; guns and fatally shot a deli worker early this morning. The other officer fired his gun, wounding the suspect. </p>

<p>The incident occurred at A&amp;M; Deli at 230 East 198th Street at the corner of Valentine Avenue around 1 a.m. today. Two officers responded to the scene, where two deli workers were in an altercation with a third man, 30-year-old Efraim Guzman. NYPD Assistant Chief <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014319/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120409/manhattan/manhattan-detective-chief-yanked-fallout-from-greg-kelly-scandal">Larry Nikunen</a>, Commanding Officer of Patrol Borough Bronx, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014319/http://nypdnews.com/2016/08/police-involved-shooting-bronx-3/">described</a> a &quot;physical struggle&quot; between the workers and Guzman.</p>

<p>Assistant Chief Nikunen told reporters:</p><blockquote>As the officers were escorting Mr. Guzman out of the store, Mr. Guzman was able to grab a gun from one of the officers&#x2019; holsters. Officers struggled with Mr. Guzman, who regained control of the gun. A second officer fired three shots at Mr. Guzman, striking him twice. Mr. Guzman fired numerous shots from the officers&#x2019; gun, one of which we believe fatally struck a 49 year-old male who works in a store across the street. This 49 year-old male had a dispute with Mr. Guzman just prior to this incident.</blockquote>Apparently Guzman was trying to sell phone chargers, and had been kicked out of another store by the 49-year-old deli worker. When Guzman went to A&amp;M; Deli, the deli worker followed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014319/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/08/9/bronx-bodega-worker-fatally-shot-by-officer-s-stolen-gun-.html">reportedly</a> warning employees there &quot;that Guzman was up to no good.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;Their argument became so heated that several 911 calls were made and witnesses flagged down two patrolling NYPD officers, who found the pair brawling,&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014319/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/shots-fired-bronx-officer-involved-shooting-article-1.2743611"> the Daily News reports</a>.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old deli worker died at St. Barnabas, which is where Guzman was also taken. <br>

<p>As many as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014319/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/09/police-deli-shooting-bronx/">15 shots may have been fired</a> during the incident. Surveillance footage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014319/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Police-Officer-Involved-Shooting-Bronx-NYPD-Investigates-389567771.html">reportedly backs up</a> the police version of events.</p>

<p>The News adds, &quot;It&#x2019;s unclear how Guzman managed to swipe the firearm or if he aimed it at the officers, but cops are investigating the incident&quot; because the holster apparently needs to be unclasped before the gun can be removed.</p>
