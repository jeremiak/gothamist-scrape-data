<p>Have you been seeing an unusual number of orange and black butterflies fluttering about?  Well, they are probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_atalanta">Red Admiral butterflies</a>, which are in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_04db8258-8b68-11e1-82c8-0019bb2963f4.html">middle of a migration from the South</a>. (<b>Update</b>: Some Red Admirals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/butterfly_invasion_update_some_red.php">will end up settling in NYC</a>!)  We spotted the one above during Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer&apos;s press conference by the West 72nd Street subway station&#x2014;there were dozens of butterflies flying around, landing on everything! </p>

<p>According to upstate paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_04db8258-8b68-11e1-82c8-0019bb2963f4.html">The Daily News</a>, &quot;Seeing the Red Admiral in the region is not rare &#x2014; it typically arrives at the end of May &#x2014; but to see it in such numbers and so early in the season is not common. Scientists call this an irruption, a sudden upsurge in numbers that often occurs when natural ecological factors are disturbed.&quot;  Experts say the migration is also about 4-5 weeks earlier, possibly due to the warmer-than-usual spring. And Cynthia Druckenbrod, director of horticulture and conservation at the Cleveland Botanical Garden, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/05/invasion_of_red_admirals_signa.html">told The Plain Dealer,</a> &quot;Every once in a while its population spikes for reasons we don&apos;t always understand.&quot;  It&apos;s possible there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://www.13wham.com/news/local/story/Red-Admiral-butterfly/sX_RsQuL3UeQ8ULzYwkFEw.cspx">ten times the normal number of Red Admirals this year</a>!</p>

<p>Here are videos of people marveling at the butterflies:</p>

<p>A young girl in Ohio brought this video to her science class, and her teacher used it as an opportunity to learn more about them:</p>

<p>Literary nerds may recall the butterfly from Vladimir Nabokov&apos;s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://www.shannonrchamberlain.com/palefirepoem.html"> Pale Fire</a> (&quot;Come and be worshipped, come and be caressed,/ My dark Vanessa, crimson-barred, my blest/ My Admirable butterfly); <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709142725/http://serenityspell.com/2012/04/20/nabokovs-butterfly-of-doom-the-red-admiral/">Nabokov also said</a>, &quot;Its coloring is quite splendid and I liked it very much in my youth. Great numbers of them migrated from Africa to Northern Russia, where it was called &#x2018;The Butterfly of Doom&#x2019; because it first appeared in 1881, the year Tsar Alexander II was assassinated, and the markings on the underside of its two hind wings seem to read &#x2019;1881&#x2032;. There is something interesting in the Red Admirable&#x2019;s ability to travel so far.&apos;&quot;</p>
