<p>After four years as a lightning rod for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/ground_zero_mosque_might_drop_that.php">conservative</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/20/yesterday_a_pro-mosque_rally_sunday.php#photo-1">and anti-Muslim</a> groups, as well as some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/families_of_911_victims_blast_groun.php">families of 9/11 victims</a>, the long-planned Muslim community center and prayer space located blocks from the World Trade Center site&#x2014;aka the &quot;Ground Zero&quot; mosque&#x2014;might actually become a different kind of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/nyregion/developer-scales-back-plans-for-muslim-center-near-ground-zero.html?_r=1">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Sharif El-Gamal, the developer, said through a spokesman that instead of a $100 million, 15-story community center and prayer space, he now planned a smaller, three-story museum &apos;dedicated to exploring the faith of Islam and its arts and culture.&apos; The building would also include a sanctuary for prayer services and community programs.&quot; Guess he abandoned that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/forget_the_ground_zero_mosque_how_a.php">&quot;Soho House for Muslims&quot; idea</a>, too.</p>

<p>El-Gamal, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/22/park51_head_admits_we_made_incredib.php">admitted past mistakes</a> with his Park 51 plan, says that he&apos;s asked Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel (he designed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://www.nouvelchelsea.com/">this luxury condo building</a>) to design the building; also, there will be &quot;public green space,&quot; the Times reports. His spokesman Hank Sheinkopf explained the building will be 5000 square feet, &quot;This is a more tailored approach, both physically and programmatically. It will prove to be an important addition to the neighborhood and to New York City&#x2019;s arts and cultural community.&quot; </p>

<p>Jihad Watch&apos;s Robert Spencer told the Times that he wasn&apos;t fooled, &quot;The structure as you describe it would be as grotesque as a three-story museum dedicated to exploring the faith of Shintoism and emperor-worship, and its arts and culture, with a sanctuary for prayer services and community programs, at Pearl Harbor.&quot; Additionally, the museum plan isn&apos;t fully financed and there&apos;s no timeline for construction. </p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195255/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/911_plane_wreckage_removed_no_human.php#photo-1">plane wreckage from 9/11</a> was found behind the building.</p>
