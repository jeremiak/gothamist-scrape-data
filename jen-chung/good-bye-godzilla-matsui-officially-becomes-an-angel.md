<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128015626/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/15/world_series_mvp_hideki_matsui_trad.php">expected</a>, Hideki Matsui, the Yankees&apos; MVP during its latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128015626/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/05/last_nights_action_yankees_win_world_series.php">World Series championship</a>, and the Los Angeles Angels have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128015626/http://www.seattlepi.com/scorecard/mlbnews.asp?articleID=270946">agreed to a $6.5 million one-year deal</a>.  Angels GM Tony Reagins said, &quot;We are excited to have a player with talent that Hideki brings. He is a professional hitter and we look forward to seeing him in an Angels uniform in 2010.&quot;  </p>

<p>His agent Arn Tellem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128015626/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arn-tellem/godzilla-rocks-southern-c_b_394273.html">wrote on the Huffington Post</a>, &quot;He has great affection for New York, a city that embraced him as a native son,&quot; but added, &quot;In the weeks since the Series victory, <strong>it became abundantly clear that resigning Hideki was not one of the Yankees&apos; priorities</strong>... Hideki takes special pride in being a complete player -- at the plate and in the outfield -- and from the start of negotiations, the Angels made every effort to accommodate him.&quot; (Matsui&apos;s past knee issues were an apparent concern of the Yankees.) &quot;Ideally, Hideki would start in left at least once or twice a week. The rest of the time, he&apos;d DH.&quot;</p>

<p>Tellem has a silver lining: &quot;Happily, the Yankees&apos; 2010 home opener is against the Angels on April 13. Hideki will be on hand --- <em>kusuri-yubi </em>(index finger) extended -- for the ring ceremony.&quot;</p>
