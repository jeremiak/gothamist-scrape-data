<p>Three almost brilliant bank robbers are now facing the music for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325063625/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/cops_search_for_phony_cops_who_robb.php">February 2012 heist at a Queens check cashing joint</a>. Prosecutors say Akeem Monsalvatge, Derrick Dunkley and Edward Byam, who are black, donned white masks from a special-effects company to commit the $200,000 crime. But what led the authorities to them was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325063625/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/22/alleged_fake_face_crooks_caught_tha.php">glowing testimonial to the mask company</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m sending this message to say I&#x2019;m extremely pleased by CFX work on the mask. The realism of the mask is unbelievable.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325063625/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/white_wrong_OObh18KFJKieUOQ2mb7zRN">Post reports</a>, &quot;The perps spent two painstaking months plotting their $200,000 stickup...and theorized that switching races would help them avoid detection, authorities said.&quot; The defendants were apparently inspired by the film, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325063625/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ7wcayQQLQ">The Town</a>, and the prosecution wants to show clips from that film, with prosecutor Maria Cruz-Melendez explaining, &quot;They wore lifelike, custom-made, Hollywood-style special-effects masks that made them look like a team of white men.&quot; And there&apos;s a photo of Monsalvatge wearing a t-shirt with a masked robber from the movie.</p>

<p>The robbers, who were also posing at NYPD officers, had frightened the check cashing employee into giving up the money when they showed her a photograph of her home, indicating they knew where she lived. After taking the cash, they left the photograph at the scene&#x2014;and the police traced the picture to a Walgreens where the photo was developed with Byam&apos;s telephone number on the receipt.</p>
