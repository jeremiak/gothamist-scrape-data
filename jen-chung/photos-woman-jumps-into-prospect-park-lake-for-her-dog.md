</div></div>					<p>Earlier this morning, a woman had to be rescued after apparently getting stuck on an island in Prospect Park&apos;s lake. And why did she go over the island? To chase her dog, which had been swimming in the lake.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075220/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140703/park-slope/woman-rescued-after-she-chased-dog-into-prospect-park-lake">A witness told DNAinfo</a>, &quot;It was crazy. The pitbull went in the lake after the ducks and it wouldn&#x2019;t come back... The ducks were smarter than the dog. They were swimming in a circle, and the dog couldn&#x2019;t get them. She was calling her dog and yelling at him for about 30 minutes. All of a sudden, she jumped in and swam after it.&quot;</p>

<p>Witness Christopher Wu tells us by the time he got there, she was on the island. Then the FDNY helped her and her dog off the island. </p>

<p>And this is not the first time a woman has jumped into the lake to retrieve her bird-crazy dog:</p>
