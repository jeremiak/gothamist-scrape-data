<p>Police in a New Jersey suburb are investigating how naked photographs of teen girls were posted online. Ridgewood school administrators sent a letter to parents of middle and high school students notifying them of the disturbing incident, &quot;This inappropriate behavior includes using social media apps as Instagram or Snap Chat to send images of real or simulated sexual acts and photos of naked or semi-naked persons.&quot;</p>

<p>Ridgewood school district and police are investigating the matter together. Ridgewood Superintendent Dan Fishbein&apos;s letter stressed that &quot;These incidents happened off school grounds&quot; but  &quot;If it is determined that students broke school rules then we would handle that administratively as we do with all student issues.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;Often, students participate in the sharing of provocative images of themselves and others without realizing the potential consequences.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151831/http://ridgewood.patch.com/articles/nude-photos-of-ridgewood-high-girls-prompt-police-investigation">According to Ridgewood Patch</a>, several parents and students said that Ridgewood High School girls sent the nude photos using the &apos;Snapchat&apos; application, which destroys photos between 2 and 10 seconds after they&apos;re received. Sources tell the website that an unidentified male student was expecting the images, and he took screenshots of the illicit photos to create an Instagram gallery.</p>

They show their faces right in the picture, so you know it&#x2019;s them. It&#x2019;s so dumb,&quot; and &quot;I&#x2019;ve gotten them, one of my friends sent it to me.&quot;</p>

<p>School, local and state authorities are pointing out that &quot;possession and/or transmission of sexually revealing or explicit images, or any materials of that nature, constitute very serious crimes of possession and transmission of child pornography.&quot; So there&apos;s an amnesty period through Monday, March, 18, 2013 at 7 a.m., for students to delete the photos&#x2014;Fishbein&apos;s letter said, &quot;After this date, any student found to have created, transmitted or possessed an illegal image/movie may be charged with the serious offenses outlined above.&quot;<br>
