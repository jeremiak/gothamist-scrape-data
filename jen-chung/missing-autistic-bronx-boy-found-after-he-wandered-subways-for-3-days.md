Ross Harrison had refused to get on a school bus and headed to a 4 train. The NYPD issued a missing person alert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428200512/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/26/police-looking-for-missing-13-year-old-bronx-boy/">on Wednesday</a>&#x2014;and it turns out he spent the three days in the subway system, getting scraps of food and water from strangers.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428200512/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/17861302/autistic-bronx-boy-to-get-gps-tracker">According to MyFoxNY</a>, Ross didn&apos;t want to go to school because of a bully&#x2014;so he got on the 4 train at 183rd Street. His family posted flyers, and some people remembered seeing Ross on the subway, but didn&apos;t realize he was missing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428200512/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/26/police-looking-for-missing-13-year-old-bronx-boy/">until seeing media reports later</a>. </p>

<p>Ross was found yesterday early yesterday morning in Brooklyn, either on an R train or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428200512/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/runaway_rail_odyssey_mNEHclgOCUi0XQ7OWdMk7K">J train</a>, by a pair of Good Samaritans. The Post reports that when his mother saw Ross at the police precinct, Ross said, &quot;Mommy, you mad?&quot;</p>

<p>Ross survived by getting water and cake from strangers (Ross&apos;s father said, &quot;I&#x2019;m thankful to anyone who helped him&quot;) and his mother said that Ross told her he was trying to come home, &quot;That he was walking and going inside the train and was trying to come back home.&quot; The boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428200512/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/27/missing-bronx-autistic-boy-found-safe-by-good-samaritans/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m running and running and running and running.&quot;  </p>

<p>Ross&apos; father said he was grateful to the people who found him, &quot;It&apos;s good to know that we still have New Yorkers that care.&quot; And MyFoxNY visited the teen and revealed that they got him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428200512/http://www.emfinders.com/">a GPS tracking bracelet</a>, free of cost.</p>
