<p>With the sudden of loss power to the Metro-North New Haven line, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132404/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/con_ed_feeder_loss_suspends_metro_n.php">after a high voltage feeder cable failed yesterday morning</a>, the MTA announced a revised plan with limited bus/train service for the commuters starting today. And, unfortunately, the revised <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132404/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/con_ed_it_could_take_weeks_to_repai.php">service could last for weeks</a>.<br>
 <br>
You can see a map of the revised service here (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132404/http://web.mta.info/mnr/NewHaven/new-haven-line-fix.pdf">PDF</a>). The MTA explained that they are looking for alternative power sources, but the usual second &quot;feeder normally providing service to the New Haven Line was out on scheduled repairs to accommodate upgrades required by Metro-North.&quot;</p>

<p>The agency says, &quot;The service plan can accommodate approximately 33% of the regular ridership on the New Haven Line.&quot; Here&apos;s the breakdown from the horse&apos;s mouth:<br>
