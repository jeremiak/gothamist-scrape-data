<p>An argument at a Queens subway station&apos;s MetroCard vending machine turned violent last month and left a man unconscious. Now police are looking for two suspects in the assault.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on January 22nd, around 1:50 p.m. inside the Flushing - Main Street 7 train station. According to the NYPD, the victim, 43, &quot;was standing in line at the subway station booth in order to add money to his MetroCard. The victim stepped off the line to check the balance using the self-service swipe balance checking device mounted on the outside of the booth. A dispute began between the victim and the unidentified males when the victim attempted to resume his position in line.&quot;</p>

<p>The two men then &quot;pushed the victim towards the station stairs where an assault that rendered the victim unconscious ensued,&quot; police say. </p>

<p>The suspects fled while the victim, who had lacerations on his face, was taken to NY Presbyterian Queens Hospital. <br>
 <br>
Police described one suspect as being in his 20s and the other in his 40s, and released surveillance footage of them walking on Main Street in the vicinity of Roosevelt Avenue:  </p>
