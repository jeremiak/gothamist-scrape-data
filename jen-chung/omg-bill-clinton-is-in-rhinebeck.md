</div></div>					<p>Former president Bill Clinton arrived in the Hudson Valley town of Rhinebeck, NY  in advance of his daughter&apos;s wedding tomorrow.  Clinton was looking trim (Chelsea did ask him to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/29/chelsea_clinton_tells_bill_to_drop.php">lose 15 pounds</a>!) and happily chatted with residents, tourists and media, saying, &quot;Today is the most beautiful day ever.&quot;  Aww.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/30/2010-07-30_bill_clinton_arrives_in_rhinebeck_looking_fit_for_his_daughter_chelseas_wedding.htm">One Hyde Park resident said</a>, &quot;I shook his hand and said congratulations.  It means a lot to the people of Rhinebeck that he took the time to talk to me on his big day.&quot;</p>

<p>In an attempt to mollify <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/28/daily_news_calls_clinton_wedding_pr.php">some annoyed residents</a> who are unhappy about being left in the dark about the huge wedding operation at the Astor Court estate and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/25/chelsea_clintons_wedding_means_huds.php"> ensuing security</a> and road closures, not to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/nyregion/30chelsea.html?ref=nyregion">mention the media frenzy</a>, Chelsea&apos;s wedding planner sent them bottles of wine from the Clinton winery (heh) with a note saying, &quot;Dear neighbor, this Saturday Astor Court will be the site of a very special event... There may be periodic road closures on River Road on Saturday evening,&quot; warning of possible bottlenecks.&quot;  Bill Weichun, who lives on nearby River Road,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rhinebeck_residents_get_wine_as_nPuPTyQdbltVx1aH0yhaEO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME="> said</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s very sweet. I don&#x2019;t feel inconvenienced at all. It&#x2019;s pretty fun &#x2014; it&#x2019;s the event of the century!&quot;</p>

<p>As for why President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/28/preview_of_president_obamas_view_in.php">wasn&apos;t invited</a>, maybe it&apos;s because every invitee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309194710/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/66792/">must know Chelsea personally</a> (that totally helps in whittling down the long list of Mom and Dad&apos;s friends!) </p>
