<p>At least 40 cars&#x2014;possibly up to 100&#x2014;had their tires slashes early yesterday morning in Flatbush. Police released video of the suspect casually slashing tires, as well as one of him walking with a female companion through the neighborhood.</p>

<p>According to police, the tire slashings occurred between midnight and 2 a.m. on Sunday, December 14, from Quentin Road to Avenue S and East 17th Street to Bedford Avenue. While the NYPD says 40 cars were slashed, WCBS 2 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011135/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/12/14/police-investigating-after-40-tires-slashed-in-midwood/">puts the total at 70</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011135/http://nypost.com/2014/12/15/vandals-slash-tires-of-over-100-parked-cars-in-sheepshead-bay/">Post reports it&apos;s more like 100</a>. </p>

<p>One victim told WCBS 2, &quot;You feel violated. We can&#x2019;t even drive it. It makes it impossible to put on a donut and take it to the shop.&quot; Another explained to the Post, &quot;Every car on my block on this side got hit,. There were so many tow trucks and police cars here this morning. Hundreds of cars were towed away to get fixed... It&#x2019;s terrible. Many people just got the new tires for winter. This is like nothing I have ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, there&apos;s a combined $3,500 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the tire slasher. City Councilman David Greenfield told JP Updates, &quot;We must have zero tolerance for this rampant crime spree in our neighborhood. A single tire costs hundreds of dollars, not to mention the time and energy that must be expended to replace it. That&#x2019;s why I am offering this reward - this kind of behavior is outrageous and quite frankly it doesn&#x2019;t go unnoticed that this happened in a predominantly Jewish community.&quot;</p>

<p>Police says both the man and woman in the video are suspects in this criminal mischief incident. Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS.</p>
