<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_lconst.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023651im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_lconst.jpg" width="190" height="285" class="image-left"> </span>While Governor Paterson battles public perception about his administration&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023651/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/04/do_you_suffer_from_scandal_fatigue.php">just lost its third key official in a week</a>&#x2014;his predecessor&apos;s scandalous fall is also news.  Former governor Eliot Spitzer is the subject of a tell-all memoir from his former friend and adviser and a lengthy Time magazine feature, in which he says of returning to politics, &quot;You have to understand what my family would go through. It would be unbearable. I just couldn&apos;t do that to them. It would be day after day of the ugly stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>His former adviser Lloyd Constantine has produced a knife-twisting look at the Spitzer administration with &quot;Journal of the Plague Year: An Insider&apos;s Chronicle of Eliot Spitzer&apos;s Short and Tragic Reign.&quot;  The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023651/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/nyregion/04spitzer.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss"> NY Times got a preview</a>, &quot;Mr. Constantine offers one diagnosis for Mr. Spitzer&#x2019;s tempestuous behavior that perhaps only a wealthy Manhattanite could suggest: acute lack of tennis. Mr. Spitzer dropped his weekly game with Mr. Constantine in 2006, worried that a tender hamstring would cause him to hobble on the campaign trail. <strong>That &apos;deprived Eliot of an important physical release,&apos;</strong> Mr. Constantine writes.&quot;</p>

<p>Constantine, who first met Spitzer when he hired him as his student intern in the state Attorney General&apos;s office, also says Spitzer called him the night before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023651/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/governor_spitze_1.php">news of Spitzer&apos;s penchant for prostitutes</a> broke: &quot;Eliot was crying and said two jangling if not necessarily inconsistent things... He said, &#x2018;You can throw me over if you want to, and I won&#x2019;t blame you if you do.&#x2019; And then said, &#x2018;As of now, you are my counsel...The Times will report that I have been involved with prostitutes... I can&#x2019;t continue as governor and must resign.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The Love Gov, who calls the book a &quot;self-serving and largely inaccurate interpretation of events mixed with unfounded speculation,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023651/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1969595,00.html">tells Time magazine</a>, &quot;At one point I stood for something that was important and useful. I was in a place in time where I had a purpose, where it mattered. And then I destroyed it.&quot; </p>
