<p>NJ police are investigating two seventh grade students at a Paterson school, because the girls allegedly threatened to kill classmates. And the authorities are aware of the situation because the students allegedly (a) told classmates as much and (b) posted a video to YouTube bragging, &quot;I have special killing thingies for different people.&quot;</p>

<p>While the YouTube video was pulled down, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080637/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Seventh-Grade-Girls-Threaten-Kill-Classmates-Hit-List-YouTube-Paterson-New-Jersey-204769021.html">NBC New York reports that a girl says</a>, &quot;I think about killing her. I don&apos;t know why she&apos;s annoying.&quot; </p>

<p>Jackie Quinones, the mother of one student, informed the school on Tuesday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080637/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Two_Paterson_girls_accused_of_making_video_death_threats_against_classmates.html?page=all">From MyCentralJersey</a>:</p><blockquote>Quinones said her daughter told her the situation started on Tuesday afternoon during a classroom journal writing exercise. One of the girls wrote in her journal the names of students - mostly other girls - she wanted to kill, said Quinones. At the end of the class, the girl read her journal entry to classmates, but not within earshot of the teacher, said Quinones.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;My daughter said to her, &#x2018;You want to kill me?&#x2019;&#x201D; said Quinones. &#x201C;She said, &#x2018;Yes, I want to kill you.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Quinones said her 12-year-old daughter, whose name she asked not be published, then went to the bathroom to hide. &#x201C;My daughter called me from the bathroom,&#x2019;&#x2019; said Quinones. &#x201C;She was so scared she was crying.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>The principal told Quinones that the student was removed from class and wouldn&apos;t be able to return until she was seen by a doctor. On Wednesday, the student was back, after getting medical clearance. Later that day, other students discovered a 21-minute YouTube video featuring the alleged threat-marker (plus another student off camera) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080637/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/25/n-j-girls-12-could-face-charges-after-threatening-to-murder-classmates-in-video/">listing students and administrators they want to kill</a>, &quot;Wouldn&#x2019;t you guys think I&#x2019;d be the best assassin ever... Stab him continuously in this area.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Quinones says her daughter never had any disputes with the two girls in the video and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080637/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/25/n-j-girls-12-could-face-charges-after-threatening-to-murder-classmates-in-video/">another mother said</a>, &#x201C;My daughter, she woke up about four times last night, to lock the doors. She woke up with nightmares.&quot;</p>
