<p>Finally commenting about NJ Governor Chris Christie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/27/law_firm_christie_hired_spent_1m_to.php">law firm&apos;s report about Bridgegate</a>, a lawyer for ex-deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly chimed in with criticism that it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/28/ladies_are_crazy_declares_chris_chr.php">pretty stupid to imply that Kelly helped</a> orchestrate Bridgegate because of a relationship gone sour. &quot;The report&#x2019;s venomous, gratuitous, and inappropriate sexist remarks concerning Ms. Kelly have no place in what is alleged to be a professional and independent report,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/http://www.northjersey.com/news/gwb-report-a-preemptive-strike-to-isolate-bridget-kelly-her-lawyer-says-1.753703">said lawyer Michael Critchley</a>.</p>

<p>The report&#x2014;which exonerated Christie of any wrongdoing (of course!)&#x2014;repeatedly mentioned how Kelly and Christie&apos;s campaign manager Bill Stepien were a couple. For instance, &quot;Kelly and Stepien became personally involved, although, by early August 2013, their personal relationship had cooled, apparently at Stepien&#x2019;s choice, and they largely stopped speaking...  Like the others involved in the lane realignment, events in Kelly&#x2019;s personal life may have had some bearing on her subjective motivations and state of mind.&quot; Just like Port Authority David Samson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/28/christie_comes_out_of_public_shadow.php">resigned because he was feeling &quot;tired&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Kelly did send the infamous email to Port Authority executive David Wildstein, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/top_christie_aide_emailed_time_for.php">&quot;time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,&quot;</a> but her friends and others in NJ government believe that she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/bridget_anne_kelly_who_betrayed_chr.php">would never have acted as a lone wolf</a>. Earlier this year, Salon&apos;s Steve Kornacki, who knows her from covering NJ politics, said, &quot;Having known her for years, I have a hard time believing Bridget Kelly ordered this by herself.&quot;</p>

<p>The report, led by former Giuliani administration chief of staff Randy Mastro, admitted it never spoke to Kelly. Critchley said, &quot;We note that by Mr. Mastro&#x2019;s own admission, he did not have access to all information. Of course, without reviewing all pertinent evidence, any conclusions that are to be drawn are by definition incomplete,&quot; and called the report a &quot;preemptive strike to isolate Ms. Kelly and impugn her credibility... Ms. Kelly is not a liar. She is a single mother of four children who was deeply devoted and committed to her job at the Office of the Governor. She worked tirelessly to pursue the goals of the Office during her tenure.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>David Samson resignation: another one bites the dust. Also, wonder what Mastro-characterized psycho slut Bridget Kelly has to say now.</p>&#x2014; Douglas Muzzio (@musingmuttering) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/https://twitter.com/musingmuttering/statuses/449636845270630400">March 28, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Kelly&apos;s lawyer added that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064533/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/bridget_kellys_attorney_accuses.html#incart_m-rpt-1">if she&apos;s given &quot;appropriate&quot; protection</a> from the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office, she&apos;ll be happy to cooperate. Dunh dunh DUNH.</p>
