                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_05_scrubs2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070206im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_05_scrubs2.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="image-left"> </span>On Thursday morning, a woman wearing scrubs rang the bell of a Staten Island home owner. The woman told the resident that she was a home health care worker. Then, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070206/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Staten-Island-Home-Invasion-Armed-Robbery-Elverton-Great-Kills-151979945.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;When he told the woman he didn&apos;t use a home health aide, a man who appeared to be her accomplice pushed his way into the house flashing a gun, police said.&quot; So the homeowner ran out and called 911.</p>

<p>The incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070206/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/staten_islland_home-invasion_s.html">occurred on Eleverton Avenue</a> in the Great Kills section, across from PS 32.  Police locked down PS 32 for 90 minutes during its investigation as a precaution: &quot;Heavily-armed Emergency Services officers marshaled outside the home, while a helicopter hovered overhead. Two canine units also responded to the scene, which was cordoned off by yellow police tape.&quot; </p>

<p>Police thought the suspects were still inside the home, but they didn&apos;t find them there or in neighboring homes or yards.  A neighbor said, &quot;This is supposed to be one of the best neighborhoods in Staten Island. Things like this can happen anywhere. You don&apos;t know the reason, like if they were targeted.&quot; </p>

<p>This has been Staten Island&apos;s 14th home invasion this year; earlier this year, a man posing as a Fed Ex deliveryman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070206/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/hero_hound_takes_bullet_in_the_head.php">forced his way into a home</a>, scuffled with the resident and then shot the man&apos;s dog. He&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070206/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/fed_ex_faker.php">still at large</a>.</p>
