A 27-year-old woman had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151417/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-woman-escapes-abduction-attempt-article-1.1412359?localLinksEnabled=false">noticed a man in a car following her</a> at Carroll and Court Streets&#x2014;and then the man got out and tried to grab her.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151417/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_abduct_attack_G3YCCN4CTZV1MVTrsgVjFK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">victim spoke to the Post</a>, explaining she had just deposited money at the Chase bank at the corner at 2 a.m. </p><blockquote>When she reached Second Place and Court Street about two blocks away, the driver pulled over and flashed a gun at her. &#x201C;It was very frightening,&#x201D; she told The Post last night. &#x201C;He pulls into his waist, and pulls the gun out.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>She quickly tried to offer him her cellphone and wallet &#x2014; but the assailant said he wasn&#x2019;t interested. &#x201C;I give him everything. He doesn&#x2019;t care,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;He puts me in a headlock and is pointing the gun at me.&#x201D; The thug then pistol-whipped her four times, and tried to drag her into his car, sources said.</p></blockquote>She managed to get away as she struggled with him, &quot;I was scared, but I didn&#x2019;t lose control. I took my chances and started fighting back.&quot; EMTs found her with a broken tooth. <p></p>

<p>The Post reports that the suspect  was in custody: &quot;Sources said he was found in Red Hook after leaving his cellphone at the crime scene.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151417/http://carrollgardens.patch.com/groups/police-and-fire/p/carroll-gardens-police-force-hunt-suspect-in-attempted-abduction">victim ID&apos;d the suspect</a>, Willie Weathers, in a police line up last night.</p>
