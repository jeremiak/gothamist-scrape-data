<p>Hey, late tax filers, the James A. Farley Main Post Office (Eighth Avenue between 31 and 33 Streets) is open until midnight tonight. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628062403/http://usps.gov/">USPS</a> also tells us, &quot;For additional convenience mobile postal retail units will also be parked in front of the Post Office on Eighth Avenue with postal employees selling stamps and accepting mail. Many New York City Post Offices throughout the five boroughs are regularly open until 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. on weeknights like April 15. Consumers can call toll free 1-800-ASK-USPS (1-800-275-8777) or go on-line to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628062403/http://usps.com/">usps.com</a> for the business hours and Post Office locations closest to their ZIP Code.&quot;  And more tips for last minute tax filers after the jump:</p>
