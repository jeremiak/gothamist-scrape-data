<p>Once upon a time, the best grocery options for Tribeca residents were the bodega, a Food Emporium or Amish Market. Now, Fairway Market is moving in, too.</p>

<p>Fairway will be the latest of the bigger supermarkets to enter the pricey neighborhood&#x2014;Gristede&apos;s is on South End Avenue and Whole Foods is on Greenwich between Murray and Warren Streets. Fairway will actually be moving down the street from Whole Foods: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024006/http://nypost.com/2013/09/27/fairway-supermarket-coming-to-world-trade-center/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;The new Fairway&quot;&#x2014;at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024006/http://www.resnicknyc.com/commercial/property/255-greenwich-street/1380894/overview">255 Greenwich</a>&#x2014;&quot;will have more than 11,000 square feet on the ground floor and the rest in the concourse, with a main entrance at the corner of Greenwich and Murray streets.&quot; </p>

<p>This leads to the inevitable question: When does Trader Joe&apos;s move in?</p>
