When asked &quot;if she had anything to say to the victims of her husband&apos;s scam or whether she played a role in it,&quot; she simply said, &quot;<strong>I have no response to you</strong>.&quot;  Apparently Ruth Madoff has been telling people that she&apos;s lonely and feels shunned ever since the scandal erupted, but a lawyer representing victims of the scam said, &quot;Why would you have sympathy for his wife in any of these circumstances? She was one of the largest beneficiaries of the fraud. She enjoyed a very rich lifestyle that practically everyone would love to emulate and it was paid for by someone else.&quot; ABC News also likes to mention how Madoff was very generous with his employees&#x2014;&quot;Madoff sent $2.2 million so that one staffer, now under criminal investigation, could buy a New Jersey beach house. Frank DiPascali, Madoff&apos;s right hand man, was paid nearly $3 million a year. DiPascali&apos;s boat captain was also on the Madoff payroll.&quot;</p>
