										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_07_lindev.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160620230045im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_lindev.jpg" width="365" height="275" class="image-left"> </span>Linda Evangelista, the 1990s supermodel who famously uttered, &quot;We don&apos;t wake up for less than $10000 a day,&quot; was in Manhattan Family Court yesterday to demand that the father of her four-year-old son <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160620230045/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/linda_demands_monthly_from_ex_8lWhicZ0088EQTIU1kouNI">pay a staggering $46,000/month in child support</a>, which was noted as the &quot;largest support order in the history of the Family Court.&quot; Of course, the baby daddy happens to be fashion industry billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, who is married to Salma Hayek.  </p>

<p>Evangelista&apos;s lawyer pointed out that while Pinault, whose company owns or co-owns brands like Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent and Puma, has a $12 million estate in trust for his three-year-old daughter with Hayek, he hasn&apos;t contributed at all to the cost of raising son August.  Lawyer William Breslow explained that most of the money would go towards nannies and &quot;gun-toting drivers,&quot; Pinault&apos;s lawyer complained about the $80,000/year cost of a nannies, &quot;She testified that she wants to have a 24-hour nanny because she does not want to be alone with the child .  Miss Evangelista, you should understand, has a worth of more than $8 million, and she earned, last year, $1.8 million.&quot;</p>

<p>While Support Magistrate Matthew Troy took out the $7,500/month vacation request in expenses, he did say some were credible, &quot;These are the extraordinary expenses that may be a part of the child&apos;s life. And if there is a trial [in the support case] with a lot of publicity, there will probably be a need for two detectives to drive this kid around.&quot;  Evangelista explained she works hard for her money, &quot;On days when I do not work, I am working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an athlete... When I work, it can be a 16-hour day.&quot; </p>
