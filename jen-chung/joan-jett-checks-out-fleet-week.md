<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_05_joanj2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925013808im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_05_joanj2.jpg" width="200" height="172" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925013808/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/19/get_ready_because_fleet_week_starts.php">Fleet Week</a> is officially kicked off, with today&apos;s Parade of Ships and the military flyover.  You&apos;ll be seeing thousands of sailors, marines, and members of the Coast Guard around town over the next week&#x2014;and you can also see them at special events (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925013808/https://www.cnic.navy.mil/cnrma/Programs/FWNY/ScheduleofEvents/index.htm">more details here</a>). The event celebrates the sea services and yesterday rocker Joan Jett met some servicemen and servicewomen as she toured the USS Iwo Jima.</p>

<p>This year&apos;s Fleet Week is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925013808/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/fighter_planes_over_hudson_riv.html">somewhat downsized</a> due to the economy; a Naval spokesperson said, &quot;We&apos;re just taking a little more of a fiscal look at this year.&quot;  Here are some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925013808/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/staten_islanders_welcome_fleet.html">photographs of the ships passing by Staten Island</a>. One S.I. resident who served in the 82nd Airborne Division from 1969 to 1971 told the Advance he was going to visit the ships this week and added, &quot;You&apos;ve got young men and women deployed around the world. A young sergeant I know just completed his second tour in Iraq. This reminds people of their service.&quot;</p>
