The police have  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045247/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/police-arrest-four-for-phony-iphone-robberies/79892/">arrested a group of young men</a> for robbing thousands of dollars from people responding to a Craigslist ad, with the sweet deal of about 10 iPhones for $2,000.</p>

<p>The Sun reports that the group would tell potential buyers to meet them on various East Flatbush street corners, with the cash, of course: &quot;Once there, officials said, the men robbed the interested buyers using a 9 mm pistol. Police said the men, who never had iPhones to sell, stole thousands of dollars.&quot;  The scheme was broken up yesterday when a police officer posed as an interested buyer and met up with the thieves at Albany Avenue and Avenue K.</p>

<p>While twelve people have said they were robbed, the police have only linked the group to four of the robberies.  And last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045247/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/09/surprise_teens.php">a group of teens were arrested</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045247/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/10/cash_and_beatin.php">trying to rob and beating would-be Porsche buyers</a>, found through a Craigslist ad.   Craigslist also has tips for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045247/http://www.craigslist.org/about/safety.html">personal safety</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045247/http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams.html">avoiding scams &amp; frauds</a>.</p>
