Here&apos;s a summary of new details:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525072831/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/2008/12/02/2008-12-02_plaxico_burress_suspended_by_giants_done.html">According to the Daily News</a>, Burress will &quot;lose the remainder of his  $3.5 million salary - $823,529&quot; and the Giants could &quot;withhold the $1million payment of his $4.25 million signing bonus.&quot;  Besides a potential fine of one week&apos;s pay (over $200K) , the Giants could trade him or cut him &quot;<strong>If he is cut before June 1 he would count for only $4.4 million in &apos;dead money&apos; against the 2009 salary cap.</strong>&quot;<br>
</li><li>Defense lawyer Robert Gottlieb <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525072831/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/sports/football/03weapon.html?ref=nyregion">tells the NY Times</a> that since the 3.5 year minimum for illegal gun possession was established, if Burress &quot;plead[s] down [to] one count,&quot; he &quot;<strong>would still face a minimum of two years in prison.</strong>&quot;  (Mayor Bloomberg, who has made gun violence a big part of his mayoral platform, fought to enact the tougher legislation.)  But given the high-profile nature of the case, Gottlieb doubts the DA&apos;s office will accept a plea. <br>
</li><li>The doctor who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525072831/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/02/hospital_under_fire_for_not_reporti.php">did not report Burress&apos;s gunshot wound</a> to the police, as per the law, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525072831/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12032008/news/regionalnews/doc_benched_in_giant_boo_boo_141962.htm">has been suspended</a>: &quot;Dr. Josyann Abisaab, 44, does not work directly for New York-Cornell Hospital but is affiliated with the facility.&quot;<br>
</li><li>The NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525072831/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12032008/news/regionalnews/towing_the_linebacker_141964.htm">impounded Antonio Pierce&apos;s SUV</a>; Pierce, who was with Burress at the club, apparently drove his teammate to the hospital.  His lawyer said, &quot;Mr. Pierce, given the extraordinary circumstances of the evening, acted responsibly in trying to save what could have been the life of a friend.&quot;<br>
</li><li>The State Liquor Authority might <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525072831/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12032008/news/regionalnews/legal_heat_on_club_141997.htm">yank LQ&apos;s liquor license</a>.<br>

<p>And Giants coach Tom Coughlin said, &quot;When you lose a player of Plaxico&#x2019;s ability, it is incumbent that everybody step up and fill the void. In the last two seasons, this team has done an outstanding job of that. <strong>We made it clear to Plax today that we are here to support him in any way possible.</strong>&quot;</p>
