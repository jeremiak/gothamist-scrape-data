While serving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/18/braunstein_gets.php">20-year-sentence for the attack</a>, Braunstein has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/27/incarcerated_peter_braunstein_is_st.php">been interviewed</a>, offered his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/02/peter_braunstein_loves_blair_waldor.php">thoughts on current TV</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/21/infamous_inmates_fat_nick_peter_bra.php">become friends</a> with other notorious criminals.  Now, Aaron Gell has published an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://www.amazon.com/Speak-of-the-Devil-ebook/dp/speak-devil-kindle-single/B006LDA6KE/ref=kin_single_gell">e-book about Braunstein</a>, featuring new insights, like how he has a young female friend who &quot;wanted to impress me in a Manson Girl kind of way. She tried to come off as more fucked up than she actually was&quot; and runs errands for him, like sending letters to magazine editors offering his criticisms which is a violation of his sentence.<p></p>

<p>Braunstein, who was found after a manhunt across the country when he tried to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/16/breaking_peter.php"> slit his throat at the University of Memphis</a> (he was recognized by a student), reached out to Gell through his friend, who he nicknamed Salander, after Lisbeth Salander in &quot;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&quot; (the book&apos;s original Swedish title is &quot;Men Who Hate Women&quot;). Part of the e-book is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://www.observer.com/2011/12/wwd-writer-fire-fiend-peter-braunstein-12132011/?show=all">excerpted in The Observer</a>, and Braunstein, whose madness seemed partly motivated by the dog-eat-dog world of the NY media industry, is now dealing with the complex dynamics behind bars:</p><blockquote>Indeed, as measured by the perverse standards that define prison life, it turns out Peter&#x2019;s greatest transgression may have been appearing on America&#x2019;s Most Wanted a total of five times while so many other reprobates with truly unspeakable offenses on their rap sheets never made the cut.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even like to mention it, because guys are so competitive,&#x201D; he said with a sigh. We were sitting at a wooden table in a spare meeting room. Peter wore a green prison jumpsuit resembling a mechanic&#x2019;s uniform. His once-unruly hair was cut short, and there was little sign of scarring from the suicide attempt that brought an end to his outlaw spree.</p>

<p>Actually, if you squinted a bit, he looked like Billy Joel.</p>

<p>Peter went on. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll be like, &#x2018;I was almost on it.&#x2019; I can&#x2019;t tell you how many times I&#x2019;ve heard that. &#x2018;Almost.&#x2019; Really? Does John Walsh email you when you&#x2019;re almost on and say, &#x2018;You were almost on my show&#x2019;? No. He doesn&#x2019;t do that. There&#x2019;s no way you could almost be on it. It&#x2019;s like &#x2018;almost pregnant&#x2019; or &#x2018;almost dead.&#x2019; No. You&#x2019;re either on it or you&#x2019;re not.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At the far end of the table, a clean-cut, exceptionally muscled guard sat politely studying his hands in his lap and occasionally stifling a laugh.</p>

<p>&#x201C;If I hear one more time, &#x2018;You didn&#x2019;t even rape her,&#x2019;&#x201D; Peter said. Then he leaned back and shook his head. &#x201C;I mean, talk about &#x2018;Damned if you did, damned if you didn&#x2019;t.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="I asked him why he wanted to spend his life in prison. &#x201C;Like I really want to hit the streets again when I&#x2019;m 65? Yeah, that&#x2019;s a good life,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In this economy. Fast forward to then, where you got like 27 percent unemployment and people are going to be hunting squirrels for food.&#x201D;">Braunstein said</a> the attack was random and part of a suicide quest. The victim, who eventually called 911 when Braunstein left, was so shaken by the attack that she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/02/victims_911_cal.php">told the 911 operator</a> she wouldn&apos;t open the door to the cops, &quot;I don&apos;t know. ... I don&apos;t trust anybody. The guy who was here had a police badge. He had a fire uniform. He had everything. I&apos;m so scared.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://www.amazon.com/Speak-of-the-Devil-ebook/dp/speak-devil-kindle-single/B006LDA6KE/ref=kin_single_gell">proceeds from the e-book</a> will go towards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093049/http://Safeharbor.org/">Safeharbor.org</a>, the New York City&#x2019;s leading service organization for victims of domestic violence.  Braunstein also told Gell he wanted to spend his life in prison, &quot;Like I really want to hit the streets again when I&#x2019;m 65? Yeah, that&#x2019;s a good life. In this economy. Fast forward to then, where you got like 27 percent unemployment and people are going to be hunting squirrels for food.&quot;</p>
