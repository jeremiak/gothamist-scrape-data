<p>A bill to make St. Patrick&apos;s Day a holiday for NYC public school students has passed the New York State Senate, and now it&apos;s up to the NY State Assembly to make it so. </p>

<p>The bill (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628074620/https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/s6747">PDF</a>)  &quot;Establishes St. Patrick&apos;s day as a school holiday for all city school districts of one million or more with an Irish-American population of 7.5% or more.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628074620/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/n-y-senate-backs-st-patrick-day-school-holiday-article-1.2567613">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Sen. Tony Avella says he introduced the bill after a constituent, a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, approached him. The Queens Democrat says lawmakers set the precedent two years ago, authorizing schools to designate the Chinese Lunar New Year as a holiday when observances would keep most students home.&quot;</p>

<p>The movement to make the Lunar New Year a holiday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628074620/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/23/mayor_bloomberg_not_lion_around.php">started back in 2010</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628074620/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/lunar_new_year_nyc_holiday.php">passed last year</a>, which means it was observed for the first time this year. The Muslim holidays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628074620/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/04/muslim_holidays_nyc_school.php">Eid al-Adha and al-Fitr were also</a> added to the NYC public schools&apos; holiday list last year.</p>
