<p>The police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222161815/http://breakingnews.nypost.com/dynamic/stories/M/MARIJUANA_PACKAGES?SITE=NYNYP&amp;SECTION=HOME">were tracking 417 pounds of marijuana</a>--32 pounds had been addressed to Calvo&apos;s wife Trinity Tomsic.  Calvo&apos;s mother-in-law asked the deliveryman (really an undercover cop) to leave the package on the porch. When Calvo returned home, he took the package in;per the Baltimore Sun, &quot;He changed clothes and walked the dogs, waving to the men and women sitting in cars near his home. He did not know they were police.&quot;  When he got back home, a SWAT team stormed his house.  </p>

<p>They shot 7-year-old dog Payton, handcuffed his mother-in-law (making her lie next to the dead dog), shot 4-year-old dog Chase in the back and then handcuffed Calvo.  Tomsic, who wasn&apos;t present, said, &quot;They were my kids. All I could see was the blood and the tissue of the dogs&quot;--the police apparently tracked the dogs&apos; blood through the house.  The police also claim they had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222161815/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-knock_warrant">no-knock warrant</a>, but Calvo and his lawyer dispute that.  The police did arrest two men involved with the drug ring, who would take the packages from porches.</p>

<p>In NYC, residents have had to deal with no-knock raids stemming from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222161815/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/19/police_informant_had_bad_informatio.php">bad information</a>.  Back in 2003, a 57-year-old Harlem grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222161815/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E7DC1630F93AA15753C1A9659C8B63">died when the police mistakenly stormed her home</a> in a no-knock raid.</p>
