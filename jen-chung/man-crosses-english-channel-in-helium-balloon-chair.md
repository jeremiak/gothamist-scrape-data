Jonathan Trappe, 36, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826222604/http://blogs.abcnews.com/theworldnewser/2010/05/up-and-away-man-crosses-english-channel-with-helium-balloons.html">explained his fanciful plan</a>, &quot;Didn&apos;t you have this dream, grabbing on to a bunch of balloons and floating off?  think it&apos;s something that&apos;s shared across cultures and across borders -- just this wonderful fantasy of grabbing on to toy balloons and floating into open space.&quot;  ABC News says, &quot;He took navigation equipment, tracking devices and an oxygen system along for the ride, which was approved by aviation officials.&quot; Trappe, who previously traveled 109 miles over NC, left Kent, England and ended up in a French cabbage patch. </p>
