title: Joe Namath Worries Rex Ryan's Ego Is Ruining The Jets

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_09_namatharyan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124756im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_09_namatharyan.jpg" width="331" height="348" class="image-left"> </span>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124756/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/last_nights_action_giants_over_eagl.php">Sunday&apos;s debacle in Oakland</a>, Jets fans have been wringing their hands over Gang Green&apos;s prospects.  And Jets legend Joe Namath weighed in on ESPN Radio yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124756/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2011/09/27/2011-09-27_joe_no_talk_on_broadway.html">questioning coach Rex Ryan&apos;s tactics</a>, &quot;I think these guys might be believing that they&apos;re better than they are. Rex has been the only coach that we know, in maybe the history of the game that I&apos;m familiar with, that keeps continually telling his guys how good they are. And they have been pretty good - pretty good - but they haven&apos;t won a championship yet.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124756/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7023925/joe-namath-rex-ryan-odds-new-york-jets-preparation">Namath also said</a>, &quot;It starts at the top. Coach Rex Ryan I think has been doing a great job getting the team to two (AFC) Championship Games. But if there&apos;s one thing about the athlete, if you keep telling him how good he is, he&apos;s going to start believing it, to the point that he may not be preparing not quite the way he should. He may be losing some respect for the other team.&quot; Namath has a point, but Ryan has been bragging and blustering about the team since Day 1, so it&apos;s not anything new.</p>

<p>Ryan said after hearing about Namath&apos;s remarks, &quot;I&apos;m not gonna change who I am because Joe Namath said something. Joe Namath can come in here, and if he can still throw, we&apos;ll have him as a backup quarterback. He doesn&apos;t know our team. He&apos;s on the outside. Even though he&apos;s a Jet, and once you&apos;re a Jet you&apos;re always a Jet ... but he&apos;s on the outside, he&apos;s not in these meetings. I think if he was he&apos;d be shocked at the preparation.&quot; He added, &quot;I&apos;m confident with our football team. There&apos;s no question about it. And, I&apos;ve told you this many times, I&apos;ve never gone into a game that I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d win. I haven&apos;t won them all, but I certainly think we can and will.&quot;  Plus, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124756/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/02/in_which_rex_ryan_tells_the_world_w.php">he has a new calf tattoo</a>.</p>

<p>Also: We applaud the Daily News for referencing Namath&apos;s drunken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124756/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2003-12-23-namath-apology_x.htm">attempt to kiss ESPN&apos;s Suzy Kolber</a> with their sports cover:</p>
