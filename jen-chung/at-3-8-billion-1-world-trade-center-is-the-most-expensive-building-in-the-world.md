<p>As One World Trade Center has passed the 90th floor of its construction, it&apos;s reached another milestone: It&apos;s now costing more than $3.8 billion.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119102113/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203920204577191371172049652.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal reports </a>that it&apos;s the &quot;world&apos;s most expensive new office tower, according to people familiar with the matter. The new figure [is] up $700 million from the latest public estimate.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119102113/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/18/silverstein_port_authority_squabble.php">drama around the construction</a> of the former Freedom Tower has played out over the previous years, most recently with the building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119102113/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/12/one_world_trade_center_scraps_its_s.php">scrapping its shimmering bottom</a> (it was replaced with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119102113/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20111115/REAL_ESTATE/111119917">less expensive option</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119102113/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/its_official_conde_nast_will_move_t.php">attracting big name tenants</a>, with the help of real estate developer Durst.  And the Port Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119102113/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/port_authority_approves_less_insane.php">has raised tolls</a>, but claims none of the increase will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119102113/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/new_world_trade_center_tower_w.html">go towards the building&apos;s construction</a>.</p>

<p>According to the WSJ, &quot;One World Trade Center&apos;s construction is vastly more expensive than a traditional office tower, in large part due to security costs associated with building the tallest building in North America on a site that has been the target of two separate terrorist attacks (the site was also bombed in 1993). Once known as the Freedom Tower, the 1,776-foot skyscraper sits atop a heavily reinforced, windowless podium. It also has a thick core of concrete and steel around its elevator shafts. By comparison, other-high profile buildings around the world have been far less expensive. <strong>The developer of the Burj Khalifa, the world&apos;s tallest tower, in Dubai, has put its cost at $1.5 billion.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The  Regional Plan Association&apos;s Robert Yaro explains why the Port Authority isn&apos;t expecting to make a profit, &quot;It was as much about making a political statement as it was an economic decision,. This is not a project that&apos;s standing on its own&#x2014;it was never intended to be.&quot;</p>
