<p>Avonte Oquendo has been missing for two weeks. The last time anyone saw the 14-year-old boy was when he was at his school in Queens&#x2014;a surveillance video shows him leaving the Center Boulevard School at 1-50 51 Avenue on Friday, October 4th. Now, the NYPD has released an image of the exact shirt that Avonte was wearing, in hopes it&apos;ll help spark someone in the public to notice or remember something.</p>

<p>Avonte has autism and cannot communicate verbally. The previous three times he went missing, he was found in the subway system, sometimes on the tracks, which has prompted the MTA to ask all subway workers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051044/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/mta-suspends-subway-work-find-missing-boy-article-1.1483451">help search for him last week</a>. The MTA also is making announcements on subways, asking riders to notify the NYPD if they seeing or know anything. </p>

<p>Avonte&apos;s family has criticized a school security agent for not stopping him from fleeing the school. But Kelly defended her, &quot;We have spoken to the school safety agent, who was on duty at the front door. We have looked at the videotape. She directs the young man to go back upstairs. She is at the front door. He goes down the hallway, actually exits the building from the side door. We see nothing at this juncture that shows that the conduct of the schools safety agent was inappropriate or there was any misconduct involved.&quot; </p>

<p>Avonte&apos;s older brother told WABC 7, &quot;Even if she did say something to Avonte, you would probably have to do more than just say something. Should probably have contacted the parents and police immediately not later.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051044/http://www.ny1.com/content/news/190642/police-hope-new-methods-will-locate-missing-autistic-queens-teen">lawyer for the family said</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t want to cast stones without knowing, but the fact that he got away from that class and got downstairs means somebody was not looking and not watching, because otherwise, it wouldn&apos;t have happened.&quot;</p>
