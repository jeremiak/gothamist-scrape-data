										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2014_11_njcop1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011750im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_11_njcop1.jpg" width="300" height="430"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block">Officer Jason Miller</i></div> A NJ police department is investigating one of its own over disturbing claims that the officer would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011750/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/police-officer-exposes-himself-to-male-drivers-576213">unzip his pants during traffic stops</a> with young men and expose himself. The Sussex County Prosecutor&apos;s Office affidavit states that there&apos;s evidence that Newton cop Jason Miller&apos;s &quot;pants were opened and/or his genitals were exposed and/or a zipper can be heard opening or closing.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011750/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/police-officer-exposes-himself-to-male-drivers-576213">According to the Smoking Gun</a>, the affidvit says &quot;Miller exposed himself during &apos;numerous&apos; late-night traffic stops to &apos;satisfy his prurient interests.&apos; He then allowed the male motorists to leave without traffic summonses, though, in some instances, he was aware the driver had been drinking or that a vehicle&#x2019;s registration and insurance were expired.&apos;&quot; He would also allegedly follow the drivers! For instance:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;K.K.,&#x201D; a 23-year-old driver, told police that he was recently stopped by a Newton officer while driving a male friend home after a late night out. The officer, &#x201C;K.K.&#x201D; said, &#x201C;asked him if he noticed the officer&#x2019;s zipper was down.&#x201D; The driver said no. After the traffic stop was completed, the man dropped his friend off and continued driving.<p></p>

<p>It was then that the driver realized he was being followed by the same officer who had pulled him over. The cop eventually pulled up alongside &#x201C;K.K.&#x201D; and motioned for him to roll down his window. &#x201C;The officer again asked him if he noticed that the officer had his fly down. K.K. again told him no,&#x201D; according to the affidavit. &#x201C;The officer asked him if the person he was dropping off was his boyfriend. K.K. told him no, and then told him that he has a girlfriend.&#x201D; The cop--whom investigators have identified as Miller--then &#x201C;told him to have a good night and left the area.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>When the Newton Police Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011750/https://www.facebook.com/NEWTON.POLICE.NJ/posts/1235837483112567">posted on Facebook that Miller had been arrested</a>, one man, David Santana, commented, &quot;He beat my wife along with his partner. This was coming to him I&apos;m glad the police dept did something about it and I hope the other one is also found guilty for what he did to my family.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Apparently while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011750/http://www.nj.com/sussex-county/index.ssf/2014/11/newton_cop_accused_of_exposing_himself_also_accused_of_beating_woman_during_arrest.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Santana was at the Newton Medical Center ER</a>, his wife Emily Blohm refused to leave and police responded &quot;at the request of the hospital staff for a report of a female out of control and refusing to leave the emergency room.&quot; Police said &quot;she became disorderly and resisted patrols attempts to handcuff her and to remove her.&quot; Miller&apos;s lawyer Anthony J.Iacullo said, &quot;The actions taken by Officer Miller relating to the arrest of this woman constituted a proper use of force and were necessary under the circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the public lewdness charges, Iacullo said, &quot;Officer Miller is an excellent officer who vehemently denies these allegations, as they are false and baseless.&quot;</p>
