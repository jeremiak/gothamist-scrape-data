One of the officers suffered a minor injury. The chopper was carrying a three-man flight crew and two scuba divers who were on a routine security patrol. Flotation devices were deployed before it landed in the bay.&quot; It&apos;s unclear what caused the emergency landing, but last year, NYPD choppers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801222613/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/05/nypd_choppers_emergency_landing_at.php">made emergency landings</a> in Maspeth, Queens and Brooklyn&apos;s Prospect Park.</p>
