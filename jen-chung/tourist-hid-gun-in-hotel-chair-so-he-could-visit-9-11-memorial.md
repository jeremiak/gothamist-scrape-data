It turns out the idiot was headed to the 9/11 Memorial.</p>

<p>The police had said that on Sunday, a man walked into the Club Quarters Hotel at 144 Washington Street and placed a &quot;loaded handgun in a chair cushion and left the location.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163749/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hidden_gun_trick_fails_55mgczBz2D5oPAQiMY64KM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">The Post reports</a> that it was a &quot;clueless tourist claiming to be a cop asked 9/11 Memorial security if he could bring in&quot; his .22-caliber gun. It was discovered by someone who sat in the chair.</p>

<p>Of course, the 9/11 Memorial staff said no&#x2014;a woman from Tennessee was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/dont_bring_your_gun_to_the_911_memo.php">actually arrested</a> for bringing her handgun to the memorial in 2011. That set off a debate about whether <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/31/after_911_memorial_gun_arrest_ny_po.php">NY gun laws are too strict</a>, because out-of-state tourists would need to get a permit to carry a gun if visiting here.</p>
