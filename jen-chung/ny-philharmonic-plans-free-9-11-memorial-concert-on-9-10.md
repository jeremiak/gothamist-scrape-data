<p>Weeks after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154341/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/ny_philharmonic_cancels_park_perfor.php">canceling its free parks performances</a> this summer, the NY Philharmonic has announced that it will give a free concert to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. According to the NY Times, the Philharmonic will perform Mahler&#x2019;s Symphony No. 2, the &#x201C;Resurrection,&#x201D; at Avery Fisher Hall... but the concert will really be on September 10.</p>

<p>The Times reports, &quot;The concert will be broadcast live on the radio and projected on a screen in Lincoln Center&#x2019;s plaza. It will actually take place at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 10, and be rebroadcast on PBS the next evening. Philharmonic officials described the concert as a gift to the city, but they also acknowledged that the planning for it, as well as a decision to perform on Sept. 15 in Central Park with the tenor Andrea Bocelli, had contributed to the absence this summer of the orchestra&#x2019;s traditional, beloved concerts in the parks, which normally take place in mid-July.&quot;</p>

<p>Originally, the Philharmonic wanted to give a free 9/11 memorial concert in Central Park, but then Bocelli and his team proposed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154341/http://www.bocellicentralpark.com/">Central Park concert</a>, which the Philharmonic would play at (and it would be paid for).  Philharmonic president Zarin Mehta told the Times, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t think there was a conflict. One was on the 10th, and one was on the 15th... At that stage, the enormity of the Bocelli production was not known,&quot; adding the Bocelli concert made &quot;good economic sense.&quot;</p>
