He was asked about Vice President Joe Biden&apos;s initial suggestion that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140929014530/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/30/amtrak_joe_biden_says_avoid_planes.php">people avoid time in confined spaces</a>, like planes or subways, given the swine flu.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140929014530/http://www.politickerny.com/3325/bloomberg-biden-traveling-train">PolitickerNY took video</a> (below) and reports, &quot;Seeking to downplay Biden&apos;s concerns, Bloomberg went as far to ask reporters to film him arriving at City Hall by train.&quot;  During a press conference, Bloomberg said, &quot;<strong>I took the subway here&#x2014;I take the subway everyday</strong>&quot; and then pointed out that over 3 million people take the subway every day, many of them take it several times. &quot;It is a place where people get to together. I think what&apos;s clear is that this flu doesn&apos;t seem to be taking over the city and there&apos;s no evidence that being on the subway in a confined space would increase [the probability of getting the flu]. I don&apos;t see people coughing and sneezing on the subway&quot;&#x2014;seriously?&#x2014;&quot;<strong>The bottom line is  I feel perfectly safe</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, Bloomberg did say that Biden was &quot;right&quot; to remind Americans they should be careful and gave the VP an assist by clarifying, &quot;If you have these symptoms, we recommend you stay home.&quot;</p>

<p>As for NYC swine flu stats so far, the city says there are 49 confirmed cases and 16 probable ones.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140929014530/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/98252/health-officials--swine-flu-continues-to-spread--most-cases-mild/Default.aspx">NY1 reports</a>, &quot;47 of the cases are linked to St. Francis Prep School in Fresh Meadows, Queens. The other two are connected to travel to Mexico, where the outbreak began... Out of the 16 cases under investigation, five are connected to St. Francis and another five are connected to P.S. 177, which is also located in Fresh Meadows.&quot;</p>
