In 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228143209/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/26/police_under_fi.php">Bell was killed</a> and two of his friends were injured when undercover police fired upon their car, thinking they were armed (they weren&apos;t). Yesterday, Sharpton, who was joined by City Councilman and City Comptroller-elect John Liu, said, &quot;This has something to do with our community embracing and using as example a young man that was on his way to doing what was right and his community rallied around him. That&apos;s what streets are named for.&quot;</p>
