<p>One person on line said, &quot;Some belligerent guy in the front of the line tried to bum-rush the door. He started yelling and then somebody else started yelling and before you knew it, the crowd was rushing toward the store.There was no way to control that chaos. It was a mob riot. The cops came after a few minutes and started Macing people. I thought to myself, &#x2018;Somebody&#x2019;s going to get killed over these sneakers!&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Supreme shut things down later into the evening, announcing: &quot;Due to concern for public safety, NYPD has forced us to not sell the Supreme/Nike Foamposites and accompanying clothing in our New York Store. These items will be available on supremenewyork.com tomorrow at 11am EST.&quot;</p>

High performance met an unorthodox appearance with a game-changing shell-like exterior, inspired by a molded sunglass case made of EVA foam. The first Nike Air Foamposite 1s were released in iridescent colors to showcase the innovative features and revolutionary seamless build of the shoe.<p></p>

<p>Since it&apos;s [<em>sic</em>] debut, the Nike Air Foamposite 1 has transcended basketball courts and influenced the streets of global metropolitan culture. The Supreme Nike Air Foamposite 1 will feature a custom print offered in two color ways. A custom basketball jersey and short will be offered in two color ways. </p></blockquote>Reached for comment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406051025/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/askanativenewyorker">Native New Yorker</a>/revolutionary theorist Jake Dobkin says, &quot;Sneakers are one of the main tools capitalism uses to distract young minority men from revolting against the oppression they experience daily.&quot; As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406051025/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNail6JjEiE&amp;feature=kp">Fugazi so memorably put it</a>, &quot;Merchandise keeps us in line / Common sense says it&apos;s by design / What could a businessman ever want more than to have us sucking in his store?&quot;<p></p>
