<p>A car caught fire on the Grand Central Parkway this afternoon, leaving behind a long trail of flames alongside the highway.

<p><strong>Update, 5:40 p.m.</strong>: According to the NYPD, a 2010 Toyota Highlander was traveling eastbound on the Grand Central when it ran over a piece of metal in the roadway, which caused an ignition of the gas tank.  The 26-year-old driver and 25-year-old front seat passenger escaped with minor injuries, while the backseat passenger&#x2014;a 50-year-old male&#x2014;was found DOA.
