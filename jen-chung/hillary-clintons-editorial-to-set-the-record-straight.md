<p><img alt="2008_05_clinwhy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_05_clinwhy.jpg" width="250" height="306" class="left">After her poorly received use of Robert Kennedy&apos;s 1968 assassination as why she is staying in the hunt, Hillary Clinton has written an editorial for the Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/05/25/2008-05-25_hillary_why_i_continue_to_run.html">to apologize and re-assert why she&apos;s sticking it out</a>.  </p>

<p>She reiterates her apology, saying she was &quot;<strong>making the simple point that given our history, the length of this year&apos;s primary contest is nothing unusual</strong>&quot;--she has, at least twice, pointed out that her husband didn&apos;t clinch the 1992 nomination until June and that RFK was assassinated in June after the California primary. </p>

<p>However, some critics have argued this year&apos;s primaries have started much earlier than in years past, Bill Clinton was way ahead in 1992 by the time June rolled around, and wonder she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438/http://www.slate.com/id/2173455/">didn&apos;t cite the long 1984 primary season</a>, instead of recalling a tragedy.  Still, a Daily News editorial from the paper says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/05/25/2008-05-25_the_hype_against_hillary.html">her remarks were simply &quot;inartful&quot;</a>: &quot;The popular vote and delegate count margins are as narrow as they get. <strong>Clinton has every right, even a responsibility to her supporters, to continue to make the case</strong> that she would be the stronger general election candidate against John McCain.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s an excerpt of Clinton&apos;s editorial:</p><blockquote>But I was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything I stand for - and everything I am fighting for in this election.<p></p>

<p>And today, I would like to more fully answer the question I was asked: Why do I continue to run, even in the face of calls from pundits and politicians for me to leave this race?</p>

<p>I am running because I still believe I can win on the merits. Because, with our economy in crisis, our nation at war, the stakes have never been higher - and the need for real leadership has never been greater - and I believe I can provide that leadership. </p></blockquote>In a column today, the NY Times&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/opinion/25dowd.html?ref=opinion">Maureen Dowd declares</a> &quot;something caused Hillary&#x2019;s inner Eve Harrington to leap out in South Dakota&quot; and calls her remarks &quot;tasteless.&quot;  The Daily News&apos; Michael Goodwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/05/25/2008-05-25_hillary_clinton_is_her_own_worst_enemy.html">says Clinton is &quot;her own worst enemy&quot;</a> and writes, &quot;She&apos;s now so toxic she&apos;s probably doomed any hope of being named Obama&apos;s running mate. He didn&apos;t want her to start with; now he won&apos;t have to take her.  And, for the Wall Street Journal, former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121148557268715077.html?mod=todays_columnists">slams Clinton&apos;s excuse &quot;that sexism did her in.&quot;</a><p></p>

<p>And though RFK Jr. thought that Clinton&apos;s remark mentioning his father&apos;s death was a mistake, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705064438/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05252008/news/nationalnews/kennedys_feel_bobby_socked_112469.htm">other Kennedys are upset</a>.</p>
