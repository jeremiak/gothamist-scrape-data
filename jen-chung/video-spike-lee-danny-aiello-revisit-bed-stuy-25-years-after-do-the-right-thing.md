<p>In June, Spike Lee celebrated the 25th anniversary of his groundbreaking film, <em>Do The Right Thing</em>, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014351/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/29/photos_dave_chappelle_wesley_snipes.php#photo-18">big block party in Bedford-Stuyvesant</a>. Now it turns out that was part of a short documentary, produced by Beats, that features Lee, Danny Aiello, production designer Wynn Thomas and others reminisce about the film.</p>

<p>The trio walk around Bed-Stuy, noting where various locales from the film were (Sal&apos;s Famous Pizzeria was built in an empty lot) and the window on Stuyvesant Avenue where Ruby Dee&apos;s character, Mother Sister, sat. And they also note that Clifton, the asshole who scuffs Buggin&apos; Out&apos;s Jordans, was likely the start of gentrification way back when. Guess Spike Lee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014351/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/26/spike_lee_goes_off_about_the_mother.php"><em>is</em> the gentrification expert</a>!</p>

<p>Aiello recounts how he met Lee at &quot;Madonna&apos;s party&quot; (Aiello played her father in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014351/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkxqxWgEEz4">&quot;Papa Don&apos;t Preach&quot; video</a>)&#x2014;Lee told him that he had a script for him, but Aiello didn&apos;t know who Lee was.</p>
