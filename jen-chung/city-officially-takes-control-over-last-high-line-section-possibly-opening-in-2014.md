</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005739/http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=B9B4568F-C29C-7CA2-FDB0D0141E1665F8">New York City officially acquired</a> the third and final  part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005739/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">High Line</a> from CSX Transportation, which owned the one-half mile part of the old elevated railroad that snakes around the West Side Rail Yards.  Mayor Bloomberg crowed that it was &quot;a monumental step toward our goal of opening the entire elevated railway to the public. In the three short years since the first section opened as a park, the High Line has become a treasured neighborhood oasis, a significant generator of economic activity for the entire city, and a celebrated icon for planners, designers, and leaders around the world. Transforming the final section of the elevated railway into public space will complete the vision - something that seemed all but impossible just over ten years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Construction will start at the end of this year and be completed next year... and then the opening will be in 2014.  Above are a few renderings of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005739/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/13/have_a_look_at_the_next_phase_of_th.php">proposed third phase</a>, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005739/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/the_high_line_phase_iii.php#photo-9">some recent photos</a>. </p>
