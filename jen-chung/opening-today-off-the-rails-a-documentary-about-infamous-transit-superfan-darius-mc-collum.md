</div></div>					<p>You may think you love NYC&apos;s mass transit system, but you don&apos;t love it the way Darius McCollum does. McCollum, 51, is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/15/darius_mccollum_counter_terrorism.php">NYC legend</a> because he&apos;s been arrested nearly three dozen times for stealing subways and buses since 1980, which was when, at age 15, he <em>took</em> an E train downtown from 34th Street to World Trade Center. Today, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://www.offtherailsmovie.com/">Off the Rails</a></em>, a documentary offering a window into his obsessive love and whether authorities overreacted to it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://metrograph.com/film/film/539/off-the-rails">opens at the Metrograph</a>. </p>

<p>Director Adam Irving portrays McCollum as a non-violent man with autism who gets locked up (for over half his life) instead of getting treatment. &quot;The Asperger&apos;s [syndrome] added this childlike innocence to his crimes,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://nypost.com/2016/11/17/meet-new-yorks-beloved-mass-transit-bandit/">Irving told the NY Post</a>. &quot;Why would someone pretend to drive a bus? You&apos;ve got to make the stops, make all the announcements. It&apos;s not, like, a pleasurable thing. Who would do that for free?&quot; </p>

<p><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/160158306?color=ffbf00&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>McCollum&apos;s ability to break in and gain access to equipment and even take them for a ride has embarrassed transit agencies too many times. He&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://gothamist.com/2004/06/14/subway_stealing_legend_arrested_again.php">arrested in LIRR yards</a> while carrying various transit keys (engineer, universal, and switch), transit worker&apos;s clothes, and a hard hat. But McCollum&apos;s legal team has suggested that the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/15/darius_mccollum_counter_terrorism.php">use him as a consultant</a>, to help the agency better secure its equipment. </p>

<p>Since he was a child, McCollum was interested in subways and buses. When he was 12, he befriended subway motormen in Queens, who showed him a new world. McCollum&apos;s mother, who now lives in North Carolina, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/07/1_subway_fan_darius_mccollum_arrest.php">has previously said</a> she has warned him from going back to NYC and its tempting mass transit system, but, &quot;He&apos;s a lover of New York and can&apos;t get over it.&quot;</p>

<p>McCollum is currently being held at Rikers  for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012710/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/12/bus_thief_busted.php">stealing a Greyhound bus</a> from the Port Authority Bus Terminal last year. He told the Post from jail that he&apos;s asked for therapy but can&apos;t get that there. &quot;I just hope people ride the MTA in the safest manner possible. The main thing I want people to understand is that even though I&apos;m here, I have never given up my love for the MTA,&quot; he said.</p>
