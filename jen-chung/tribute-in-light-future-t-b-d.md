<p>It&apos;s arguably one of the most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221357/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/10/nycs_september_11_commemoration_pla.php">beloved ways</a> the city remembers the September 11, 2001 attacks&#x2014;the Tribute in Light, which has beacons of light shimmer from lower Manhattan into the sky starting at dusk on September 11 and fading away at dawn on September 12.  But the funding for the installation has run out!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221357/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/tribute_in_light_due_to_dim_out_COhbdg5TgKuHUsYoWcc13H">Post reports</a>, &quot;The World Trade Center&apos;s annual Tribute in Light could go dark next September... A $3 million grant from the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. to run the beloved tribute expired last year.&quot; Earlier this month, Frank Sanchis, senior vice president at the Municipal Art Society (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221357/http://mas.org/tribute-in-light-and-engaging-lower-manhattan/">MAS</a> and Creative Time brought the designers of the tribute together) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221357/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/dress-rehearsal-in-light/?scp=1&amp;sq=%22tribute%20in%20light%22&amp;st=cse">told City Room</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m hopeful that, working with the L.M.D.C., we can find the funding to do it in 2009.&quot;  </p>

<p>We&apos;re hopeful too&#x2014;the Tribute in Light is part of the commemoration fabric and we can&apos;t imagine an anniversary without it.</p>
