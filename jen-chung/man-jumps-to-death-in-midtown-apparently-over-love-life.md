<p>The teen ended up on the sidewalk.  The scene remained blocked off for hours, and witnesses could see a big dent in the bus&apos;s roof.  One told us that the police used a restaurant&apos;s barriers to cordon off the body&#x2014;and the barriers happened to say &quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot;  </p>

<p>Apparently the teen was &quot;distraught over a recent breakup,&quot; per the News&apos; sources.  </p>
