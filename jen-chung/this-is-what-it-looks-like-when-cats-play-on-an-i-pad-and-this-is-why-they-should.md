<p>I&apos;m the person at the restaurant who is always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905200928/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/22/restaurant_phone_etiquette.php">letting her kid play with an iPhone or an iPad</a> in hopes of keeping the peace, and even though my cats are not dining out with us, they&apos;re also allowed some screen time back at home. How? I have apps on my iPad for my cats, too. Because. Why. Not.</p>

<p>I didn&apos;t even get through the entire &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905200928/http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/29/tech/games-for-cats-and-dogs-feat/">Why your cat needs an iPad</a>&quot; headline before I transformed my family&apos;s home into a cat cafe-meets-Apple Store. </p>

<p>What I&apos;ve noticed since introducing the screens to my cats is that my sweet, shy and rather dumb cat really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905200928/https://www.instagram.com/p/_aiT36tl71/">enjoys iPad games</a> so maybe she&apos;s not so stupid&#x2014;maybe she&apos;s just a nerd who needed an outlet?</p>

<p>For confirmation on this, I turned to veterinarian Dr. Peter Soboroff of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905200928/http://www.newyorkcathospital.com/">New York Cat Hospital</a>, who spoke with me about technology and felines&#x2014;overall, he&apos;s enthusiastic about The Future (and our future cat overlords).</p>
