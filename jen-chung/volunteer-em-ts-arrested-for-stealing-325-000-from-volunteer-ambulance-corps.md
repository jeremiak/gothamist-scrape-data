<p>Three volunteer EMTs at a Queens volunteer ambulance group have been charged with grand larceny for allegedly stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the non-profit&#x2014;and then using it for their own personal use, like trips to Disney World. NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman slammed the men for using the funds as their &quot;own personal piggy bank.&quot;</p>

<p>Daniel Dominguez, 37, was the board member and treasurer of the Corona Community Volunteer Ambulance Corps, and his position as treasurer gave him access to the bank accounts. Schneiderman&apos;s office claims that Dominguez transferred over $300,000 to his own account, and &quot;then used that money for extravagant jaunts to Walt Disney World and Niagara Falls, as well as purchases of luxury car service trips and fancy meals.&quot;</p>

<p>Dominguez also allegedly helped another board member, Daryl Adeva, to transfer nearly $9,000 into Adeva&apos;s accounts. And then-board member and CCAC president David Moretti is also accused of taking more than $11,000, via &quot;wire transfers, cash withdrawals and unauthorized credit card purchases.&quot;</p>

But Adeva&apos;s mother isn&apos;t helping his case, telling the News, &quot;Dan [Dominguez], every time I see him, he has a nice car. My son has the car my grandma gave him as a gift. It&#x2019;s in pieces, a 1999 Toyota Camry. Someone who stole money, I don&#x2019;t think, would be driving that.&quot;<br>
