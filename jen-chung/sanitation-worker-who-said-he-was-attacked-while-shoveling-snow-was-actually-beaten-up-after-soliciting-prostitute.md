<p>Yesterday morning, a sanitation worker told the police that he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063919/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160127/jamaica/sanitation-worker-pistol-whipped-robbed-while-cleaning-jamaica-streets">pistol-whipped and robbed</a> while shoveling snow in Queens. By the evening, police had arrested him for filing a false police report after they determined he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063919/http://nypost.com/2016/01/28/beaten-sanitation-worker-was-actually-trying-to-pick-up-a-hooker/">beaten up after trying to solicit prostitute</a>. While on-duty. </p>

<p>Michael Morelli, 31, had told cops that two men attacked him and took his cell phone while he was removing snow from a fire hydrant at Liberty Avenue and Guy Brewer Boulevard. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063919/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sanitation-worker-pistol-whipped-mugged-queens-article-1.2511550">The Daily News reports</a> that his story &quot;fell apart when someone found his phone and turned it in.&quot; Morelli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063919/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160127/jamaica/sanitation-worker-who-claimed-he-was-pistol-whipped-made-it-up-police-say">reportedly admitted</a> to investigators that he was attacked by two men after trying to solicit a prostitute. The assailants&apos; connection to the prostitute is unclear.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063919/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Sanitation-Worker-Arrested-Lied-Pistol-Whipped-Robbed-Clearing-Snow-Queens-366789581.html">NBC New York spoke</a> to Morelli&apos;s girlfriend, Jaclyn Francin, and her father Rudy, shortly after the initial report that he was attacked while working. She said, &quot;Anytime you get called in the middle of the night, the first thing you&apos;re concerned about is safety&#x2014;is he OK, is he alive, what actually went down? So of course I was terrified.&quot; Her father added, &quot;Comes in, working like 14 hours a day, leaves 7 at night, comes back in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>NBC New York also reported, &quot;When reached on the phone for comment after Morelli&apos;s arrest, Rudy Francin was in shock and said he couldn&apos;t believe it. He declined further comment.&quot;</p>

<p>On Facebook, Jaclyn Francin later wrote, &quot;Apparently responsible journalism isn&apos;t a requirement for the media today- as long as those political hire ups are satisfied and wrote the script themselves - obscene isn&apos;t even part of it.&quot; She also posted this image:</p>

<p>Morelli was charged with filing a false report and received a desk appearance ticket.</p>
