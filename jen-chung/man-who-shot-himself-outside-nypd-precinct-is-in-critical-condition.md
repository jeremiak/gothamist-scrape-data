Apparently the man, Anthony Alexander, 32, who is at Kings County Hospital in critical condition, was &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050710/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/zoom_boom_Av2fZ7pBZ2ichmYqo0GPXJ">distraught over an alleged domestic-violence probe.</a>&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050710/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/zoom_boom_Av2fZ7pBZ2ichmYqo0GPXJ">According to the Post&apos;s sources</a>, &quot;Alexander was arrested on March 16 on misdemeanor charges of choking and beating his girlfriend, sources said. His girlfriend, identified by sources as 27-year-old Keisha Darnley, broke off the relationship and had an order of protection against Alexander, the sources said.&quot; Earlier on Friday, the police from the 81st had responded to a domestic violence call from her, and, after apparently learning that there was an investigation, Alexander told Darnley &quot;he planned to kill himself at the 81st Precinct, sources said. Darnley then called the precinct to warn police of her ex&#x2019;s deadly plans.&quot; </p>

<p>A Daily News source said, &#x201C;(The girlfriend) had just called to say he was coming. While she was on the phone, he drove in.&quot; Alexander sped into the lot, crashing his Lexus RX350 into a police van and then fired a 9mm gun, pointing up at his chin. Police also found a .22 caliber gun in his car.  Alexander&apos;s sister is also a police officer, but she&apos;s stationed at another precinct.</p>

<p>Alexander has been served time for first-degree robbrey, but a cousin told the Post, &quot;He&#x2019;s really not a bad guy,&quot; but she didn&apos;t know about any domestic incidents.</p>
