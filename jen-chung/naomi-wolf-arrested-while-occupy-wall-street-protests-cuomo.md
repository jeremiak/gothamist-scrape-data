<p>While members of Occupy Wall Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040513/http://twitter.com/#!/ANIMALNewYork/status/126421493042253824">were outside a Soho event</a> that Governor Cuomo was attending&#x2014;to protest his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040513/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/cuomo_compares_his_opposition_to_mi.php">refusal to reinstate the &quot;millionaires tax</a>&quot;&#x2014; the feminist author and activist Naomi Wolf was arrested.  </p>

<p>Firedoglake&apos;s Kevin Gosztola <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040513/http://twitter.com/#!/kgosztola/status/126436129955258368">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Naomi Wolf shows up to inform protesters confronting Cuomo they do not need permit for a megaphone.&quot;  Police claim that protesters can&apos;t be outside Skylight Soho (at 275 Hudson Street) because they need a street activities permit.  <a href="126463513207115776">New Yorkist reported</a>, &quot;Lt someone w/Manhattan South Precinct say people marching are obstructing pedi traffic. Naomi wolf talking, he said: &quot;tell it to the judge!&apos;&quot; ANIMAL NEW YORK <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040513/http://twitter.com/#!/ANIMALNewYork/status/126465579841363969">further explains</a>, &quot;NYPD told Naomi Wolf that they were going to arrest her for marching in front of Skylight Soho in violation of the event space&apos;s SAP permit.&quot; And so they arrested her. </p>

<p>What was the event? Apparently Cuomo was being given the &quot;Game Changer of the Year Award&quot; from the Huffington Post. Wolf, who contributes to the HuffPo, had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040513/http://twitter.com/#!/JoshHarkinson/status/126464955686977536">been attending the event</a>.  Now protesters are marching to the 1st Precinct, where Wolf has been taken.
