</div></div><p>Last night, the Tonys were held at the Beacon Theatre and best musical honors were bestowed upon <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051416/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/trey_parker_and_matt_stone_the_book.php">The Book of Mormon</a></em> while best play was the British import <em>War Horse</em>.  Best musical revival went to <em>Anything Goes</em> and Best play revival was <em>The Normal Heart</em>.  Best musical actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051416/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/sutton_foster_actor.php">Sutton Foster</a> (for <em>Anything Goes</em>) paid tribute to her dresser of nine years, while Best play actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051416/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/25/frances_mcdormand_actor.php">Frances McDormand</a> (for <em>Good People</em>) mused that the last time she was at the Beacon, she saw Gregg Allman. And host Neil Patrick Harris opened the show to tell America that theater is not just for gays anymore: </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not just for gays, the gays and the Jews,&quot; sang NPH. &quot;And cousins in from out of town you have to amuse. And the sad, embittered malcontents who write the reviews. And also foreign tourists and the beats of senior citizens and well-to-do suburbanites and liberal intellectuals. Oh, that group is only really Jews and homosexuals, I&apos;ve lost my train of thought, oh yes, it&apos;s not just for gays anymooooore.&quot;  Check out videos below, click through photos from the telecast, and see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051416/http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/winners.html">full list of the winners here</a>.</p>
