Okay, there&apos;s only one new detail about Robert &quot;Sandy&quot; Vietze&apos;s alleged pissing-while-in-a-passenger row on a JetBlue flight bound for JFK, but it&apos;s a big one:  The girl&apos;s dad says she wasn&apos;t peed upon.  <p></p>

<p>The folklore of the story is that Vietze, 18, got drunk on the Tuesday night flight from Portland, Oregon and later wandered over to where a sleeping tween was sitting and urinated on her, only for the girl&apos;s father to return from the lavatory and freak out at Vietze. It turns out that Vietze had at least five beers and two rum-and-Cokes before getting to the airport and now, the girl&apos;s family has released a statement through a lawyer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034504/http://www.oregonlive.com/beaverton/index.ssf/2011/08/drunken_teen_urinated_on_the_floor_not_on_girl_during_plane_ride_beaverton_family_says.html">which the Oregonian published</a>, &quot;While family members have cooperated with authorities in the investigation, they neither welcome nor encourage further publicity. The family&apos;s main concern is the welfare of their daughter.&quot;  </p>

<p>Vietze, a competitive skier, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034504/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/drunk_airplane_pisser_could_have_be.php">kicked off the U.S.&apos;s Alpine skiing development team </a>after the incident.  He faces a federal public indecency charge, which carries up to a year in prison if convicted.</p>
