Bear, the 6-year-old German shepherd partner of Police Officer Vincent Tieniber, patiently posed for photographs. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130626044528/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/nyregion/injured-making-an-arrest-bear-the-police-dog-becomes-a-line-of-duty-celebrity.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Bear stoically bore the regular tugs at his jowls as camera operators and inquisitive fellow officers leaned down to get a look at his cracked canine teeth.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130626044528/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/nypd-k-9-from-li-hurt-in-subway-fight-recovering-1.5523970">Tieniber declared,</a> &quot;He&apos;s fine. He&apos;s back to acting like a typical dog.&quot;</p>

<p>Tieniber and Bear were on the southbound 4 train platform at 59th Street and Lexington earlier this week helping out another transit officer trying to quell a group of women fighting. However, the alleged attacker, Ravenia Matos-Davis, ended up kicking Bear in the face twice. Tieniber was surprised, &quot;Ninety-nine percent of the time, when we come to the scene, people cooperate. No one really wants to be bit by a dog.&quot; He added, &quot;He was barking because she was very loud. When an individual escalates, a dog will escalate with her. They pretty much go on autopilot when there is a threatening situation. They handle it themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>Matos-Davis, 22, was charged with injuring a police animal, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration. As for Bear, he&apos;s getting his teeth capped and will just relax. Tieniber said, &quot;At home he&#x2019;s just like any other dog, hangs around, chews his toy, plays with kids&quot;&#x2014;Tieniber has two young children, ages 3 and 6&#x2014;&quot;But at work. he watches my back, and I watch his. That&#x2019;s pretty much the same with any K-9 handler around the world.&#x201D;</p>
