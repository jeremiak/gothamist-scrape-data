The beach had numerous signs noting there were no lifeguards on duty; there were three adults supervising the 24 students.  The DOE fired first-year teacher Erin Bailey and disciplined assistant principal Andrew Stillman and Principal Jose Maldonado-Rivera.<p></p>

Bailey&apos;s boyfriend - former teacher Joseph Garnevicus, 28 - went in Stillman&apos;s place, but couldn&apos;t swim.&quot; Also, &quot;There weren&apos;t specific permission slips, just &apos;blanket&apos; slips from the start of the year that didn&apos;t include swimming.&quot; The &quot;blanket slips&quot; were only for trips in Manhattan; instead of issuing a permission slip to parents, Stillman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074749/http://www.1010wins.com/Teacher-to-Be-Fired-in-Long-Beach-School-Trip-Drow/7690431">simply emailed them</a>, &quot;We&apos;re headed to the beach tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Both Stillman, who will be removed from his administrative position and &quot;demoted to a teaching position,&quot; and Maldonado-Rivera assumed there would be lifeguards at the beach.  The Times reports, &quot;The report describes a last-minute decision to send the class to the beach as a reward for raising money in a school walk-a-thon. Mr. Stillman chose Long Beach, he told investigators, because he had been there with his family and knew it was easy to get to on public transportation.&quot;</p>
