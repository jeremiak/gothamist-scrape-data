<p>Comedienne <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014017/http://gothamist.com/tags/joanrivers">Joan Rivers</a> is still hospitalized, and her daughter Melissa Rivers issued a statement yesterday: &quot;Thank you for your continued love and support. We are keeping our fingers crossed.&quot;</p>

<p>Rivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014017/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/28/joan_rivers_critical.php">went into cardiac arrest</a> during a surgical procedure on Thursday. She has reportedly been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014017/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/29/joan_rivers_put_in_medically-induce.php">placed in a medically-induced coma</a> at Mount Sinai Hospital, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014017/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/31/joan_rivers_reportedly_on_life_supp.php">some reports say she&apos;s on life support</a>.</p>

<p>Her former writing partner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014017/http://pagesix.com/2014/08/31/joan-rivers-laughed-about-little-procedure-the-night-before/?_ga=1.209887957.1965030224.1401028033">Jay Redack, told the Post</a> that she had discussed the surgery on Wednesday: &quot;She said her throat was bothering her for a long time. Her voice was getting more raspy, if that was possible. She said she was just going in for a little procedure in the morning, that was it... What&#x2019;s ironic is at dinner [Wednesday night], we were talking about who goes first. I&#x2019;ve know Joan so damn long. I said, &#x2018;Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ll leave you if I go first. What&#x2019;ll you leave me?&#x2019; She said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll think about it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014017/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/joan-rivers-brought-medically-induced-coma-source-article-1.1923394">According to the Daily News</a>, Rivers is undergoing a &quot;wake-up process&quot; from the coma, but a source said, &quot;There is real concern that the part of the brain that controls motor skills may have been compromised, leaving her as either a vegetable or in a wheelchair.&quot; The source added that the family might sue Yorkville Endoscopy, where Rivers was having the initial procedure: &quot;Shock and upset is turning to anger, and they are looking for someone to blame... An 81-year-old should not have that procedure as an outpatient. Very ill advised.&quot;</p>

<p>Rivers&apos; Fashion Police co-star George Kotsiopoulos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014017/http://www.eonline.com/news/574814/joan-rivers-still-hospitalized-daughter-melissa-rivers-shares-new-statement-and-fashion-police-co-stars-call-for-prayers">told E!,</a> &quot;Social media has really just been very supportive and I think that is important right now if we collectively we all just pray for Joan to be well and back and laughing with us very soon.&quot; He then mentioned her daughter and grandson: &quot;Melissa and Cooper need you. We all need you. The world needs you.&quot;</p>
