<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_espoir.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093421im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_espoir.jpg" width="240" height="254" class="image-left"> </span>A man who fell off the roof of his luxury Williamsburg rental building is now suing the property. But not because he forgot his keys, attempted to climb into his window (&quot;after a few drinks&quot;) and was injured when he fell onto a terrace.  It&apos;s because the building doesn&apos;t have a handicap-accessible elevator.</p>

He claims &quot;a building manager at The Espoir in Williamsburg told him to &apos;use the stairs&apos; to get to the main elevator. His Manhattan federal court suit seeks more than $200,000 in damages from the luxury rental building for allegedly violating the federal Fair Housing Act.&quot; </p>
