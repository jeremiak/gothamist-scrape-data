					<p>In a stroke of populism, Vogue has put Sports Illustrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204349/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/video_kate_uptons_2nd_sports_illust.php">swimsuit cover girl</a> Kate Upon on its June cover. There are many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204349/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/the-kate-effect-kate-uptons-first-vogue-cover/">editorial photographs of Upton taken by Mario Testino</a>&#x2014;and she wants everyone to know her boobs are &quot;natural&quot; and she loves her body.</p>

<p>Upton made the cover of the coveted SI Swimsuit issue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204349/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/video_kate_uptons_2nd_sports_illust.php">this year</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204349/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/kate_upton_lands_cover_of_sports_il.php#photo-1">last</a>&#x2014;and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204349/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/01/watch_kate_upton_do_cat_daddy_dance.php">Cat Daddy&apos;d her way</a> into cold bitter hearts. Of course, her curves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204349/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/terrible_pro-anorexic_website_body.php">made the pro-anorexia contingent upset</a>! The only Kate Upton thing people should be upset about is how she did not look as stunning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204349/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/photos_the_lamest_dresses_at_the_me.php#photo-">as she could at the Met&apos;s gala</a>&#x2014;HOW CAN ANYONE BE UPSET WHILE WATCHING THIS:</p>

<p>About her famous figure, Upton tells Vogue, &quot;The things that they&#x2019;re rejecting are things that I can&#x2019;t change. I can&#x2019;t change my bra size. They&#x2019;re natural! I can work out and I can stay healthy and motivated, but I can&#x2019;t change some things. I really just live my life. I love my body. It&#x2019;s what God gave me! I feel confident with myself, and if that inspires other women to feel confident with their bodies, great.&#x201D;</p>
