<p>Wall Street is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122146/http://www.cnbc.com/id/26770386">poised for a rally</a> as central banks around the world--from the U.S.&apos;s Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan (and others)--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122146/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/business/worldbusiness/19centbank.html">put more cash into the markets</a>.  Per the NY Times:</p><blockquote>The Fed said in a statement that it had authorized a $180 billion expansion of its temporary reciprocal currency arrangements, known as swap lines, to allow banks to borrow more dollars in markets at a lower rates...<p></p>

<p>The Fed also authorized increases in the existing swap lines with the European Central Bank, up to $110 billion from $55 billion, and the Swiss National Bank, up to $27 billion from $15 billion.</p>

<p>New swap facilities were established by the Fed with the Bank of Japan, for $60 billion; the Bank of England, for $40 billion; and the Bank of Canada for $10 billion.</p></blockquote>Barclays&apos; chief European economist Julian Callow said, &quot;This is clearly a very significant help and central banks are showing decisive leadership here as risk aversion is hitting the private sector.&quot;  Asian stocks fell, but European stocks gained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122146/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ahjf.hJtYWuM&amp;refer=home">upon news of the cash infusion</a>.<p></p>

<p>Still, the Wall Street Journal, dubbing this &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122146/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122169431617549947.html">Worst Crisis Since &apos;30s, With No End Yet in Sight</a>,&quot; said the crisis &quot;has entered a new, far more serious phase,&quot; noting the problem is beyond just subprime mortgage and there&apos;s a &quot;growing sense of wariness about the health of trading partners.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking of health, Morgan Stanley--&quot;one of the two last independent U.S.-based investment banks&quot;--is reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122146/http://www.cnbc.com/id/26771724">talking to Wachovia about merging</a>.  Morgan Stanley is also looking to raise cash from a Chinese bank.  And Washington Mutual will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122146/http://www.cnbc.com/id/26761181/site/14081545/">put itself up for auction</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122146/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/18wall.html?hp">NY Times has an article</a> about how Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs stock, in spite of reporting &quot;respectable profits,&quot; fell almost 25% and 14% respectively, &quot;underscor[ing] how quickly a sense of fear is spreading through Wall Street.&quot;</p>
