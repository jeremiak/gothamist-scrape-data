<p>The man who filmed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">police officer choking Staten Island man</a> to death last month was arrested on Saturday. In a statement released to the media last night, the NYPD announced that Ramsey Orta, 22, allegedly tried to hide a gun on a teen girl.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 9:45 p.m. on August 2, members of the &quot;Staten Island Narcotics Module&quot; saw Orta talking to a 17-year-old girl at Bay Street and Victory Boulevard. Cops say the pair walked into &quot;the Hotel Richmond, a known drug prone location, located at 71 Central Avenue. The two suspects are inside only for moments and then depart.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, police say, plainclothes cops with their shields out approached the two, but Orta slipped an item into the girl&apos;s waistband. The officers then &quot;took control of the two&quot; and found an unloaded .25 caliber Norton handgun on her. </p>

<p>Orta was charged with criminal possession of a weapon while the girl, Alba Lekaj, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon and unlawful possession of marijuana. Orta has been arrested numerous times, for assault, rape, robbery, menacing and more, and has &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/ramsey_ortas_family_questions.html#incart_m-rpt-1">three other criminal cases pending against him</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>Orta&apos;s family says he&apos;s been a target for the NYPD, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">sharing the distressing video he took of police officers</a> putting Eric Garner into a chokehold on July 17. Cops pulled Garner to the ground after he told them, &quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I&#x2019;m tired of it. It stops today!&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/080114garner.jpg"> <img alt="080114garner.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2014/08/080114garner-thumb-640x505-853607.jpg" width="300" height="236" class="image-right"> </a> </span>While on the ground, with cops pulling his arms behind his back and still in a chokehold, Garner repeatedly said, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe.&quot; Garner died at a hospital, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/eric_garners_death_ruled_a_homicide.php">his death was ruled a homicide</a>.</p>

<p>Orta&apos;s wife Chrissie Ortiz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/ramsey_ortas_family_questions.html#incart_m-rpt-1">told the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;They park across the street, they follow him. I&apos;m speaking [about] the NYPD. It&apos;s obvious. Once they rule this a homicide, now you all of a sudden find something on him? Come on, let&apos;s be realistic. Even the dumbest criminal would know not to be doing something like that outside. So the whole story doesn&apos;t fit at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Ortiz told the Post, &quot;I knew something like this was going to happen. Ever since he took that video the police have been targeting us, so I&#x2019;ve told him over and over: &#x2018;Keep your ass inside the house.&#x2019; If I find out that it&#x2019;s true that they came out of that hotel together, I&#x2019;m gonna beat his ass.&quot; Apparently Lekaj confessed that Orta sold her pot and they were going to a hotel to get high.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://nypost.com/2014/08/03/sharpton-wants-feds-on-chokehold-case-after-witness-arrest/">Post reports that when arrested</a>, Orta said to his wife during a phone call, &quot;I got arrested. Call Al Sharpton right away!&quot; and said to cops, &quot;You&#x2019;re only mad because I filmed your boy,&quot; referring to Officer Daniel Pantaleo who administered the prohibited chokehold. </p>

<p>One law enforcement source told the Post, &quot;Here&#x2019;s their star witness, and he&#x2019;s nothing but a criminal himself.&quot; Patrolmen&apos;s Benevolent Association president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/killed-eric-garner-distraught-article-1.1890415">Patrick Lynch crowed</a>, &quot;It is criminals like Mr. Orta who carry illegal firearms who stand to benefit the most by demonizing the good work of police officers.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD occasionally sends out detailed press releases regarding &quot;good arrests&quot; on weapons charges, so a press release of this nature, while somewhat rare, is not entirely uncommon.</p>

<p>Sharpton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514012427/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/04/man-who-shot-video-of-eric-garner-arrest-due-in-court-on-gun-charge/">said the arrest didn&apos;t matter</a>, telling the media, &quot;No one is questioning the validity of the tape and the medical examiner has validated it.&quot;</p>
