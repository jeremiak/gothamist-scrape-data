<p>On the heels of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227125347/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/heads_up_assholes_nypd_cracks_down.php">distracted driving</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227125347/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/16/distracted_driver_crackdown.php">crackdown</a> last week, the NYPD is starting a &quot;48-Hour Speeding Enforcement Initiative&quot; starting at midnight Tuesday through Wednesday. In other words, the NYPD wants to print some money!</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, &quot;Fines for speeding range anywhere from $90 and can be as high as $600.  Drivers may also be penalized from 3 to 11 penalty &quot;points&quot; on their respective Driver&apos;s Licenses&#x2019; for speeding infractions.&quot;</p><blockquote> The NYPD encourages safe driving and asks the public to obey the speed limit. The speed limit in New York City is 30 mph on local streets unless otherwise posted. There is no speed limit greater than 50 mph in New York City.<br>
 <br>
The NYPD also emphasizes that there are newly created arterial slow zones in the city where the speed limit decreases to 25 MPH and newly created School Zones where the speed limit decreases to 20 MPH.  Drivers should be mindful that speed cameras are in operation on many New York City Streets.</blockquote>Now, can cars not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227125347/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/19/photos_suv_jumps_curb_strikes_pedes.php#photo-1">hit pedestrians and wind up on front lawns</a>?<p></p>
