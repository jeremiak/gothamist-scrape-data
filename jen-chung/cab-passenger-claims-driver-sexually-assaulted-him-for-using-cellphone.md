<p>NJ authorities are investigating allegations that a cab driver forced a passenger to perform oral sex on him yesterday. </p>

<p>The incident allegedly took place at the corner of Sip and Summit Avenues in Jersey City around 2:30 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011340/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/12/passenger_says_cabbie_forced_him_to_perform_sex_act_in_taxi.html">According to The Jersey Journal</a>, a man said the driver &quot;sexually assaulted him after the driver allegedly got angry when the passenger talked on his cellphone in the vehicle.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011340/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-Jersey-City-Cab-Driver-Forces-Passenger-Oral-Sex-Angry-Cellphone-284551331.html">NBC New York quoted</a> the police radio transmission from the 911 dispatcher to Jersey City police: &quot;The victim claims that a cab driver made him have oral sex with him and touched his leg for, uh, using his cellphone.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim reportedly said he would be able to identify the driver, but didn&apos;t know the cab company. The Jersey Journal says, &quot;Police also said in the radio transmission there is a surveillance camera at a nearby chicken takeout restaurant, but that they could not immediately access it.&quot;</p>
