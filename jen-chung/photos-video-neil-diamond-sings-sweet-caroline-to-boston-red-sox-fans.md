<p>After the terrible tragedy that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020136/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/boston_marathon_bombings_terrorism.php#photo-1">unfolded at Monday&apos;s Boston Marathon</a>, as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020136/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/one_boston_bomb_suspect_is_dead_as.php">violence on Thursday night</a>, baseball teams around the country adopted the Boston Red Sox&apos;s unofficial anthem, Neil Diamond&apos;s &quot;Sweet Caroline,&quot; to pay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020136/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/17/video_yankees_honor_boston_with_swe.php#photo-1">tribute to Boston</a>. Yesterday was the Red Sox&apos;s first home game since the bombings, and during the eighth inning, Neil Diamond himself appeared to lead Fenway Park in singing his song:</p>

<p>Diamond, a Brooklyn native, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020136/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-boston-bombing-neil-diamond-sweet-caroline-rock-hall-fame-20130419,0,1858062.story">had said earlier in the week</a>, while on his way to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, &quot;Music can offer comfort to people in times of joy or sorrow. Tonight there are so many people getting awards, and sometimes you sense the questions &#x2018;Why are we doing this? Does this really matter?&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve asked those questions of myself many times. And it turns out that it does matter. With a  tragedy like this, there are no words, but if people can find healing in music, this is the reason I&#x2019;ve been doing this for the last 50 years. It goes beyond what I ever imagined.&quot; </p>

<p>Diamond originally wrote the song, which was released in 1969, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020136/http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/04/19/boston-marathon-explosion-neil-diamond/">give comfort to Caroline Kennedy</a>, &quot;I wrote it in a hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. And I think there&#x2019;s a little bit of God in that song. I always have felt that. There&#x2019;s no accounting for what can happen to a song. But this one had something special to it.&quot;</p>
