And that&apos;s what Kelly Catapano allegedly did.<p></p>

<p>Catapano crashed her 2001 Chrysler Sebring into Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp on Sunday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022842/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/06/new_arrest_for_slain_restaurat.html#incart_m-rpt-2">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, she &quot;is being held on $5,000 bail... she had three times the legal limit of alcohol in her system when she drove over a grave.&quot; </p>

<p>Catapano was dating Frank Fresca, the owner of Fresca&apos;s of the Bay who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022842/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/30/staten_island_restaurant_owned_shot.php">shot at his restaurant in 2008</a>. The Advance adds, &quot;Fresca is entombed at Moravian, though it&apos;s unclear if she was visiting his crypt. A law enforcement source said the tire of her car was hanging over a freshly-dug, empty grave.&quot;</p>

<p>This was also Catapano&apos;s third drunk driving arrest&#x2014;the other two times happened after Fresca&apos;s murder, in late 2008. Fresca&apos;s murder is still unsolved; his restaurant operated &quot;under the protection&quot; of the Bonannos but before he was killed execution-style, he had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022842/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/08/restaurateur_cooperated_with_f.html">cooperating with the feds</a> to solve another gangland murder.</p>
