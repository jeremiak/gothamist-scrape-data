<p>The NYPD is searching for four men accused of beating a green taxi driver and then taking his wallet in Brooklyn earlier this month.</p>

<p>According to the police, at around 2:55 a.m. on October 4, the cabbie was &quot;resting inside of his green taxi which was parked&quot; by McCarren Park, opposite the Automotive High School at 50 Bedford Avenue. One person in a group of four allegedly &quot;approached the vehicle and broke the passenger side view mirror.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver, police say, got out of the car to challenge them &quot;but returned to his driver&apos;s seat after he was confronted by the group.  The suspects then broke the driver&apos;s side view mirror and the victim emerged from the car again. The suspects began to punch the victim about the head and body before removing the victim&apos;s wallet, which did not contain any money.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver was treated for a broken nose and two black eyes at Woodhull Hospital. The NYPD released images of the four male suspects:</p>
