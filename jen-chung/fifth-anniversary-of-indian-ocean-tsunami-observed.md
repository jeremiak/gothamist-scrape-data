<p>People around the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915161934/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2009/12/26/2009-12-26_lowkey_ceremony_.html">remembered the fifth anniversary</a> of the devastating<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915161934/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake">Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami</a> that killed over 230,000 people in eleven countries. In Banda Aceh, Indonesia, where 150,000 died, a woman whose children and nieces were killed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915161934/http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/12/26/tsunami.anniversary/index.html">told CNN</a>, &quot;We are only human... We&apos;ll never really forget... We still feel the trauma. And when there is another earthquake, all we can do is run and pray.&quot;</p>

<p>The NY Times reports the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915161934/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/world/asia/26iht-tsunami.html">rebuilding effort in Banda Aceh</a>. One of the biggest projects is a $250 million highway, which is being managed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915161934/http://www.usaid.gov/">U.S. Agency for International Development</a>, and reaction has been mixed. One man said, &quot;Usaid just said &#x2018;this is where the road will go&#x2019; without consulting much with us,. Sometimes they planned for the road to go through cemeteries. We were angry. But now that this section is finished, I think most people are happy. I mean, we can go to Banda Aceh now in half the time we could before.&quot;</p>

<p>The Red Cross has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915161934/http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.53fabf6cc033f17a2b1ecfbf43181aa0/?vgnextoid=664fc71f2806b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=86929355be09b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default">report on its efforts to help the region</a>: &quot;Focusing on six key areas&#x2014;water and sanitation, psychosocial support, health, shelter, livelihoods and disaster preparedness&#x2014;the Tsunami Recovery Program has supported more than 80 relief and recovery projects in 10 countries. Because of the generosity of donors, beneficiaries received more than immediate relief&#x2014;they received resources, services and training that will help them thrive for years to come.&quot;  </p>
