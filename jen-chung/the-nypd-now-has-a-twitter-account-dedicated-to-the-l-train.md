Today they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013620/https://twitter.com/NYPDLTrain/status/512611964796039168">handing out fliers to L train riders</a> in order to increase their follower count, which seems a tad desperate&#x2014;can&apos;t they just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013620/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/fashion/twitter-followers-for-sale.html">buy followers</a> like the rest of us?</p>

<p>The natural uses of the account are to alert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013620/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/24/nyc_subway_ridership_was_1708_billi.php">riders of the extremely popular line</a> about suspects in specific crimes&#x2014;like person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013620/https://twitter.com/NYPDLTrain/status/510154450510807040">wanted for an iPad snatching</a> at the Graham Avenue stop or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013620/https://twitter.com/NYPDLTrain/status/512538705991856128">chain snatching at Atlantic Avenue</a>&#x2014;and other public safety matters (it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013620/https://twitter.com/NYPDLTrain/status/512537842732773377">National Preparedness Week!</a>).</p>

<p>There&apos;s also some transit nostalgia (RIP, Redbirds):</p>
