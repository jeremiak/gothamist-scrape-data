<p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney wants to win the Iowa caucus.  He&apos;s been trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708094356/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/28/can_chris_christie_help_voters_forg.php">relate to voters with awkward small talk</a> but apparently a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708094356/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/13_years_after_quitting_romney_stil.php">multi-millionaire</a> management (ahem, &quot;restructuring&quot;) consultant former governor of Massachusetts who thinks corporations are people is really desperate to strike a chord. Because yesterday he promised to put commercials on public broadcasting stations&#x2014;and specifically called out Sesame Street.</p>

<p>Talking Points Memo reports that while speaking at a Town Hall yesterday, Romney said, &quot;I like PBS. We subsidize PBS. Look, I&#x2019;m going to stop that. I&#x2019;m going to say PBS is going to have to have advertisements.&quot;  Yeah, America subsidizes the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which funds PBS and NPR) to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708094356/http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0411/Poll_Americans_way_off_on_public_broadcasting_funding.html">tune of $506 million in all of 2010</a>, just 0.00014% of the $3.456 trillion budget.  For comparison, war spending in<em> just </em>February of the same year was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708094356/http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2010-05-12-afghan_N.htm">combined $12.2 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan</a>.  </p>

<p>Romney, who is famous for believing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708094356/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-says-corporations-are-people/2011/08/11/gIQABwZ38I_story.html">corporations are people, too</a>, also said, &quot;We&#x2019;re not going to kill Big Bird. Big Bird&#x2019;s going to have advertisements, alright?&quot; Hmm, we have a feeling he said something similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708094356/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/01/27/as_bain_slashed_jobs_romney_stayed_to_side/?page=full">the folks of Ampad</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe he&apos;s just bitter because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708094356/http://1.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/f/a/collegehumor.c81371cf9d231ab05ed0165a1afea205.png">he looks so much like Guy Smiley</a>?</p>
