</div></div>					<p>Earlier this week, two NYPD Canine Teams were dispatched to help with Washington state mudslide recovery efforts. According to the NYPD, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security &quot;activated part of New York Task Force 1 (NY-TF1), a search and rescue team made up of the most highly trained first responders in the nation.&quot; The mudslide, which covered a square mile, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406072623/http://time.com/48397/death-toll-in-washington-mudslide-rises-to-30/">claimed at least 30 lives</a> and many are still missing.</p>

<p>The two teams were Detective Patrick Nee and his partner, Hondo, a six-year-old German Shepard, and Police Officer Benjamin Colecchia and his partner, Timoshenko, a three-year-old German Shepard. Timoshenko is named after slain police officer Russel Timoshenko, who was killed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406072623/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/09/two_police_offi.php">during a 2007 Brooklyn traffic stop</a>. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, &quot;FEMA established the National Urban Search and Rescue (US&amp;R;) Response System in 1989 as a framework for structuring local emergency services personnel into integrated disaster response task forces.  New York Task Force 1 is staffed by elite members of the NYPD, FDNY, and OEM, and includes rescue specialists, emergency physicians, paramedics, structural engineers, hazardous materials technicians and K-9 specialists.&quot;</p>

<p>There are 28 such national task force teams, who are ready for situations like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, aircraft accidents, hazardous materials spills and catastrophic structure collapses. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406072623/http://www.nytf1.org/">NY Task Force 1</a> has been previously deployed to help with search and rescue for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, hurricanes Ike, Gustav, Katrina, and the Oklahoma City bombing.</p>
