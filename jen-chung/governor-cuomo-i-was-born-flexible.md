<p>Oh, Governor Cuomo, stop being so fake modest!  He&apos;s been skillful at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301035909/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/cuomo_shows_off_political_muscle_in.php">getting decisions made</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301035909/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/cuomo_forces_compromise_on_teacher.php">things done in Albany</a>, but now he&apos;s being all coy about it.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301035909/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/andrew-cuomo-call-gov-gumby-article-1.1029709">Daily News reports that he told reporters</a>, &quot;I was born flexible. I&#x2019;ve gotten more flexible as governor. A veritable Gumby you need to be to be a governor.&quot; So, is Lieutenant Governor Duffy his Pokey?</p>

<p>Cuomo was referring to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301035909/http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/06082011PensionReformLegislation">proposed pension reform plan</a> (which the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301035909/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/opinion/gov-andrew-cuomos-pension-proposal.html">NY Times, FWIW, likes</a>), in hopes of saving taxpayers $93 billion over 30 years.  Cuomo said, &quot;I am not saying this is &#x2018;my plan &#x2014; it is my way or the highway,&apos;&quot; but he did also say to lawmakers, &#x201C;I need you to make it happen. If we do not do this, we could literally bankrupt the State of New York and we could bankrupt towns and villages and cities all across this state.&quot;</p>
