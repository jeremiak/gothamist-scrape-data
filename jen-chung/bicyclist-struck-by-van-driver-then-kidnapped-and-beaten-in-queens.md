<p>According to the police, a 52-year-old woman was riding her bicycle on Saturday, July 20 at 11:25 near 73-20 30th Avenue when a light green 2002-2004 Honda Odyssey struck her, knocking her off her bike. Suspects got out of the van, grabbing the victim and forcing her in the vehicle. The NYPD says, &quot;Once inside the van, the suspects blindfolded and zip tied the victim and then began to beat her. The suspect repeatedly asked the victim &apos;where is the money&apos;&quot; for 15 minutes, then throwing her out at 32-98 98 Street. </p>

<p>There were 4-5 male Hispanic suspects in the van, and police released a sketch of one of them, described as a dark-skinned male about 35 years old, 5&apos;10&quot; and weighing 280 pounds. Anyone with information in regards to this kidnapping is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162827/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">the Crime Stoppers Website</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
