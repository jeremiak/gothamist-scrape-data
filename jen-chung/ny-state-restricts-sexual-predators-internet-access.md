<p>With all the horror stories about sexual predators trolling the Internet for young victims, Governor Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085658/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=81588">signed legislation</a> requiring convicted sexual offenders to register their screen names with the state. Paterson said, &quot;New York State will do everything possible to try to protect young people from the actions of convicted sexual offenders.&quot;</p>

<p>Called the e-STOP law, the sexual offenders must register any and all Internet and email accounts with the state, and if they don&apos;t or change them without updating the state, it will be considered a felony.  Facebook and MySpace has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085658/http://nysun.com/news/new-york/sex-offenders-must-register-online-screen-names">agreed to use the information to remove users</a> who are sexual offenders.  </p>

<p>Lawmakers are also trying to stop videos of violent incidents from being distributed on the Internet, such as &quot;bum fighting,&quot;  animal attacks and the recent videos of cheerleaders beating up another girl.    Currently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085658/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--internetviolence0512may12,0,6905639.story">the AP reports</a> there&apos;s no sentence for making a video of an attack &quot;that could continue to embarrass or traumatize a victim for years.&quot;</p>
