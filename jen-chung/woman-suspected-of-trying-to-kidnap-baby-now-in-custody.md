<p>Police have found the woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171021/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/18/nypd_this_woman_tried_to_steal_baby.php">accused of trying to kidnap a baby</a>&#x2014;who was in the care of his nanny&#x2014;on a Chelsea sidewalk this week. Tara Anne McDonald, 46, was found in midtown Manhattan and is undergoing psychiatric evaluation. </p>

<p>The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon; police say the nanny was pushing an eight-month-old baby in a stroller on 8th Avenue near 17th Street when McDonald allegedly approached her. According to reports, McDonald was muttering and tried to walk away with the stroller.</p>

<p>UPS driver William Marte was nearby and intervened. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171021/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/18/police-still-searching-for-suspect-in-attempted-kidnapping-of-infant-in-chelsea/">He said,</a> &quot;The lady that grabbed the stroller by the handle&#x2014;she was saying, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re a liar! These are my babies!&#x2019; And I told the lady, &#x2018;Please, just get off of it; just walk away, because apparently, you have some problems.&#x2019; Then she walked away.&quot;</p>

<p>The police distributed images of McDonald yesterday and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171021/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9507825">one local worker said</a>, &quot;She&apos;s a local crazy. I seen her on the corner here a couple of times, not recently but maybe a month ago.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171021/http://nypost.com/2014/04/18/crazed-woman-still-at-large-after-foiled-kidnapping-attempt/">Post reports</a>, &quot;McDonald has a long rap sheet &#x2014; including seven prior arrests for attempted kidnapping &#x2014; and served more than a year behind bars in the late 1990s for an attempted snatching, sources said.&quot; Charges for this incident are pending.</p>

I did the right thing in the right moment.&quot; Also, the baby slept through the whole thing.</p>
