<p>The story about the one-year-old boy who was fatally shot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061333/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/02/baby_fatally_shot_while_crossing_br.php">while his father pushed him</a> in a stroller is already depressing enough, what with father Anthony Hennis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061333/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/03/father_not_cooperating_with_police.php">refusing to cooperate with the police</a> in the investigation, and Hennis allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061333/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/suspect_who_shot_brooklyn_1-year-ol.php">being the actual target due to a gang feud</a>. But now Hennis has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061333/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/05/father_of_fatally-shot_one-year-old.php">accused of a violent subway robbery</a>&#x2014;and the police say his accomplice was his younger brother.</p>

<p>Police said that on Thursday, October 3rd, a 19-year-old man riding a southbound 3 train pulling into the Saratoga Avenue stop was approached by two men. After being threatened, the rider gave them his watch, and then a suspect punched him in the face. The victim&apos;s pregnant sister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061333/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/anthony-hennis-enlists-younger-brother-brooklyn-robbery-article-1.1477589">even tried to intervene</a>, but was threatened too, with one suspect yelling, &quot;I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re pregnant!&quot; </p>

<p>The suspects fled, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061333/http://nypost.com/2013/10/04/stroller-slay-dad-wanted-in-subway-robbery/">Post reports</a> that another passenger recognized one as 22-year-old Anthony Hennis from the coverage of his son&apos;s shooting. Last night, the police revealed that they were also looking for Ammany Hennis, 20, for the robbery.  </p>
