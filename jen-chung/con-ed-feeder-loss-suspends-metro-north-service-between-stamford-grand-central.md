<p>All train service on Metro North&apos;s New Haven line was suspended when a Con Ed feeder went out around 6:30 a.m. It&apos;s unclear when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918030242/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/MTA-Metro-North-Trains-Stopped-225165442.html">service will be restored</a>.</p>

<p>The MTA says, &quot;New Haven Line Service is suspended between Stamford and Grand Central Terminal until further notice due to the loss of a Con Edison Feeder.  Customers should seek alternate means for travel to the city.  Customers may use the Harlem Line for travel to Grand Central Terminal.  As more information becomes available we will notify you as soon as possible.  Please listen for announcements at your station.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: At about 8:30 a.m. Metro-North announced there would be &quot;extremely limited service&quot; using diesel locomotives once an hour, making <em>all local stops. </em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918030242/https://twitter.com/MetroNorth">On Twitter</a>, officials announced that &quot;Custs should expect crowded conditions.&quot; And despair, expect plenty of despair ye doomed &amp; cursed Custs.</p>

<p>Metro-North is currently cross-honoring New Haven line tickets on the Harlem line, but frustrated Custs are encouraged to find some other way to get into the city if they can, like on foot with pitchforks and torches. There&apos;s no word yet on when normal service is going to resume, so keep an eye on Twitter for updates and plenty of justified griping from the disgruntled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918030242/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU8t6Z6dpns">presidents of the Howdy-Doody Circus Army</a>. </p>
