The Assembly Speaker, who opposed congestion pricing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228115449/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/09/25/2008-09-25_silver_commuter_tax_not_so_bad_.html">said he was open to revisiting the tax</a>, given the state of the economy.  But, the Daily News reports, &quot;Silver said he wants the GOP-controlled Senate take the lead in resurrecting the commuter tax,&quot; which seems unlikely, since Senate Majority Dean Skelos&apos;s spokesman said, &quot;The NYC commuter tax was a particularly onerous and unfair tax.&quot; (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228115449/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/budget-woes-beget-talk-of-commuter-tax/86696/">Sun explains</a> it&apos;s a &quot;tax of 45/100ths of 1% on the earned income of people who work in the city but commute from elsewhere.&quot;)  As for other pols, Senate minority leader Malcolm Smith doesn&apos;t like it, Governor Paterson hates it and Mayor Bloombers really hearts it, &quot;<strong>I&apos;ve been screaming about commuter taxes for as long as I&apos;ve been here.</strong>&quot;</p>
