<p>Former professional football Brian Holloway was at his home in Florida when his son let him know that a large group&#x2014;like hundreds&#x2014;of teens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151817/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brian-Holloway-Twitter-Party-Upstate-NY-224319951.html">were partying in their upstate New York home</a>. And his son knew this because there were tons of photos on social media. Holloway checked Twitter and was in shock, telling the AP, &quot;We were getting eyewitness reports of what was happening while it was happening. We couldn&apos;t believe what was going down.&quot;</p>

<p>The party at the Stephentown home occurred over Labor Day weekend. The former Patriot and Raider has posted photographs of some of the teens on a site called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151817/http://helpmesave300.com/">HelpMeSave300.com</a>; the Facebook &quot;about&quot; page explained, &quot;Last weekend, 300 kids/students broke in and vandalized a residence that has been our home since 1981. They were drinking (underage), doing drugs, selling drugs and destroying property. It looks like there was over $20,000 in damage to the home.&quot; </p>

<p>The damages are from when, according to the AP, the kids &quot;broke about 10 windows and glass doors, punched dozens of holes in the walls, dragged kegs of beer across oak floors and left behind an &apos;enormous amount&apos; of graffiti. His $20,000 damage estimate does not include personal items that were stolen.&quot; The intruders also peed on his rugs. Yes, they peed on the dude&apos;s rugs.</p>

<p>The website says:</p><blockquote>If you would like to come and help out, I&apos;m in need of floor sanders, carpet folks, good painters that can help maybe match some paints. Please bring cleaning supplies and i guess some food. I will have security there, so please see the security folks and register with them. I will be planning some fundraisers and will post that on the website.<p></p>

<p>I will not be discussing anything accept [sic] getting the house and the grounds cleaned up. </p>

<p>I want to give a personal thank you -- some great folks who stepped up to help out right away. Please go by and thank them. They are good people.</p></blockquote>Some teens who weren&apos;t at the party helped clean the home; one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151817/http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Students-tackle-cleanup-duties-4823139.php">16-year-old said to the Times Union</a>, &quot;We just wanted to show him that not all teenagers in the world do these kind of things.&quot;<p></p>

<p>As for his vigilante approach, &quot;It&apos;s not hard to identify who they were. We&apos;ve got 170 tweets. We have 200 to 220 names already confirmed today. I&apos;m going to go online right now &#x2014; I guarantee I&apos;ll have 10 more names of people who are sharing who was there, what they did. And that data is all going to the sheriffs.&quot; Holloway wants to help these teens take responsibility for their actions and &quot;send [an] urgent message about the dangers of drinking, drugs, crime and violence.&quot;</p>

<p>This weekend, Holloway is planning a picnic and tells those teens who ruined his home, &quot;Please help!  Come out and help set up,  fix up, bring food,  and picnic stuff,  so we can honor these real HEROS. I&apos;m here.  Come now. Take a stand for your future.  This is called redemption.&quot;</p>
