</div></div>					<p>Last year, David Bouley&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530225611/http://www.davidbouley.com/brushstroke-main/">Japanese restaurant Brushstroke</a> in Tribeca <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530225611/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/dining/at-brushstroke-bento-boxes-to-go.html">introduced</a> bento boxes with 16 individual items&#x2014;and now they are back! </p>

<p>Created by executive chef Isao Yamada, the two-story boxes are pricey at $59 but feature an extensive array of mouthwatering seasonal items and accompaniments. Here&apos;s the current menu:</p><blockquote>Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass<br>
Oregon Raised Wagyu Beef with Red Wine Sauce<br>
Canadian Fuji Pork Belly with Amazu Glaze<br>
Steamed Duck Breast with Tasmanian Mustard Seed<br>
Dashi-maki Tamago<br>
Simmered Kabocha Squash<br>
Dashi Braised Malanga Yam<br>
Dashi Marinated Eggplant<br>
Grilled Anago<br>
Sesame Burdock<br>
Spicy Eringi Mushrooms<br>
Atsu-yaki Tamago<br>
Grilled Zucchini<br>
Tsukune Dumpling<br>
Spicy Hakata Sushi Roll<br>
Smoked Salmon Salad<p></p>

<p>Rice and Pickles accompaniments: Golden Crab, Lobster and Mushrooms Steamed with Rice; Hijiki and Fava Beans mixed with Rice; House Made Pickles</p></blockquote>Plus, the boxes are wrapped in a Japanese scarf. Brushstroke says, &quot;When you call to order, make sure Chef Yamada has at least three days of advance notice and don&#x2019;t forget to tell him exactly what time you are planning to enjoy your meal&#x2014;maximum freshness is his number one priority.&quot;<p></p>
