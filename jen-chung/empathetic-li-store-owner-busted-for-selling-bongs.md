Mohammed Sohail, as well as other business owners, &quot;face civil penalties for allegedly selling illegal pipes, bongs and hookahs,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022937/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/crime/ny-lidrug0512842905jun04,0,4556512.story">according to Newsday</a>.  Brookhaven Supervisor Mark Lesko and Suffolk County DA Thomas Spota claim that &quot;Undercover investigators bought items from Sohail, and the other store owners, after making clear that they would use them for drug use.&quot;  Legislator Kate Browning said that while Sohail&apos;s generosity to the would-be robber was nice, &quot;But I know who he is, I know what he was doing. No sympathy for him.&quot;  And Sohail simply told Newsday,  &quot;I threw everything in the garbage. I don&apos;t want it anymore.&quot; <span class="photo_caption">Photo of Spota holding a bong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022937/http://www.1010wins.com/Store-Owner-In-the-News-Again/4534449">from 1010WINS</a></span><br>
