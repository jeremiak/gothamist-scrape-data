</div></div>					<p>President Barack Obama continued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227200811/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/24/obama_sighting.php">his father-daughter time in New York City</a> by taking Malia to see a new production of an Arthur Miller play last night.

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227200811/http://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Shows-Events/Arthur-Millers-The-Price.aspx">This Roundabout Theatre staging of <em>The Price</em></a>, which debuted in 1968, is in previews (it opens on March 16) and stars Mark Ruffalo and Tony Shalhoub as two estranged brothers going through their dead father&apos;s estate; Jessica Hecht plays Ruffalo&apos;s wife while Danny DeVito is an appraiser. As it happened, a NY Times reporter was sitting in the row in front of them:</p>

She was sitting five seats to the right of Mr. Obama and did not realize he was there until a friend told her at intermission. &#x201C;I had a really bad day and it all just changed.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Ms. Mowers said she was actually irritated when the trio first came in. &#x201C;Who is so rude to come in after the show starts with the flashlights and everything?&#x201D; she said.</p></blockquote>Backstage, the President and Malia met with the cast and crew; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227200811/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwZDhPt4i8E">DeVito</a> and Ruffalo were/are big Bernie supporters and the director, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227200811/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Kinney">Terry Kinney</a>, is a founder of Chicago&apos;s Steppenwolf Theatre Company.
