<p>Tens of thousands of people will be taking to the streets in all five boroughs for the 42nd <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522075906/http://www.nycmarathon.org/">NYC Marathon</a>. It&apos;s the city&apos;s exciting fall sports classic, giving thousands of New Yorkers the opportunity to cheer on entrants over 26.2 miles.  It also means numerous roads and bridges are closed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522075906/http://www.nycmarathon.org/road_closures.htm">here&apos;s the list</a>).  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522075906/http://www.nycmarathon.org/entrantinfo/start_services.htm">race has staggered start times</a> in Staten Island&#x2014;the Wheelchair division, Foot Locker Five Borough Challenge runners, and Handcycle and Disabled entrants start between 8:30 a.m. and 8:55 a.m., while the professional women&apos;s start is at 9:10 a.m. and the professional men&apos;s start is at 9:40 a.m.  NBC 4 starts its coverage at 9 a.m. Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522075906/http://www.nycmarathon.org/documents/INGNYCM11_Course_Map_For_Media.pdf">PDF of the course map</a>, and for fun, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522075906/http://www.nycmarathon.org/documents/NYCM-Profilepage10.pdf">PDF of course elevations</a>.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re running today, we hope you have a great day&#x2014;you&apos;ll be running next to folks like restaurateur Joe Bastianich, Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott, and Rangers legend Mark Messier.  And if you take photographs, you can share them with us by emailing them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522075906/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tips@gothamist.com</a> or tagging them &quot;gothamist&quot; on Flickr.</p>
