</div></div>					<p>If it&apos;s July 4th, it means it&apos;s time for Nathan&apos;s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.  After some concern over scheduling conflicts (stupid Wimbledon!) that had sent the contest to 3 p.m., the time for the gluttonous competition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815212714/http://nathansfamous.com/PageFetch/getpage.php?pgid=38">was restored to its traditional 11:30 a.m. start</a> for the women&apos;s showdown and noon for the men&apos;s.  And Sonya &quot;The Black Widow&quot; Thomas set a new women&apos;s record by eating 45 hot dogs!</p>

<p>ESPN&apos;s announcers called Thomas the &quot;Katniss Everdeen&quot; of eating, which probably would make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815212714/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/03/tomorrows_july_4th_and_we.php">Mayor Bloomberg say, &quot;Who wrote this shit?&quot;</a>  Anyway, this is Thomas&apos;s second victory in a row&#x2014;women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815212714/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/04/first_nathans_hot_dog_eating_contes.php">got their own contest last year</a>.  FYI, second place eater was Juliet Lee with 43.</p>

<p>The men&apos;s competition is coming up, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815212714/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/04/nathans_hot_dog_eating_contest_1.php#photo-1">defending five-peater Joey Chestnut the favorite</a> (he ate 62 hot dogs last year; he set the standing record in 2009 with 68 hot dogs).  Stupidly, ESPN isn&apos;t broadcasting a taped edition of the contest until 3 p.m. (it&apos;s supposedly on ESPN 3 now, but it&apos;s actually on delay).  </p>

<p>FYI: Joey Chestnut compares hot dog eating training to marathon training.</p>

<p>Boom: Chestnut tied his 2009 record by eating 68 hot dogs.  He was disappointed in himself for not giving the crowd a new world record (but noted that no one was pushing him, a la Kobayashi) but, hey, there&apos;s always next year.</p>
