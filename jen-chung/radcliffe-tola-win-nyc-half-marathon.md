</div></div><p>Yesterday morning, Briton Paula Radcliffe won the women&apos;s NYC Half Marathon, with a time of 1:09:45&#x2014;her first race since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135116/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/02/paula_radcliffe_wins_her_third_nyc.php">winning last year&apos;s NYC Marathon</a>. Tadese Tola of Ethiopia won the men&apos;s race, finishing at 1:01:06.  Radcliffe, who had bunion surgery in March and is considering running a marathon in Berlin this weekend, decided to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135116/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2009-08-14-radcliffe-half-marathon_N.htm">run in the race at the last minute</a>. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135116/http://www.nyrr.org/races/2009/nychalf/story_raceday01.asp">told the New York Road Runners</a>, &quot;<strong>I needed to blow out some racing cobwebs. I&#x2019;m the first to admit that this is an unorthodox way to test myself for a marathon&#x2014;running a half-marathon a week out</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>David Lam wrote this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135116/http://athletemovie.com/blog/2009/08/nyc_half_marathon.html">blog post on the race</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve watched Radcliffe on TV many times before, but I&apos;ve never seen her compete in person (she won three of the five marathons I completed in NYC and London). Boy is she fast,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135116/http://athletemovie.com/blog/2009/08/nyc_half_marathon.html">has photographs of her</a> &quot;zipping through Times Square.&quot; He added, &quot;<strong>In fact, she was so fast, she beat the R train I took from Times Square to the finish at Battery Park in Lower Manhattan. I arrived about 10 minutes after Radcliffe won the race...</strong>That really puts her (and the other top finishers&apos;) incredible speed in perspective.&quot;  Ethiopia&apos;s Mamitu Daska placed second in the women&apos;s race at 1:11:04 and Kenya&apos;s Catherine Ndereba was third in 1:11:56.</p>
