But when stopped on the streets of Soho yesterday--and in spite of being annoyed by gossip rags making stuff up--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902095229/http://www.tmz.com/2008/08/17/john-mayer-i-didnt-want-to-waste-her-time/">Mayer decided to talk</a> because &quot;<strong>I just don&apos;t want to be followed around New York City like an animal</strong>.&quot;  And while trying to explain why he broke up with the &quot;sophisticated&quot; and &quot;lovely&quot; Aniston, he said he didn&apos;t want to waste her time and it&apos;s not unusual to break up with somebody &quot;if something&apos;s not right...<strong>I guarantee 20% of the people on this street right are in a relationship they wish they could get out of but they don&apos;t know how</strong>.&quot;  (This street would be Prince Street, between Crosby and Broadway.)</p>
