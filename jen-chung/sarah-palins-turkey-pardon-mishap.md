title: Sarah Palin's Turkey Pardon Mishap

                            <p>It&apos;s confirmed:  Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is having some bad luck with the media.  Her time on the Republican Party&apos;s top ticket was marred by a few missteps--namely with her handlers limiting her time with the media, being over- or underprepared with the media or McCain-Palin insiders complaining to the media about her. But now that she&apos;s back in her native state, one would think that her aides could make sure she doesn&apos;t stand in front of the turkey killing machine during an interview after pardoning a turkey for Thanksgiving.  </p>

<p>Naturally, Countdown had some fun with the segment (we&apos;re betting Keith Olbermann is upset he&apos;s on vacation!) but it does blur out the graphic parts (which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072155/http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/11/palin-talks-tur.html">see here</a>):</p>

<p>This is also probably why the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072155/http://www.whitehouse.gov/holiday/thanksgiving/2008/">White House Turkey Pardon</a> is done at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and not at a slaughterhouse.</p>
