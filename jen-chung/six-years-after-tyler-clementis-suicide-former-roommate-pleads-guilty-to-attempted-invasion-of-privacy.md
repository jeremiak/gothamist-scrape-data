<p>Dharun Ravi, who broadcast his first year Rutgers University roommate Tyler Clementi&apos;s private sexual encounter to other viewers, leading to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/rutgers_students_appalled_over_vide.php">Clementi&apos;s suicide</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/04/hundreds_attend_vigil_at_rutgers_un.php">national conversation about cyberbullying</a>, has pleaded guilty to attempted invasion of privacy. Ravi, now 24, told reporters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2016/10/dharun_ravi_court_appearance.html#incart_2box_nj-homepage-featured">that he &quot;feels good&quot; and is &quot;relieved.&quot;</a></p>

<p>On September 22, 2010, shortly after starting college at Rutgers, 18-year-old Clementi jumped off the George Washington Bridge. He posted to Facebook, &quot;Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.&quot; It turned out that Clementi had asked roommate Ravi to have the room to himself. Ravi then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/students_say_webcam_spy_guy_is_misu.php">set up his webcam</a> and went to the room of his friend, Molly Wei, to watch Clementi, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/rutgers_students_appalled_over_vide.php">Ravi Tweeted</a>, &quot;making out with a dude.&quot; </p>

<p>While Ravi had viewed, via webcam, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/tyler_clementis_guest_testifies_the.php">Clementi&apos;s previous encounters</a>&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/02/tyler_clementis_death_galvanizes_lg.php">Clementi seemed to be aware of</a>, having sought advice on Yahoo&#x2014;on the night of September 21, Clementi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/23/tyler_clementes_rutgers_roommate_d.php">had covered up the webcam</a>. During a trial in 2011, prosecutors accused Ravi of being homophobic, while his defense said that he was merely concerned about the stranger that Clementi was with in their room. </p>

<p>Ravi, who admitted, &quot;I did do things wrong and I was stupid about a lot of stuff. I was a dumb kid not thinking about it,&quot; had been convicted of bias intimidation, but his defense appealed the conviction. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2016/09/ex-rutgers_student_bias_appeal_in_tyler_clementi_c.html">court later overturned the verdict</a>, after agreeing that the prosecution improperly used details about Clementi&apos;s state of mind during closing arguments, when, in order to secure a conviction, the state of mind of the defendant is what should be considered. </p>

<p>Instead of going through a new trial, Ravi decided to plead guilty to invasion of privacy and was sentenced to time served (he had served 30 days in jail, three years of probation and 300 hours of community service). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/nyregion/dharun-ravi-tyler-clementi-case-guilty-plea.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">NY Times explains</a>, &quot;By pleading guilty to the third-degree felony, [he]  accepted a deal with state prosecutors to drop all charges after an appellate court threw out his conviction.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2016/10/dharun_ravi_court_appearance.html#incart_2box_nj-homepage-featured">From NJ.com</a>:</p><blockquote> Judge Joseph Paone on Thursday did not impose any further sentences. The judge said Ravi has demonstrated that he has lived a &quot;law-abiding life for a substantial amount of time.&quot; <p></p>

<p>&quot;His youth and immaturity did not provide him with the tools necessary to help him understand the consequences of his actions,&quot; Paone said. &quot;He did not consider his conduct would cause serious emotional harm to Mr. Clementi.&quot;</p></blockquote>Middlesex County <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Dharun-Ravi-Pleads-Guilty-Rutgers-Webcam-Spying-Case-398893661.html">Prosecutor Andrew Carey said</a>, &quot;Reaching the plea agreement was a reasonable way to resolve the case in view of the appellate court decision, which dismissed a series of criminal bias charges that had been levelled against the defendant by a grand jury in Middlesex County.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Tyler Clementi&apos;s mother Jane, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/26/tyler_clementis_mother_blames_herse.php">blamed herself for alienating her son</a> with her evangelical beliefs, wrote about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013152/http://people.com/crime/tyler-clementis-mother-reveals-why-she-is-heartbroken-over-dharun-ravis-guilty-plea/">her disappointment in the guilty plea</a> for People; here&apos;s an excerpt:</p><blockquote>My time stopped when my world crashed apart into a thousand pieces, on Sept. 22, 2010. It feels to me as if it was just yesterday. I was so numb for so long that it seemed as if time just stood still. The pain and anguish held me tight and would not go away or subside. My life was frozen in time. And yet in the same moment &#x2014; if you can even imagine &#x2014; there was this giant chasm of nothingness in which it seems like it was an eternity when I last heard Tyler&#x2019;s voice, his laugh or his music, and it is extremely difficult to remember the touch of his hand or his hug.<p></p>

<p>So to hear now that the time has come to move on is extremely painful &#x2026; everyone is saying this has gone on long enough and now it&#x2019;s time to move on. I am told that Mr. Ravi wants this to go away and he wants to move on. He wants to get on with his life. So he will plead guilty to one of the many counts against him and then shut the door and move on with his life.</p>

<p>As if you can put part of your life in a box, tape it shut and poof it is gone. It does not exist any longer. If only it were that simple.</p></blockquote>In a separate statement, Jane Clementi and her husband said, &quot;We call on all young people and parents to think about their behavior and not be bystanders to bullying, harassment or humiliation. Interrupt it, report it and reach out to victims to offer support. If this had happened in Tyler&apos;s case our lives might be very different today.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Ravi&apos;s lawyer said his client &quot;just wants to disappear.&quot;</p>
