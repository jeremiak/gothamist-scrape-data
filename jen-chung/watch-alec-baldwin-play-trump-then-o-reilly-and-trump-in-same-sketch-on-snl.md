<p>After previously playing an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416053026/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/12/snl_cold_open_alec_baldwin_returns.php"><em>Independence Day</em>-style, alien-fighting Commander-in-Chief</a>, Alec Baldwin returned to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to portray a present-day President Trump during the cold open. &quot;Trump&quot; proclaimed, &quot;I just had an amazing week, folks. I just met with the leaders from China, Egypt and Jordan. Gorsuch was confirmed. The media is saying nice things. And no one is talking about Russia. Wow, what a difference just 59 Tomahawk missiles can make.&quot;</p>

<p>The sketch was set in Kentucky, with an audience of a coal mining community. &quot;I wanted to spend 20 minutes today with my people. Folks who don&apos;t whisper, &apos;Oh, God, what&apos;s happening?&apos; after I leave the room,&quot; explained Baldwin as Trump. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416053026if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/CL7kenX3Vu8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>One concerned miner (Mikey Day) expressed concerns about his job security, &quot;Trump&quot; answered, &quot;I&#x2019;m going to do everything I can to make sure you people will work in coal the rest of your life.&quot; When Day&apos;s character says they just want any good jobs, they don&apos;t have to be in coal, the &quot;President&quot; says, &quot;Sorry, hombre, it&apos;s all coal. In Trump&apos;s America, men work in two places - coal mines and Goldman Sachs.&quot;</p>

<p>Baldwin reprised his Trump impression in a Bill O&apos;Reilly sketch&#x2014;in which he also portrayed O&apos;Reilly. As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416053026/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FO%27Reilly%2C%20Bill">embattled Fox News personality</a>, Baldwin said he&apos;d discuss &quot;the scandal everyone&#x2019;s been talking about all week, a scandal no one thought I&#x2019;d have the guts to address head-on, about the shocking allegations of abuse of power &#x2014; that have been leveled against the Obama administration.</p>

<p>At one point, &quot;O&apos;Reilly&quot; tried to interview another Fox News reporter, after learning that she doesn&apos;t work there any more asks, &quot;Did she get the check?&quot;&#x2014;a reference to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416053026/https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-oreilly-and-fox-news-parent-paid-13-million-to-settle-five-harassment-claims-1491080833">$13 million that Fox News&apos; parent company paid to women</a> who alleged that O&apos;Reilly sexually harassed them. </p>

<p>Finally, &quot;O&apos;Reilly&quot; spoke to &quot;President Trump,&quot; which featured Baldwin in the two split screens &quot;Thank you for coming to my defense last week even when no one asked you to. You even went as far as saying, &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416053026/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/trump-interview-susan-rice.html">Bill O&apos;Reilly did nothing wrong.</a>&apos;&quot; Baldwin&apos;s O&apos;Reilly asked, &quot;That&apos;s based upon?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hunch, just a loose hunch,&quot; &quot;Trump&quot; replied, then claimed he didn&apos;t know much about O&apos;Reilly situation. &quot;I&apos;m more familiar with this case, than, say, health care... I was too busy being super-presidential by bombing a bunch of [bleep].&quot; </p>

<p>In a nod to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416053026/http://adage.com/article/the-media-guy/o-reilly-factor-cash-life-insurance/308601/">advertisers fleeing <em>The O&apos;Reilly Factor</em></a>, the advertisers during the sketch were &quot;Dog Cocaine,&quot; &quot;Cialis for horses,&quot; and the movie, <em>CHIPS</em>.</p>
