<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at 7:39 p.m. on January 6th , on a southbound F train, when an unidentified perv &quot;exposed his penis and masturbated in front of the victim before he fled the train at the Fort Hamilton Avenue subway station.&quot;<br>

The victim was apparently able to take photographs of the suspect, who the police describe as being 30-35 years old, 6&apos;0&quot; and 180-190 pounds and was wearing a black jacket, gray sweat pants, white ski cap and white sneakers.<br>
 <br>
