<p>A &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723034234/http://nypost.com/2017/01/05/man-shot-by-cops-is-scion-of-powerful-new-york-family/">fun, misunderstood trust-fund kid</a>&quot; was hit with a slew of charges&#x2014;including two counts counts of attempted murder&#x2014;after Staten Island police officers found him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723034234/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/05/police_shootout_staten_island.php">allegedly drawing a 9mm Glock on them yesterday</a>. The cops fired at Patrick Allen, 24, who was injured and taken into custody.</p>

<p>Police had received calls around 1 a.m. about gunshots near Androvette Street and Arthur Kill Road in the Charleston section. Allen was apparently wearing a &quot;heavy ballistic&quot; vest, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723034234/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-shoots-kin-ex-new-york-post-owner-opening-fire-article-1.2935112">deflected one of the officers&apos; bullets</a> (he was hit in the arm and leg as well). </p>

<p>It is unclear whether Allen actually fired at police, but NYPD Chief of Patrol Terrence Monahan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723034234/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-shoots-kin-ex-new-york-post-owner-opening-fire-article-1.2935112">said</a>, &quot;He did point the gun at us.&quot; Besides attempted murder, Allen was charged with attempted assault, attempted assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon, criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment and menacing.</p>

<p>His friend, Jonathan Derbyshire, also 24, fled into the woods, but, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723034234/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-shoots-kin-ex-new-york-post-owner-opening-fire-article-1.2935112">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Shortly after 6 a.m., cops took Derbyshire into custody as he emerged from wooded Fairview Park about a mile from the shooting. He was covered in mud and had discarded some of his winter clothes, sources said.&quot; </p>

<p>After searching the woods, police found an &quot;AR-15-style assault rifle outfitted with a scope and sniper&#x2019;s bipod, a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, a .45-caliber pistol, a large hunting knife, some prescription pills and several spent shell casings,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723034234/http://nypost.com/2017/01/05/man-shot-by-cops-is-scion-of-powerful-new-york-family/">according to the Post.</a> </p>

<p>Allen is the great-grandson of former legendary Post publisher Dorothy Schiff. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723034234/http://nypost.com/2017/01/05/man-shot-by-cops-is-scion-of-powerful-new-york-family/">The Post says</a>, &quot;Allen&#x2019;s father, former Brooklyn prosecutor-turned-criminal defense lawyer Gerald Allen, told cops he &apos;basically washed his hands&apos; of Patrick years ago and no longer wants anything to do with him, one source said. Allen&#x2019;s mom, Tess Leopold, is also a former Brooklyn prosecutor. Her mother, Adele Hall Sweet, is married to Manhattan federal Judge Robert Sweet. Leopold&#x2019;s late dad, A. Frederic Leopold, was a mayor of Beverly Hills, and her grandmother was Schiff, whose grandfather was legendary financier Jacob Schiff.&quot; </p>
