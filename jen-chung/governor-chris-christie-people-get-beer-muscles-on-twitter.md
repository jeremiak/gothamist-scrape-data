<p>When NJ Governor Chris Christie announced he was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428231440/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/whitney_houstons_livestreamed_funer.php"> lowering flags</a> to  half-staff on the day of Whitney Houston&apos;s funeral, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428231440/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/nyregion/christie-spars-on-twitter-over-honor-for-whitney-houston.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">slammed by Twitterers</a> who felt it was too inappropriate.  So Christie took to the social networking service to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428231440/https://twitter.com/#!/GovChristie/status/169841566758866944">respond to people</a>, &quot;@steakprincess Flag being lowered for her cultural contributions as an artist &amp; New Jerseyan. Her struggles w/substance abuse r a diff topic&quot; (@steakprincess had written &quot;@GovChristie are you serious? Whitney is no hero, she was a crack head who killed herself. Our flag is not to be lowered for a junkie.)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428231440/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/christies_sympathetic_view_of.html">Today Christie said</a>, &quot;<strong>People get beer muscles on Twitter.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The Star-Ledger reports that Christie explained how his experience as a &quot;board member of a substance abuse treatment center &quot;had a &apos;profound effect&apos; on him and informed his sympathetic view of Whitney Houston&apos;s struggle with drugs. Her death and his experience attending her funeral on Sunday &#x2014; where he received a standing ovation for his decision to lower flags to half-staff in her honor &#x2014; strengthened Christie&apos;s resolve to set up mandatory drug treatment for nonviolent offenders.&quot; </p>

<p>He said, &quot;I&apos;ve had a number of people in my life who have gone through these problems. Some of the smartest people in the word who I know have gone through this problem. Some have survived it and some haven&apos;t.&quot;  Christie also reflected on seeing Cissy Houston at the funeral, &quot;I will never forget that moment... An incredibly dignified women, who when she heard her daughter&apos;s voice come over the loud speakers as we were leaving that funeral ... threw herself on that casket and cried &apos;My baby, my baby.&apos; I&apos;m sorry as a father there&apos;s no more unthinkable thing than losing a child &#x2014; unthinkable.&quot;  </p>

And while Christie is getting some kudos for his sympathetic feelings about nonviolent offenders, he&apos;s getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428231440/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/video_jon_stewart_chris_christie_an.php">criticized for his anti-gay marriage stance</a>.</p>
