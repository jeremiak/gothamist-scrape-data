										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:320px; "> <img alt="2012_01_tabletpeeper.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133617im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_01_tabletpeeper.jpg" width="320" height="235"> <br> <i>Surveillance image of the suspect</i></div> Connecticut police say that a man used a computer tablet to take photographs up a woman&apos;s skirt at the Target store in South Windsor.  Creepily bold!<p></p>

<p>The customer had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133617/http://www.courant.com/community/south-windsor/hc-south-windsor-peeping-target-complaint-0201-20120131,0,6735508.story">shopping for clothing</a> when the perv approached her.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133617/http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2012/01/31/south-windsor-police-seek-alleged-tablet-computer-peeper/">According to CBS Connecticut</a>, &quot;The woman tells police that she noticed a man following her down an aisle and later touched her thigh with the tablet. She realized what he was trying to do and the man fled.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released a surveillance image of the suspect, who is described as a white man in his 40s, with short hair, who was wearing a long, black coat, a buttoned-down shirt and tan pants.</p>

<p>In 2005, a pervert set up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133617/http://gothamist.com/2005/05/18/upper_east_side_upskirting_camera_revealed.php">video camera in an Upper East Side subway grate</a> to take upskirt images. Upskirt pervs also like to take images while women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133617/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/grand_central_c.php">are going up stairs or escalators</a>.</p>
