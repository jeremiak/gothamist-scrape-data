<p>The Egyptian banking executive who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053259/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/egyptian_banker_accused_of_sexually.php">arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a maid</a> at the Pierre Hotel decided to plead guilty.   Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar entered the plea yesterday and was sentenced to five days community service.  His lawyer said he completed the community service already (soup kitchen work) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053259/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8211713">plea was &quot;the most expeditious way&quot;</a> for him to return to his ailing wife.</p>
