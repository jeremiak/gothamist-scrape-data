</div></div>					<p>Players and fans alike arrived at the new Yankee stadium yesterday.  Derek Jeter, who was, perhaps fittingly, the first Yankee to hit a ball out of the park (during batting practice) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117095219/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090402&amp;content_id=4112812&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy">said</a>, &quot;I think everyone was excited to be out there and amazed at how big the stadium is. Everyone is going to enjoy it -- from the coaches, the players and even more importantly, the fans.&quot;</p>

<p>The fans, arguably, are the biggest group to convert, with many devoted to the old stadium. Vick Fotia, season ticket holder since 1979, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117095219/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04022009/news/regionalnews/take_me_out_to_the_new_yankee_ballgame_162561.htm">initially told the Post</a>, before entering the new stadium, &quot;I wasn&apos;t in favor of this stadium. I love the old one,&quot; but then said, &quot;<strong>Wow! I&apos;m in love. They did a fantastic job.</strong>&quot; Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117095219/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2009-04-02-baseball-palaces_N.htm">for $1.5 billion,</a> it better have been fantastic!</p>

<p>Many classic elements, like the frieze, were kept and pitcher Andy Pettite said, &quot;<strong>Really, it looks exactly like the old ballpark, when you just look from the dugout.</strong> It looks like it&apos;s going to play big in left and a short porch in right. That usually works out pretty well for a left-handed pitcher, so I&apos;m hoping that will be the case.&quot;  And Yankees co-chairman Hal Steinbrenner&#x2014;who admitted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117095219/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090402&amp;content_id=4112116&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy">some tickets were overpriced</a>&#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117095219/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090402&amp;content_id=4115382&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy">said of the new park</a>, &quot;I see it as classy. We did our best to bring all the tradition this great franchise has had the last century into this ballpark. At the same time, we made it as nice as we can for our fans. I think this building is very classy, it&apos;s going to be here a long, long time, and I think we did a great job. I think everybody in the organization is proud of it.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Yankees play two exhibition games, today (weather permitting) and tomorrow, before the home opener on April 16.  And during tomorrow&apos;s game, Captain Chesley Sullenberger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117095219/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090402&amp;content_id=4114310&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy">will throw out the first pitch</a>.</p>
