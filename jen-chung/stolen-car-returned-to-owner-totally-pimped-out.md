But recently the cops found it at a Queens chop shop, traced it back to her and called up the Brooklyn teacher.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141002102811/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/04/25/2010-04-25_crooks_made_my_car_speed_freak_and_then_i_got_it_back.html">Daily News reveals</a> it was &quot;returned to her drag-race ready, with a brand-new V-8 engine, tinted windows, oversized tires with special hubcaps - and custom valve stem caps shaped like bullet casings.&quot;  </p>

<p>Pogany said, &quot;When I first saw under the hood I thought it looked like, you know in the movie &apos;Grease?&apos; Like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141002102811/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oWeaujOWXc">&apos;Grease Lightning&apos; car</a>.&quot; Further, the car&apos;s interim owner&#x2014;apparently he bought from the thieves&#x2014;also put &quot;in a manual transmission and leather interior and [hung] a Dominican flag and a giant wooden cross from the rearview mirror.&quot;  Pogany said, &quot;I&apos;m Jewish. and I don&apos;t even know how to drive a stick shift!&quot;</p>

<p>Her friends are offering her stick shift lessons but the car is in her parents&apos; NJ driveway, where it&apos;s the belle of the block (people have expressed interested in buying it).  In other news, the NYPD is reportedly<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141002102811/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/22/nypd_cracks_down_on_auto_theft.php"> trying to crack down on auto thefts</a>&#x2014;they are down 14% over 2008 and 2009 but are up 27% this year.</p>
