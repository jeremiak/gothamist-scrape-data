He then took out his gun and fired.&quot; The police officer&apos;s partner then ran out of a home and asked someone on the street, &quot;Did he just shoot himself?&quot;</p>

<p>Another neighbor told the News, &quot;I heard one shot - it was really loud. Within the next few minutes, all I saw was flashing lights and police cars came speeding through.&quot; The officer, who was 28 and a five-year veteran of the force, was taken to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.  </p>
