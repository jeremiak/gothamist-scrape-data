<p>When Time magazine put a young <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628054445/http://laist.com/2012/05/10/time_covers_breastfeeding_mom_is_la.php">Los Angeles mom</a> on its cover, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628054445/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/10/heres_a_three-yr-old_breastfeeding.php">her nearly four-year-old son suckling on her left breast</a>, it was for an article about attachment parenting&#x2014;but let&apos;s face it, everyone is just obsessed with breastfeeding. And wondering why that little kid is on a chair (the mom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628054445/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/times_breastfeeding_mom_duh_i_dont.php">says it&apos;s obviously for dramatic effect</a>).  So now we must turn to Blossom to clear our stupid, boob-distracted minds.</p>

<p>Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience from UCLA, is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628054445/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/09/blossom_still_breastfeeds_her_toddl.php">big proponent of attachment parenting</a>, which is basically encouraging parents to be physically close to their babies&#x2014;  wear slings (instead of putting them in bouncers), co-sleep, and breastfeed&#x2014;so their children grow up confident and know they are loved. She&apos;s even written a book about it, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628054445/http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Sling-Real-Life-Confident-Attachment/dp/145161800X"> Beyond The Sling: A Real-Life Guide To Raising Confident, Loving Children The Attachment Parenting Way</a></em>,  and when she saw the Time cover, she wrote on her Facebook page, &quot;Q and A with the mom on the cover of TIME. I have mad respect for her after reading this. Super shocked to hear her story... Clarifying: I was shocked how amazing her story was. And breastfeeding an adopted baby is incredible. And she gave an educated and eloquent set of responses. I would not have done a photo shoot myself but I respect her and think she is a smart woman.&quot;</p>

<p>On Friday, she appeared on CNN to discuss the Time cover and attachment parenting.  Bialik&apos;s problem with the Time cover is that it doesn&apos;t show the nurturing aspects of breastfeeding and is concerned that people are trying to sexualize a very natural biological instinct.  And when asked the money question&#x2014;when she and her own three-year-old wil be done with breastfeeding&#x2014;Bialik was self-deprecating and sincere. &quot;Before high school is what we&apos;re taught to say by La Leche League International,&quot; she answered, laughing.  &quot;He stopped breastfeeding at night when he was three. I stopped pumping at work when he was three. Now he goes days without and those will keep increasing. and he will be done and I hope he will be done soon.  And if at any point it&apos;s not okay with me, then that&apos;s a conversation I will gently have with my child.&quot;</p>

<p>Bialik also criticized Time&apos;s cover headline &quot;Are You Mom Enough?&quot; because it&apos;s not conveying the complexity of attachment parenting&#x2014;the sensationalist image is &quot;meant to sell magazines.&quot;  Well done, Time, well done.</p>
