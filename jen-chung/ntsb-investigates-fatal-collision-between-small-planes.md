The pilots of both planes were killed, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317034427/http://www.lohud.com/article/20110510/NEWS05/105100365/2-dead-after-2-planes-collide-over-Orange-County-woods?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage">witness said</a>, &quot;One clipped the other, clipped the wing is what it looked like from my angle. The one spiraled directly down, and the other was more at an angle over the hill.&quot; Also, one of the planes burst into flames while the other didn&apos;t.<p></p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating the crash. It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317034427/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/05/two_killed_when_planes_registe.html">believed the two pilots flew</a> from Sussex, NJ in one plane to Orange County, NY in order to pick up a plane owned by Edward Crump. Crump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317034427/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/nyregion/plane-collision-over-orange-county-kills-2-pilots.html?src=twr">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;I feel so sick about it. I feel so terrible for the families.&quot;  The victims&apos; names were not given; the Times reports that one of the victims was so disfigured it wasn&apos;t clear if it was a man or woman.</p>

<p>A 14-year-old boy who lives near one of the crash sites in New Hampton said &quot;he saw the battered and burned fuselage of a silver plane, missing its wings and tail&quot; in the forest...&quot;In his neighbor&#x2019;s driveway was a wing, he said, adding that just steps from his house lay a foot-long red zippered pouch with the number N5275L.&quot;</p>
