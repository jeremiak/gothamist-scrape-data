<p>The incident took place around 8 p.m. on March 18th. The victim, a 34-year-old woman, was on a Manhattan bound R train at the Union Square station when, the NYPD says she saw &quot;an unidentified male manipulated his private parts.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman disembarked at Union Square, while the man allegedly stayed on the train. <br>
 <br>
The alleged jerk-off is described as being about 60-70 years old, 5&apos;4&quot; and 145 pounds. He was last seen wearing glasses, a blue baseball cap, a black jacket over a blue collared shirt, black pants and black shoes and was carrying a black tote bag.<br>
 <br>
