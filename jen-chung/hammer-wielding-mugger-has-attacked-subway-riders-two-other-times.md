<p>The man accused of using a hammer to rob a subway rider at the Fulton Street &amp; Rockaway Avenue station may be connected two other similar incidents. And one of those victims was a petite pregnant woman. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2014_05_bksuro.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140615042237im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_05_bksuro.jpg" width="220" height="269" class="image-right"> </span>The 26-year-old woman told NBC New York she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140615042237/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hammer-Attacks-Subway-Stations-MetroCards-Riders-258523891.html">was attacked near an F train in Queens</a> on March 5. &quot;I&apos;m 5&apos;1, 130 pounds...did you really have to hit me behind the head?&quot; she asks. &quot;Couldn&apos;t you just take the bag and run?&quot; </p>

<p>The other incident occurred this past Sunday, with a 23-year-old man attacked at the same Fulton Street &amp; Rockaway Avenue station where Wednesday&apos;s attack occurred. </p>

<p>The most recent victim, Richianand Brijanand, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140615042237/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/08/riders-on-alert-after-subway-hammer-attack-in-brooklyn/">described his ordeal to WCBS 2</a>. Brijanand was buying a MetroCard at 9:20 a.m. at the station when the suspect attacked him. He recalled, &quot;I went up to the machine trying to make my purchase, and all of a sudden he just hit me right in the head - boom... I just spun around, and when I turned around, he held the hammer again to frighten me. He said, &#x2018;Give me your money &#x2014; after he hit me.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect took $140. Brijanand, an immigrant from Guyana who works at Staples, said of the hammer, &quot;I guess he held it with two of his hands, because when I saw him with the hammer in hand, he held it with both hands.&quot; He said, &quot;I&#x2019;m feeling, like, swelling - a lot of swelling,&quot; and pointed to the right side of his head, &quot;It swells from here [his ear], all the way up here [his temple], to the bottom here [his eye].&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as 5&apos;10&quot; and weighing between 130 and 150 pounds. Anyone with information regarding this robbery has been asked to contact the NYPD&#x2019;s Crime Stoppers hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
