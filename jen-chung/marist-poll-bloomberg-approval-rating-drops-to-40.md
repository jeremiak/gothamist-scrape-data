<p>Mayor Bloomberg may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706135905/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/27/photos_mayor_bloomberg_shows_his_uh.php">swinging from the rafters while wearing Spider-Man tightsMarist poll finds his job approval rating at 40%</a>, &quot;This includes 9% who believe the mayor is doing an excellent job in office and 31% who say he is doing a good one.  About four in ten voters &#x2014; 38% &#x2014; rate Bloomberg&#x2019;s job performance as fair while 21% view it as poor. Only 1% is unsure.&quot; Last month, his approval rating was 44%. </p>

<p>Marist polling director Lee Miringoff said, &#x201C;Mayor Bloomberg is not immune from &#x2018;third term-itis.&apos; If you mix together the rough winter weather, a sluggish economy, and the ongoing battle over public schools, he&#x2019;s spending too much of his political capital.&quot; What&apos;s more, his approval rating has dropped in Queens and Staten Island (this time around, 35% say he&apos;s doing an excellent/good job, while the number was 49% in February).  His numbers is the Bronx (36%) and Brooklyn (35%) are about the same, but &quot;Bloomberg&#x2019;s approval rating, though, has bumped up in Manhattan.  59% of registered voters in Manhattan currently give the mayor a thumbs-up compared with 50% in early February.&quot; That&apos;s consistent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706135905/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/poll_manhattan_still_likes_bloomber.php">with other polls</a>.</p>

<p>Other stats: 53% of voters think the city is moving in the wrong direction (vs. 42% that are happy with the way things are going); 65% disapprove of how the mayor is handling the schools; and 56% think Bloomberg is mishandling the budget.  </p>
