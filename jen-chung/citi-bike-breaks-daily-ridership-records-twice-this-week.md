<p>As it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016154520/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/20/citi_bike_expansion_2016.php">expands into</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016154520/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/citi_bike_invading_brownstone_brook.php">more neighborhoods</a>, it&apos;s no surprise that Citi Bike is expected to break its annual ridership record of 10 million rides, set last year. But Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that this week, the daily ridership record was broken&#x2014;twice.</p>

<p>&quot;Citi Bikes are being ridden in record numbers - breaking 60,000 rides for the first time on Wednesday and then hitting a new daily record of 61,266 rides yesterday,&quot; de Blasio said in a statement. &quot;With 565 stations and counting in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, Citi Bike is growing and we remain committed to bringing this great transit alternative to even more New Yorkers in the years ahead.&quot;<br>

Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said today, &quot;In Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope, where Citi Bikes arrived only in the last two weeks, they have become so well-used and popular, it&#x2019;s already hard to remember what it was like without them. Getting around brownstone Brooklyn&#x2014;along with other new Citi Bike neighborhoods like East Harlem and Red Hook&#x2014;has never been so easy, convenient and affordable.&quot;</p>
