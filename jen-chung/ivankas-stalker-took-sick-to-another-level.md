<p>At a court hearing yesterday, prosecutors revealed that the man accused of<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713142558/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/19/man_obsessed_with_ivanka_trump_arre.php"> stalking socialite Ivanka Trump</a> allegedly threatened her and her husband.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713142558/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/terror_of_mNrPlSTeGIuqdha76Z1yQM">Post reports</a>, &quot;From August 2009, [Justin] Massler, who legally changed his name to Cloud Starchaser, set up fan Web sites, penned gushy love letters and scolding screeds, drew loony cartoons of Ivanka rescuing him -- and once sent photos of himself drenched in red liquid that looked like blood.&quot; One source told the paper, &quot;Without a doubt, he is very sick. He took sick to another level. This is one of the worst cases of stalking I&apos;ve ever seen.&quot;</p>

Jared Kushner has ruined my life for all time and eternity. Thanks to Kushner, there is no sun in the sky, no stars in the wind and no moon in the trees.&quot;</p>

<p>Massler&apos;s lawyer, who represented Uma Thurman&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713142558/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/03/umas_stalker_wa.php">stalker Jack Jorda</a>n (who was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713142558/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/06/uma_thurman_sta.php"> found guilty</a>), said his client was never going to hurt the glamorous couple, &quot;The reason we&apos;re here, your honor, is because we&apos;re dealing with the Trump family.&quot; The 27-year-old was released on $10,000 bail and reportedly flashed the thumbs up sign.</p>
