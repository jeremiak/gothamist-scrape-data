<p>Last night, the NBA&apos;s best player, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, discussed his team&apos;s loss Oklahoma City after the game. But then he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/https://twitter.com/sam_amick/status/829901315174178817">called for reporters&apos; attention again </a>to add, &quot;Oh, I&apos;m sorry. I missed one. Oakley for president,&quot; referring to Cleveland native and Knicks legend Charles Oakley.</p>

<p>While Oakley, the bruising 6&apos;8&quot; enforcer for New York between 1988 and 1998, was arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/watch_msg_security_remove_charles_o.php">punching three security guards at Madison Square Garden</a> on Wednesday night, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/sports/basketball/charles-oakley-james-dolan-knicks.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsports&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=sports&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">court of public opinion</a>, if not the law, is standing by Oakley. And now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170210/midtown/charles-oakley-james-dolan-msg-knicks">DNAinfo reports</a>, there is a fall guy: &quot;Frank Benedetto, the senior vice president for security at the Madison Square Garden Company, was fired Friday morning, a source said.&quot;</p>

<p>During the Wednesday game, with the Knicks facing off against the L.A. Clippers, Oakley, who bought his own tickets to the games, was asked to leave the arena by security guards. He claims that MSG chairman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/charles_oakley_james_dolan_told_msg.php">James Dolan does not want him at games</a> and has told security to monitor him. Oakley also insists that he was minding his business when he was kicked out:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Soooooo Charles Oakley just got into a fight at he Knicks game. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/https://t.co/klZBD89VI7">pic.twitter.com/klZBD89VI7</a></p>&#x2014; Ian Schafer (@ischafer) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/https://twitter.com/ischafer/status/829500863794274305">February 9, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>However, the Knicks claimed, in a statement, that &quot;Charles Oakley came to the game tonight and behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. He has been ejected and is currently being arrested by the New York City Police Department. He was a great Knick and we hope he gets some help soon.&quot; </p>

<p>And MSG spooned an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/sports/basketball/charles-oakley-james-dolan-knicks.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsports&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=sports&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">employee&apos;s account to the Times</a>: &quot;According to the statement by the woman [an order taker], whom the Garden did not name, Oakley was agitated when he sat down, asking where Dolan was and why security guards were looking at him. She said she urged him to calm down, to no avail.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, as Oakley, who has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/charles-oakley-calls-knicks-owner-james-dolan-bad-guy-article-1.2111428">contentious relationship with Dolan</a>, was telling his side of the story to reporters, Knicks PR doubled down with their line of attack, issuing another statement: &quot;There are dozens of security staff, employees and NYPD that witnessed Oakley&apos;s abusive behavior. It started when he entered the building and continued until he was arrested and left the building. Every single statement we have received is consistent in describing his actions. Everything he said since the incident is pure fiction.&quot;</p>

<p>This prompted some questions from many, including those who have played in the NBA:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&apos;re a FA to be, why would you play for an Owner who treats the past greats like this or a President who stabs star player in the back?</p>&#x2014; Reggie Miller (@ReggieMillerTNT) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409182435/https://twitter.com/ReggieMillerTNT/status/829796080644665345">February 9, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>DNAinfo notes that MSG would not comment on Bendetto&apos;s departure, adding:</p><blockquote>Dolan has an ongoing feud with Oakley, who was briefly denied admission to a game last year before ultimately being allowed inside. Oakley also told reporters that MSG security insisted on following him around at games long before Benedetto was hired last August. Benedetto took over the top security post after serving as a top U.S. Secret Service official who was credited with helping oversee the safety of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama while serving as Assistant Special Agent in Charge of Presidential Protection. <p></p>

<p>He was also lauded for handling security for the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago, as well as the 2013 and 2014 Chicago Marathon, according to his LinkedIn account.</p></blockquote>In an interview with Fox 5 NY&apos;s Duke Castiglione, Oakley said that he had a few drinks before going to the game but nothing at MSG, &quot;I was only there four minutes. So if I could rob a bank in four minutes, maybe that&#x2019;s what it is. But I didn&#x2019;t do nothing. I went to sit there with my guest and watch the game and they said they got orders that I had to leave.&quot;<p></p>

<p>He also said he&apos;s heard from many players, &quot;A lot of people reached out to me. Michael Jordan, LeBron, a lot of people, a lot of ex-players also. A lot of guys, a lot of people I know in life, all shapes and forms, actors, entertainers, I mean, I know a lot of people, so I respect them for reaching out and having my back. It shouldn&#x2019;t come up to this. Life is too short and too much going on in the world and we got to fix things in life and not try to break things in life... I mean, I&#x2019;m a guy who people came to see play, I played hard. I give back all the time. I&#x2019;m not one of these fake guys out here.&quot;</p>

<p>Does this mean that Knicks superfan Spike Lee will be the one to broker an Oakley-Dolan peace summit?</p>
