<p>A man at an Elmhurst subway station was fatally struck by an arriving train last night. The victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025506/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-fatally-struck-in-head-by-subway-in-queens/1725039/">may have leaned forward</a> over the platform edge as the train pulled in.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. at the Grand Avenue-Newtown stop. Sources told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025506/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Struck-Head-Train-Subway-Station-Killed-Queens-Elmhurst-Grand-Avenue-412021655.html">NBC New York</a> that &quot;the man may have been intoxicated when he leaned or fell in front of the oncoming train.&quot;</p>

<p>The impact of the northbound M train apparently &quot;wedged him between the train and the platform,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025506/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-subway-train-leaning-platform-graphic-article-1.2957930">according to the Daily News</a>.</p>

<p>The News adds that the police spoke with the victim&apos;s &quot;visibly intoxicated&quot; friend, who said, &quot;I didn&apos;t do nothing wrong. He was my friend.&quot;</p>
