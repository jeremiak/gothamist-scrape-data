<p>A 13-year-old boy was twice in the head while standing outside a Flatbush Avenue pizzeria with his aunt yesterday afternoon. Gama Droiville is in stable condition at Kings County Hospital; even though a bullet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140418131737/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/boy-13-shot-head-brooklyn-article-1.1756022">pierced his right eye, he told his mother</a>, &quot;&#x2018;Mom, God is with me. I can&#x2019;t die. Don&#x2019;t worry.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the shooting occurred just before noon, at Flatbush and Beverly Road. The gunman hit Gama and a 24-year-old man, who was the apparent target and was hit in the leg. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140418131737/http://nypost.com/2014/04/14/13-year-old-brooklyn-boy-shot-in-the-head/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;He was being interviewed by detectives, who hadn&#x2019;t yet determined a motive.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140418131737/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/boy-13-shot-head-brooklyn-article-1.1756022">Daily News has details of the chaotic scene</a>: Gama&apos;s aunt Laurieuse Droiville  shouted, &quot;My boy is dying! My boy is dying!&quot; and the wounded boy was helped into Avenue Pizza II. She recalled, &quot;Next thing I know he was on the floor. He was saying he can&#x2019;t see.&quot; Another person, Assitou Diallo, told the News, &quot;I heard something like five shots. The boy was bleeding. ... The woman was jumping up and down screaming. He was bleeding but he was trying to calm her down.&quot;</p>

<p>Doctors are concerned that Gama might lose his eye. He was also struck by a bullet behind his ear.</p>

<p>One woman in the neighborhood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140418131737/http://nypost.com/2014/04/14/13-year-old-brooklyn-boy-shot-in-the-head/">told the Post</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s senseless. I cried, because I have a son, and I have a daughter that&#x2019;s in the Navy, too.&quot;<br>
