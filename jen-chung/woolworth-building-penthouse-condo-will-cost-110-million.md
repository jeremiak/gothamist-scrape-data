Three units in addition to the penthouse are listed at more than $20 million, including a 6,084-square-foot full-floor apartment with a terrace on the 31st story for $24 million.<p></p>

<p>The $110 million penthouse is about 8,975 square feet with a 584-square-foot terrace. The four-bedroom condo with a private elevator spans nine stories, with the primary living space on the 50th and 51st floors, according to the offering plan. A great room and wine cellar make up the 53rd floor, and the 55th through 58th levels in the cupola include a library or media room and an observation deck at the top, the plan shows.</p></blockquote>You could also just buy a penthouse topped with <em>two</em> cupolas for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013742/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/manhattans_most_beautiful_fixer-upp.php#photo-1">the low price of $20 million</a>.<p></p>

<p>When Alchemy president Ken Horn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013742/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/living-large-the-market-for-super-luxury-homes/">was interviewed by CBS News</a>, he was asked &quot;What does the luxury customer who will buy in a building like this want?&quot; Horn replied, &quot;The best kitchen you can imagine. The most spectacular bathrooms. They&apos;re gonna be spectacular pieces of art.&quot; He also likened the penthouse to a &quot;castle in the sky. We can&apos;t think of anything in the world that will be similar to that.&quot;</p>
