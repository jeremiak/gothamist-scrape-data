Gibbons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005255/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/26/judge_resigns_investigation_turns_u.php">resigned mid-month</a> after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005255/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/27/porn_judge_had_lots_of_crotch_and_c.php">&quot;massive&quot; amount of images</a> was found during routine courthouse monitoring.  A law enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005255/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/judge_pix_called_kid_porn_CjD6zuSc3wfwwJsqUW4uHI">told the Post,</a> &quot;The girls definitely look underage...[But] If she looks 14, is she really 14? Or is she 17, and so it&apos;s not illegal?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Another source added, &quot;These appear to be from illegal sites, with illegal content,&quot; but it&apos;s unclear whether the ages of the photographs&apos; subjects can be verified. In NY, it&apos;s illegal to have pornographic images of someone under 16.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005255/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/29/2010-08-29_porn_judges_neighbors_say_theyre_still_in_state_of_shock.html">Daily News staked out</a>  the 47-year-old judge&apos;s Park Slope apartment, which he shares with Legal Aid attorney Jeanne Emhoff, who recently gave birth to their son. A 34-year-old father told the News, &quot;Just to be in the same building, it&apos;s extremely shocking. We&apos;re hoping that the allegations are untrue.&quot;  </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005255/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/28/2010-08-28_the_porn_supremacy.html">News editorial also dubs him &quot;Porn Judge&quot;</a> and says he&apos;s the definition of a Knucklehead for looking at porn (let alone allegedly underage porn) at work: &quot;Someday a Newton or an Einstein will find scientific proof for the First Law of Knucklehead Dynamics. That being: Sexual obsession and IQ move in inverse proportion. As the former increases, the latter decreases.&quot; Well, according to one study, about a third of Americans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005255/http://www.aolnews.com/surge-desk/article/manhattan-judge-james-gibbons-is-latest-government-employee-busted-for-porn-at-work/19610990">check out porn from work</a>&#x2014;one psychotherapist told Businessweek a couple years ago, &quot;The peak hours for Internet porn use are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. You&apos;ve got the ease of access. In some cases, it&apos;s like the company putting a six-pack on an alcoholic&apos;s desk, and saying, &apos;Here, don&apos;t drink it.&apos;&quot;</p>
