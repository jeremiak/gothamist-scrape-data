Michael McMahon (D) invited the ex-wife of his Republican challenger to Tuesday night&apos;s debate.  And not only was Michael Grimm&apos;s ex Susan Kim there, so were her father and brothers!  The Advance summed it up, &quot;Call it a bit of campaign shenanigans unrivaled even in the rough and tumble that is a hallmark of Staten Island politics.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Kims were able to take &quot;four took seats directly in front of the podium at which Grimm would stand&quot; courtesy of McMahon staffers/volunteers holding seats.  Grimm told the paper, &quot;She looked as beautiful as the day I met her,&quot; and of his ex-in-laws, &quot;It was a pleasure to see them.&quot;  The former FBI agent and ex-Marine added, &quot;I guess he [McMahon] did it to try to rattle me. It didn&apos;t. I think this shows you which way the campaign is going. It is what it is.&quot;</p>

<p>McMahon&apos;s campaign explained that the Kims have been his long-time supporters.  McMahon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305182700/http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2010/10/bloomberg_officially_throws_hi.html">received the endorsement</a> of Mayor Bloomberg yesterday, but that didn&apos;t sway one Staten Island resident, &quot;I don&apos;t know who [to vote for] yet. But someone who won&apos;t make more of a mess.&quot; </p>
