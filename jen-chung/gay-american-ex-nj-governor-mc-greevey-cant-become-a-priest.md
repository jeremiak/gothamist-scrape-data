<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_04_mcgreevey.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063752im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_mcgreevey.jpg" width="365" height="258"> <br> <i>James McGreevey when he stepped down in 2004 (AP)</i></div> James McGreevey, NJ&apos;s infamous former governor who famously declared himself a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063752/http://gothamist.com/2004/08/13/mcgreevey_steps_down_citing_extramarital_affair.php">&quot;gay American&quot; and resigned</a>, embarked on an enlightened, post-political life by  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063752/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/14/five_years_later_mcgreevey_grateful.php">studying at the General Theological Seminary</a>, where he got a Masters in Divinity.  But his studies may have been for naught because his attempt to join the Episcopal Church priesthood had been denied, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063752/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/heaven_can_wait_rzIVCJVENUl8mgCezXBUCJ">according to the NY Post</a>.  An Episcopal Diocese of Newark source says, &quot;<strong>It was not being gay but for being a jackass</strong> -- [McGreevey] didn&apos;t come out of the whole divorce looking good.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Hmm, what could be so jackassy about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063752/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/17/mcgreevey_confi.php">admitting threesomes</a> and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063752/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/09/more_evidence_t.php">interminably bitter divorce</a> with ex Dina Matos?  Another church source says, &quot;He was sort of looking for every angle to make a complete redo of his professional life. He ran to the church for some kind of cover, which isn&apos;t fully appropriate. Even if he&apos;s a good guy, he should wait five to 10 years to get over his issues.&quot; In other words, for all you other governors with secrets, stop looking at the church for sanctuary!</p>

<p>McGreevey still lives with his real estate executive boyfriend, Mark O&apos;Donnell, in a NJ mansion; O&apos;Donnell<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427063752/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/22/mcgreevey_boyfr.php"> reportedly gives the former governor money to pay</a> his various alimony commitments.</p>
