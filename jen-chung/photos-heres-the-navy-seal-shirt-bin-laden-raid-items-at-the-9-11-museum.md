<p>The other two items are a brick from bin Laden&apos;s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan and a CIA &quot;challenge coin&quot;&#x2014;with an X on one side and &quot;May 1, 2011&quot; on the other&#x2014;created to commemorate the mission. The coin was donated by &quot;Maya,&quot; the CIA operative who tracked bin Laden for years, and she also donated a photograph on the plane she took back to the U.S. after the mission.</p>

<p>9/11 Memorial Museum Director Greenwald said, &quot;This display, in the heart of Foundation Hall, invites Museum visitors to contemplate the extraordinary dedication of the U.S. military and intelligence communities in their search for justice in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.&quot;</p>
