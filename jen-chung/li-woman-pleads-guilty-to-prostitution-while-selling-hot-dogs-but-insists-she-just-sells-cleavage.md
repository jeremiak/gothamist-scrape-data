Catherine Scalia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142024/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hot_dog_hooker_relishes_her_return_ZkSpuOXduXr1YkKj8BYECO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">admitted that she agreed to serve up some pleasure</a> after an undercover cop paid $50 for a hot dog, but then outside the courthouse, she told reporters, &quot;Prostitution is sex. I&#x2019;m not selling sex, I&#x2019;m selling my cleavage.&quot; Confused? Yes, we are, too.<p></p>

<p>Scalia sells hot dogs out of a Winnebago in Nassau County and last week, she was arrested for prostitution. (FWIW, in 2004, she was also arrested for prostitution while selling hot dogs.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142024/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/hot-dog-vendor-admits-to-prostitution-1.3706171">According to Newsday</a>, &quot;Scalia, 45, of East Rockaway, told Judge Anthony Paradiso in First District Court in Hempstead that she was &apos;stripping&apos; Thursday when she was arrested. When he asked again if she had engaged in an act of prostitution, she said &apos;yes,&apos; and giggled. She pleaded guilty to one count of misdemeanor prostitution.&quot;  The judge will sentence her to 7 days in jail next month &quot;provided she agrees to get a psychiatric evaluation and comply with treatment recommendations.&quot;</p>

I&#x2019;m right in front of Pep Boys on Baldwin in Freeport. I have loads of customers, everybody loves me, nobody has a problem,&quot; and &#x201C;<strong>If a man can walk out down the street without a shirt, so can I!</strong> I just give my business cards out, and guys who want a strip show call me, and I&#x2019;ll do it at my house. What&#x2019;s wrong with that?&quot;  Scalia also tempted gourmands with, &quot;<strong>Come taste my onions!</strong>&quot;</p>
