<p>Today, more women have come forward and recounted tales of unwanted advances from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">One woman told the NY Times</a>, &quot;He was like an octopus. His hands were everywhere.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/palm-beach-post-exclusive-local-woman-says-trump-groped-her/w5ii48gwdJY9htsLl88GcP/">another recounted to the Palm Beach Post</a> that Trump grabbed her, &quot;It was pretty close to the center of my butt.&quot;</p>

<p>The news comes five days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">audio from a 2005 Access Hollywood interview</a> was leaked. The audio, caught in between filmed segments, features Trump telling interviewer Billy Bush, &quot;You know I&#x2019;m automatically attracted to beautiful&#x2014;I just start kissing them. It&#x2019;s like a magnet... And when you&apos;re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything. Grab &apos;em by the pussy.&quot; Trump apologized for his words, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">claimed it was &quot;locker room&quot; talk</a>.</p>

<p>Jessica Leeds, the woman on the plane, contacted the NY Times after she watched Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/dumpster_fire_2016_the_second_presi.php#photo-1">deny that he ever actually treated</a> a woman that way (even though a few women have actually said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">Trump groped them</a>). She was so angry that she &quot;wanted to punch the screen.&quot; </p><blockquote><br>
More than three decades ago, when she was a traveling businesswoman at a paper company, Ms. Leeds said, she sat beside Mr. Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York. They had never met before.<p></p>

<p>About 45 minutes after takeoff, she recalled, Mr. Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her.</p>

<p>According to Ms. Leeds, Mr. Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He was like an octopus,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;His hands were everywhere.&#x201D;</p>

<p>She fled to the back of the plane. &#x201C;It was an assault,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>Ms. Leeds has told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke with The New York Times.</p></blockquote>The Times spoke to another woman, Rachel Crooks:<blockquote>Ms. Crooks was a 22-year-old receptionist at Bayrock Group, a real estate investment and development company in Trump Tower in Manhattan, when she encountered Mr. Trump outside an elevator in the building one morning in 2005.<p></p>

<p>Aware that her company did business with Mr. Trump, she turned and introduced herself. They shook hands, but Mr. Trump would not let go, she said. Instead, he began kissing her cheeks. Then, she said, he &#x201C;kissed me directly on the mouth.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It didn&#x2019;t feel like an accident, she said. It felt like a violation.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It was so inappropriate,&#x201D; Ms. Crooks recalled in an interview. &#x201C;I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>She immediately called her sister, who remembered, &quot;She was very worked up about it. Being from a town of 1,600 people, being na&#xEF;ve, I was like &#x2018;Are you sure he didn&#x2019;t just miss trying to kiss you on the cheek?&#x2019; She said, &#x2018;No, he kissed me on the mouth.&#x2019; I was like, &#x2018;That is not normal.&#x2019;&quot;<p></p>

<p>When a NY Times reporter contacted him to ask about two accusations, a &quot;highly agitated&quot; Trump didn&apos;t hold back:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;you&apos;re a disgusting human being,&quot; trump told me when i asked about claims that he touched women inappropriately:&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/https://t.co/naHweclUo0">https://t.co/naHweclUo0</a></p>&#x2014; megan twohey (@mega2e) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/https://twitter.com/mega2e/status/786344190313504768">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170624074435js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>&quot;None of this ever took place,&quot; Trump told the NY Times, adding that &quot;he would sue the news organization if it reported them.&quot;</p>

<p>Mindy McGillvray was helping a friend, Ken Davidoff, who, with his father, photographed Trump&apos;s events at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/palm-beach-post-exclusive-local-woman-says-trump-groped-her/w5ii48gwdJY9htsLl88GcP/">cover a concert in January 2003</a>. </p><blockquote>After the show, Davidoff and McGillivray were standing in a pavilion behind the main house in the middle of a group of people. To their left was Regis Philbin and his wife, Joy, according to Davidoff. To McGillivray&#x2019;s immediate right was Trump and his fianc&#xE9;e, Melania.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Ray already performed. He&#x2019;s ready to leave. He&#x2019;s saying his goodbyes to everyone,&#x2019;&#x2019; McGillivray recalled.</p>

<p>&#x201C;All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it&#x2019;s Ken&#x2019;s camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there&#x2019;s Donald. He sort of looked away quickly. I quickly turned back, facing Ray Charles, and I&#x2019;m stunned.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>McGillivray said she remembers saying to herself, &#x2018;&#x2019;&#x2018;OK, am I going to say something now and make a scene or be quiet?&#x2019; I chose to stay quiet.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>Davidoff said he did not witness the alleged groping but he said he has never had any reason to doubt McGillivray.</p>

<p>Asked about the possibility that what she felt was Trump or someone accidentally bumping into her, McGillivray said no. &#x201C;This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab,&#x2019;&#x2019; she said. &#x201C;It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p></blockquote>The Palm Beach Post reports, &quot;She said the incident is something she and her family and the Davidoffs would bring up periodically over the years, sometimes joking about it.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Buzzfeed spoke to some Miss Teen USA contestants who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/https://www.buzzfeed.com/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing">remembered Trump barging into their dressing room</a> and an accusation from Cassandra Searles, Miss Washington 2013, resurfaced today&#x2014;Searles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/https://www.yahoo.com/style/donald-trump-reportedly-treated-miss-000000927.html">wrote in a Facebook comment</a>, &quot;He probably doesn&#x2019;t want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.&quot;</p>

<p>Kamie Crawford, Miss Teen USA in 2010, commented on the Buzzfeed report:</p>

<p>Another beauty pageant contestant, Tasha Dixon, Miss Arizona 2001, mentioned how Trump walked into a Miss USA dressing room while s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624074435/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-unearthed-footage-trump-says-of-10-year-old-i-am-going-to-be-dating-her-in-10-years/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=29868172">he and other women were getting dressed</a>, &quot;He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.&quot;</p>

<p>Then CBS News dug up this vintage video:</p>
