<p>State Senator Adriano Espaillat has proclaimed himself the winner of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/28/primary_problems.php">contentious battle</a> to succeed longtime Rep. Charles Rangel. With 15,735 votes to Assemblyman Keith Wright&apos;s 14,499, Espaillat is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/06/28/democratic-primary-tuesday-in-nyc.html">projected to win</a> the district that covers Harlem and part of the Bronx. </p>

<p>Espaillat, who would be the first Dominican in Congress if elected in the November election, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/nyregion/adriano-espaillat-charles-rangel-first-dominican-in-congress.html?_r=1">said last night</a>, &quot;Voters from throughout the 13th Congressional District elected a country boy from Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. So from Harlem to East Harlem, from Washington Heights, from Inwood to the Northwest Bronx, I want to thank all the voters that cast their votes in support of this historic candidacy... This campaign establishes that the American dream is still alive.&quot;</p>

<p>But Wright did not concede, stating, &quot;No candidate can declare victory tonight. Not until every vote is counted.&quot;</p>

<p>Espaillat narrowly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/26/ap_declares_rangel_winner_of_close.php">lost against Rangel in the 2014 primary</a>, as the demographic shifted in the district with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/rep-charles-rangel-endorses-keith-wright-house-successor-article-1.2690968">booming Hispanic population</a>. However, the racial dynamics also played a part in this campaign, with Wright and the Rev. Al Sharpton claiming there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/06/wright-sharpton-say-there-is-a-plot-to-suppress-the-black-vote-in-rangel-race-103272">conspiracy to suppress the black vote</a>. </p>

<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://observer.com/2016/06/fall-of-the-house-of-rangel-espaillat-tops-wright-to-replace-retiring-congressman/">Wright told reporters</a>, &quot;Now, I&#x2019;m not an expert on voter suppression. But I can tell you that all of the ghosts of the civil rights movement, all of the ghosts of Jim Crow-ism, all of the ghosts of poll taxes, started to emerge. So I think that has to be looked at.&quot;</p>

<p>In other contests, the incumbents&#x2014; Rep. Jerry Nadler, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Rep. Gregory Meeks, Rep. Jose Serrano and Rep. Nydia Velazquez&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/new_york_primary_primer.php">all won their district primaries</a> again.</p>

<p>And upstate, progressive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/15/zephyr_teachout_cuomo.php">Zephyr Teachout</a>, who mounted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/10/cuomo_wins_primary_against_invisibl.php">stronger-than-expected primary challenge</a> to Governor Cuomo in 2014, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144741/http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/2016/06/28/teachout-leads-yandik-ulster/86448510/">won the Democratic primary for the 19th District</a>. She&apos;ll square off against Republican primary winner John Faso for Rep. Chris Gibson&apos;s seat. Gibson, a Republican, is retiring.</p>
