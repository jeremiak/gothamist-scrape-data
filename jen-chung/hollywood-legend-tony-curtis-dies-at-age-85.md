</div></div>					<p>Iconic Hollywood actor Tony Curtis, who starred in <em>Spartacus</em>, <em>Some Like It Hot</em>, and <em>The Sweet Smell of Success</em>, has passed away at age 85. He died after suffering cardiac arrested in his Las Vegas area home. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152637/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/movies/01curtis.html?ref=arts">In the NY Times&apos; obituary</a>, Dave Kehr writes a thorough examination of Curtis&apos; career&#x2014;acting and heartthrob/heartbreaker status alike (&quot;Mr. Curtis embodied a new kind of feminized male beauty that came into vogue in the early 1950s&quot;)&#x2014;as well as his upbringing in New York City:<br>
</p><blockquote>Behind the pretty-boy looks could be found a dramatically potent combination of naked ambition and deep vulnerability, both likely products of his Dickensian childhood in the Bronx. Tony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz on June 3, 1925, to Helen and Emanuel Schwartz, Jewish immigrants from Hungary. Emanuel operated a tailor shop in a poor neighborhood, and the family occupied cramped quarters behind the store, the parents in one room and little Bernard sharing another with his two brothers, Julius and Robert. Helen Schwartz suffered from schizophrenia and frequently beat the three boys. (Robert was later found to have the same disease.)<p></p>

<p>In 1933, at the height of the Depression, his parents found they could not properly provide for their children, and Bernard and Julius were placed in a state institution. Returning to his old neighborhood, Bernard frequently found himself caught up in gang warfare and the target of anti-Semitic hostility; as he recalled in many interviews, he learned to dodge the stones and fists to protect his face, which he realized even then would be his ticket to greater things. In 1938, Julius Schwartz was hit by a truck and killed.</p></blockquote><br>
Curtis, who later went to Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side, famously married Janet Leigh in 1951 (one of their children is the actress Jamie Lee Curtis), divorced her, and remarried five more times.  He is survived by his current wife, Jill VandenBerg (the couple operated a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152637/http://www.shilohhorserescue.com/">horse rescue and sanctuary farm</a>), and five children.<p></p>
