</div></div>					<p>Take a look at this<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619232622/http://modi.mech.columbia.edu/nycenergy/"> interactive map of NYC&apos;s annual energy consumption by block</a>. It&apos;s by Vijay Modi, a professor of mechanical engineering at Columbia University, and graduate student Bianca Howard.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619232622/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/02/01/new-york-city-energy-use-all-over-the-map/">According to Metropolis</a>, &quot;Their research allows New Yorkers to get a rough idea of how much energy is used inside their homes, offices and businesses &#x2014; and it offers a peek into the building next door, down the street and across the city. The goal of the project is to take some of the mystery out of energy usage.&quot;</p>

<p>Modi says, &quot;<strong>Midtown Manhattan has more energy use than the whole country of Kenya, and New York state uses more energy than all of sub-Saharan Africa. </strong>There is just this intense use of energy in cities like New York.&quot; He and Howard estimated energy usage based on city data by zip code, and you can zoom at the block level to see how much various kinds of energy are used. </p>

<p>Things you&apos;ll see: Times Square, Midtown Manhattan and other commercial areas of the city (Silicon Alley) use a lot of energy, while residential areas use less (Staten Island, being mostly residential, uses very little relatively speaking).  </p>
