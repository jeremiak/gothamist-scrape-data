Last night, Melania Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention in her most high-profile appearance as a potential First Lady. Her delivery was fine, but an astute journalist in Los Angeles noticed that her words sounded a lot like Michelle Obama&apos;s speech to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, raising questions about plagiarism. And now Trump&apos;s campaign is blaming... Hillary Clinton?<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/us/politics/melania-trump-speech.html?_r=0">The NY Times also broke down </a>the passages that resemble each other</p><blockquote>Ms. Trump, Monday night:<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;From a young age, my parents impressed on me the <strong>values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect</strong>. They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son. And we need to <strong>pass those lessons on</strong> to the many <strong>generations</strong> to follow. <strong>Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mrs. Obama, in her 2008 speech:</p>

<p>&#x201C;Barack and I were raised with so many of the same <strong>values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say</strong> you&#x2019;re going to do; <strong>that you treat people with</strong> dignity and <strong>respect</strong>, even if you don&#x2019;t know them, and even if you don&#x2019;t agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. <strong>Because we want our children</strong> &#x2014; and all children <strong>in this nation &#x2014; to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Ms. Trump:</p>

<p>&#x201C;I was born in Slovenia, a small, beautiful and then-Communist country in Central Europe. My sister, Ines, who is an incredible woman and a friend, and I were raised by my wonderful parents. My elegant and hard-working mother, Amalija, introduced me to fashion and beauty. My father, Viktor, instilled in me a passion for business and travel. <strong>Their integrity, compassion and intelligence reflects to this day on me and for my love of family and America.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mrs. Obama, in 2008:</p>

<p>&#x201C;And I come here as a daughter &#x2014; raised on the South Side of Chicago by a father who was a blue-collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me. My mother&#x2019;s love has always been a sustaining force for our family, and one of my greatest joys is seeing her <strong>integrity, her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters</strong>.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/us/politics/melania-trump-speech.html?_r=0">Hill told the Times</a> &quot;that one of Ms. Trump&#x2019;s lines &#x2014; the words &apos;strength of your dreams&apos; &#x2014; caught his attention as he was watching on his computer from a Starbucks in Los Angeles, juggling Facebook chats and browsing Twitter.&quot; He explained, &quot;It kind of made me pause for a minute. I remembered that line from Michelle Obama&#x2019;s speech.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Before giving her speech, Melania Trump&#x2014;who is fiercely private and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/melania-trump-donald-trump-2016-republican-national-convention-214063&amp;#8221">hasn&#x2019;t been seen on the campaign trail in two month</a>&#x2014;had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-conventions/melania-trump-appears-plagiarize-michelle-obama-convention-speech-n612141">told Matt Lauer on the Today Show that she wrote it</a>: &quot;I read once over it, and that&apos;s all. Because I wrote it&#x2026;with as little help as possible.&quot; </p>

<p>Then, early this morning, senior Trump campaign communications adviser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/melania-trump-michelle-obama-225793">Jason Miller issued a statement</a> essentially admitting Melania Trump&apos;s speech was plagiarized, &quot;In writing her beautiful speech, Melania&apos;s team of writers took notes on her life&#x2019;s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking. Melania&#x2019;s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, Trump campaign manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/19/politics/melania-trump-michelle-obama-speech/index.html">Paul Manafort is vigorously denying plagiarism charges</a>. On CNN, he said, &quot;To think that she would do something like that knowing how scrutinized her speech was going to be last night is just really absurd... There&apos;s no cribbing of Michelle Obama&apos;s speech. These were common words and values&quot;&#x2014;and what Trump supporter is going to get hung up on these allegations when their candidate has consistently proven that he can say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/27/disgusting_donald_trump_desperately.php">whatever ugly, inflammatory thoughts</a> drift through his head with no consequence? </p>

<p>&quot;She cares about her family,&quot; Manafort added. &quot;To think that she&apos;d be cribbing Michelle Obama&apos;s words is crazy... This is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she seeks out to demean her and take her down. It&apos;s not going to work.&quot; But Clinton and her team hasn&apos;t said anything about this&#x2014;if anything, political commentators have been pointing out it shows a lack of professionalism within Donald&apos;s team. </p>

<p>Anyway, this only matters to people who care about these kinds of things; Trump&apos;s base&#x2014;as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://chicagoist.com/2016/07/18/republican_national_convention_day_1.php#photo-1">seen here</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126011633/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/18/america_first_unity_rally.php#photo-1">here in Cleveland</a>&#x2014;do not.</p>
