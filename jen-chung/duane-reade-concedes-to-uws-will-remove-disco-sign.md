                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_03_brightlight.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729193506im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_brightlight.jpg" width="365" height="275"> <br> <i>Bright lights at the new Duane Reade on the UWS (WCBS 2)</i></div> Ever since a &quot;new look&quot; Duane Reade opened up at West 72nd Street and Broadway, residents and local officials have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729193506/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/27/new_duane_reades_bright_lights_bug.php">complained about its extremely bright second floor LED screen</a>.  One woman said it was &quot;almost like a strobe light... It went from a very serene environment to like being in a club. When I&#x2019;m in bed, I can still see the flashes,&quot; and the Department of Buildings confirmed it was illegal. Now the drug store chain has decided to stop blinding residents and agreed to remove it.<p></p>

By Sunday evening, the once-bright sign had been turned off, leaving a blank black square looking down on the busy intersection.&quot; </p>

<p>Duane Reade said, &quot;At Duane Reade, part of the Walgreens family of companies, we strive to be good neighbors in all the communities we serve.&quot;  But don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be able to buy this giant screen on eBay&#x2014;it may be headed to a Duane Reade (or Walgreens) location in...Times Square.</p>
