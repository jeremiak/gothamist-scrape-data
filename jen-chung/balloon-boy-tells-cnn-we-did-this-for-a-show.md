<p><b>[UPDATE, 10 p.m. with video after the jump]</b>: &quot;Balloon&quot; boy Falcon Heene and family appear on CNN; Falcon tells his parents, CNN and the world that he didn&apos;t come out because &quot;we did this for a show.&quot;</p>

<p><b>3:10 p.m. </b>:  ABC&apos;s Denver affiliate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160533/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/21306839/detail.html">reports</a>, &quot;A 6-year-old boy is floating over northeastern Colorado in a homebuilt balloon and authorities are racing to try and rescue him. The balloon, in the shape of a flying saucer is covered in foil and filled with helium. The craft&apos;s dimensions are 20-feet across and 5-feet high.&quot; Somehow, the balloon became untethered&#x2014;the boy and his father &quot;had apparently been working on the aircraft for some time.&quot;  The authorities are tracking it and it&apos;s possible it could remain airborne for 12 hours. There&apos;s live video of the balloon&#x2014;which looks to be going pretty fast at times&#x2014;on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160533/http://www.myfoxny.com/subindex/video/live_video">MyFoxNY</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160533/http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/10/15/colorado.boy.balloon/index.html#cnnSTCVideo">CNN</a>. </p>

<p><b>UPDATE 3:38 p.m.</b>:  The balloon landed and the boy was not inside!  The child, identified as Falcon Heene, was seen getting into the gondola (and he apparently untied it from its anchor); it&apos;s unclear what happened to him.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160533/http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13568863">Denver Post notes</a> that the boy&apos;s father &quot;Richard Heene is an amateur scientist based out of Fort Collins. He and his partners call themselves the &apos;psyience detectives.&apos; Heene is a storm chaser who collects data to prove that rotating storms create their own magnetic fields.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the Heenes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160533/http://abc.go.com/shows/wife-swap/episode-guide/heenesilver/161743?page=2">were on Wife Swap:</a> &quot;When the Heene family aren&apos;t chasing storms, they devote their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160533/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/6-year-old-alone-in-hot-air-balloon-over-colorado/?hp">According to the Lede</a>,  the Larimer County emergency manager Erik Nilsson said, &quot;That&#x2019;s good news and that&#x2019;s bad news. He was no longer in danger from a balloon crash. The bad news is we don&#x2019;t know where he is.&quot;  Dozens of law enforcement officers are looking for Falcon and Nilsson added, &quot;I am hoping the scenario is that he is scared of punishment and does not want to be found.&quot;</p>

<p><b>UPDATE 6:17 p.m.</b>:  Thank goodness&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109160533/http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13568863">Denver Post now reports</a> that Falcon Heene found in his home&apos;s attic.  Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said, &quot;He was found in a box in the attic above the garage,&quot; and said that his parents didn&apos;t realize he was there, &quot;They thought he was missing.&quot;  The boy&apos;s older (9-year-old) brother had told his parents and investigators that Falcon was in the balloon that floated away.</p>
