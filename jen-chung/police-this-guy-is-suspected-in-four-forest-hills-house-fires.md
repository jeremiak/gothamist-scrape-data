<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062003/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/20/forest-hills-suspicious-fires/">series of suspicious Queens fires</a> has officially been deemed arson by the authorities. And the police have video of a suspect.</p>

<p>Many of the homes targeted are ones under construction or under renovation.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062003/http://nypost.com/2015/11/27/queens-serial-arsonist-caught-on-security-camera/"> The Post reports</a>, &quot;Rather than relying on an accelerant, the arsonist typically ignites combustible materials found at the sites, police sources said.&quot;</p>

Investigators also found a note, which appeared to be left there by the person setting the fires, at that site, according to police officials. It was not immediately known what the note said.&quot;</p>

<p>The neighborhood is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062003/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/20/forest-hills-suspicious-fires/">home to many Bukharan Jews</a>. One homeowner told NBC New York, &quot;I feel that we&#x2019;re under attack. It&#x2019;s some kind of sort of also terrorist attacks going against Bukharan Jews.&quot;</p>
