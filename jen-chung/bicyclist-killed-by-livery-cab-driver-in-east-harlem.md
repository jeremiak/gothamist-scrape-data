<p>A bicyclist was fatally struck by a livery cab driver earlier this morning in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Police say that at around 5:15 a.m., a 25-year-old bicyclist was traveling southbound on Park Avenue, as was a livery cab driver. When the driver started to make a left turn on East 108th Street, he struck the bicyclist. The bicyclist was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced DOA.</p>

<p>The driver was taken into custody; a police spokesman said it was more than likely he would be charged with driving with a suspended license, but the arrest is pending. </p>

<p>By the way, the police are in the middle of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014334/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/nypd_starts_2-week_bicycle_safety_e.php">two-week bicyclist crackdown</a>.</p>
