<p>The New Yorker has been pretty clear about its feelings toward Donald Trump, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014954/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/29/trump_new_yorker_cover.php">as various</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014954/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/12/sad_trump_new_yorker_cover.php">covers show</a> (if they only knew how apt the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014954/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/17/the_new_yorkers_new_cover_will_feat.php">July 2015 &quot;bellyflopping Trump&quot; cover</a> would be), so it&apos;s not surprising that the esteemed magazine is #WithHer. But in next week&apos;s issue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014954/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/21/putin_is_trumps_first_lady_in_new_n.php">whose cover hypothesizes</a> a possible Hillary Clinton swearing-in with Bubba at her side while Trump&apos;s inauguration would have Vladimir Putin, the Talk of the Town section will be dedicated to an endorsement of Clinton.</p>

<p>Rachel Maddow broke the news last night, reading an excerpt from next week&apos;s issue:</p>

<blockquote>On November 8th, barring some astonishment, the people of the United State will, after two hundred and forty years, send a woman to the White House. The election of Hillary Clinton is an event that we will welcome for its immense historical import, and greet with indescribable relief. It will be especially gratifying to have a woman as commander-in-chief after such a sickeningly sexist and racist campaign. On every issue of consequence, including economic policy, the environment, and foreign affairs, Hillary Clinton is a distinctly capable candidate: experienced, serious, schooled, resilient. 

<p>Hillary Clinton&apos;s vision and temperament are the opposite of her opponent&apos;s. ... Her story is about walking through flames and emerging changed, warned and more determined. ... We wish that Clinton faced a worthy opponent: she deserves a less sullied, more substantive win. </p>

<p>Electing a female President means imagining new possibilities: that a woman might survive that gauntlet of derision to hold power with confidence, without apology, to enlarge our notions of authority and hasten an age when a female President will no longer be exceptional. .. That&apos;s a thrilling possibility for all Americans. </p></blockquote>The New Yorker has had some great features on the election&#x2014;Larissa MacFarquhar&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014954/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/in-the-heart-of-trump-country">visit to West Virginia coal country</a> is one, as is Ryan Lizza&apos;s profile on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014954/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/kellyanne-conways-political-machinations">Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway</a>.<p></p>
