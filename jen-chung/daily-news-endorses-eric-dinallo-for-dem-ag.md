										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_08_edinallo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101025357im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_08_edinallo.jpg" width="210" height="193" class="image-left"> </span>A day after getting praise (but not an endorsement) from the NY Times, Eric Dinallo has received the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101025357/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/22/2010-08-22_go_with_dinallo.html">Daily News editorial board&apos;s endorsement for the Democratic nomination</a> for NY State Attorney General.  A former prosecutor in the Manhattan DA&apos;s office as well as State AG&apos;s office (under Spitzer), Dinallo is described by the News as having a &quot;blend of first-rate legal, executive and regulatory experience that is unique among the contenders and equips him best to lead New York&apos;s top law office amid rising challenges.&quot;</p>

<p>The News&apos; endorsement also says, &quot;During a stint as a bureau chief in the attorney general&apos;s office, Dinallo devised the legal strategies that thrust the agency to the forefront of cracking down on financial industry conflicts of interest. In the process, he won a $1.4 billion settlement from 10 big banks. Later, serving as state insurance superintendent, Dinallo played a critical role in stabilizing AIG when the company&apos;s exposure to subprime mortgage securities threatened the economy. Bottom line: Dinallo has gotten the job done across a career that also included prosecuting violent and white-collar crime for the Manhattan district attorney, advising financial firms on following the rules and, now, serving as a professor of business ethics at New York University.&quot; </p>

<p>As for the other four candidates: The News&apos; runner-up praise is for Nassau County DA Kathleen Rice (she&apos;s &quot;brought professionalism and dynamism to an office that had grown sleepy&quot;); State Senator Eric Schneiderman, the Times&apos; endorsed candidate, and Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, are faulted for being too close to Albany&apos;s dysfunction; and Sean Coffey has the baggage of donating to &quot;pension fund powerbrokers.&quot;</p>

<p>The primary is September 14; the Republican candidate is already set&#x2014;Staten Island DA  Daniel Donovan.</p>
