<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_09_rexryanfi.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_09_rexryanfi.jpg" width="170" height="233" class="image-left"> </span>Jets wide receiver Braylon Edwards addressed his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/21/jets_wide_receiver_braylon_edwards.php">Tuesday morning DWI</a> yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/jets/2010/09/braylon-edwards-i-dont-underst.html">telling reporters</a>,  &quot;I don&#x2019;t understand the black eye that this would put on the organization. Because this isn&#x2019;t a representation of what this organization is about. This isn&#x2019;t what Rex Ryan, Mike Tannenbaum and Woody teach. It&#x2019;s isn&#x2019;t. This is a situation that I&#x2019;m in - that I put myself in. <strong>So I don&#x2019;t see how this could be a black eye for them. More so be a black eye for myself if anything.</strong>.. It was sad for me (being) in that situation. I don&#x2019;t know if I would describe it (as) embarrassed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Funnily enough, when Jets coach Rex Ryan addressed reporters, he said, &quot;Quite honestly, I&apos;m basically tired of dealing with these issues. I&apos;m tired of the embarrassment to our owner and this organization. Let&apos;s just end it. Let&apos;s just stop. However severe or minor, we don&apos;t need to be that team.&quot; Says the man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/01/rex_ryan_apologizes_for_stupid_inap.php">flipped the bird</a> at a Florida mixed martial arts event, showed off his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/28/rex_ryan_discusses_fingergate_belly.php">belly at a hockey game</a> and put sailors to shame with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://deadspin.com/5633140/jet-blue-a-multimedia-analysis-of-rex-ryans-swearing-week-4">Hard Knocks swearing</a>! Of course, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/bombshell_reporter_male_hormone_rag.php">&quot;hot reporter&quot; incident</a> doesn&apos;t help things.</p>

<p>Edwards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/braylon_edwards_asked_cops_to_let_h.php">reportedly went to nightclubs</a> after a fundraiser held by a teammate and was eventually pulled over by cops in Midtown west for his &quot;overly tinted&quot; Range Rover windows.  He said, &quot;I have my own car service that I use all the time. I never drive to the city. I don&#x2019;t know my way around the city. I don&#x2019;t like driving to the city. Yesterday was probably the third time I&#x2019;ve ever driven to the city of New York.&#x201D; He apologized, adding, &#x201C;I&apos;m human. I&apos;m not the first person to make a mistake.&quot; Yeah, but your friend, just hours after you were drinking with him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115348/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont&#xE9;_Stallworth#Manslaughter_charges">fatally struck a man</a>!  </p>
