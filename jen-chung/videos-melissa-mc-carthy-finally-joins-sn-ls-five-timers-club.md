</div></div>					<p>Melissa McCarthy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201212/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/07/videos_melissa_mccarthy_hosts_best.php#photo-1">always a reliably</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201212/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/02/videos_saturday_night_live_6.php#photo-1">excellent host</a>, has helped elevate this season of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to new peaks with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201212/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/14/spiceys_back_melissa_mccarthy_snl.php#photo-1">her Sean Spicer impression</a>, and now she&apos;s made the legendary Five-Timers club. After not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201212/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/14/videos_melissa_mccarthy_joins_five-.php#photo-1">quite making the club last year,</a> McCarthy was genuinely surprised and moved when Steve Martin (who has hosted 15 times) appeared at the end of the show to present her with her own Five-Timers smoking jacket. </p>

<p>Her status was cemented by a solid outing as host. Besides offering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201212/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/14/spiceys_back_melissa_mccarthy_snl.php">a new turn as Spicer</a>, she charmed with a Mother&apos;s Day monologue that plucked a mom named Joan from the audience and took her on a whirlwind backstage tour of the set&#x2014;Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds happened to be hanging around&#x2014;and gave Joan an opportunity to walk out as an SNL host. </p>

<p>McCarthy also went above and beyond with physical comedy in a dessert-themed game show that had her repeatedly pelted with pies and cakes, and then doused with high-powered sprays of water. She also proved she&apos;s not afraid of unflattering wigs, from a suburban moms skit to a bit about a production company&apos;s logo.</p>

<p>Other highlights included an awesome commercial for Amazon Echo for senior citizens (&quot;I don&apos;t know about that&quot;); an update on Leslie Jones&apos; and Kyle Mooney&apos;s relationship; some veteran Hollywood actresses sharing their thoughts on the film industry; and a Weekend Update with Michael Che&apos;s neighbor Cathy as well as Pete Davidson talking about his $40,000 horse-focused rehab stint. </p>
