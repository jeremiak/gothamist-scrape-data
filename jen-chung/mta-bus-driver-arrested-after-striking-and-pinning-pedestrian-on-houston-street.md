He tried to pry her free as she asked for her family, but failed during the &apos;hectic&apos; aftermath. &apos;She was asking for help and wanted the bus off of her but they told (her) that they couldn&apos;t,&apos; Juan Santana, 22, said. &apos;I just really wanted to help her and her family out as quick as I can.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>EMS did manage to free the woman&apos;s leg and she was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she was treated for a broken leg and abrasions. </p>

<p>The bus driver, Eduard Khanikov, was taken to Beth Israel Hospital for trauma&#x2014;and he was also charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian.</p>
