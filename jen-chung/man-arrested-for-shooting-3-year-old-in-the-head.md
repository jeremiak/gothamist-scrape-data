                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_08_3yo2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828052547im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_3yo2.jpg" width="365" height="285" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, a three-year-old boy was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828052547/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/24/toddler_shot_in_head_in_brooklyn.php">shot in the head</a> in a Brooklyn apartment. Now, a 22-year-old family acquaintance has been arrested for assault, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal possession of a weapon&#x2014;but neighbors are slamming the boy&apos;s mother for putting him in danger repeatedly.</p>

<p>According to reports, the little boy, identified as Tharell Edward, was left in the care of his mother Nichelle Edward&apos;s roommate in a Ditmas Park apartment. The roommate had invited neighbor Akeem Bernard over, and at some point, Bernard allegedly shot the boy. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828052547/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_tot_shot_in_head_c3bBGil7csfBuyIdn0s8gJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">Post reports</a>, &quot;The circumstances of the shooting were unclear, and a source said cops had no reason to believe it was not an accident.&quot;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828052547/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-horror-3-year-old-boy-alive-shot-head-apartment-article-1.1435778">Bernard denied the charges</a>, telling reporters as he was being led into a police van, &quot;I did not shoot anybody.&quot; However, the victim&apos;s sister told the Daily News, &quot;My mother had just left and the girl got up to use the bathroom. She heard a gunshot and the guy was trying to act like he didn&#x2019;t know what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Tharell, who remains in critical condition, had been recovering from being mauled by a pit bull earlier this year. A neighbor, Tony Reid, criticized Nichelle Edward, telling the News, &quot;She&#x2019;s very irresponsible, very neglectful. She had a dog that bit the baby and when the baby came back from the hospital the child fell down the staircase that week. Twice that week.&quot; The pit bull reportedly belonged to Nichelle Edward&apos;s boyfriend, and neighbors also said she often stayed at a boyfriend&apos;s home.</p>

<p>Another neighbor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828052547/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-horror-3-year-old-boy-alive-shot-head-apartment-article-1.1435778">Jay Nichols, agreed</a>, &quot;The dog bit him in the side. He had to wear a colostomy bag ... He&#x2019;s 3-years-old. He shouldn&#x2019;t have to live in these kind of conditions.&quot;</p>

<p>Neighbor Jacintha Fleming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828052547/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_tot_shot_in_head_c3bBGil7csfBuyIdn0s8gJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">even said to the Post</a>, &quot;I hope they take that child away. He&#x2019;s not safe. She [Nichelle] needs to be a better mother. He&#x2019;s supposed to be safe in his own home. He&#x2019;s overcome a lot, but I think it&#x2019;s time for her to get into trouble. I&#x2019;m not sorry for her. I&#x2019;m sorry for the baby.&quot;</p>
