<p>After what seems like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161044/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/19/washington_squa_5.php">ages of renovations</a>, Washington Square Park is back to its glorious self with fountain turned on and parkgoers enjoying the lack of construction material in the way.</p>

<p>A tipster told Curbed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161044/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/05/19/live_from_washington_square_park_alls_pretty_and_clean.php">which has more photographs</a>, &quot;It&apos;s all very pretty, and clean -- but it looks like the local dogs will take care of that pronto. Nothing like days of yore (yet). Neither a guitar nor blunt in sight.&quot;</p>
