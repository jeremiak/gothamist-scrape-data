<p>News flash: Residents and business owners who have been bravely withstanding the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808151119/http://gothamist.com/tags/2ndavenuesubway">Second Avenue Subway construction</a> are <em>still miserable</em>. Based on constituents&apos; complaints of &quot;noxious odors and dust plumes&quot; from East 69th Street and Second Avenue, Rep. Carolyn Maloney has asked the MTA to &quot;redouble [its] efforts to mitigate quality-of-life concerns related to the subway project.&quot; And she also wants to the MTA to confirm that the site is safe. </p>

<p>Other politicians chimed in:  Assemblyman Micah Kellner said, &quot;<strong>The dust storms created by the subway construction make Second Avenue seem like the badlands of Texas.</strong> This isn&#x2019;t a matter to be taken lightly; asthma and allergies are at their peak during the summer months.  This dust is only adding to those health concerns.  We need to hold the MTA accountable so that East Siders have breathable air,&quot; while City Councilman Dan Gardonick said, &quot;East Siders have put up with many inconveniences and disruptions from this project -- but when it raises questions of air quality and health, we need answers -- and action.&quot;  </p>

<p>Beyond health issues, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808151119/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/06/26/residents-say-smell-dust-coming-from-2nd-avenue-subway-construction/">one resident told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;They blast all day long. The noise is outrageous. You cannot even hear the person you are with,&quot; adding that frustrated residents can&apos;t even think about moving, &quot;It&#x2019;s bad, it&#x2019;s terrible. It is a co-op and people are complaining about the real estate values. They are trying to sell and they can&#x2019;t sell.&quot;</p>

<p>In more positive 2nd Avenue Subway news, the project received $197 million in federal funds.</p>
