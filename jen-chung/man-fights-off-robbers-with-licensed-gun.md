One man fired at him, but the 35-year-old homeowner &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054512/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-lishot0827,0,6328301.story">fired back</a>&quot; with his licensed Glock 9mm.  No one was hit and the two robbers fled.  Police were able to find one of the suspects, Jose Celis, who was charged with attempted murder and robbery.  Police are still looking for the second suspect.  Newsday says that police &quot;could not immediately say if [the victim&apos;s] pistol license -- or the attempted robbery and assault -- was related to his business.&quot;</p>
