<p>Because we need to be reminded of good things and good people, here&apos;s another heartwarming feature on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031051747/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/janitor_works_20_years_to_earn_colu.php">inspiring Columbia University janitor</a> who has spent the last 20 years learning English and working his way to get a B.A. in classics. Gac Filipaj, who fled war-torn Yugoslavia in 1992, will graduate from Columbia&apos;s School of General Studies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031051747/http://www.columbia.edu/content/school-general-studies.html">this Sunday</a>. While he is very proud, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031051747/http://abcnews.go.com/US/custodian-gac-filipaj-graduate-columbia-university-19-years/story?id=16311041#.T6vfyZ9YtfR">Filipaj also says he wished he had told his father</a> (who died three weeks ago) that he had been studying &quot;because he thought that I&apos;m not that smart.&quot; Plus, he still sends most of his income back home to Yugoslavia. Uh, is it a little dusty in here?</p>

<p>Columbia employees are allowed tuition exemptions for a certain number of courses per semester (Filipaj earned his B.A. in 12 years; he found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031051747/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/janitor_who_earned_columbia_ba_says.php">Ancient Greek difficult and Latin easier</a>).  Peter Awn, the dean of the School of General Studies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031051747/http://abcnews.go.com/US/custodian-gac-filipaj-graduate-columbia-university-19-years/story?id=16311041#.T6vfyZ9YtfR">told ABC News</a> that other employees that take courses are &quot;in class with all of the other highly talented undergraduates. Students with untraditional backgrounds add significantly to intellectual discourse.&quot;</p>

<p>Awn added, &quot;You meet him and even when he&apos;s working, you get a big smile and you can just see this sense of pride in what he&apos;s doing here at Columbia. He&apos;s one of those people that believe that if you work hard at anything, be that his custodial responsibilities or his academic responsibilities, you can create that sense of accomplishment and value.&quot; And yes, Filipaj says that he has been recognized by classmates while working as a janitor.</p>

<p>Filipaj&apos;s statement about his undergraduate time lauded his professors and &quot;being in classes with young people who are extremely mature in their approach to their coursework.&quot;  As we know, Filipaj&apos;s next goal is a Ph.D.</p>
