Akselrod added, &quot;They&apos;re my life. I would never put them in danger.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The 35-year-old mother explains that one of her sons had been sick&#x2014;he went to the emergency room on Sunday&#x2014;and had slept in nearly a day.  When she went to the Fair Lawn CVS, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182255/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Babies-Left-Moving-Minivan-Mother-Arrested-Fair-Lawn-New-Jersey-152679875.html">she noticed he was finally sleeping</a>, &quot;This was the first time he fell asleep in 22 hours, and I did think, take him out in the pouring rain and put them in the stroller? Or just run in?&quot; So she ran in, leaving the babies in the car.  But then the minivan, which was in neutral &quot;started to roll through the parking lot.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Record, &quot;A witness, Elliot Hecht, said the van rolled out of its parking spot and almost hit another car that was driving through the lot. He said a passer-by pulled a crying baby out of the car, which apparently was not locked, and the child fell silent as the man cradled him in his arms.&quot;</p>

<p>Akselrod is due for a hearing tonight at 6 p.m. Her lawyer said she would plead not guilty and that Akselfrod was upset at being away from her children for so long since she is breastfeeding, &quot;I think my client has suffered enough. This happens in towns across America. Moms have errands to run.<strong> I don&#x2019;t think we want to put moms in jail for doing what they need to do.&quot;</strong></p>
