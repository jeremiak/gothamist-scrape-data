                            <p>A reader sent us photographs of an incident that happened last night: A cyclist was hit and apparently run over by a cab just after 7 p.m. at Broadway and East 4th Street in Manhattan.</p>

<p>The tipster told us, &quot;I&apos;m kind of in shock so you&apos;re gonna have to get details from someone else, but <strong>I just witnessed this guy get pulled under a cab</strong>... According to witnesses the cabbie was clearly at fault.&quot; He added that he wasn&apos;t sure whether the cab driver was at fault, because he didn&apos;t see the street lights, &quot;I only saw the actual collision and the aftermath.&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY confirmed that a male cyclist in his 20s was hit by a cab (they received the call at 7:05 p.m. and were there three minutes later, taking him to the hospital at 7:23 p.m.). The NYPD didn&apos;t have any details; keep in mind, the NYPD only investigates incidents where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020611/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/heres_why_drivers_get_away_with_mur.php">victims are likely to die</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020611/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/nypd_issues_sweeping_changes_to_cra.php">are critically injured</a>. </p>
