Gary McGurk, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024456/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/ex-boyfriend_pleads_guilty_to_killi.php">pleaded guilty to murdering Michelle Lee</a> last month, apologized to her family in court.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024456/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/06/16/2010-06-16_killer_gary_mcgurk_who_hammered_stabbed_and_burned_lover_michelle_lee_apologizes.html">According to the Daily News</a>, he said, &quot;I hope that in the years to come God will help you through this. Michelle is safe with him now. I don&apos;t ask for forgiveness because I don&apos;t deserve it... I will meet my maker one day and receive my punishment that day as I receive my punishment today. I can only hope the years to come will be easier... May she rest in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>Lee, who had met McGurk at John Jay, had also given McGurk money because he lied about having cancer.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024456/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/fatal_attraction_rh6ySMJAInnAcBCArqv8eI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">prosecutor read from her journal</a>, &quot;Dear Journal, My mind is rambling... I&apos;m not ready to lose Gar... I&apos;m trying to figure out the right time to tell him I love him. I truly do... He&apos;s so brave. I can&apos;t stop thinking. I can&apos;t stop crying. I love him so much. I wish he would get better. I wish I could hold him forever.&quot; </p>

<p>McGurk had tried to cover up his tracks by creating a &quot;psychopathic crime scene&quot; in Lee&apos;s Sunnyside apartment&#x2014;he burned Lee&apos;s belly with an iron, tied her to a bed with a cell phone charger cord, and stabbed her in the neck, as well as striking her in the head. Lee&apos;s sister told McGurk, &quot;Knowing what you put her through makes my blood boil.&quot; Judge Gregory Lasak agreed to the plea deal to spare Lee&apos;s family a trial (the family agreed to the deal), but he said, &quot;This makes no sense at all. You deserve a life sentence, Mr. McGurk. You know that.&quot;</p>
