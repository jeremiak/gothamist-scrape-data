<p>Partiers at a West Village hotel assaulted a man in an elevator while yelling anti-gay slurs last weekend.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at 1 a.m. at the Jane Hotel on October 30th during the hotel&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152137/http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1346543-halloween-night-jane-hotel-new-york/">Halloween at the Jane Hotel Ballroom&quot; party</a>.</p>

<p>A 36-year-old man was in an elevator when, the NYPD says, one person in a large group &quot;made an anti-gay statement towards the victim. One of the individuals then punched the victim, while another kicked the victim in the face.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim suffered a laceration to his forehead and went to Mount Sinai for treatment.</p>

<p>The suspects, described as five males and two females, around 20-30 years old, fled. Here&apos;s video of the suspects in costumes:</p>
