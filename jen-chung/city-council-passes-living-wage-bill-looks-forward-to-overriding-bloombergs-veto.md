<p>Yesterday, after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602144408/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/video_christine_quinn_not_amused_wh.php">contentious press conference</a>, the City Council passed the living wage bill, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602144408/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/empire/2012/apr/30/expected-city-council-passes-living-wage-bill-wide-margin/">in a 45-5 vote</a>.  </p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg is poised to veto the bill (the way he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602144408/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/billionaire_bloomberg_vetoes_living.php">did with the prevailing wage bill last week</a>) but the Council will be ready to override that veto.  How does that work?  Here&apos;s what the City Council&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602144408/http://council.nyc.gov/html/about/legislative.shtml">procedures say</a>:</p><blockquote>If the Mayor disapproves/vetoes the bill, he or she must return it to the City Clerk with his or her objections to the Council by the next scheduled Stated Meeting.<p></p>

<p>The Council then has 30 days to override the Mayoral veto.</p>

<p>If the Council does repass the bill by a vote of two-thirds of all Council Members (at least 34 members), it is then considered adopted and becomes a local law.</p>

<p>If the Mayor does not sign or veto the bill within 30 days after receiving it from the Council, it is considered approved automatically.</p></blockquote>At yesterday&apos;s press conference, Quinn stormed off after someone called Bloomberg a &quot;pharoah&quot;&#x2014;Quinn explained it was rude to call names at someone who disagreed with them.  But Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, who, like Quinn, is eyeing a mayoral run, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602144408/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/council_defies_mike_passes_living_DgvTYtMs0ryszVMsZg2RoJ">said of Quinn&apos;s apparent defense of Bloomberg</a>, &quot;Here you have a crowd of folks who believe in living wage. They&#x2019;re angry; they&#x2019;re energized to create change. Of course they&#x2019;re going to feel angry at Mayor Bloomberg... I think she has to realize on an issue like this ... the mayor is in the wrong place.&quot;<p></p>
