</div></div>					<p><b>[Updated with more photos and a video below]</b> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201546/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldtradecenter">World Trade Center</a> site has been synonymous with excavation for the past eight+ years, but it was only recently that a ship from the late 1700s was found.  Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman told us that it was found during work for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201546/http://www.panynj.gov/wtcprogress/vehicle-security-center.html">Vehicle Security Center</a>.  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201546/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/18th-century-ship-found-at-trade-center-site/#more-197009">City Room reports</a>:</p><blockquote>By Wednesday, the outlines made it plain: a 30-foot length of a wood-hulled vessel had been discovered about 20 to 30 feet below street level on the World Trade Center site, the first such large-scale archaeological find along the Manhattan waterfront since 1982, when an 18th-century cargo ship came to light at 175 Water Street.<p></p>

<p>The area under excavation, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, had not been dug out for the original trade center. The vessel, presumably dating from the mid- to late 1700s, was evidently undisturbed more than 200 years.</p></blockquote><br>
The ship had been preserved by the ground water and sediment, so now, with it exposed to the air, it&apos;s starting to deteriorate.  Archaeologists have flocked to the site to examine the hull. Molly McDonald, of AKRF, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201546/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7555787">told the AP,</a> &quot;We noticed curved timbers that a back hoe brought up. We quickly found the rib of a vessel and continued to clear it away and expose the hull over the last two days.... We&apos;re going to send timber samples to a laboratory to do dendrochronology that will help us to get a sense of when the boat was constructed.&quot;<p></p>

<p>As for why the boat was buried: Another AKRF archaeologist, A. Michael Pappalardo, and NY State Historic Preservation chief regional archaeologist Doug Mackey told City Room that the &quot;sawed-off beams seemed to indicate that the hull had deliberately been truncated, most likely to be used as landfill material.&quot;  City Room also has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201546/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/18th-century-ship-found-at-trade-center-site/#more-197009">slideshow of the unearthed ship</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Some more photographs, plus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201546/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/world.trade.center.2.1806580.html">WCBS 2 asked some people</a> what they thought and folks were EXCITED: &quot;It&apos;s amazing. <strong>I don&apos;t know what else could be under there! There must be other stuff!</strong>&quot;</p>
