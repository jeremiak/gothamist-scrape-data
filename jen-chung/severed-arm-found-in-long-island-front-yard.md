Now Nassau County police are determining whether the arm might be related to the female body parts found on Tuesday in Suffolk County.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012146/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/09/shocking-discovery-on-long-island-police-find-arm-in-hempstead-yard/">According to 1010 WINS</a>, Jose Diaz said &quot;that he and his family started smelling something in their front yard on Tuesday. When the smell persisted on Wednesday, his brother-in-law Noel Rivera went to check it out.&quot; Rivera thought it was a dead animal at first, but then saw fingernails. Diaz said, &quot;He saw a lot of flies on top and around,&quot; and that Rivera nearly passed out.</p>

<p>The Nassau County police arrived&#x2014;even bringing a cadaver dog to look for more remains&#x2014;as did investigators from Suffolk County, who are looking into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012146/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/in-bay-shore-partially-dismembered-female-body-found-in-empty-lot-police-say-1.8723642">remains found in Bay Shore</a>. That partially dismembered body was discovered near the Fire Island Ferries parking lot. Investigators are now trying to determine whether the remains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012146/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/body-found-lot-missing-brooklyn-woman-police-article-1.1861240">belong to a missing Brooklyn woman</a>, who had been having problems with a landlord.</p>

Very carefully drop it because it wasn&apos;t like far from the fence. They didn&apos;t even, didn&apos;t even throw it. Just reach from the fence, put it in there. That&apos;s it... To do something like this it was a premeditated act to cut up somebody like that and drop them here and there. I want justice is done.&quot;</p>
