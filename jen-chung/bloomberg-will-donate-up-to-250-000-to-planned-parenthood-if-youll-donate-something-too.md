<p>After the Susan G. Komen Foundation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615213414/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/susan_g_komen_foundation_ends_plann.php">pulled its breast cancer prevention-related funding</a> from Planned Parenthood, numerous people have been stepping up to donate to Planned Parenthood. And Mayor Bloomberg wants to donate $250,000&#x2014;and have others donate another $250,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615213414/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/bloomberg-to-give-250000-to-planned-parenthood/">CityRoom reports</a> that he&apos;s offering to match $1 to every new dollar donated to Planned Parenthood, up to $250,000.  Bloomberg said, &quot;Politics have no place in health care. Breast cancer screening saves lives and hundreds of thousands of women rely on Planned Parenthood for access to care. We should be helping women access that care, not placing barriers in their way.&quot; </p>

<p>Right now, Planned Parenthood has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615213414/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/actually_planned_parenthood_made_65.php">raised about $650,000 in the 24 hours</a> after it was revealed Komen was defunding them. Komen claims that it&apos;s because there&apos;s a House investigation into Planned Parenthood&apos;s practices, but the investigation was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615213414/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/27/planned-parenthood-investigation-government-resources_n_984002.html"> launched by a pro-life Congressman</a>.  Komen&apos;s grants were around $680,000 in 2011 and $580,000 in 2010; if Mayor Bloomberg donated the full amount, matching $250,000 in others&apos; donations, then over $1 million would be raised.  The mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615213414/https://twitter.com/#!/MikeBloomberg/status/165181833653403650">just Tweeted</a>, &quot;Please donate to help #PlannedParenthood&apos;s breast cancer screening program &amp; I&apos;ll match up to $250,000: bit.ly/ylZqbs #standwithPP&quot; </p>

<p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America president Cecile Richards said, &quot;On behalf of hundreds of thousands of women nationwide who rely on Planned Parenthood for breast cancer education and screening, we are enormously grateful to Mayor Bloomberg. This contribution will help ensure that politics don&#x2019;t interfere with women having access to health care. People all across the country have stepped forward in the last 48 hours to offer help and support, and the Mayor&#x2019;s donation will help ensure that no woman is denied breast cancer services because of right-wing political pressure campaigns.&quot;</p>
