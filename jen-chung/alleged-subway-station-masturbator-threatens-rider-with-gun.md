<p>According to the NYPD, this happened on Monday, October 19th, at 11:56 p.m.: A 38-year-old woman was on the southbound platform of the 5th Avenue N/R station &quot;when she heard a hissing noise beside her. When she looked to see what the noise was, she observed the suspect manipulating his penis outside of his pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that when the suspect began to leave, the woman began to cry. A man asked her what was wrong, and she explained what happened&#x2014;prompting the man to take out his cellphone and follow the suspect and film him.</p>

<p>As he reached the exit, the suspect allegedly &quot;pulled out a black handgun, pointed [it at the man]&quot; and told him to mind his own business.&quot; </p>

<p>There were no reported injuries. The police released the cellphone footage, showing a man with a mustache wearing a grey suit:</p>
