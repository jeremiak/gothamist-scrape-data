A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510225719/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10022008/news/regionalnews/lt__who_ordered_fatal_tasering_kills_sel_131828.htm">told the Post</a>, &quot;He didn&apos;t want his family to see him cuffed up and jailed. The guy felt he disgraced his family.&quot; </p>

<p>Last week, Pigott ordered a sergeant to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510225719/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/25/after_cop_tasers_him_naked_man_fall.php"> Taser an emotionally disturbed man</a>, Iman Morales, who was standing naked on a storefront ledge in Brooklyn.  Though ESU called for an airbag to catch Morales, it hadn&apos;t arrived yet and Morales fell on his head, dying at a hospital later.  </p>

<p>The incident was caught on tape and the NYPD said it seemed the Tasering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510225719/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/25/nypd_brooklyn_mans_taser_death_brok.php">broke department guidelines</a> and Pigott was stripped of his badge and gun.  Earlier this week, Pigott had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510225719/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/01/tasered_mans_family_will_sue.php">publicly apologized</a> and the 21-year NYPD veteran had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510225719/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/nyregion/03taser.html?hp">receiving department counseling</a>, apparently being told to take  &quot;a few days to rest up,&quot; according to a Daily News source.  The source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510225719/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/10/02/2008-10-02_nypd_lt_michael_pigott_who_ordered_fatal.html">also said</a>, &quot;He was very distraught and upset what had happened...No one saw this coming.  It is very tragic.&quot;</p>
