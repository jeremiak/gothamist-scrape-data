On Friday afternoon, Qi Ming Weng had apparently fallen off his electric bicycle riding on Second Avenue near 96th Street when a MTA express bus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110053/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/26/mta_finds_bus_driver_involved_in_fa.php">rolled over him</a>, crushing his skull.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110053/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/slain_guy_kin_blame_nd_ave_chaos_vV5Kwc5qkp1Y1z0P6g94pO">Post reports</a> that Weng&apos;s relatives are blaming it on the Second Avenue subway construction that is taking up lanes.<p></p>

<p>Weng&apos;s aunt also can&apos;t believe that the bus driver, who was off-duty and driving to his route, didn&apos;t realize he had hit someone, &quot;I don&apos;t believe the driver. He should have stopped.&quot;  </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110053/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/26/2011-03-26_city_bus_fatally_strikes_biker.html">witness told the Daily News</a> that the bus struck Weng to avoid a car that swerved into the bus&apos;s way, but he also said the Second Avenue subway construction was at fault, &quot;The construction kills everything around here and now it kills people.&quot; A few of our readers agreed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110053/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/26/mta_finds_bus_driver_involved_in_fa.php">commenting yesterday</a>, The second ave project is hurting a lot of people. It squeezes lanes, obstructs visibility, just a big mess,&quot; and &quot;I biked almost all the way through the construction on 2nd ave, it&apos;s pretty terrifying. Eventually we had so many near misses because people are not driving any slower or taking any precautions in their cars/taxis/buses despite the horrible condition of the road.&quot;</p>
