<p>Listen, people&#x2014;do not mess with pregnant ladies on the subway.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174339/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/03/pregnant_lady_slashes_straphanger_o.php">They may slash you</a>.  They will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174339/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/30/pregnant_women_find_subway_seats_ha.php">bitch and moan</a> about the assholes who refuse to give up their seats to them, especially the ones who claim, &quot;I didn&apos;t ask them to get pregnant.&quot; They will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174339/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/09/pregnant_woman_ticketed_while_tryin.php">even tempt a NYPD ticket</a> by breaking the rules and traveling between subway cars in search of a damn seat. </p>

<p>So now a local sports radio show&apos;s advertising campaign is jumping into this contentious topic with a new ad that says, &quot;ALWAYS OFFER YOUR SUBWAY SEAT TO A PREGNANT WOMAN UNLESS SHE&apos;S WEARING A RED SOX HAT.&quot;  The ad is for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174339/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/content-vertical/boomer-carton/">Boomer &amp; Carton, the WFAN show</a> hosted by former Jets QB Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton.  Where&apos;s the &quot;If someone is dying, call 911&#x2014;unless they&apos;re wearing a New England Patriots hat&quot; sign?</p>

<noscript><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174339/http://polldaddy.com/poll/6143782/">Would you give up your subway seat to a Red Sox fan?</a></noscript></p>

<p>copyranter, curmudgeon of all curmudgeons, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174339/http://www.buzzfeed.com/copyranter/new-york-city-subway-ad-says-dont-offer-your-seat">explains/opines</a>, &quot;In an effort to attract more moronic immature mooks, this is an ad currently up in the New York subway system. It&apos;s a joke! Lighten up! Anything goes in the New York-Boston rivalry! If it was even a mildly funny joke, I might agree.&quot;</p>
