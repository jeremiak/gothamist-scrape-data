<p>A Suffolk County judge sentenced David Laffer, who killed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140721184154/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/police_raid_li_home_in_connection_w.php">four people</a> at a Medford pharmacy on Father&apos;s Day, to five consecutive life sentences in prison.  Judge James Hudson, who also sentenced him to 25 years, plus five years probation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140721184154/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/li_massacre_suspect_resisted_arrest.php#photo-1">for robbing the pharmacy of thousands of prescription pills,</a> asked that Laffer be put in solitary confinement for his time behind bars.  </p>

<p>Laffer&apos;s victims were Haven Drugs worker Jennifer Mejia, 17; pharmacist Raymond Ferguson, 45; and customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, and Jamie Taccetta, 33. Suffolk County prosecutors painted a horrifying timeline: Laffer allegedly &quot;simply shot [Ferguson] after engaging the pharmacist in conversation&quot; and then went to steal the hydrocodone. Then, after spotting Mejia, Suffolk ADA John Collins says Laffer shot her twice. Taccetta&apos;s fiance, who had been waiting outside in a car, was the one who discovered the carnage. Laffer will face life without parole at his sentencing.  Laffer had been stealing the drugs for himself and his wife Melinda Brady, who drove the getaway care.  Brady was sentenced to 25 years.  </p>

<p>Taccetta&apos;s mother Patricia read a victim&apos;s impact statement, &quot;I hope that you, David Laffer, live to be 100 years old and every minute of every day you have to think about what you took from us. And you, Melinda Brady, I am so glad that you will never be able to have children or the privilege to have a family... You both are cowards and the scum of the earth for what you did to my family.&quot;</p>

<p>Laffer, who claimed that his gun went off when it got snagged on his backpack (prosecutors say video shows him deliberately firing), didn&apos;t ask to be forgiven, &quot;To ask for forgiveness is a selfish act... If some discussion of doctor-shopping and prescription pill abuse results from this, then perhaps some good will have come from this.&quot;</p>
