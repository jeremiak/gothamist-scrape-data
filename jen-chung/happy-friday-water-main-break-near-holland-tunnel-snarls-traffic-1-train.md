<p>Commutes to the west side of lower Manhattan are a mess&#x2014;a water main break at Varick and Spring Streets broke before 6 a.m. Not only are some lanes of Varick Street closed, the northbound 1 train is &quot;running local from South Ferry to Chambers St, then express to 14 Street&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012826/http://www.mta.info/status/subway/123/23549049"> according to the MTA</a> (which is better than its previous suspension between South Ferry and 42nd Street.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012826/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/26753531/water-main-break-near-holland-tunnel">According to MyFoxNY</a>, &quot;The water appeared to have been shut off or greatly diminished at about 7 a.m. Traffic to the outbound Holland Tunnel is impacted. Motorists are advised to avoid the 7th Ave. approach to Varick St.&quot; Most of the water was caught in storm drains.</p>
