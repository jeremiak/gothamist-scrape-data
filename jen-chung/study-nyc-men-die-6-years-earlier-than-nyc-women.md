The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released a report about the longevity of New Yorkers. The big factoid is that life expectancy is at &quot;an all-time high&quot;: &quot;City residents born in 2007 can expect to live an average of 79.4 years - a gain of nearly 5 months since 2006.&quot; But on the flip side, men tend to die younger than women&#x2014;at age 76 versus women&apos;s 82 years&#x2014;and two causes of premature death are heart disease and homicide.  Here are some findings: 
<ul>	<li>Men are 65% more likely than women to die between the ages of 35 and 64, mainly because of their higher death rates due to heart disease. </li>
	<li>More than 1 million of the 1.5 million men in this age group are either overweight (46%) or obese (25%) - conditions that increase the risk of heart disease. </li>
	<li>In addition, the vast majority (93%) report eating fewer than the recommended five servings of fruits or vegetables each day, and one in six report smoking (18%). </li>
	<li>24% [of men] are either uninsured or insured but lacking a regular medical provider. Only 18% of women face these barriers.</li>
	<li>Men aged 18 to 34 die at more than twice the rate of women in New York City (homicide is the leading cause; the highest homicide rates are the Bronx neighborhoods of Hunts Point and Mott Haven and the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and East New York). </li>
</ul>
You can read the report here (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083258/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/survey/survey-2010menshealth.pdf">PDF</a>).Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said, &#x201C;Complex factors contribute to men&apos;s shorter life expectancy and higher death rates, but many premature deaths are preventable. The Health Department is working to improve men&apos;s health and well-being. Healthier behaviors such as quitting smoking, exercising and eating well can prevent heart disease and cancer - and efforts to prevent violence can help save lives.&quot;
