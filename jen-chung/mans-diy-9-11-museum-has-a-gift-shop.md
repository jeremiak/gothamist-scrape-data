<p>Last year, photographer Gary Suson was criticized for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617054253/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/28/everybodys_a_critic_inmates_and_law.php">opening up the &quot;Ground Zero Museum&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617054253/http://nypost.com/2013/04/28/911-kin-rip-fotogs-blood-display/">charging $25 admission for people</a> to view photographs he took after September 11th, as well as artifacts he apparently didn&apos;t have permission to remove from the site. Now it turns out Suson is also operating an online store.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617054253/http://nypost.com/2014/06/15/another-911-gift-shop-competes-for-cash/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;Suson, who sells souvenirs on site, has launched an online gift store hawking his book of photographs ($49), posters ($25) and T-shirts ($32), among other items.... Suson advertises &apos;a portion of the proceeds&apos; goes to charity, but his IRS tax forms report a paltry 3.1 percent of revenues spent on &#x201C;grants&#x201D; in 2011. The museum reported $391,090 in revenues but only $12,278 in grants. The recipients are not named.&quot; Further, he has items from the site that the city says he was never authorized to take:</p>

<p>The museum is located in a Meatpacking District loft. Much of the museum is made up of Suson&apos;s photographs. Suson claims to be the &quot;Official Photographer of record at Ground Zero&quot; for the Uniformed Firefighters Association, but the Post points out, &quot;the union warned him years ago to stop claiming that title.&quot; </p>

<p>The website for Suson&apos;s museum trumpets how it&apos;s very popular...according to Tripadvisor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617054253/http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d626630-Reviews-or20-Ground_Zero_Museum_Workshop-New_York_City_New_York.html#REVIEWS">One Tripadvisor review says</a>, &quot;<strong>Do not miss the experience of feeling the pain &amp; sorrow the rescuers went through....some looking for their loved ones.</strong>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617054253/http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d626630-Reviews-or20-Ground_Zero_Museum_Workshop-New_York_City_New_York.html#REVIEWS">However, another visitor wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>As most of the other reviews pointed out, this is not the official 9/11 museum -- won&apos;t recover that. Besides being small, I was a little disappointed by the contents given how enormous this event was for the city. I suppose it would be impossible to capture the event effectively in any space, but left somewhat feeling this was more about the creator of the museum than the event itself. This is effectively a one room apartment with a lot of small artifacts from the World Trade center. I did learn a good amount, the recorded stories are good, and the calendar and clock artifacts are chilling to see in person. Again, just felt a little less about the event and more about the creator.</blockquote>

<p>Possible lesson: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617054253/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/29/911_museum_removes_911_cheese_plate.php">Do not monetize tragedy</a>.</p>
