<p>On Friday night, over a thousand F train commuters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424141535/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/28/f_train_hell_commuters_stranded_for.php">were stuck because a track broke</a>. So there&apos;s a certain poetic symmetry to this morning&apos;s F train commute, which is also turning out to be a bit of a nightmare. </p>

<p>Earlier this morning, a F train had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424141535/https://twitter.com/NYCTSubwayScoop/status/384658163397435393">some sort of issue</a> at Bergen Street, causing delays.

<p>But for one person, there was an upside:</p>
