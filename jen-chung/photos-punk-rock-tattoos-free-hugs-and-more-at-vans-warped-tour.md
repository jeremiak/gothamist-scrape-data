                            <p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035344/http://www.vanswarpedtour.com/">Vans Warped Tour</a> is in its 19th year, and a little rain wasn&apos;t about to discourage punks from heading to the Nassau Coliseum&apos;s parking lot for the raucous corporate-sponsored festivities. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035344/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimkiernan/sets/72157634640621512">Photographer Jim Kiernan</a> was on the scene and notes that 104 bands were playing on Saturday, across 7 stages, from noon to 9:30 p.m.&#x2014;all for $45.</p>

<p>Kiernan observed, &quot;Despite the whole &apos;punk rock&apos; vibe of the bands/day/concept the crowds were extremely well behaved and the kids seemed very safe and mellow. I didn&apos;t see anybody who seemed drunk, high or super-aggro the entire day. Not one. I&apos;m sure there were folks there like that but it sure wasn&apos;t obvious to me.&quot; He added, &quot;Suuuuper young kids everywhere&#x2014;some appearing to be in the single digits.  Crazy.  How did this happen?&quot;</p>

<p>You can see some of his photographs above and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035344/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimkiernan/sets/72157634640621512">the full set here</a>&#x2014;he photographed 17 bands from across the world. He notes that the best frontman &quot;was actually a woman&#x2014;Tonight Alive&#x2019;s Jenna McDougall from Australia.  She was awesome, great energy, really got the crowd going, awesome voice&#x2014;the whole deal.&quot;</p>
