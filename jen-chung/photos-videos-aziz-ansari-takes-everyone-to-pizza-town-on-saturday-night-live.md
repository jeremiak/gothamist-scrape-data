</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/23/americas_dad_tom_hanks_hosts_snl_fo.php"></a>We&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/7_people_wed_rather_see_host_snl.php">waiting years (years!)</a> for Aziz Ansari to host <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, and he did not disappoint. From a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/22/aziz_ansaris_snl_monologue.php">searing monologue that was just right</a> for a post-Trump inauguration Saturday to a melancholy digital short about getting a five-star Uber rating, the writing and performances were sharp and fun. You like that pizza pizza?</p>

<p>The show kicked off with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/22/snls_first_cold_open_in_president_t.php">Vladimir Putin cold open</a>&#x2014;where Putin went insult comic on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/822837675648389122">Kellyanne Conway&apos;s Inauguration outfit</a>&#x2014;before Ansari&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/22/aziz_ansaris_snl_monologue.php">thoughtful and funny monologue</a> about our crazy mixed up world. The first sketch with Ansari featured him in a game show called &quot;Beat the Bookworm&quot;&#x2014;of course, he does have his weaknesses, like &apos;90s pop culture. </p>

<p>Things got really good in an interrogation room sketch which saw two hardened cops (Beck Bennett and Cecily Strong) mercilessly questioning Ansari&apos;s character on why he didn&apos;t LOVE <em>La-La Land</em>. Next, Kate McKinnon brought back her impression of Conway, but this time she got to portray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/19/samantha_bee_kellyanne.php">Conway&apos;s ease with untruths</a> as a kind of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxie_Hart">Roxie Hart</a>-style ambition. A skit about a personal injury law firm featured many happy clients with million-dollar payouts&#x2014;and then Ansari&apos;s client, who was saddled with the incompetent attorney.</p>

<p>&quot;Weekend Update&quot; saw some good, day-after inauguration and day-of women&apos;s marches commentary, plus a nice Leslie Jones segment inspired by <em>Hidden Numbers</em> on how teaching everyone about more black achievements would inspire people. A bit about the difficulties of dirty talk (do not pretend to be a sixth grader) preceded the &quot;Uber&quot; digital short, which showed an Uber driver (Bobby Moynihan) and customer (Ansari) each trying to remedy their 3.9 ratings by impressing each other.</p>

<p>In the &quot;David Pumpkins&quot;/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020148/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/video_larry_david_cant_keep_it_toge.php">&quot;Kevin Roberts&quot;</a> sketch of the night, Ansari played part of a pizza chain&apos;s animatronic band, whose presence interrupts a police bust. </p>

<p>The final part of the show was a heartfelt rendition of &quot;To Sir With Love&quot; by Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata, dedicated to President Obama. Try not to tear up.</p>

<p>Big Sean was the musical guest, starting with an electric performance of &quot;Sunday Morning Jetpack&quot; and closing with a subdued &quot;Bounce Back.&quot; Next week is a repeat (Kristen Wiig and the xx) and February 4 has Kristen Stewart as host and Alessia Cara as musical guest. </p>
