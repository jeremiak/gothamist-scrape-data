<p>The <em>Fifty Shade of Grey</em> trilogy is the publishing phenomenon of the year.  First, it was the mommies who were delighting in the tale of a naive college student who gets into a BDSM relationship with a handsome, young, rich billionaire.  Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215854/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/photos_fifty_shades_of_grey_fans_wa.php">everyone else</a>, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215854/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/26/men_are_reading_fifty_shades_of_gre.php">men</a> and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215854/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/26/men_are_reading_fifty_shades_of_gre.php">actual billionaire mayor</a>, started reading it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215854/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/fifty_shades.php">everywhere</a>. Now, it seems like Sports Illustrated swimsuit models are also reading it... and they are bereft about finishing it.  Bar Refaeli, also known as Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s ex-girlfriend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215854/https://twitter.com/BarRefaeli/status/223724596271128576">Tweeted</a>, &quot;on my last 100 pages of &quot;50 shades freed&quot; a sad day. a very sad day. i do not want it to finish :(&quot; <em>This</em> is what sad face emoticons were made for!</p>

<p>Well, if Bar wants some tips, the publishers of Anne Rice&apos;s Sleeping Beauty erotica trilogy (it&apos;s exponentially better written&#x2014;and exponentially more hard core) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215854/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/50_shades_of_thanks_anne_rices_inte.php">think that fans of the Fifty books will love Rice&apos;s look</a> at fantasy BDSM.  </p>
