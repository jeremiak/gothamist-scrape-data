<p>The Westchester Department of Health is trying to find the individual who left a cage of baby raccoons on the steps of its office. Mainly because the baby raccoons may be rabid, which means their owner might have rabies too!</p>

<p>Dr. Sherlita Amler, commissioner of health, said, &quot;The raccoons were left on our doorstep in a cage with bottles of milk, blankets and toys. They appear to have been well cared for and nurtured, which means that there was direct contact between these raccoons and the person or people who were caring for them. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s important that we talk to the individual or individuals who left them to determine if they may have been potentially exposed to rabies.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Westchester DOH adds, &quot;At this time, the baby raccoons appear to be healthy and are being placed with a certified wildlife animal rehabilitator, where they will remain in hopes that their caregiver can be located and evaluated. The only way to confirm an animal has rabies is by euthanizing it and testing its brain tissue, a step the health department is trying to avoid.&quot;</p>

<p>Signs of rabies include unusual behavior: &quot;A rabid animal may become either abnormally aggressive or unusually tame. It may lose fear of people and become excited and irritable, or, conversely appear particularly passive and lethargic. Staggering and frothing at the mouth are sometimes noted.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a video of the critters: </p>
