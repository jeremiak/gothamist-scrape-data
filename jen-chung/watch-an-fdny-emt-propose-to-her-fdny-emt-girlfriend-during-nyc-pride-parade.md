<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006132519/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/tony_awards_address_orlando_mass_sh.php">Love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love</a>, and that sentiment was made powerfully manifest yesterday at the annual LGBTQ pride parade, the Heritage of Pride March. One of the highlights from yesterday&apos;s celebration featured an FDNY EMT proposing to her girlfriend during the parade.<br>
 <br>
The FDNY posted this video to Facebook, starring FDNY EMTs Julianna Arroyo and Erika Marrero. Arroyo, who works at Station 20 in the Bronx, had help from family members to pull off the surprise; she said, &quot;This parade is monumental for us because of the Orlando shooting. It hit really close to home. We wanted to walk in the parade in honor of the 49 victims. At the same time, I wanted to give Erika something positive to remember from the parade.&quot;</p>
