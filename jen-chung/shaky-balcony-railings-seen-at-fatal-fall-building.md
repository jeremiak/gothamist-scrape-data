Now some of its residents are showing the media <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807102910/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/terrace_terrors_8wdx6AoyLe2FRyOK5PMXML">its shaking railings and complaining about its stability</a>.  One told the Post, &quot;You can see the foundation crumbling. The railing is wobbly and insecure. The railing is loose; the side isn&apos;t even attached.&quot;</p>

<p>On Sunday, 24-year-old Connor Donohue&apos;s body was found outside 330 East 39th Street, after falling from his apartment&apos;s balcony.  The Department of Buildings said that building was required to inspect its exterior in 2007.  Another resident said of the railings, &quot;I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re up to code, but they do move. My boyfriend and father tell me not to lean on the railing,&quot; and another even showed how easy the railing comes apart:</p>
