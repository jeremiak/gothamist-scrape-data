</div></div><p>A Florida judge sentenced Casey Anthony to four years in prison for lying to law enforcement officials.  On Tuesday, a jury found Anthony, 25, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140436/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/05/casey_anthony_found_not_guilty_of_k.php">not guilty of killing her daughter in 2008</a>, but guilty on four counts of lying to the authorities.  However, Anthony, who has been in prison since 2008, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140436/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20077485-504083.html?tag=cbsContent;cbsCarousel">AP reports</a> that &quot;with credit for time served and good behavior she is likely to be released in late July or early August.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Anthony murder trial has riveted a nation of armchair lawyers as well as those outraged by the death of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony.  The child had been missing for a month before her grandmother, Cindy Anthony, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140436/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/caylee_anthony/1.html">reported her missing</a>.  When Casey Anthony spoke to authorities, she claimed the nanny had taken the toddler, and made up a story that was ultimately found to be false.  Little Caylee&apos;s bones were found in a wooded area six months later (police ignored tips about suspicious items there for months).  A forensic investigation into Casey Anthony&apos;s car trunk showed a decomposing body had been there.</p>

<p>The prosecution&apos;s case was circumstantial, and the defense claimed that the toddler accidentally drowned in the pool and Casey Anthony&apos;s father covered up the death.  Jennifer Ford, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140436/http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey_anthony_trial/casey-anthony-juror-jury-sick-stomach-guilty-verdict/story?id=14005609">juror, told ABC News</a>, &quot;I did not say she was innocent. I just said there was not enough evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be.&quot;  She added, &quot;We were sick to our stomach to get that verdict. We were crying, and not just the women. It was emotional and we weren&apos;t ready. We wanted to do it with integrity and not contribute to the sensationalism of the trial,&quot; but explained it was easier to accept the defense&apos;s explanation of how Caylee&apos;s body could have gotten in the trunk than the prosecution&apos;s theory that Casey Anthony used chloroform (Anthony searched for &quot;chloroform&quot; on her computer) to drug then kill the child. </p>

<p>Ford&apos;s mother said that her family received a trip to Disney World from ABC News in exchange for the interview.  Another juror is reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140436/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/us/07casey.html?ref=caseyanthony">looking for $50,000 to speak to the networks.</a></p>
