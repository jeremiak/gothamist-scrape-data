<p>The Replacements <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013818/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/08/the_replacements_will_end_decades-l.php">made their return to NBC and 30 Rock</a> last night and performed &quot;Alex Chilton&quot; on The Tonight Show. Jimmy Fallon introduced them as a &quot;massively beloved and influential rock band.&quot;</p>

<p>The appearance was notable because the group famously earned the wrath of Saturday Night Live creator (and Tonight Show executive producer) Lorne Michaels for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013818/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/08/the_replacements_will_end_decades-l.php">drunken 1986 performance</a> on SNL. Michaels banned them from the show after that.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013818/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/274568891.html">Artcetera reports</a>:</p><blockquote> Word is the band also played a second song that will hopefully be posted on Fallon&apos;s site tomorrow.<p></p>

<p>While bassist Tommy Stinson wore a slick pinstripe jacket and guitarist David Minehan stuck with the kind of plaid suit of Replacements lore, frontman Paul Westerberg looked like he was headed to school with his 16-year-old son Johnny the next day in a plain red T-shirt. He and Stinson exchanged several devilish smiles throughout the performance that suggested they were either having a blast or couldn&apos;t wait to be done (50-50 odds).</p></blockquote>One of the Fallon&apos;s other guests, Keith Richards, did hang out with the &apos;Mats backstage:<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013818/http://thereplacementsofficial.com/pages/home">The Replacements</a>, who are touring, will be at Forest Hills Stadium on Friday, September 19. </p>
