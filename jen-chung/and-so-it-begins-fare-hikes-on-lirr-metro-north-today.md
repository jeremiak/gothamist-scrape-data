WCBS 2&apos;s Lou Young <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174546/http://wcbstv.com/local/mta.fare.hikes.2.1047643.html">spoke to commuters at Grand Central</a> and Penn Station. One woman, who travels from Yonkers into the city, said, &quot;It&apos;s a big deal considering nobody has any money. Money is very scarce right now&quot;; she faces an increase of $1.50 per roundtrip&#x2014;about $30/month (and she rarely has the cash available to buy a monthly).  A pair of brothers who commute from Babylon into Manhattan will have to pay another $21/month each on their monthly passes.  Another commuter from White Plains was resigned, &quot;<strong>It adds up. It adds up, especially when the fares go up all the time. They got a deficit. Wadda ya gonna do?</strong>&quot; </p>
