And he was caught because of the DNA left behind.  </p>

<p>According to the DA&apos;s office, Darnell Hardware, 26,  &quot;rubbed his penis against a woman in a crowded subway car, ejaculated on her, and fled the subway when the doors opened.&quot; The three incidents were between 2002 and 2006&#x2014;at 8:15 a.m. on a northbound Lexington Avenue express between 14th and 42nd Streets; at 6 p.m. on a northbound 1 train; and at 7:30 a.m. near 86th Street on a northbound Lexington Avenue express&#x2014;and all the victims were young women who couldn&apos;t move away because the trains were so crowded.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215137/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110712/upper-east-side/serial-subway-sex-abuser-carried-out-string-of-attacks-da-says">A prosecutor said in court today</a>, &quot;[One victim] could feel what was happening but would be powerless to move because of the crush of other passengers.&quot;</p>

<p>The three women filed reports and the police collected the offending DNA. Prosecutors, which had obtained &quot;John Doe&quot; indictments in 2006, went after Hardware when he had to submit his DNA after being convicted of felony drug possession.  Manhattan DA Cy Vance said, &quot;This case represents a small but significant step towards ensuring the safety and protection of women on the subway. These are our wives and sisters, mothers and daughters, colleagues and friends, and they should not ride the subway in fear of being sexually assaulted.  Forensic science and law enforcement together make New York a safer city.&quot;</p>

<p>Hardware was charged with sexual abuse, forcible touching, and criminal mischief.
