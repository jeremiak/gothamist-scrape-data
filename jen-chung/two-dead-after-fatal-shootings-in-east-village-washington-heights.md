<p>Two men were killed in Manhattan in separate shootings last night.</p>

<p>Around 10:45 p.m., police say that officers responded a 911 call about a person who was shot in front of 635 East 12th Street, which is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141655/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/mancamposplaza.shtml">Campos Plaza Houses</a>. There cops found Eliot Caldwell, 23, shot in the back, unconscious and unresponsive. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>There are no arrests and police are investigating. Witnesses may have seen a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141655/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/15/alphabet-city-fatal-shooting/">person in a red hoodie running away</a>.</p>

<p>Then, just after midnight today, police officers responded to a call about a man shot in front of 500 West 157th Street and found Dejon McInnis, 41, with a gunshot wound in his right leg. He was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>A resident of the building tells us, &#x201C;It was very quiet before we heard what was clearly a gunshot. It sounded very close to us (later we realized it was directly below our window). And then I heard someone say, &apos;Oh shit, oh my God.&apos; And then, a minute later, we heard sirens.&#x201D;</p>

<p>No arrests have been made as the police continue to investigate.</p>

<p>The Post notes there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141655/http://nypost.com/2016/04/15/two-dead-after-separate-shootings-in-manhattan/">two other non-fatal shootings</a>, one in the Bronx and one in Morningside Heights, where a man opened his door and was &quot;greeted with gunfire.&quot;</p>
