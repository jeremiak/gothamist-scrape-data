<p>A woman was sexually assaulted and robbed in a Brooklyn apartment building yesterday morning, and the police hope the public can help identify the suspect.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 6:30 a.m. Saturday. The NYPD says that a 26-year-old woman entered an apartment building at 1308 Loring Avenue and headed into the stairwell: &quot;An unidentified male, who entered the stairwell from the 3rd Floor hallway, allowed the victim to pass him and then grabbed her from behind and placed his hand over her mouth. The unidentified male forced the victim to the ground, sexually assaulted her and attempted to rape her. The unidentified male then removed $100 from the victim&apos;s purse and fled on foot down the stairwell.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was treated at Kings County Hospital. </p>

<p>The authorities released surveillance video of the suspect, describing him as being in his late 20s, 5&apos;10&quot; and 150 pounds with tattoos on his arms. He was wearing a black baseball cap, a blue/purple t-shirt, black pants and black sneakers with white soles.</p>
