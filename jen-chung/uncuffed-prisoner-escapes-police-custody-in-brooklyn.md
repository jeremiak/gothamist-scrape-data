	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_03_escapedprisoner.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602012603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_03_escapedprisoner.jpg" width="240" height="272" class="image-right"> </span>Last night at 10 p.m., the NYPD asked for the &quot;public&apos;s assistance in locating and apprehending the following escaped prisoner from within the 84 Precinct.&quot; Apparently, the suspect, Corpus Hernandez, was at Kings County Criminal Court in Brooklyn when he managed to dodge the police&#x2014;since he wasn&apos;t handcuffed!</p>

<p>Hernandez had been awaiting arraignment on drug charges; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602012603/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_ex_con_escapes_court_while_3iMMl0agFWrIOB18i47MUL">Post reports</a> that he escaped at 4:30 p.m. &quot;because cops weren&#x2019;t paying attention, law-enforcement sources&quot; said. </p>

<p>Shortly after asking for public help, Hernandez was apprehended. Of course, this comes a few weeks after a salami thief awaiting arraignment at the same courthouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602012603/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/accused-salami-thief-puts-courthouse-lockdown-escape-article-1.1281469">escaped police custody</a> while using the bathroom (he was caught a few hours later, too).  A source marveled to the Post, &quot;I can&#x2019;t even imagine how this happened again. Clearly someone&#x2019;s asleep on the job.&quot;</p>
