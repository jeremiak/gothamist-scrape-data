<p>Buddy Valastro, the NJ baker known to reality TV fans as Cake Boss, pleaded guilty to DWI during his arraignment in New York City today. </p>

<p>Valastro was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011406/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/13/cake_boss_buddy_valastro_arrested_f.php">arrested on November 13</a>, after cops spotted his low-key yellow Corvette weaving on 10th Avenue near the Hudson Yards. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011406/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/14/im_the_cake_boss_you_cant_arrest_me.php">He reportedly told cops</a>, &quot;Can you just put me in a cab? You don&apos;t have to arrest me. I&apos;m not a bad guy. Is there anything we can do?&quot;</p>

<p>Today, Valastro took a plea deal. According to the NY Times, he &quot;will not be allowed to drive for three months... Judge Melissa A. Crane fined Mr. Valastro $300, suspended his license for three months in New York State and ordered him to take a course on drunken driving. New Jersey, where Mr. Valastro lives, will suspend his driving privileges sometime in the next few days, his lawyer and publicist said.&quot;</p>

<p>Valastro Tweeted an apology:</p><blockquote><p></p>

<p>It&apos;s classy of Valastro to admit he was wrong, but he shouldn&apos;t stop here: He should also do public service announcements during his show to remind people of the dangers of drunk driving. Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011406/http://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/about/drunk-driving-statistics.html">some stats from MADD</a>: </p><blockquote>Every day in America, another 28 people die as a result of drunk driving crashes.<p></p>

<p>Every two minutes, a person is injured in a drunk driving crash. </p>

<p>Drunk driving costs the United States $199 billion a year. </p>

<p>Drunk driving costs each adult in the United States almost $800 per year.</p></blockquote>Cake Boss&apos;s blood alcohol level was measured at .108, well above the .08 legal limit. What&apos;s gross is that apparently Valastro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011406/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/nyregion/cake-boss-star-pleads-guilty-to-dwi-charge.html?partner=socialflow&amp;smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;_r=0">&quot;had a fair chance of winning an acquittal&quot;</a> according to his lawyer. However, Valastro &quot;chose not to because it would send the wrong message to his family and fans.&quot; The lawyer told the Times, &quot;That&#x2019;s not him. The hardest thing for him was explaining this to his kids. I think morally he had to take that plea.&quot;<p></p>
