<p>On Sunday afternoon, Philip Estevez allegedly shot Luis Martinez at 566 Shepherd Avenue, when Martinez apparently defended his sister and fellow tenant, Anna Rodriguez.  After shooting Martinez, Estevez is accused entering the home, where Rodriguez and her 10- and 12-year-old children were hiding in a locked room, and trying to fire at them. Estevez&apos;s gun jammed and the 10-year-old boy jumped out of a second-story window; the 12-year-old girl eventually hit Estevez on the head with a block of wood. </p>

<p>It&apos;s suspected that the rent dispute may have been over just $100, but neighbors also suggested that Estevez was upset that his tenants were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154646/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-landlord-charged-murder-article-1.1285255">running up the electric bill</a>.

<p>Area residents and workers were shocked. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154646/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/178439/brooklyn-landlord-charged-with-murdering-tenant">A clerk told NY1</a>, &quot;I actually see the landlord covered in blood. But that&apos;s all I seen. And then the cops took him. He was always a nice guy. He was quiet - never looked like one of those guys.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154646/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-landlord-charged-murder-article-1.1285255">Another neighbor said</a>, &quot;He only asked for rent.&quot;</p>
