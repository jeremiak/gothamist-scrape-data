<p>According to the NYPD, around 3:00 a.m., a man knocked on the door of a home and &quot;entered the location when the door was opened.&quot; He attempted to rape the 57-year-old woman, but then &quot;fled the location when the attack was interrupted by another family member.&quot;  The incident apparently took place near 49th Street.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a Hispanic male in his 40s, around 5&apos;8&quot; and 170 pounds.  Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto Crime Stoppers&apos; website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105529/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">www.nypdcrimestoppers.com</a> or by texting their tips to CRIMES (274637), then enter TIP577.</p>

<p>The 72nd Precinct is where a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105529/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/25/cops_release_more_videos_of_south_s.php">22-year-old woman was fondled on 16th Street</a> on Wednesday.
