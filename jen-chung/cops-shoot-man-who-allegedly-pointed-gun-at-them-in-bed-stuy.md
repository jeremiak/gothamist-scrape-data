<p>Last night, the police shot a man who was allegedly pointing a loaded .380 gun at them in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, three plain-clothed police officers, who are part of an anti-crime unit and were in an unmarked police car, saw a 24-year-old man &quot;tugging at his waistband in the vicinity of Malcolm X Boulevard and Monroe Street.&quot; When two of the cops approached him, the police say the man ran west on Monroe.</p>

<p>The cops chased him on foot and in the car, until he got to the back of M.S. 269. At that point, the NYPD says, the individual &quot;grabbed a loaded firearm from his ankle and pointed it at the officers.&quot; One of the police officers fired once, hitting the man in the stomach.</p>

<p>The suspect was taken to Kings County Hospital and is in stable condition with a graze to his abdomen. Two of the cops were taken to Wyckoff Hospital for tinnitus. </p>

<p>The NYPD says the investigation is ongoing and charges are pending.</p>
