title: Steve Phillips Says Sex Addiction Isn't An Excuse
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_hunphi.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602102146im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_hunphi.jpg" width="240" height="201" class="image-left"> </span>Steve Phillips, the former Mets general manager and ESPN baseball analyst, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602102146/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/35293369/ns/today-today_people/">appeared on the Today Show</a>, fresh from his stint in sex rehab.  Phillips told Matt Lauer, &#x201C;<strong>People look at sex addiction as an excuse; it&#x2019;s not an excuse</strong>. I&#x2019;m fully responsible for everything that I did and accept responsibility for that... People who go [to rehab] are broken people. That&#x2019;s really the essence of the addiction, that you&#x2019;re broken inside. You&#x2019;ve got a hole that you&#x2019;ve tried to fill, whether it was with alcohol or drugs or sex or gambling with whatever.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Phillips&apos; private life became front page fodder for the tabloids when a 22-year-old production assistant he was having an affair with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602102146/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/21/former_mets_gm_starring_in_fatal_at.php">allegedly threatened his wife</a>&#x2014;by bombarding her at the Phillips home&#x2014; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602102146/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/tubby_temptress_used_craigslist_to.php">cyberstalked his teenage son</a>.  While he had previously admitted to affairs (he was hit with a sexual harassment suit when he was with the Mets) years ago, Phillips said he &quot;didn&#x2019;t go to a clinic; I just got some local therapy... I didn&#x2019;t get the appropriate help that I needed.&quot;</p>

<p>Phillips&apos; program was at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602102146/http://www.pinegrovetreatment.com/gentle-path.html">Gentle Path</a> clinic in Hattiesburg, Mississippi&#x2014;supposedly the clinic that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602102146/http://gothamist.com/tags/tigerwoods">Tiger Woods</a> has been attending.  Phillips said he&apos;s trying to save his marriage&#x2014;&quot;I&#x2019;ve broken my wife&#x2019;s heart&#x201D;&#x2014;but isn&apos;t sure if he can.  As for Hundley, she told NBC similar things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602102146/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/12/tubby_temptress_speaks_out_about_st.php">she told ABC last year</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry for him and his family. I&#x2019;m sorry for my family. I was 22, I made some mistakes. <strong>If I could take them back, I would, okay?</strong>&quot;  </p>
