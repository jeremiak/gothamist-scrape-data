<p>Port Authority police are investigating a woman&apos;s allegation that she was raped by a man who met her at Port Authority Bus Terminal for a date earlier this week. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529164502/http://nypost.com/2016/01/15/woman-raped-at-gunpoint-by-eharmony-date-cops/">According to the Post</a>, the woman, 28, had met a man named &quot;Jeffrey Kent&quot;  through eHarmony. The two agreed to have their first date in the city, and the woman arrived at Port Authority by bus on Monday afternoon around 4 p.m. </p><blockquote>The two met at an agreed-upon spot inside the Port Authority, but he did not make a good first impression &#x2014; not by any stretch &#x2014; immediately suggesting they go to a hotel, a law-enforcement source told The Post.<p></p>

<p>The woman was furious, and refused. And that&#x2019;s when he stuck what he told her was the barrel of a gun into her back, sources said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>&quot;Kent&quot; allegedly forced the woman downstairs into what the Post&apos;s sources describe as &quot;the maze of underground concrete spaces and tunnels that extends west of the Port Authority. She told police that she was raped inside an area with what looked like an abandoned train track running through it.&quot;</p>

<p>Because the woman is not from NYC and unfamiliar with Port Authority, it is reportedly difficult for her to say exactly where the rape occurred. There is a tunnel, known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529164502/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Tunnel">&quot;Freedom Tunnel,&quot;</a> inhabited by the homeless; the tunnel&apos;s walls are also popular with graffiti artists.</p>

<p>Police are trying to get more information about &quot;Jeffrey Kent&quot; from eHarmony.</p>
