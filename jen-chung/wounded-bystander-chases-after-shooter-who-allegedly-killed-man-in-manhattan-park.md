<p>A man who was shot in the shoulder managed to chase after the man who allegedly shot him and fatally shot another person in a park yesterday afternoon. Police were then able to arrest the suspect, charging him with murder and attempted murder soon after.</p>

<p>Police say that just before 1 p.m., a 31-year-old man told officers that he was shot in the shoulder inside Highbridge Park, at West 165th Street and Edgecomb Avenue in Washington Heights. The shooter&apos;s target was apparently a 36-year-old man, who was shot multiple times in the head; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021302/http://nypost.com/2016/10/03/man-chases-down-gunman-after-witnessing-fatal-shooting/"> the NY Post reports</a> that &quot;as the gunman fled over the Washington Bridge foot bridge, the wounded guy ran after him and soon alerted a patrol cop from the 44 Precinct.&quot;</p>

<p>Officers caught up with and arrested Corvell Hampton, 28, of Chicago. Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021302/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-36-shot-dead-bystander-wounded-upper-manhattan-park-article-1.2816125">tell the Daily News</a> that Hampton &quot;and the victim had been partying, consuming cocaine and beer for several hours leading up to a fight that sparked the fatal gunfire.&quot;  </p>

<p>City Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez, Senator Adriano Espaillat and other politicians are holding a press conference to discuss the shootings and &quot;call for an increase in police/parks officer presence in uptown parks&quot; today.</p>
