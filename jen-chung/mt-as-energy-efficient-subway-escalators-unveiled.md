The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301083245/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/new-subway-escalators-speed-up-when-you-get-on/?scp=1&amp;sq=mta%20escalator%20energy%20efficient&amp;st=cse">pilot program</a> includes escalators at 34th Street-Herald Square, Roosevelt Island; Jamaica-Van Wyck and Parsons/Archer.  MTA hopes to save almost $2,000 (per each escalator) in energy costs annually.  While some riders are wary, one found the glass half full, telling NY1, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s much better than them not working at all! </strong>If in fact it goes really slow when I&apos;m not on it and actually works when I&apos;m on it, so much the better.&quot;</p>
