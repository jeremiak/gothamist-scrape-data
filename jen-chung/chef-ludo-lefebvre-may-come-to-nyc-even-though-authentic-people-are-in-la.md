He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124352/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2011/07/nyc_vs_la.php">also said of NYC vs. LA</a>, &quot;I&apos;d say LA more interesting than New York [sic]. It&apos;s less fancy. It&apos;s more like a street restaurant scene. Authentic people. There&apos;s a bigger community of Asians, Latinos. You eat some amazing Mexican and Asian food in LA, trust me. It&apos;s just different, it&apos;s more simple, less city-like.&quot;</p>
