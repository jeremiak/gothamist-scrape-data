<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616021232/http://gothamist.com/tags/cicada">Cicadas</a> are making their presence known after 17 years underground&#x2014;which means there&apos;s no time like the present to <strong>do it</strong>. And apparently they have great stamina: A child found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616021232/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/06/30_minutes_of_bliss_for_staten.html#incart_m-rpt-2">two cicadas mating for a half hour</a>.</p>

Gabriella Farah, 11, &quot;held them in her hand and at one point, it seemed we might lose the love connection, as one began to turn away. But then ... well, they made a connection, all right. For 30 minutes. &quot; </p>

<p>Impressive! Then again, they have had 8,935,200 minutes of rest. The Advance also has other pictures of cicadas mating, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616021232/http://photos.silive.com/4499/gallery/cicadas_making_appearance_on_staten_island/index.html#/11">this</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616021232/http://photos.silive.com/4499/gallery/cicadas_making_appearance_on_staten_island/index.html#/7">this.</a></p>
