<p>The slippery conditions were well documented across every social networking platform, and the organizers waited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035018/https://twitter.com/GovBallNYC/status/343175518641860608">until 9 p.m. to cancel the rest of the concert</a>, finally pulling the plug and announcing: &quot;Due to sustained high winds and unsafe stage conditions, Kings of Leon and Pretty Lights are unable to perform. Please get home safely.&quot;</p>

<p>By that time, there were added issues with getting home, especially for the people who drove to the concert:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035018/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/a-rain-soaked-kickoff-to-the-governors-ball/">The NY Times noted</a>:</p><blockquote>Perhaps the promoters should have heeded the unanimous weather forecasts that New York City would receive the remnants of Tropical Storm Andrea, with heavy rains and flash-flood warnings. They might have considered rescheduling some version of Friday&#x2019;s lineup for Monday, though touring schedules, of course, are knotty at this time of year. As it was, Friday&#x2019;s big headliners &#x2014; the Southern rockers Kings of Leon and the electronic dance music act Pretty Lights &#x2014; had to cancel their closing sets &#x201C;due to high winds and unsafe stage conditions,&#x201D; a statement from the festival said. Neither headliner has a tour date booked on Monday.<p></p>

<p>...there was emotionally exposed neo-girl-group rock from Best Coast, whose leader, Bethany Cosentino, admitted that she wouldn&#x2019;t have been out in her own soaked audience. Feist and her band took the stage as winds whipped up again, hurling the primal beat of &#x201C;A Commotion&#x201D; into the storm for a crowd she praised as &#x201C;crazy people.&#x201D; Before the song ended, the storm blew back a deluge onto the stage, knocking out the keyboards and ending Feist&#x2019;s set.</p></blockquote>But those Kings of Leon fans are PISSED... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035018/https://twitter.com/SkyGreenChick/status/343362814133547009">and hopeful</a>: &quot;Are kings of Leon performing today since they didn&apos;t yesterday @GovBallNYC? I think we deserve a performance after standing in rain for hrs!&quot;<p></p>
