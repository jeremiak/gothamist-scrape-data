<p>FYI: You may feel ill after ingesting bags of heroin. Police in Riverdale, NJ say that a man vomited up 14 bags of horse while sitting in his 2012 Chevy Camaro.</p>

<p>The police officers had been responding to a call about a man snorting drugs in his car, which was parked in a Walmart on Route 23.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111149/http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2013/03/man_vomits_14_bags_of_heroin_i.html#incart_m-rpt-1">According to NJ.com</a>, &quot;Witnesses told the officers they saw [Walmart employee Cody] Larson swallow something when the patrol car arrived, police said.
