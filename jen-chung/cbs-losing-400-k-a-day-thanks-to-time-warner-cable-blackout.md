<p>Time Warner Cable&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828023020/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/02/cbs_goes_off_air_on_time_warner_cab.php">blackout of CBS</a> over retransmission fees (CBS wants more money, TWC doesn&apos;t want to pay more) is adding up for the network. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828023020/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cbs-corp-lose-400000-dispute-599383">An analyst estimated</a> that not being seen by 3 million viewers in key markets like New York, Los Angeles and Dallas, &quot;could cost CBS Corp. about $400,000 per day, including lost retransmission revenue and a loss of advertising dollars at both the network and the stations.&quot;</p>

<p>However, it&apos;s not a <em>huge</em> deal to CBS&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828023020/http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/cbs-blackout-could-be-costing-it-400000-per-day-analysts-1200573955/">Variety reports</a>, &quot;CBS&#x2019;s estimated daily loss of $400,000 is small coin in relation to the company&#x2019;s total revenue: In the second quarter, the Eye reported $3.7 billion in revenue and net income of $472 million.&quot; </p>

<p>The squabble between the corporations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828023020/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/03/time_warner_cables_cbs_blackout_cou.php">could last weeks</a>, as the two sides aren&apos;t actively negotiating. Currently, TWC pays $1 per subscriber to retransmit CBS&apos;s programming, but CBS wants something closer to $2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828023020/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/business/media/viewers-wait-for-cbs-and-time-warner-to-make-up.html?ref=business&amp;pagewanted=all">According to the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>The cable company initially labeled the demand exorbitant, and said the costs would have to be passed on to customers. (Cable prices have increased recently to an average of $60 to $70 a month, though analysts point out that the per-channel price has actually dropped because so many new channels have been added.)... CBS executives have cited the popularity of their network&#x2019;s shows to justify a fee price closer to what successful cable networks get from cable operators. ESPN, for example, gets the top price of any network, $5.54 monthly per subscriber, according to SNL Kagan.</blockquote>Another analyst tells the Times that &quot;CBS&#x2019;s financial demands were not only justified, &apos;I would argue they are almost a bargain.&apos; He noted that CBS spends more than $4 billion a year on programming, &apos;four to eight times as much&apos; as cable networks getting similar subscriber fees spend, and that CBS has an audience about five times the size.&quot; <p></p>

<p>CBS is scheduled to air its first NFL game <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828023020/http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/schedules/regular">on September 8</a>, so most expect the standoff to end before then. In the meantime, the NY City Council is holding an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828023020/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/186616/city-council-to-hold-joint-oversight-hearing-on-twc-cbs-dispute">oversight meeting this week about the blackout</a>&#x2014;Speaker Quinn said, &quot;I believe this emergency oversight hearing is going to get Time Warner, CBS, consumers, customers, in a room together, and will get us to a solution.&quot;</p>
