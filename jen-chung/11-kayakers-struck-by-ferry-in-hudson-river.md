All is well here in NYC and we thank you for your concerns. By now, many of you have seen notice of an incident reported in news feeds of a NY Waterways ferry running into a group of kayakers on one of our guided excursions. In almost two decades of guiding trips here in the local NY waters, this is the FIRST major incident we have ever had, and we are very thankful that there were no fatalities. <br>
The incident is being investigated at this time, and this is just to update you that of the eleven kayakers on the water, four were injured and we are grateful to the speedy assistance of the US Coast Guard, the NYPD, and the Hudson River Park for getting the injured to local hospitals. <br>
One kayaker has already been released, and the others are doing well.The rest of the group were okay and safely escorted back to land.<br>
All participating kayakers were properly outfitted with safety gear and fully briefed on safety protocols. The group was led by one of our senior instructors who is ACA certified in both SUP and Kayak disciplines, as well as being a veteran guide who learned to paddle on the local waters here in NYC. Our guide was also seriously injured, and we are extremely relieved to hear that he is in good spirits.<br>
Again, we thank you for your ongoing support in light of this incident, and we look forward to seeing you out on the water very soon!<br>
- The Team at MKC.</blockquote>The NY Waterway captain took a Breathalyzer test and was negative for alcohol. The company said, &quot;We&#x2019;re cooperating fully with the United States Coast Guard and the New York Police Department in this investigation.&quot;<p></p>
