Haggerty, who had promised to use the money for ballot security but instead <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302101202/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/06/14/2010-06-14_trusted_bloomberg_aide_john_haggerty_indicted_for_stealing_11m_of_mayors_campaig.html">bought a home</a>, faces up to 15 years in prison.</p>

<p>Haggerty, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302101202/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/14/gop_operative_indicted_for_stealing.php">was indicted last year</a>, had a defense strategy of pointing out that Bloomberg was a very wealthy man and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302101202/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/John-Haggerty-Trial-Mayor-Bloomberg-Campaign-Closing-Arguments-132066713.html">his re-election team didn&apos;t really care how the money</a>, which was given to Haggerty acting for the Independence party, was spent as long as Bloomberg would win.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302101202/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/haggerty-guilty-of-grand-larceny-and-money-laundering/">His lawyer said</a>, &#x201C;Nobody cared what was on that budget, and because they did not care, they did not rely on that budget.&quot; Still, the jury believed the Manhattan DA&apos;s office, who argued that no matter how rich Bloomberg is, he was a victim. Plus, Haggerty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302101202/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/21/john-haggerty-convicted-of-stealing-from-bloombergs-campaign/">only spent $32,000 on ballot security and took the rest</a>.</p>

<p>Many of Bloomberg&apos;s closest aides testified in the trial&#x2014;even Bloomberg himself, who was described as seeming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302101202/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/03/when_bloomberg_takes_the_stand.php">like a &quot;lizard in the sun&quot; when questioned by the defense</a>.</p>
