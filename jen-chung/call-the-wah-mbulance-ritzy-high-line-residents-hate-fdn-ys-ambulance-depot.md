But now that the Fire Department wants to keep ambulances on a lot at 512 West 23rd Street, residents of fancy High Line condos are upset.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120411210153/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120410/chelsea-hells-kitchen/luxe-high-line-condo-residents-want-chase-ambulance-depot-away">One fumed at a community board meeting</a>, &quot;<strong>We have nieces and nephews that come to visit, and it was a nice day and they had problems going outside on the terrace because of the fumes</strong>.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In addition to the idling ambulances, residents also complain about the sirens from the ambulances, but the FDNY wants to extends it lease to provide much-needed services.  According to DNAinfo, David Harney, chief of staff for the Deputy Fire Commissioner, said at the meeting, &quot;My first quality-of-life issue is life itself. Not having a facility on the West Side of Manhattan is detrimental to our operations. Right now, the landlord could evict us with 30 days notice.&quot;  While the FDNY is looking for a permanent site, but in the meantime, Harney would like to stay in the current lot for the interim, &quot;The Fire Department could not wait three years to identify, go through a land-use review, design, and build a permanent facility to service this critical area.&quot;</p>

<p>One resident paying $3,500/month for a one-bedroom at 520 West 23rd Street said, &quot;My apartment gets filled with exhaust at 7 a.m. in the morning. It gets filled with exhaust at 11 at night. I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s questioning the necessity of having ambulance service on the West Side of Manhattan, but the fact of the matter is this station is surrounded by five residential buildings.&quot;  While the FDNY is trying to work on the idling issue, another resident said, &quot;They better be looking somewhere else, because this ain&apos;t forever.&quot;  Know what else ain&apos;t forever?
