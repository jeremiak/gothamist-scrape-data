<p>New York City is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307222637/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/09/mets_playoffs_sports_meaning.php">officially Mr. Met&apos;s Town</a> as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307222637/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/mets_dodgers_beer_slip.php">Amazin&apos;s head into</a> the National League Championship Series tonight against the Chicago Cubs. And to get there, the MTA is bringing out the &quot;Train of Many Colors&quot; for all the home games.</p>

<p>The agency says, &quot;The strictly old-school, 11-car Flushing Line train is made up of vintage IRT cars manufactured between 1948 and 1964.  The varying color schemes represent several different eras in subway history, including the redbirds and the striking two-tone robin&#x2019;s egg blue and cream World&#x2019;s Fair colors.&quot;</p>

<p>The train will leave the new 34th Street-Hudson Yards station at 6:30 p.m. tonight and tomorrow and will make express stops to Main Street. And, yes, the MTA and CTA are making bets:</p>
