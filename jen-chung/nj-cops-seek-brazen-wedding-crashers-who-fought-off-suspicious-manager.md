<p>Did these guys not read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013454/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396269/trivia">Wedding Crashers&apos; rules</a>? Specifically Rule 37: &quot;At the reception, one hard drink or two beers max. A drunk crasher is a sloppy crasher.&quot; Because Ocean Township police are looking for a trio who crashed a wedding last weekend.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013454/http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/09/23/wedding-crashers-ocean-township/16100403/">According to the Asbury Park Press</a>, &quot;The trio of young men dressed sharply in button-down shirts and mingled with guests of the wedding reception, held Saturday at the English Manor in the Wanamassa neighborhood. But they did not have an invitation, police said.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_09_crashers1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013454im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_09_crashers1.jpg" width="640" height="450"> <br> <i> Via Ocean Township Police</i></div> <p></p>

<p>In spite of that formality, the group partook in &quot;drinking, eating and immersing themselves in the spirit of the occasion; they even snapped pictures of themselves in a photo booth set up for the wedding.&quot;</p>

<p>But then when a female manager for English Manor found them and tried to detain them, one of the crashers threw her to the ground. Now they are wanted for strong-armed robbery, because they consumed the wedding food and drinks and threw down the manager. </p>
