<p>There are so many disturbing elements in the 2005 audio in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020900/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">Donald Trump brags about forcing himself on women</a>, kissing them with Tic-Tac-freshened breath, and trying to &quot;move on&quot; a married woman &quot;like a bitch.&quot; The big story, of course, is that this is a window into the Republican presidential candidate&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020900/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">entitled, rape-culture perspective</a>. But there&apos;s still an important subplot in the callow, encouraging behavior from Billy Bush, who is heard <em>laughing</em> when Trump says he can &quot;grab [women] by the p---y. You can do anything&quot; because he&apos;s famous.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the terribleness in its unedited filth:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020900if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhsSzIS84ks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The exchange occurred in 2005, when Trump was invited to film a part as himself on <em>Days of Our Lives</em>, an NBC soap opera. NBC Entertainment also owns the entertainment news program <em>Access Hollywood</em> and Bush, a co-anchor, was doing a segment about Trump&apos;s appearance. Both Trump and Bush had microphones on and, while in the presence of Trump&apos;s team as well as Access Hollywood&apos;s crew, shot part of the segment on a backlot. </p>

<p>Then Trump&apos;s people and the AH crew left the bus, and Trump revealed to Bush how he tried to score on Bush&apos;s colleague, Nancy O&apos;Dell, but failed&#x2014;&quot;I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll show you where they have some nice furniture.&#x2019; I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn&#x2019;t get there. And she was married.&quot;&#x2014;and then insulted her, &quot;Then all of a sudden I see her, she&#x2019;s now got the big phony tits and everything. She&#x2019;s totally changed her look.&quot;</p>

<p>Bush&apos;s reaction: &quot;That&apos;s huge news!&quot;  Later, he alerts Trump that he sees the Days of Our Lives actress, Arianne Zucker, who will be in the segment, and that she&apos;s &quot;hot as s--t. In the purple. Whoa, the Donald is good! Whoa, my man!... The Donald scores!&quot; </p>

<p>Later, this leads to Trump explaining, &quot;I&#x2019;ve gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I&#x2019;m automatically attracted to beautiful &#x2014; I just start kissing them. It&#x2019;s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don&#x2019;t even wait. And when you&#x2019;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.&quot; </p>

<p>A man, apparently Bush, says, &quot;Whatever you want,&quot; to which Trump agrees, &quot;Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, when they meet Zucker, Bush tells her, &quot;How about a little hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus&quot; and then says, &quot;How about a little hug for the Bushy?&quot;</p>

<p>Bush, who moved from Access Hollywood to a high-profile role with NBC News&apos; Today Show, issued a statement last night: &quot;Obviously I&apos;m embarrassed and ashamed. It&apos;s no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago &#x2014; I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I&apos;m very sorry.&quot; </p>

<p>For the record, Bush, who is first cousins with Jeb and George W. Bush and has been married since 1998 with three daughters, is 44, which makes him 33 at the time of the video. </p>

<p>Apparently the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020900/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/pervy_trump_sexist_pig.php"> AP&apos;s report about cast and crew members</a> from Trump&apos;s reality show <em>The Apprentice</em> recalling his sexist behavior prompted someone at Access Hollywood to remember this segment. AH says they were working for their own story, but it was going to air after tomorrow night&apos;s debate:</p>
