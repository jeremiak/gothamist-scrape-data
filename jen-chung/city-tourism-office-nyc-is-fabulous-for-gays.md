The city&apos;s tourism marketing website now has a gay section, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212013418/http://nycgo.com/gay">nycgo.com/gay</a> which offers suggestions on things to do and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212013418/http://nycgo.com/?event=view.article&amp;id=154268">list of gay landmarks</a>.  University of Illinois at Chicago professor of history and gender and women&apos;s studies John D&apos;Emilio remarked to CityRoom, &quot;<strong>Forty-plus years ago, a newspaper like The New York Times had front-page articles alerting the city to the growing problem of &#x2018;overt homosexuality.&apos;</strong> Within living memory, something has been turned around. People who were seen as an unwelcome presence are now encouraged to arrive.&quot;  Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212013418/http://theboweryboys.blogspot.com/2008/05/podcast-stonewall-riots.html">Stonewall riots podcast</a> from the Bowery Boys.</p>
