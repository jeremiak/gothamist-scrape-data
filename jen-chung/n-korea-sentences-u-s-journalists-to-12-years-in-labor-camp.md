Korea&apos;s official news agency KCNA reported that the court accused Euna Lee and Laura Ling of &quot;<strong>committing hostilities against the Korean nation and illegal entry</strong>.&quot;  The U.S. State Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161705/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/world/asia/09north.html?_r=1&amp;hp">released a statement</a>, &quot;We are deeply concerned by the reported sentencing of the two American citizen journalists by North Korean authorities, and we are engaged through all possible channels to secure their release. We once again urge North Korea to grant the immediate release of the two American citizen journalists on humanitarian grounds.&quot; Lee and Ling work for San Francisco-based Current TV, which was co-founded by Al Gore.
