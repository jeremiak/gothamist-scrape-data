That&apos;s the message from the Giants, who beat the supermodel&apos;s husband and his Patriot teammates in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015026/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/super_bowl.php#photo-1">thrilling Super Bowl game</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015026/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/backpage/giants_jacobs_on_gisele_be_cut_and_qd4Aqd1MNCsEQpxNP1zP7O">Brandon Jacobs said</a>, &quot;She just needs to continue to be cute and shut up.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Brazilian bombshell was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015026/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/gisele_bundchen_post-super_bowl_fre.php">caught on video responding to a taunting Giants fan</a> (who had ungraciously said, &quot;Eli owns your husband!&quot;), &quot;You (have) to catch the ball when you&#x2019;re supposed to catch the ball. My husband cannot (bleeping) throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time. I can&#x2019;t believe they dropped the ball so many times.&quot;  Which reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015026/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/boston_hates_gisele_bundchen_for_br.php">upset some Patriots players</a>, not to mention most of Boston and anyone who understands team sports camaraderie.  </p>

<p>Giants defensive end Osi Umenyiora <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015026/https://twitter.com/#!/MikeGarafolo/statuses/167021080165359617">also said of Bundchen&apos;s outburst</a>. &quot;She&#x2019;s supposed to stay out of things like that but &#x2026; she has the right to say whatever she wants to,&quot; and then he just wanted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015026/https://twitter.com/#!/MikeGarafolo/statuses/167021288060223489">stop talking about her all together</a>, &quot;Listen, we just won the Super Bowl. We&#x2019;re not saying nothing about whatever her name is.&quot;</p>
