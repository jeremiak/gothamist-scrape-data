A source said it was a McDonald&apos;s.</p>

<p>A male individual followed a 22-year-old woman into the restroom, then locked the door&#x2014;and when the woman tried to leave, he &quot;pushed her into the wall, pulled down his pants and exposed his private parts,&quot; police say.</p>

<p>The woman screamed and the suspect fled the restaurant. The victim did not suffer any injuries. </p>

<p>The police released images of the suspect exiting the restroom and outside the McDonald&apos;s as well as surveillance footage from the restroom area. </p>
