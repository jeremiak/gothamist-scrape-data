<p>The NY Times has a weekend Styles feature about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233057/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all">difficulty of making friends in your 30s and 40s</a>.  Writer Alex Williams explains, &quot;In your 30s and 40s, plenty of new people enter your life, through work, children&#x2019;s play dates and, of course, Facebook. But actual close friends &#x2014; the kind you make in college, the kind you call in a crisis &#x2014; those are in shorter supply.&quot;</p>

<p>There are many examples of how freaking hard it is to make friends when you&apos;re older&#x2014;how you can&apos;t always transition your work friend into being your friend friend, how your kids&apos; parents aren&apos;t always perfect friends, how it&apos;s really uncomfortable to have friends who are obsessed with money, so on and so forth. One person interviewed &quot;has even developed a playful 100-point scale (100 being &apos;best friend forever&apos;).<strong> In her mind, she starts to dock new friend candidates as they begin to display annoying or disloyal behavior.</strong> Nine times out of 10, she said, her new friends end up from 30 to 60, or little more than an acquaintance.&quot; Would you want to make friends with that person?</p>

<p>But shouldn&apos;t we just go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233057/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7JcGYilsuE">back to that bit that Jerry Seinfeld had</a> in the Seinfeld episode, The Boyfriend (Part 1):</p><blockquote>When you&apos;re in your thirties it&apos;s very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is that you&apos;ve got now that&apos;s who you&apos;re going with. you&apos;re not <br>
interviewing, you&apos;re not looking at any new people, you&apos;re not interested in seeing any applications. They don&apos;t know the places. They don&apos;t know the food. They don&apos;t know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or someplace I&apos;m sure you&apos;re a very nice person you seem to have a lot of potential, but we&apos;re just not hiring right now. <p></p>

<p>Of course when you&apos;re a kid, you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were the qualifications? If someone&apos;s in front of my house NOW, That&apos;s my friend, they&apos;re my friend. That&apos;s it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We&apos;ll be best friends!</p></blockquote>You&apos;ll recall that in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233057/http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheBoyfriend2.htm">The Boyfriend (Part 2)</a>, Keith Hernandez shockingly asked his new friend Jerry to help him move:<p></p>

<p>Well, if people in their 30s and 40s do make new friends, here&apos;s how<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233057/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/fashion/its-not-me-its-you-how-to-end-a-friendship.html?pagewanted=all"> you can break up with them</a>, courtesy of the Times Styles section.</p>
