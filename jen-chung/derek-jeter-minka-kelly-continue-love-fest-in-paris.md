<p>The Yankees star and the, uh, star of the cancelled-after-just-four-episodes Charlie&apos;s Angels reboot were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103113717/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/31/derek_jeter_minka_kelly_appreciate.php">spotted last week at the Musee d&apos;Orsay</a> by an American college student. Yesterday, the couple was at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart: &quot;In the series of snaps, the 31-year-old Kelly lifts up her iPhone to take pictures of herself and Jeter on the entrance steps. While she concentrates on taking a shot, the Yankees shortstop smiles and gazes doe-eyed down at her.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Page Six, the pair broke up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103113717/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/derek_jeter_minka_kelly_break_up.php">over the summer</a> due to a &quot;lull in their relationship,&quot; proving that even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103113717/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/derek_jeters_girlfriend_officially.php">Esquire&apos;s Sexiest Woman Alive</a> has boyfriend problems.  And about a year ago, the Post claimed they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103113717/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/10/derek_jeter_and_minka_kelly_to_wed.php">were getting married</a>.  </p>
