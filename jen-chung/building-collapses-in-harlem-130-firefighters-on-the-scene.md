<p>A five-story building at 110 West 123rd Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408140958/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8648931">totally collapsed</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408140958/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Harlem-Building-Collapse-123rd-Street-Lenox-Avenue-150229805.html">with the floors pancaking</a> on top of each other.  The Fire Department has at least 130 firefighters on the scene.</p>

<p>The FDNY says there were no injuries.  The building seems to be under construction and does not seem like it was occupied (the FDNY did searches).</p>
