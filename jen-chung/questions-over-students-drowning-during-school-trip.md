<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="2010_06_lbswimno.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_06_lbswimno.jpg" width="240" height="199"> <br> <i>Sign at Long Beach noting there are no lifeguards on duty (WCBS 2)</i></div> The tragic death of 12-year-old Nicole Suriel, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/23/12-year-old_drowns_off_long_beach_d.php">drowned during a class trip to Long Beach</a>, is putting the practices that Columbia Secondary School and the Department of Education enforce during school trips under scrutiny.  Suriel&apos;s parents say they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/23/2010-06-23_devastated_dad_wants_answers_from_school_in_daughters_long_beach_drowning_death.html">did not sign</a> a permission slip for the trip and Juan Suriel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/girl_tragic_plea_os3M8FBZqkjix3ZjjoBfZI">recounted hearing about his daughter&apos;s death</a>: &quot;The principal called, &apos;We have to go to the beach. I think Nicole is dead.&apos; I said, &apos;You&apos;re joking. Only two or three hours ago I spoke to her.&apos; It just doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Suriel and other students at Columbia Secondary were visiting Long Beach as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703900004575325372611829894.html">reward for fundraising</a> (it was previously reported they were visiting the beach as part of their June term studies).  Students&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/nyregion/24drown.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">supervised by three adults</a> (first-year teacher Erin Bailey plus a substitute teacher and a student intern)&#x2014;went into the water even though no lifeguards were on duty (they start working during weekdays next week), which was clearly indicated on signs, and some were swept out by a current. Long Beach City Manager Charles Theofan said, &quot;Witnesses told police officers that the kids were climbing all over the jetty -- and that&apos;s the most dangerous thing you can do. There was a complete lack of any supervision. It was just a recipe for disaster.&quot;</p>

<p>Other parents say that the permission slips <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744/http://wcbstv.com/cbs2crew/drowning.nicole.suriel.2.1769692.html">said nothing about swimming or about going to Long Beach</a>. One angry parent said, &quot;If you send a first year teacher out to a beach with 24 kids and not expect them to get into the water on a 90 degree day, then something is beyond your comprehension.&quot;  And a beachgoer who witnessed the horror <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074744/http://wcbstv.com/local/missing.swimmer.field.2.1765686.html">said</a>, &quot;When the girl disappeared, the teachers started running around the beach, &apos;Oh can somebody help?&apos; They didn&apos;t know how to swim, no lifeguards, so irresponsible.&quot;</p>
