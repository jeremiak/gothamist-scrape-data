title: Video: Paladino Says "Fuck 'Em" To Having NYC Terror Trial
---

	
										<p>Carl Paladino is upset at the media for seizing on his various lightning rod statements.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053701/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/paladino-admits-to-some-missteps/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">He told City Room</a>, &quot;It just seems like there&#x2019;s a continuous misstatement, or abuse or exaggeration by certain members of the press that just keep chasing us around.&quot;  But when there&apos;s video of him dropping the F-bomb during a town hall meeting this past March, why can&apos;t we all just enjoy it?  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053701/http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2010/10/paladino_curses.php">According to National Journal</a>, the questioner says,  &quot;If you were the chief executive of New York, what would your response be to the attorney general of the United States deciding to hold terrorist trials in Manhattan?&quot; Paladino answered, &quot;Fuck him. Fuck him.&quot; WAtch the video&#x2014;the question is at about the 2:10 mark.</p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/socNqrOoI9E?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053701oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/socNqrOoI9E?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>[Now, Governor Paterson and Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053701/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/28/paterson_joins_bloomberg_in_push_to_1.php">are opposed to having the terror trial</a> of 9/11 plotters in NYC.  (It sorta seems like Holder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053701/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/holder_911_terror_trial_might_be_ve.php">abandoned that idea</a>, but who knows.)]</p>

<p>Also, City Room reports, &quot;Mr. Paladino said it was &apos;probably&apos; a mistake to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203053701/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/paladino_denies_dyfunctional_homose.php">allow rabbis whose congregations he visited </a>on Sunday to have input into his remarks on gays. One of Mr. Paladino&#x2019;s speeches on Sunday originally included a line deploring gay lifestyles as &apos;dysfunctional,&apos; but Mr. Paladino said he had crossed out the remark, suggested by a rabbi, before the speech and never intended to deliver it. Still, he was widely condemned when a draft of his remarks that included the line was made public.&quot;</p>
