<p>A noise that sounded like an explosion just occurred in Manhattan&apos;s Chelsea neighborhood around 8:30 p.m., on West 23rd Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues. Mayor Bill de Blasio said there was no known connection to terror, but said that so far, it appears it was &quot;an intentional act.&quot; </p>

<p><b>UPDATE 11:20 p.m.</b>: During a press conference, the Mayor said there were a &quot;significant&quot; number of injuries&#x2014;29, including one that could be called serious. He stressed that based on the preliminary investigation, it did not seem that the blast was related to terrorism, adding, &quot;There is no specific and credible threat against NYC.&quot; </p>

<p>He praised the NYPD and all other agencies for being well-equipped to handle the situation, &quot;Whatever the cause, whatever the intention, New Yorkers will not be intimidated.&quot; Also, it didn&apos;t appear, de Blasio said, that there was a link to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222714/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/pipe_bomb_explodes_on_route_of_seas.php">Jersey Shore pipe bomb incident</a>.</p>

<p>The mayor also asked that anyone with tips, photos and video to contact the NYPD at 800-577-TIPS.</p>

<p>NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill said the explosion occurred outside 131 West 23rd Street. Police officers patrolling west on West 23rd between 6th and 7th Avenues actually saw the blast and called for additional units. They&apos;ve ruled out gas as a cause of the blast, &quot;The exact nature has not yet been determined.&quot; The FDNY is investigating any structural damage to buildings in the area.</p>

<p>It was confirmed that West 27th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues was being investigated.</p>

<p>FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said of the 29 injuries, 24 people were taken to hospitals, &quot;None of these are life-threatening.&quot; Also, other FDNY units in the area heard the blast and responded.</p>

<p>However, officials did not give any other details about the investigation. They didn&apos;t confirm that the dumpster was involved in the blast. O&apos;Neill did say there was video of the explosion they have seen.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the press conference:</p>
