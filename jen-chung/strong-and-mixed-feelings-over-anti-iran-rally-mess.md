This is embarrassing, especially to Gov. Palin, to me and I think it should be to every single New Yorker.&quot;  Last night, at the State of Israel Bonds dinner where Clinton said, &quot;<strong>We cannot, we should not, we must not permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons</strong>,&quot; the Observer found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122356/http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/pro-israel-crowd-split-clintons-withdrawal-stop-iran-rally">Iranian Jews split over her decision</a> to skip the rally.  And Representative Anthony Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122356/http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/weiner-stop-iran-rally-complete-mess">weighed in, too</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t believe this was a grand conspiracy. It was a complete mess by the organizers. It got too political.  The casualty here?  Me.&quot;</p>
