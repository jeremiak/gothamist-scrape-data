<p>An attorney for a Manhattan tax law firm was charged with murder yesterday after his wife, a prominent Westchester pediatrician, died in their Scarsdale home. </p>

<p>Scarsdale Police Capt. Thomas Altizio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605051506/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2016/01/20/scarsdale-lincoln-road-death/79063640/">told the Journal News</a> that officers were called to the home, located at 50 Lincoln Road, after receiving a 911 call &quot;reporting a woman seriously injured there.&quot; Police believe the call came from a 61-year-old male but would not further elaborate on who made the call.</p>

<p>First responders arrived at the residence to find Dr. Robin Goldman, 58, dead, apparently from stab wounds. Her husband, Jules Reich, 61, was arrested and charged with second degree murder. </p>

<p>Reich is a partner at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605051506/http://www.weisermazars.com/component/content/article?id=455:julesreich">Weiser Mazars</a>, specializing in mergers and acquisitions, while Goldman was a pediatrician associated with Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and was a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. </p>

<p>Neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605051506/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/20/woman-killed-scarsdale/">told WCBS 2</a> that &quot;the couple was estranged and Reich had not been around much lately.&quot; The house, which local news describes as a &quot;mansion&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605051506/http://nypost.com/2016/01/20/cops-question-husband-over-wifes-gruesome-murder/">worth $3.4 million</a>, had reportedly been their home since 1997. Reich reportedly filed for divorce from Goldman last summer, soon after their daughter&apos;s wedding. </p>

<p>A security guard at Montefiore Medical Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605051506/http://nypost.com/2016/01/20/cops-question-husband-over-wifes-gruesome-murder/">told the NY Post</a>, &quot;Dr. Goldman was murdered? Oh, my God, this is horrible! I&#x2019;m completely shocked. She was a very pleasant lady. She always smiled and said hello to everyone. Nobody ever said or felt anything bad about her. Not with that smile.. A lady of that stature? Who would want to do that to her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is very sad... [Reich] is a nice guy. He seemed so level-headed,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605051506/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/woman-stabbed-death-westchester-mansion-article-1.2503767">a neighbor said to the Daily News</a></p>

<p>The couple&apos;s son Adam Reich also told the Post that his mother &quot;was great, a great person, amazing.&quot;</p>

<p>Reich is currently being held without bail.</p>
