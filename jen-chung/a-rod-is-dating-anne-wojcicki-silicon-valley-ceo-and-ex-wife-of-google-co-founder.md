<p>Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez has dated a number of boldfaced names&#x2014;Madonna, Cameron Diaz, Kate Hudson&#x2014;but now he&apos;s in a new league: Billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs. Sources tell Page Six and People that A-Rod is dating Anne Wojcicki, head of genomics company and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064138/http://pagesix.com/2016/03/22/a-rod-is-dating-sergey-brins-ex-wife/?_ga=1.207138643.1965030224.1401028033">According to Page Six</a>, &quot;The couple was at Graydon Carter&#x2019;s power player-packed pre-Super Bowl gathering in San Francisco, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064138/http://pagesix.com/2016/02/09/power-crowd-mingles-at-graydon-carters-pre-super-bowl-party/">where they were pictured together</a>. Rodriguez and Wojcicki were also last week spotted dining with friends at Bern&#x2019;s Steak House in Tampa, Fla., where he was in town for spring training. A-Rod was also in the audience when Wojcicki, CEO and co-founder of genetic research firm 23andMe, spoke at a satellite event for the Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting in Tampa.&quot; </p>

<p>In a change of pace from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064138/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/23/a-rods_batting_average_by_blonde.php">exes Madonna, Diaz, Hudson</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064138/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/30/a-rods_latest_hard-bodied_blonde_ex.php">retired pro wrestler Torrie Wilson,</a> not to mention ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis, Wojcicki is not a blonde. A source claims, &quot;Alex and Anne are spending time together and have been on a few dates. It is very new. He finds her interesting, inspirational and very smart.&quot; </p>

<p>Both Wojcicki and Rodriguez have two children each from their previous marriages. Wojcicki reportedly received billions in her divorce from Brin; she apparently discovered that Brin and Google Glass marketing manager Amanda Rosenberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064138/http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/04/sergey-brin-amanda-rosenberg-affair">were having an affair</a> after finding messages he sent Rosenberg. Wojcicki&apos;s sister Susan is the CEO of YouTube, BTW. </p>

<p>Of course, it&apos;s unclear what fans from opposing teams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064138/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/02/blonds_or_bosto.php">will do to taunt A-Rod</a> if he&apos;s still dating Wojcicki well into the season&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064138/http://www.amazon.com/Science-Wiz-Ladder-Rungs-Double/dp/B00KA9SH1U/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458735842&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=dna+toy">wave double helix models</a>?</p>
