<p>The train was headed to Jamaica, Queens at around 11:45 a.m. when the drill hit the train car as it left the 21st Street-Queensbridge station. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907225014/http://nypost.com/2014/10/30/massive-drill-bit-nearly-skewers-packed-subway-car/">The Post&apos;s sources tell the tabloid</a> that &quot;the operator heard a thundering noise on the roof and stopped the subway with the emergency brakes &#x2014; and then discovered the drill extending from the roof of the tunnel to the floor, which struck down just inches from the side of the train.&quot;</p>

<p>The drill was being used by contractor Griffin Dewatering New England, Inc. Another source told the Post, &quot;Somebody made a mistake; maybe a surveyor or a field engineer. They drilled into the street but didn&#x2019;t realize they were right over the F train tunnel. They weren&#x2019;t supposed to be in that spot.&quot; And the News&apos; MTA source said, <strong>&quot;Some people don&#x2019;t follow instructions; they drilled deeper than they were supposed to.</strong>&quot; Uh, no kidding, look at this picture:</p>

<p>Passengers were taken off the train and put onto an emergency train. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907225014/http://nypost.com/2014/10/30/massive-drill-bit-nearly-skewers-packed-subway-car/">One passenger was sanguine</a>: &quot;I wasn&#x2019;t worried, I just assumed it was normal MTA crap. Something&#x2019;s always breaking, you&#x2019;re underground so you&#x2019;re pretty much secluded from knowing if there is any real danger.&quot; Anything&apos;s better than a used condom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907225014/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/14/used_condom_f_subway.php">brushing against your hair</a>, right?</p>
