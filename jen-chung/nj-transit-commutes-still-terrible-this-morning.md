<p>Yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105055/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/09/nj_transit_train_derails_between_pe.php">NJ Transit train derailment</a> between Penn Station and the Hudson River meant an extremely annoying Tuesday morning and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105055/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/09/nj_transit_derailment_means_screwed.php">afternoon commute</a> for NJ Transit riders, as well as those on Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road.  Today, trains on the Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast Line are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105055/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/nj_transit_trains_are_delayed_2.html">delayed up to 60 minutes</a>!  And that&apos;s even with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105055/http://www.njtransit.com/hp/hp_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=HomePageTo">some trains cancelled</a>!</p>

<p>Workers are still repairing damage, according to NJ Transit, but Amtrak (which shares tracks with NJ Transit) says repairs are complete.  The PATH and buses are honoring NJ Transit passes.</p>
