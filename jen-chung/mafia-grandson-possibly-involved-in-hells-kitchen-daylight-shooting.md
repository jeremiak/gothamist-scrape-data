Now it turns out there may be a link to the Gambino crime family. <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, the grandson of an associate of John Gotti was taken into custody for his role in the shooting. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082147/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/construction-worker-shot-boss-arrested-cops-article-1.1388079">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Robert Sasso, 31, comes from a long line of mob convicts. His father did three years on gun trafficking charges and his 79-year-old grandfather was convicted in 1992 of helping John Gotti extract payoffs from contractors.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that Sasso orchestrated the shooting because he was fired from the construction company, while a friend actually fired the gun. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082147/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/cops_bust_man_in_connection_with_bjgMVAnMRmvBvavEy83qeP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Queens">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Anthony Manco, the suspected shooter, was arrested today in the Rockaways after cops found him driving the same stolen vehicle that was caught on video fleeing the shooting, sources said. He is charged with attempted murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon.&quot;</p>

<p>Sasso himself has dozens of prior arrests. He was picked up by the police while trying to apply for a union job at JFK Airport.</p>
