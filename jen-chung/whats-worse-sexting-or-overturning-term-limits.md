title: What's Worse: Sexting Or Overturning Term Limits?

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_07_weinersexlk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_weinersexlk.jpg" width="640" height="432" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> has had a hard few weeks ever since he admitted that his sexting continued long after his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/crying_weiner_admits_to_sending_exp.php">2011 resignation</a> and even after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/18/weiner_family_exposed_in_people_mag.php">glowing 2012 People magazine profile</a>. And he&apos;s accepted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/27/voter_refuses_to_shake_weiners_hand.php">tough criticism</a> he&apos;s been getting from voters. But, at an event earlier this week, Weiner brought up a good point: Where does sexting fall on the scale of misdeeds&#x2014;worse or better than overturning term limits?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/08/overturning-term-limits-is-just-as-bad-as-sexting-anthony-weiner">Supporters of his campaign released this video</a> which has &quot;Carlos Danger&quot; responding to one man who demanded to know when he would quit. Weiner said, &quot;You ... have a long record to look at. I did not, for example, come to the people in this room and say I am going to embezzle money or I am gonna turn over your right to have a vote for a third term... That&apos;s something that was passed by the city of New York.&quot; </p>

<p>Weiner added, &quot;People have every right to disqualify me. But why would I quit?&quot; and someone yells, &quot;Amen!</p>

<p>Mayoral frontrunner City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/23/city_council_votes_to.php">accused of engineering a backroom deal</a> to overturn term limits (which she has denied). At any rate, the City Council&apos;s move prompted Mayor Bloomberg to comment, &quot;Today, the majority of the City Council decided to give the people of New York a fuller choice in the November, 2009 election. I believe that was the right choice, and I want to thank Speaker Quinn for her leadership.&quot;</p>

<p>And does this report about mayoral hopeful Public Advocate Bill de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804192750/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/de_blasio_nanny_state_tdvjDl5XDMcS6dK42PUExM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">using city staffers to watch his kids</a> even rank on the misdeeds scale?</p>
