										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_bloomtl.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210071301im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_bloomtl.jpg" width="180" height="233" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s been just over a year since Mayor Bloomberg made his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210071301/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/02/mayor_bloomberg_makes_his_third_ter.php">pitch for extending term limits</a> to three terms and since then, the City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210071301/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/23/city_council_votes_to.php">approved it</a> and the Mayor launched a (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210071301/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/03/bloomberg_spends_64_million_on_thir.php">pricey</a>) third term re-election bid. With a month to go before the election, the NY Times finds that while New Yorkers like Bloomberg, but many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210071301/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/nyregion/04limits.html?_r=2&amp;ref=nyregion">are still sore</a> about term limits.</p>

<p>Bloomberg remains relatively popular with voters, getting about a 70% approval rating.  However, only 50% of those polled say they&apos;ll vote for him.  CUNY poli sci professor John Mollenkopf, who has &quot;informally advised&quot; the Bloomberg campaign, said, &quot;The Bloomberg campaign can&#x2019;t convince voters to not be upset about this. It won&#x2019;t work. If you ask New Yorkers what they did not like over the last eight years, term limits is the major negative.&quot;  </p>

<p>Which is what mayoral challenger City Comptroller Bill Thompson is reminding voters. A Thompson pollster believes that term limits is what has put a &quot;ceiling&quot; on the Mayor&apos;s numbers, in spite of his expensive campaign (Bloomberg&apos;s campaign says that Thompson is focusing on term limits because he can&apos;t match the mayor&apos;s record of performance).  One Bensonhurst woman said she would vote for Thompson, &quot; I didn&#x2019;t go to college, but I know right from wrong. This was wrong.&quot;</p>
