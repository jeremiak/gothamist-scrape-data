The Post (naturally) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165856/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04052009/news/regionalnews/pols_in_tate_of_utter_confusion_on_budge_162937.htm">offers criticism from the Republican minority</a>:  Senator Marty Golden (R-Brooklyn) says, &quot;They haven&apos;t broken down where all the stimulus money is going. How do you vote on a budget that&apos;s not broken down and has only whole numbers? We asked for a breakdown and they told us [Friday] a list was forthcoming.&quot;<p></p>

<p>For instance, taxes and fees may result in an increase of $5.2 billion in the budget&#x2014;or $8 billion, depending on how it&apos;s calculate&#x2014;and Medicaid spending may increase 20%.  However, the Budget office refuses to give confirm the numbers, at this point, because it&apos;s still &quot;developing the final number on the increase to Medicaid costs.&quot;  The full accounting of the budget is due within 30 days, according to the Budget Division.  Government watchdog group, the Citizens Union, released a statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165856/http://www.citizensunion.org/site_res_view_template.aspx?id=e128a4be-8753-43de-b0aa-841635fcc5fc">criticizing the process</a>, &quot;This year&apos;s state budget adoption process reached new lows of back-room politicking and closed-door negotiating, and was not only irresponsible, but more importantly an insult to New Yorkers.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165856/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/nyregion/05pork.html">NY Times looks</a> at how the $170 million in member-item&#x2014;&quot;annual legislative earmarks doled out by individual members for pet project&quot;&#x2014; spending is scattered throughout the budget and will now benefit many Democrats, since the Democrats seized power of the State Senate this past election year: &quot;There is actually more than $170 million in this year&#x2019;s budget, because the Legislature uses discretionary funds left over from previous years for items in this year&#x2019;s budget as well. <strong>No public official could provide the total amount of member items in the budget &#x2014; it is one of Albany&#x2019;s mysteries.</strong>&quot;  </p>
