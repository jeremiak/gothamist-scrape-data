Grimm last year (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Congressman Michael Grimm has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705033032/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-michael-grimm-facing-federal-charges-will-surrender-to-fbi-sources-say/2014/04/27/fd302426-ce33-11e3-b812-0c92213941f4_story.html">turned himself into authorities to face charges</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705033032/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Rep-Michael-Grimm-Expected-to-Surrender-to-FBI-on-Monday-Sources-256913501.html">According to NBC New York&apos;s sources</a>, &quot;Grimm is believed to be facing charges related to a private business deal that he made prior to being elected to Congress that involved an Upper East Side health food restaurant.&quot; </p>

<p>A lawyer for the Staten Island Republican issued a statement last Friday afternoon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705033032/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/25/si_congressman_michael_grimm_thinks.php">trying to get out in front of the scandal</a>, &quot;We are disappointed by the government&#x2019;s decision, but hardly surprised. From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth. Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing.&quot; </p>

<p>While Grimm has been investigated for possible campaign finance issues, these charges are expected to be related to the restaurant Healthalicious. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705033032/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-michael-grimm-facing-federal-charges-will-surrender-to-fbi-sources-say/2014/04/27/fd302426-ce33-11e3-b812-0c92213941f4_story.html">Washington Post reports</a>, &quot;The charges stem from his ownership of a Manhattan health-food restaurant that has ties to an Israeli fundraiser who served as a liaison between Grimm and a mystic, celebrity rabbi whose followers donated more than $500,000 to Grimm&#x2019;s campaign in 2010.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705033032/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/fingerprinting_mugshot_court_a.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Staten Island Advance spoke</a> to defense attorney Mario Gallucci, who said that Grimm, a former FBI agent, would be processed first&#x2014;mugshot, fingerprints&#x2014;before being arraigned: &quot;Gallucci, a veteran of the federal courts, said that he expected the government to seek bail of around $150,000 to $200,000, which could be secured by a bank account or property through what is known as a personal recognizance bond... And Gallucci said that if Grimm were his client, he would advise him to stay at a hotel in Manhattan on Sunday night. That way he could avoid any reporters staked out in front of his home in New Springville.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear where he surrendered to authorities. Grimm is still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705033032/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/nyregion/for-politician-an-indictment-looms-and-so-does-a-campaign-for-re-election.html?ref=nyregion">planning on running for re-election</a>.</p>
