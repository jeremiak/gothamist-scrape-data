<p>A reader wrote to us about a fire that occurred in NJ &quot;that woke us up here in Brooklyn. I live near the Brooklyn Museum, off of Eastern Parkway, and the smell of fire and burning rubber was so strong that someone in my building called the fire department. We gathered on the steps at 2 am with other residents in our building. When people called 911, they had been told there was a warehouse or junkyard fire in New Jersey. It was really alarming-the air was thick with smoke and it smelled so strongly for a few hours.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Jersey City Fire Department tells us it was a scrap metal fire (three alarms!) in a junk yard at 1 Linden Avenue East. The fire occurred just after midnight. The NYC Office of Emergency Management <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165243/http://twitter.com/notifynyc">Tweeted</a> messages that residents in Brooklyn and Queens might smell the smoke.  Sigh, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165243/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/05/maple_syrup_smell_press_conference.php">miss the maple syrup</a>.</p>
