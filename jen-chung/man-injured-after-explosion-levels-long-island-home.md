<p>Yesterday afternoon, an explosion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160902/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=8114441">ripped apart a home in Syosset</a>, injuring a 48-year-old guidance counselor.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160902/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/syosset-explosion-sends-man-to-hospital-1.2858912">According to Newsday</a>, owner Brian Welsh was &quot;found dazed, badly hurt and speaking incoherently on the front lawn.&quot; Fire officials said the roof and floor collapsed and the walls caved in; it&apos;s believed the explosion may have been caused by a gas leak.</p>

<p>Welsh, a guidance counselor at Half Hollow Hills High School, was flown to Nassau University Medical Center for burns all over his body. WABC 7 reports, &quot;Around noon he&apos;d been in the basement reportedly cleaning his gas clothes dryer when something caused a spark and blew up his house.&quot; </p>

<p>His sister-in-law said Welsh would need skin grafts; his wife and children were not at home at the time.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160902/http://syosset.patch.com/articles/one-seriously-injured-in-syosset-house-explosion">A neighbor said</a>, &quot;It was a big boom, and I could feel it inside my chest. We went outside and looked over and we saw the roof all shaken up. I don&apos;t even know how to describe it.&quot;</p>
