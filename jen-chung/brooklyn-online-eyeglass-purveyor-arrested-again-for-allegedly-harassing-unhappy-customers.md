<p>The owner of an online eyeglasses website who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233035/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/business/vitaly-borker-owner-of-decormyeyes-sentenced-for-threats-to-customers.html">previously convicted</a> for threatening customers with violence&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233035/http://nypost.com/2012/09/07/cyber-bully-gets-four-years-for-threatening-to-rape-murder-women-who-complained-about-his-web-biz/">including rape and murder</a>&#x2014;has been arrested again. This time, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office says he allegedly &quot;misrepresent[ed] the authenticity and condition of eyeglasses sold through the website&quot;&#x2014;and &quot;harass[ed] customers who complained or attempted to return their purchases.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2010, Vitaly Borker was sentenced to four years in prison (he served three and a half) for threatening customers. He came to law enforcement attention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233035/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">after bragging to the NY Times</a> about his tactics, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve exploited this opportunity because it works. No matter where they post their negative comments, it helps my return on investment. So I decided, why not use that negativity to my advantage?&quot;</p><blockquote>He stumbled upon the upside of rudeness by accident.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I stopped caring,&#x201D; he says, and for that he blames customers. They lied and changed their minds in ways that cost him money, he says, and at some point he started telling them off in the bluntest of terms. To his amazement, this seemed to better his standing in certain Google searches, which brought in more sales.</p>

<p>Before this discovery, he&#x2019;d hired a search optimization company to burnish his site&#x2019;s reputation by writing positive things about DecorMyEyes online. Odious behavior, he realized, worked much better, and it didn&#x2019;t cost him a penny.</p></blockquote>In the new complaint, Borker was operating &quot;OpticsFast.com&quot; that claimed to sell &quot;brand new and 100% authentic&quot;  luxury eyewear. The U.S. Attorney&apos;s office, though, says, &quot;[C]ustomers of OpticsFast.com frequently received damaged and counterfeit items, were refused refunds, charged unauthorized restocking fees, or never sent eyewear for which they had been charged.  When those customers tried to return merchandise, Borker, using an alias, subjected them to a campaign of abusive emails and text messages.  Borker also insulted customers, called them names, and threatened to refer disputed sales to debt collectors.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint, a customer in California complained about receiving damaged, fake Ray-Bans with the wrong prescription, and then allegedly received 35 phone calls a day and many emails calling her a &quot;stupid stupid lady&quot; and a &quot;total degenerate.&quot; She was said she received a call from a &quot;police officer&quot; who said a civil harassment suit was filed against her.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2017_05_glassescomp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233035im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_05_glassescomp.jpg" width="640" height="175"> <br> <i> From the criminal complaint</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Another unhappy customer told a federal agent that he asked OpticsFast about fixing sunglasses and clicked on a link for a shipping label. However, the customer never used the label and when he refused to pay for the label, OpticsFacts &quot;began sending [the victim] a text message every morning at 6 a.m. to demand payment. The OpticsFast Email Account also sent [the victim] hundreds of emails, including approximately 456 emails on a single day, hundreds of which had the subject line &quot;I WIN!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Borker was charged with mail fraud and wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. </p>

<p>&quot;As alleged, Vitaly Borker ran his eyewear business, OpticsFast.com, as an online platform for fraud, selling defective and counterfeit merchandise,&quot; Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said. &quot;And as alleged, when his customers rightfully complained or tried to get their money back, Borker harassed and abused them.  Borker&#x2019;s shameless brand of alleged abuse cannot be tolerated, and we are committed to protecting consumers from becoming victims of such criminal behavior.  We thank our partners at the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for their shared commitment to this mission.&quot;</p>

<p>Borker&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233035/http://nypost.com/2017/05/25/bully-eyeglass-salesman-busted-for-harassing-customers-again/">said his client would plead not guilty</a>.</p>
