<p>A day after a whale was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015022/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/video_whale_spotted_visiting_nyc_ne.php">spotted in New York Harbor by Liberty Island</a>, a whale was spotted up the Hudson River by the George Washington Bridge yesterday afternoon. </p>

<p>Apparently the whale was happily feasting on &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015022/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Whale-Spotted-Near-George-Washington-Bridge--401927126.html">schools of menhaden, or bunker fish</a>.&quot; </p>

It&apos;s believed this is the same whale from Thursday, just further north. Paul Sieswerda of Gotham Whale, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015022/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/whale-gwb-city-sighting-days-article-1.2879310">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;Hopefully, it&#x2019;s just chasing fish. There are a lot of fish inside the harbor and up the Hudson River.&quot; He added that he contacted the Riverhead Foundation to monitor the whale&apos;s movements, &quot;Sometimes when whales get deep into rivers, there is an indication something is wrong.&quot;

<p><br>
Hopefully the whale is just healthy and is enjoying the bounty of fish. Hudson River observer Gil Hawkins told NBC New York that he&apos;s &quot;seen eagles and ospreys&quot; devouring the menhaden, &quot;picked it up off the river as if you were picking vegetables from a market.&quot; </p>

<p>And, yes, menhaden are the fish from that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015022/https://theawl.com/why-is-this-fish-kill-so-beautiful-c080560c8e96#.5vxfg25ft">mesmerizing</a> huge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015022/http://easthamptonstar.com/Lead-article/20161114/Massive-Fish-Kill-Clogs-Shinnecock-Canal">fish kill in Long Island</a>.</p>
