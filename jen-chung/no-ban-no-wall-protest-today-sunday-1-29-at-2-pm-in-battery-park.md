<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016021117js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>The event will be on the west side of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021117/https://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm">Castle Clinton National Monument</a>, near the Statue of Liberty viewpoint at 2 p.m. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021117/https://www.facebook.com/events/1793522974242870/">organizers&apos; Facebook page explains</a>:</p><blockquote>In a true show of force, thousands of people descended upon JFK calling for the release of dozens of refugees and immigrants who were being detained, questioned, and refused entry to the United States. <p></p>

<p>Due to the collective efforts of advocacy groups and organizers in New York, the Federal Court for the Eastern District of New York has now issued a temporary stay halting President Donald Trump&#x2019;s executive order.</p>

<p>The signing of President Trump&apos;s executive order has affected thousands - refugees seeking asylum and protection who have already been approved for visas, mothers and fathers barred from reuniting with their families, legal permanent residents being denied the ability to return to school or work, and refugees fleeing persecution being forced to return to their countries to death and violence. </p>

<p>WE CALL ON OUR COMMUNITIES TO KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM TO FIGHT THE REFUGEE AND MUSLIM BAN! </p>

<p>Let&apos;s make it clear that we don&apos;t just want a temporary halt, we want human rights and dignity for refugees and immigrants and we want a reversal of these inhumane executive orders NOW.</p>

<p>JOIN US ON SUNDAY, JANUARY 29TH at Battery Park to march to the offices of Customs and Border Patrol in Manhattan.</p>

<p>We have a permit to rally and march.<br>
