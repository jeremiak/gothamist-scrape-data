</div></div>					<p>Last night, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2009/">MTV Video Music Awards</a> returned to New York City with its usual mix of spectacle and a heavy dose of nostalgia (mostly Michael Jackson-related, with a remembrance from Madonna, then a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/435991/michael-jackson-tribute.jhtml#id=1620606">performance of Scream by Janet Jackson</a>). However, the whole thing was upstaged by Kanye West&apos;s antics&#x2014;the rapper decided to storm the stage when Taylor Swift was the surprise winner for Best Female Video with her song &quot;You Belong With Me.&quot; He took the microphone from the 19-year-old to declare Beyonce&apos;s &quot;Single Ladies&quot; &quot;<strong>one of the best videos of all time</strong>.&quot;  Here&apos;s video:</p>

<center><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424oe_/http://media.mtvnservices.com/mgid:uma:video:mtv.com:435995" width="512" height="319" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="configParams=id%3D1620605%26vid%3D435995%26uri%3Dmgid%3Auma%3Avideo%3Amtv.com%3A435995%26startUri={startUri}" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" base="."><div style="margin:0;text-align:center;width:500px;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12px;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/" style="color:#439CD8;" target="_blank">MTV Shows</a></div></center>

<p>West was booed by the audience&#x2014;while Swift looked confused&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621404/20090913/west_kanye.jhtml">he was asked to leave</a> (possibly for his own safety&#x2014;security had to keep Pink from him!).  Apparently Swift and her mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://twitter.com/djneilarmstrong/status/3969265311">were <em>crying</em> backstage</a>. Gawker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://gawker.com/5358569/kanye-west-youre-a-dick">declared Kanye &quot;a dick&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/09/kanye-west-rapes-taylor-swifts-soul-at-the-mtv-video-music-awards/">Cajun Boy at Animal New York decided</a>, &quot;The thought did occur to me that this whole thing might just be another of the many VMA pranks we&#x2019;ve seen over the years, but this just seems too bizarre to be a hoax, and Kanye West is enough of an asshole to do something like this, so yeah, it all makes perfect sense.&quot;</p>

<p>Swift did manage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621394/20090913/swift__taylor.jhtml">perform in the subway and on the city streets</a> later (she actually took the F train from 42nd Street to 47th-50th, leaving the station via an emergency exit &#x2014;yes, the alarm went off&#x2014;video after the jump).  And when Beyonce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1621406/20090913/knowles_beyonce.jhtml">won Video of the Year for &quot;Single Ladies,&quot;</a> she remembered her first VMA nomination, &quot;It was one of the most exciting moments in my life, so I&apos;d like for Taylor to come out and have her moment.&quot; The two embraced and Swift said, &quot;Maybe we can try this again.&quot; (Video after the jump.)</p>

<p>Kanye, who said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1544794/20061103/west_kanye.jhtml">he had a little &quot;sippy sippy&quot;</a> before the show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713015424/http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/kanye-apologizes-for-bumrushing-taylor-swift/">apologized on his website</a>, adding, &quot;<strong>I&apos;M NOT CRAZY YALL, I&apos;M JUST REAL.</strong>&quot;</p>
