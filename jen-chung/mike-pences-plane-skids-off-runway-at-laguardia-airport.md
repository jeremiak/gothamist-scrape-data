<p>WABC 7 reports, &quot;ABC News Producer Ines de LaCuetara was on board the plane at the time of the hard landing. She said in a phone interview with Eyewitness News that there are two cracks now on the runway from the hard landing and subsequent skid. She added that there have been other hard landings on the Pence plane, and everyone on board thought this would be like the others, until they started skidding.&quot;</p>

<p>Pence&apos;s running mate, Donald Trump, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021821/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/17/trump_calls_laguardia_airport_third.php">called the airport a &quot;third world airport.&quot;</a> Vice President Joe Biden has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021821/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/biden_says_laguardias_like_a_third.php">compared Laguardia to a third world country</a>.

<p><b>Update</b>: The Port Authority issued this statement, &quot;There were no injuries tonight when a charter plane carrying Republican Vice Presidential Nominee Mike Pence and more than 30 others overshot a LaGuardia Airport runway.  There was no fire and passengers are off the plane.  Port Authority emergency personnel and other agencies are on the scene.  No planes are landing or departing the airport at this time and airport officials are hopeful of resuming flights on one runway within 30 minutes. Passengers should check with their carriers on flight status and delays.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Also, the agency added, &quot;One of LaGuardia&#x2019;s two runways has reopened for arriving and departing flights, following tonight&#x2019;s incident in which a plane overshot the runway. LaGuardia&#x2019;s other runway will remain closed indefinitely pending clearing of the aircraft.  There were no injuries.  Passengers are advised to contact their carrier on the status of flights and delays.&quot;</p>
