<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_bagck.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130300im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_bagck.jpg" width="140" height="115" class="image-right"> </span>The city&apos;s overall budget cuts are apparently hitting the NYPD right in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130300/http://gothamist.com/2005/07/22/welcome_subway_bag_checks_by_the_nypd.php">subway bag check area</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130300/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/nyc/090428_TSA_to_Replace_NYPD_on_Subway_Bag_Checks">MyFoxNY reports</a> that with few police officers available, &quot;Transportation Security Administration bag screeners from Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports will be replacing most NYPD cops in the subway that screen bags for explosives.&quot; The TSA wouldn&apos;t confirm the plan (but did say taking TSA screeners from airports and putting them underground wouldn&apos;t effect air safety) and the NYPD says these are just talks. However, sources tell MyFoxNY it&apos;s likely to happen&#x2014;and it&apos;ll work this way: &quot;<strong>About 30 TSA screeners a day will be pulled from the three area airports Monday through Friday to inspect bags at various subway locations throughout the city. At each location they&apos;ll be teamed up with one police officer instead of the two or three officers you currently see at inspection sites.</strong>&quot;  Naturally, the Patrolmen&apos;s Benevolent Association says this is a terrible idea and says budget crisis or no, the NYPD needs more cops.  </p>
