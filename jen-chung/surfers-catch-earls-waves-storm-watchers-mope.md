</div></div><p>Hurricane Earl was all bark but no bite as the tri-state area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055404/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/us/04hurricane.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">barely got hit</a>, in spite of predications and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055404/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/02/mta_offers_plan_for_hurricane_earl.php">preparations</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055404/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/surf_upheaval_Kg30lZooP05HcH4iFtnD1L?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz0yZrmMiW3">A Montauk resident said</a>, &quot;Where is the hurricane everybody&apos;s been talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>Still, the storm was enough to provide a great surfing day. The Daily News&apos; Ben Chapman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055404/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/04/2010-09-04_how_i_tamed_earls_swirls.html">headed out to the Rockaways</a> where others had the same idea: One Upper West Sider said, &quot;This is what we wait for all year. It&apos;s beautiful out,&quot; and a surf shop owner said, &quot;When you see a good surfer riding a big wave, it&apos;s like watching an art form.&quot;</p>

<p>However, while some property owners were relieved Earl didn&apos;t batter their homes and businesses, those hoping for a spectacular storm were bummed out.  Two people in NJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055404/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/09/04/storm-watchers-disappointed-in-earl/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Total disappointment. Missed the mark,&#x201D; and &#x201C;It was nothing. Absolutely nothing.&#x201D; </p>
