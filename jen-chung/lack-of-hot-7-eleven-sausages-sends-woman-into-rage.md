And apparently the woman was driven into a rage because...there were no hot sausages at the store.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165846/http://www.nj.com/cumberland/index.ssf/2012/03/police_lack_of_7-11_sausages_s.html">According to The News of Cumberland County</a>, the cop said he saw Brittany Glanville &quot;wing an item at the head of the clerk on duty. With quick reflexes the clerk was able to snatch the item out of the air and avoid being hit.  The officer said that as he began to enter the store Glanville was attempting to climb over the counter and go after the clerk, so he immediately arrested her.  He put her in the back of his patrol car where she repeatedly tried kicking out the windows until finally he pepper-sprayed her into submission.&quot;</p>

<p>The 7-Eleven workers said Glanville was upset &quot;when there were no sausages ready for her to eat in the store&#x2019;s hot dog cooker,&quot; and the cop &quot;said she appeared to be intoxicated because of her strange behavior, slurred speech, bloodshot and watery eyes and the distinct odor of alcohol on her breath.&quot;</p>

<p>Glanville was charged with disorderly conduct.  The type of sausage was not identified, but these &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165846/http://www.7-eleven.com/Hungry/Hot/Maple-Pancake-Sausage/Default.aspx#3002015-001">Maple Pancake Sausage Rollers</a>&quot; look like just the thing to send someone into a frenzy.</p>
