Assemblyman Richard Brodsky (D-Westchester) wants the authorities to disclose what they doing, &quot;The state borrows less and less and hires less and less, and state authorities borrow more and more and hire more and more,&quot; and referring to the infamous figure who helped create the public authority system, &quot;<strong>I&#x2019;m sure Robert Moses was a nice man, but these are Frankenstein monsters.</strong>&quot;</p>
