A spokesman for Liu told the NY Times that about $20,000 has been refunded; the Times adds, &quot;Much of that has been sent back to people connected to companies highlighted in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302172622/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/nyregion/irregularities-found-in-john-lius-campaign-finance-reports.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">investigation by The New York Times in October</a> into Mr. Liu&#x2019;s campaign disclosure reports. The inquiry found that some people listed as his campaign donors insisted that they had never given money.&quot;</p>

<p>One man who had been raising money for Liu, Xing Wu &quot;Oliver&quot; Pan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302172622/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/feds_arrest_fund_raiser_who_worked.php">was arrested for allegedly taking $16,000 from</a> an undercover agent who said he wanted to donate money. Pan is accused of offering to mask the $16K, which is more than the legal limit for donation of $4,950, via straw donors.  Liu has not yet been charged with any crimes.</p>

<p>Liu&apos;s spokesman George Arzt said, &quot;Refunds are a standard process of campaign committees. It&#x2019;s been a policy of the John Liu campaign that when a question is raised on a contribution, we refund it.&quot; When Liu was elected Comptroller in 2009, it was the highest office ever achieved by an Asian in NYC.
