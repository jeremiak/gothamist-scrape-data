Besides the adorable picture of his and wife Huma Abedin&apos;s adorable baby Jordan and how Weiner is trying to convince New York and America that he&apos;s totally cool with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151132/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/25/video_weiner_health_care_debate_tir.php">not being the spotlight and fighting for Americans</a>?<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151132/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/weiner-speaks-about-scandal-and-dismisses-reports-of-campaign/?ref=nyregion">CityRoom notes</a> that &quot;the article opens with a description of him singing &apos;Joy to the World&apos; while shampooing Jordan&#x2019;s hair &#x2014; and dismissed reports that he was considering running for mayor of New York next year.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151132/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444464304577535253178053234.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTSecondStories">Wall Street Journal points out</a> how the interview also says &quot;Weiner is responsible for doing all of his family&apos;s laundry... He has done some paid consulting from home, but he&apos;s mostly kept a low profile.&quot;  Weiner claims, &quot;<strong>I really do feel like a very different person</strong>.&quot;  <em>Anthony Weiner: He Knows His Stains<br>
</em><br>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151132/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/creep_eyes_comeback_life_escape_vneIxiGnt3krZjhfcI3Q8M?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Post&apos;s Andrea Peyser isn&apos;t buying it</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;It took a lot of work to get to where we are today, but I want people to know we&#x2019;re a normal family,&#x201D; Huma, 37, said, while disturbingly parading the couple&#x2019;s 6-month-old son, Jordan, like a pet prop.<p></p>

<p>Normal? Compared to whom? The Manson family?</p>

<p>...Like many American househusbands, junk-centric Weiner, who resigned from Congress last year, can&#x2019;t get a job and finds changing diapers smelly and unfulfilling. Meanwhile, his wife is starting to nag and kvetch. Pretty soon, she might drive Weiner back to the Internet.</p>

<p>The proof was in a creepy at-home photograph taken at the couple&#x2019;s Manhattan apartment (they fled Queens, postscandal) in which Weiner issued a quiet cry for help. In the pic, Weiner&#x2019;s face bears an agonized grin. His mouth says, &#x201C;What, me worry?&#x201D; but his eyes say, &#x201C;Get me outta here!&#x2019;&#x2019;</p></blockquote>Also weird: Another Post columnist&#x2014;Michael Goodwin&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151132/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/07/6242706/goodwin-and-gambling-picture-jordan-weiner">equated Weiner&apos;s crotch shots with the photos of his son</a> or something.<p></p>

<p>Of course, this PR offensive comes just as Rep. Michele Bachmann is accusing Abedin, who is Muslim and a trusted aide of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, of being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151132/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505267_162-57475483/michelle-bachmann-refuses-to-back-down-on-claims-about-huma-abedin/">linked to the Muslim Brotherhood</a>.  Senator John McCain said of the claim, &quot;These attacks have no logic, no basis and no merit, and they need to stop... When anyone, not least a member of Congress, launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow Americans on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and ignorance of what they stand for, it defames the spirit of our nation, and we all grow poorer because of it.&quot;</p>
