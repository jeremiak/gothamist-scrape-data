The police are investigating her death, but it&apos;s suspected it may have been suicide.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152657/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/columbia-coed-samantha-kwek-death-plunge-midtown-balcony-breakup-beau-article-1.1014425">According to the Daily News</a>, family and police sources believe she &quot;jumped to her death Sunday after arguing with her boyfriend about breaking up,&quot; reporting that the 22-year-old &quot;threatened suicide in text messages she exchanged with Benjamin Small, 30, whom she had been dating for three months, the sources said. She vowed she would kill herself if he didn&#x2019;t meet her at her apartment uptown to talk. He refused, so she made her way to his&quot; apartment at 100 United Nations Plaza.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152657/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/co_ed_death_plunge_IrPnA7f7s9J9SFztQneRFJ">Post picks up</a>, &quot;There was an argument and she said words to the effect that she couldn&#x2019;t live without him, the sources said.&quot;  Then she jumped from the balcony. But Kwek&apos;s brother-in-law said the family was suspicious, &quot;To jump out 16 floors takes a lot &#x2014; to take your life. It all seems a little too fish... She&#x2019;s not one to be attached to a guy like that. She&#x2019;s strong and smart and involved.&quot;  He added, &quot;We went out for Chinese for dinner for New Year [on Sunday]. But she got into a fight with him and they didn&#x2019;t come... She said, &#x2018;You know what? I&#x2019;m done with him,&apos;&quot; and insisted Kwek was the one breaking up with him.</p>

<p>Small was spotted outside his building; when asked why Kwek jumped, he told the Post, &quot;I really don&#x2019;t know why. She was really, really sad, I guess.&quot; </p>
