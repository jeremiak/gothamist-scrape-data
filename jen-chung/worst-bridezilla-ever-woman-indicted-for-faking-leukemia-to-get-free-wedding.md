Together, the community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110105534/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100426/NEWS/100429740/-1/NEWS14">donated a wedding gown, flowers, rings, a honeymoon and even cash</a> for Vega and her groom Michael O&apos;Connell.  The couple, with their baby daughter at their side, married on May 2...and then in September 2010, O&apos;Connell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110105534/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100906/NEWS/9060333">revealed that Vega never had cancer</a>.  Now Vega has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110105534/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120410/NEWS/120409724&amp;cid=sitesearch">indicted on grand larceny and fraud charges</a>.</p>

<p>See, husband O&apos;Connell became suspicious when Vega didn&apos;t seem to get sick and remained healthy.  He called her doctor&apos;s office, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110105534/http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/04/10/bride-indicted-for-allegedly-bilking-public-out-of-money-with-cancer-lie-for-wedding/">said she was never a patient there</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110105534/http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-indictment-former-orange-county-resident-posing-dying-bride">NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said</a>, &quot;By pretending to have a terminal illness, Vega inexcusably took advantage of the community&apos;s hearts and minds, and profited off of their generosity. Our office will hold this individual accountable for fleecing the public through lies and deception.&quot; A press release states, &quot;Vega is charged with six felonies and one misdemeanor: one count of Scheme to Defraud in the First Degree, five counts of Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree, and one count of Criminal Possession of a Forged Instrument in the Third Degree. The maximum sentence for any of the felony charges in the indictment is 1&#x2153;- 4 years in prison.&quot;  </p>

<p>Times Herald-Record reporter Doyle Murphy, who initially reported about Vega&apos;s plight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110105534/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100906/NEWS/9060333">wrote in September 2010</a>:</p><blockquote> O&apos;Connell insisted a letter from Dr. Dan Costin that described her diagnosis was a fake.<p></p>

<p>When I was reporting the April 26 story, Vega showed me the letter to verify her diagnosis.</p>

<p>Now O&apos;Connell had invited me to listen in when he called Costin&apos;s Westchester office and asked about Vega&apos;s medical records: &quot;Never a patient here&quot; was the response.</p>

<p>He hadn&apos;t wanted to look at Costin&apos;s letter before. And Vega had said in April that she kept it hidden to make life easier for him. O&apos;Connell said he now wished he&apos;d checked out the letter sooner.</p>

<p>In his mother&apos;s house in Walden, he switched on the speakerphone and dialed Costin&apos;s number.</p>

<p>A receptionist transferred O&apos;Connell to an administrator who sounded exasperated to hear from him again.</p>

<p>&quot;I can tell you for sure this person was never a patient here,&quot; the woman said, adding that they didn&apos;t want to keep receiving his calls. O&apos;Connell hung up and pumped his fist.</p></blockquote>Vega, who said she would take Murphy to her doctor&apos;s office but never did, also accused O&apos;Connell of being abusive (O&apos;Connell claimed he bit her to escape being headlocked by her; he &quot;said he also slapped her during a fight at their Montgomery apartment before they separated. He claimed Vega had torn up his car and punched him in the face that day because he was kicking her out.&quot;).  <p></p>

<p>The couple divorced but got back together and have a second child.  Vega has pleaded not guilty and O&apos;Connell, who is trying to help her get a lawyer, thinks she should repay the donors, but shouldn&apos;t have jail time&#x2014;just mental health treatment, &quot;<b>She&apos;s a good mom, and that&apos;s all that counts at the end of the day. I want my kids to have their mother back.</b>&quot;</p>
