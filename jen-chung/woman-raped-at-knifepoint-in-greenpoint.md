<p>The police released details about a rape that occurred last weekend in Greenpoint as well as surveillance video and a sketch of the suspect.</p>

<p>On Sunday, June 16, just after midnight, the NYPD says a 26-year-old woman was walking near 198 Java Street when a man approached her and tried to chat her up (as seen in the video below). The man, armed with a knife, then raped her. </p>

We always look behind, especially late at night, but it makes you wonder if you should be more cautious these days.&quot;</p>

<p>City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Council Member Stephen Levin said, &quot;Sunday&apos;s vicious sexual assault of a young woman in Greenpoint, Brooklyn is disturbing news in the safest big City in the world. We are deeply troubled by reports that the survivor of this attack may have been targeted because of her sexual orientation. New York City&apos;s greatest strength is our diversity, but in recent months, there has been an unacceptable increase in hate crimes.&quot;<br>
