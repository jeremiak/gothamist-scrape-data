<p>Officials in western New York are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/21/photos_buffalo_officials_fear_flood.php">bracing for potential flooding</a> after the huge snowstorm that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/20/photos_buffalo.php#photo-1">dumped</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/19/buffalo_snow_photos.php#photo-1">as many as</a> 88 inches of snow in the Buffalo region, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/18/freezing_50_states_climate_snow_hel.php">thanks to the lake effect</a>. In fact, Governor Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/weather/cuomo-moves-cabinet-to-buffalo-to-monitor-storm-recovery-20141124">has moved his cabinet to Buffalo</a>, to show he&apos;s Serious about recovery. So serious that he&apos;s taken to blaming the National Weather Service for &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://thevane.gawker.com/andrew-cuomo-slams-natl-weather-service-over-his-own-ig-1662362854">their largely accurate Buffalo snow forecasts.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>During a Saturday press conference, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://nypost.com/2014/11/24/cuomo-blames-forecasters-over-buffalo-area-snowstorms/">Cuomo insisted</a>, &quot;No one had an idea that it was going to be that much snow that fast... Snow coming down at the rate of about 5 inches an hour. No one had an idea. The weather service was off.&#x201D;</p>

<p>However, if you look at the <em>facts</em>, the National Weather Service actually DID forecast the intense snow. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011530/http://rochester.twcnews.com/content/news/787651/cuomo-blames-nws-for-buffalo-s-lack-of-preparation-for-wny-storm/#sthash.zk0n239g.dpuf">From TWC News</a>:</p><blockquote>According an e-mail from the NWS, by Saturday the prediction was one to two feet of snow or more.<p></p>

<p>By Sunday, the NWS was calling for a blizzard, definitely two feet of snow, and an expectation for roads to become impassable.</p>

<p>By 3:45 p.m. Monday, the NWS increased forecasts again to two to three feet or more, and predicted snowfall rates would reach five inches per hour.</p>

<p>In a statement, the NWS said:&quot;The National Weather Service issued time and accurate forecasts for not just one, but two heavy lake-effect snow events for the Buffalo area.&quot;</p></blockquote>And you do not MESS with the meteorologists:<p></p>

<p>According to the Post, while the NWS updated its forecast for six feet of snow on Tuesday, &quot;[S]tate officials only planned for 3 feet of snow from a briefing they received Monday and got a late start plowing out the region.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, Cuomo, with his snow boner, says he&apos;ll create NY state&apos;s own weather service, &quot;We want even more information and even more data, and the only way to get it then is to put up more stations that have more sensors.&quot;</p>
