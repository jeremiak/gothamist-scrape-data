										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_08_dsmurdo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163507im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_08_dsmurdo.jpg" width="260" height="173" class="image-left"> </span>Yes, it&apos;s time for items related to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163507/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosque">proposed mosque and community center</a> two blocks from the World Trade Center and the rhetoric about why the Park 51 project should or shouldn&apos;t go forward. Last week, the Daily Show pointed out that speculating about Fox News&apos; speculation about possible terrorist funding for the mosque was akin to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163507/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/20/daily_show_connects_rupert_murdoch.php">speculating about terrorist funding for Fox News parent company News Corp.</a>, since News Corp.&apos;s second biggest investor is Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. Then yesterday, Fox News&apos; Dan Senor basically said that Al-Waleed funds Park 51&apos;s Imam Feisel Abdul Rauf and radical madrassas....but neglected to mention Al-Waleed by name or his News Corp. connection. Which gave Jon Stewart a lot of fodder:</p>

<p>Then MSNBC&apos;s Rachel Maddow wondered why Glenn Beck and Bush administration official Karen Hughes are denouncing the project and the Park 51 imam, since they both worked with him on projects (video after the jump).  Governor Paterson and Archbishop Dolan are reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163507/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/paterson_dolan_to_discuss_mosque_rdFbanPrTJv7m8aAdWLHBK">meeting about the mosque</a>, though it&apos;s unclear if any Park 51 participants are also meeting. And just in case you were wondering, Donald Trump is also against the mosque <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163507/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/even_the_donald_opposes_ground_zero_bVbUv4cNWxe7TcbaTvvz7K">being so close to Ground Zero</a>, &quot;It&apos;s very insensitive and it shouldn&apos;t be there. I&apos;m a big believer in freedom of religion, but I think the mosque being in that location is absolutely wrong.&quot;</p>
