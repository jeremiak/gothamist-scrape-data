</div></div>					<p>The Yankees lost one of their biggest&#x2014;and noisiest&#x2014;fans: Freddy Schuman, better known to New Yorkers as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519235653/http://www.freddysez.com/">Freddy Sez</a>&quot; who rallied fans with homemade signs and by banging his frying pan, passed away on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital.  A friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519235653/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/10/17/2010-10-17_freddy_sez_a_yankee_stadium_staple_for_the_last_20_years_dead_at_age_82.html">told the Daily News</a> that the 85-year-old collapsed on Friday said, &quot;Freddy was a true Yankee legend and a No. 1 fan [who] will be missed.&quot;</p>

<p>Schuman brought his fan fervor to Yankees Stadium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519235653/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/15/nyregion/15freddy.html">since 1988</a> and the Yankees even<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519235653/http://riveraveblues.com/2010/10/freddy-schuman-long-time-yanks-stalwart-passes-away-37061/"> flew him out to a World Series game</a> in 2001.  Last year, when the new stadium opened, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519235653/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/21/add_new_yankee_stadium_woes_no_fred.php">had problems getting tickets</a>, stirring outrage about the Yankees&apos; possibly elitist ticket prices (the Yankees found tickets for him eventually).  One of his frying pans was even donated to Cooperstown and he can be seen in House of Pain&apos;s &quot;Jump Around&quot; video (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519235653/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwQbPgouUYo">at 2:55</a>). Schuman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519235653/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_kwq2Z0gB5fuI3RccJZAf3H;jsessionid=AFF17692BF4739371292A84899F11236">once revealed </a>that he couldn&apos;t practice his frying pan routine when his wife was at home.</p>

<p>Yankees player Nick Swisher told the News, &quot;I&apos;ve seen him out there all the time. I know he&apos;s been here forever. I definitely send my best wishes to his family.&quot; And Tina Lewis, the queen of the &quot;Bleacher Creatures,&quot; said, &quot;It&apos;s going to be very strange without him, without hearing Freddy and his pans. He wasn&apos;t a Creature, but we respected him out in the bleachers. I wish he&apos;d lived to see what I hope is one more great postseason.&quot;</p>
