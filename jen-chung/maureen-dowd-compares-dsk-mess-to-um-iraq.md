										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_06_modow.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501164924im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_modow.jpg" width="190" height="240" class="image-right"> </span>Finally, NY Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501164924/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/opinion/sunday/03dowd.html?ref=opinion">weighing in on the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case</a>, which has turned from the authorities believing they had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501164924/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/19/dominique_strauss-kahn_indicted_on.php">strong sexual assault case</a> against the leading international politician to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501164924/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/30/report_authorities_suspect_dominiqu.php">revelations that the accuser has been lying a lot</a>. She begins, &quot;So what&#x2019;s the moral of this Manhattan immorality tale? That the French are always right, even when their hauteur is irritating? <strong>They were right about Iraq and America&#x2019;s rush to war. And they may be right about Dominique Strauss-Kahn and America&#x2019;s rush to judgment.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>She continues:</p><blockquote>In both cases, French credibility was undermined, so we resisted seeing things from their point of view.<p></p>

<p>France tried to block W.&#x2019;s spun-up attack on Iraq, but we knew that the French government had a history of making special oil deals with Saddam Hussein, and of favoring expediency over principle.</p>

<p>France refused to believe that DSK could force himself on a Sofitel maid, but we knew that French society had a history of shielding powerful and talented men accused of scandalous behavior with young women.</p>

<p>W. created a fake deadline and casus belli on Iraq, but New York prosecutors had a real deadline before Strauss-Kahn flew away to France, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.</p></blockquote>Dowd also looks at the new developments and the maid&apos;s credibility, deciding, &quot;When a habitual predator faces off against a habitual liar, the liar will most likely lose, even if it is the rare case when she is telling the truth.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501164924/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/02/2011-07-02_liberteacute_oui_egaliteacute_non_dsk_accusers_shady_so_what.html">Daily News&apos; Joanna Molloy wrote</a>, &quot;Okay, her credibility is as wobbly as a three-legged chair, but that doesn&apos;t mean she wasn&apos;t attacked. Her shakiness as a witness doesn&apos;t change the fact that the horny Frenchman (wait, is that redundant?) left his DNA on her uniform,&quot; and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501164924/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/the_filthy_froggy_is_still_wart_GbGxUl1IfsKzTJ9TJs8sHL">NY Post&apos;s Andrea Peyser said</a>, &quot;So Dominique Strauss-Kahn is probably not a maid-mangling sex fiend. Don&apos;t pop the French bubbly just yet. The lowlife frog was revealed yesterday as something twisted... As soon as he was done getting oral sex, Strauss-Kahn checked out of the hotel as fast as a scared bunny. Then he had lunch with his 26-year-old daughter, as if nothing special had happened.&quot;</p>
