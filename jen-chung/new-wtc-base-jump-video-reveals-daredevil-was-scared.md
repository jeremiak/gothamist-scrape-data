<p>In March, it was revealed that a trio of men had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/24/cops_to_charge_skydivers_who_jumped.php">successfully jumped from 1 World Trade Center</a> in 2013. The BASE jumpers also videotaped their bravery/idiocy, <a 25="" 2014="" href="&lt;a href=" http:="" gothamist.com="" 03="" video_watch_wtc_base_jumpers_dive_o.php#photo-1"="">&quot;&gt;resulting in terrifying and beautiful footage</a>. Yesterday, one of the jumpers&apos; lawyers released another video, explaining, well, YOLO.</p>

<p>The video was taken from a camera that Marko Markovich had, and his lawyer Timothy Parlatore said, &quot;There&#x2019;s no question over what happened that night so there&#x2019;s no reason to hide behind it.&quot; There&apos;s also a prominent URL for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://www.nycbasejump.com/">nycbasejump.com</a>&#x2014;which is a legal defense fund for Markovich, Andrew Rossig and James Brady (Parlatore says any money raised from the video will go to 9/11 victims). </p>

<p>On the video, Markovich is breathing nervously and finally swallows his courage at 4:30, &quot;Fuck it.&quot; Another jumper says, &quot;You got this, man,&quot; reassuringly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/new-video-shot-freedom-tower-jumpers-surfaces-article-1.1780382">Daily News reports</a> the jumpers are &quot;&apos;hoping the video can be used for some good&apos; in light of the NYPD creating a spectacle of the jump, Parlatore said when the first videos were posted.&quot; The BASE jump, as well as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/20/teen_on_wire.php">16-year-old boy&apos;s ability to climb to the top</a> of the tower, exposed woefully inadequate security at the construction site. Parlatore also added that they would love to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://nypost.com/2014/05/05/wtc-base-jumper-posts-new-death-defying-video/">do community service at WTC</a>.</p>

<p>Markovich, Rossig and Brady were charged with reckless endangerment, burglary and BASE jumping. The NYPD, who were tipped off by a Goldman Sachs security officer about seeing the jumpers land near the Goldman Sachs building, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/26/one_world_trade_center_base_jumper.php">eventually caught up with them</a> after reviewing a lot of surveillance video and tying a getaway car to Brady, a construction worker who had spent time at the WTC site. The three are due in court today.</p>

<p>The head of security at the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/29/head_of_security_at_1_wtc_resigns_p.php">resigned</a>. Two CNN reporters weren&apos;t stealth enough to sneak in&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510082139/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/2_cnn_employees_arrested_for_trying.php">they got arrested</a> while trying to document the building&apos;s lax security.</p>
