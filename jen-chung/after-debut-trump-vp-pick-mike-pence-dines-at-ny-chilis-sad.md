<p>Mike Pence, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105424/http://chicagoist.com/2016/07/14/donald_trump_and_gov_mike_pence_giv.php">governor of Indiana</a> who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105424/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/16/mike_pence.php">now Donald Trump&apos;s running mate</a>, quickly got down to business by showing how much the Trump-Pence ticket loves Hispanics&#x2014;by going to a local Chili&apos;s restaurant:</p>

<p>That looks like a Quesadilla Explosion Salad (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105424/http://www.businessinsider.com/chilis-quesadilla-explosion-salad-nutrition-2015-6">explosive for your diet</a>) on the table, which is obviously what a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105424/http://chicagoist.com/2015/03/26/indiana_gov_mike_pence_signs_contro.php">socially conservative governor</a> from the midwest would order to complement his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105424/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/05/picture_trumps_lower_intestine.php">new boss&apos;s love of taco bowls</a>. It&apos;s shocking that Trump didn&apos;t take Pence to an authentic NYC restaurant, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105424/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/sarah_palin_donald_trump_eat_at_fam.php#photo-3">Famiglia Pizza in Times Square </a>he took Sarah Palin took, but maybe he wanted to avoid another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105424/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/kasich_pizza_auto_erotic_asphyxi.php">yokel eating pizza with a fork</a> photo op. </p>

<p>Of course, Pence probably needed all the artery-clogging comfort food he needs to kill himself with because Trump was reportedly doubting his selection of Pence nearly up until basically the last moment:</p>
