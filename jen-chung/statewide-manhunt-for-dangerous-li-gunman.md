                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_09_csmanhunt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044941im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_csmanhunt.jpg" width="640" height="359"> <br> <i> Photograph of state troopers looking for Sang Ho Kim in Cold Spring by Erin Tennant</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Police are searching for the man accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044941/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/li_shooting_prompts_lock_down_of_ro.php">shooting two workers at a Long Island lighting company</a> yesterday&#x2014;killing one of them. The suspect, Queens resident Sang Ho Kim, 64, is described as &quot;a very dangerous individual&quot; whose car was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044941/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130926/NEWS/309260037/Putnam-manhunt-after-LI-shooting-suspect-s-SUV-found-Cold-Spring-video-?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|Frontpage">found late last night north</a> of Cold Spring in Putnam County. A Nassau County police spokesman said, &quot;The search is still ongoing.&quot;</p>

<p>Authorities say that Kim entered Savenergy Inc. in Garden City at 10:10 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044941/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cops-east-garden-city-shooting-suspect-s-vehicle-found-1.6143252">Newsday reports</a> that he &quot;shot and killed an employee and shot the company owner over a soured business relationship.&quot; The company owner, John Choi, is in critical condition. </p>

<p>Then Kim fled in a white Honda Pilot, prompting the police to lock down the nearby Roosevelt Field Mall and schools during their search. A Connecticut woman told Newsday she heard gunfire when she was outside the mall, &quot;People were running around; it was pretty chaotic. Cops were everywhere, and people were running. I&apos;m shaken up.&quot;</p>

<p>A few hours after the shooting, Kim allegedly left a message with his sister. She said, &quot;My brother left message on suicide: &apos;I love you so much, I love my family.&apos;  I&apos;m upset. I hope he&apos;s not dying... My whole family is waiting for him.&quot; </p>

<p>Kim&apos;s sister told Newsday that her brother was a  &quot;very, very nice man&quot; and that he and Choi were supposed to meet on Tuesday about a business dispute, but Choi didn&apos;t show up. </p>

In 1998, he was arrested in Queens on a DWI charge and was arrested on the same charge in Manhattan&apos;s Riverbank State Park in 2006. In 2008, he was arrested for trademark counterfeiting in New Jersey.&quot;</p>

<p>Nassau County and Putnam County police as well as state police and the FBI are involved in the investigation. One Putnam County resident, Mike Powell, told the Journal News, &quot;It&apos;s tragic what has happened. It&apos;s not the guns. It&apos;s a piece of steel. It&apos;s the person that&apos;s pulling the trigger. The world is just getting crazier.&quot; He added the suspect is &quot;either going on trails toward Wappingers or eastbound. There&apos;s a lot of caves up there. I grew up in these woods.&quot;</p>
