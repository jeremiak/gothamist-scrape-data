title: More Farmers Markets Accept Food Stamps
---

	
										<p>With more families turning to food stamps as food prices increases, more farmers markets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171227/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/food-stamps-come-to-more-farmers-markets/84519/">accepting them</a>.  The Farmers&apos; Market Federation of NY says that food stamp sales have grown to $90,000 in 2007 from $3,000 in 2002 (helped in part by wireless technology that allows the farmers to accept payments by food stamp debit card); executive director Diane Eggert told the AP, &quot;We&apos;re already outpacing 2007, so I think we&apos;re going to see significant growth.&quot;  One Brooklyn resident hopes to use his food stamps on fresher produce from the farmers, &quot;When you shop at the grocery store, it&apos;s very limited-they don&apos;t have a very wide selection. I think if we had a farmers market, I think we would shop more, and eat more produce.&quot;</p>
