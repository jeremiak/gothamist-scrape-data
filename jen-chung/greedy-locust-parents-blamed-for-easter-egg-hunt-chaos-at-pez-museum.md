<p>A free Easter holiday event for families at the PEZ headquarters in Connecticut turned into &quot;Hunger Games: Easter Egg Hunt District,&quot; as parents ignored organizers&apos; instructions and prematurely rushed the field in search of eggs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040924/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Pushy-Parents-Cause-Chaos-at-Pez-Easter-Egg-Hunt-Manager-373630311.html">One woman said</a>, &quot;By the time I found my 4-year-old, he was hysterically crying.&quot; And the boy said, &quot;<b>Somebody pushed me over and take my eggs and it&apos;s very rude of them and they broke my bucket</b>.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently over 1,000 people attended the PEZ Easter egg hunt in Orange, far more than the company expected. PEZ had planned numerous egg hunts for children separated by ages (so four-year-olds wouldn&apos;t have to compete against 12-year-olds) but some parents could not contain themselves. One woman, whose 6-year-old was set for the 10:40 a.m. hunt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040924/http://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-pez-0328-20160327-story.html">told the Hartford Courant</a>, &quot;We&apos;ve been there quite a few times before but never have seen a crowd like that for any of their events. Even in the few minutes we were there you could see the crowd of people almost like a swarm covering the field and just everywhere with no disregard that there were other people, children and cars around them.&quot;</p>

<p>PEZ general manager Shawn Peterson described the crowd as &quot;locusts.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040924/http://abc7ny.com/news/parents-accused-of-bum-rushing-easter-egg-hunt-in-connecticut/1265196/">He said he told anxious adults</a>, &quot;&apos;Let&apos;s wait, we&apos;ll give a whistle. We&apos;ll give the signal to start this.&apos; That lasted about a minute. And then folks just rushed the field and took everything.&quot;</p>

<p>PEZ said, &quot;Unfortunately people chose to enter the first field prior to anyone from PEZ staff starting the activity. The crowd moved to the second field, waited for only a couple of minutes and proceeded to rush the field without being directed to do so and before the posted start time... Due to the actions of a few, the good intent quickly turned into a mess. I would like to sincerely apologize to each of our guests, this was not something created to frustrate or make people angry.&quot;</p>

<p>The hunt was abruptly cancelled and then employees started to distribute free candy, but then lines for free candy were too long for some to wait with their disappointed children.</p>

<p>While some people were criticizing PEZ&apos;s management of the egg hunt on the company&apos;s Facebook page, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040924/https://www.facebook.com/PezCandyUSA/photos/a.282174508470293.68122.279993548688389/1093385847349151/?type=3&amp;theater">others sided with</a> PEZ, even suggesting that the event be a paid hunt (with money going to a charity).</p>
