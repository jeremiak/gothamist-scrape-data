<p>You know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170527180205/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/24/nyc_beach_guide_tips.php">what beaches to go to</a>. You know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170527180205/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/25/free_sunscreen_beaches_nyc.php">there&apos;s free sunscreen</a>. Now you can find out if the beaches are even open by signing up for text alerts on beach weather conditions, thanks to a program from the NYC Health Department. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2017_05_knowbefore.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170527180205im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_05_knowbefore.jpg" width="400" height="200" class="image-right"> </span>The &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170527180205/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/beach-homepage.page">Know Before You Go</a>&quot; program sends alerts if there are issues with water quality. The Health Department explains, &quot;When water quality is compromised from excessive rain runoff, sewage or other pollution, it can pose health risks to swimmers. Public and private beaches will also post easy-to-read water quality advisory and closure signs at the beach to help make sure all beachgoers are aware of any health or safety risks.&quot; </p>

<p>You can text &quot;BEACH&quot; or &quot;PLAYA&quot; to 877877 to get the status of any of the eight public beaches in the city. The public can also sign up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170527180205/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/beaches-before-you-go.page">for the texts here</a> (messaging rates may apply). The Health Department also has a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170527180205/http://maps.nyc.gov/beach/"> map showing NYC&apos;s various public and private beaches and their status</a>&#x2014;for instance, some private beaches in the Bronx and Queens have advisories for Enterococci Bacteria.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, the Health Department reminds New Yorkers to &quot;check that there is a lifeguard present and always supervise children when near the water&#x2019;s edge. Remember to protect your skin and use sunscreen to avoid burns. All of the City&#x2019;s beaches are smoke-free.&quot;</p>
