<p>It&apos;s hard for the Republican candidates in the NYC mayoral race to grab attention for the Democrats for a few reasons (there are so many Democrats and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160706/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/walking_weiner_gets_booed_at_israel.php">so many Weiner references</a>), so maybe that&apos;s why Joe Lhota is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160706/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/21/lhota_for_mayor_rudy_giuliani_would.php">enlisting Rudy Giuliani</a> for his campaign videos.</p>

<p>Lhota, the former MTA chairman, was top aide during former Mayor Giuliani&apos;s administration. And Giuliani wants us to know it! In a new video for Lhota&apos;s campaign, the mayor of 9/11 says, &quot;In these uncertain times, there&apos;s only one candidate for mayor who&apos;s already proven he&apos;s ready... It was Joe who kept the city running during 9/11. Joe was one of the most effective leaders in my administration.&quot;</p>

<p>Giuliani also praises Lhota&apos;s work leading the MTA during Hurricane Sandy, &quot;Take it from me: Joe is New York -- and he&apos;s ready to be our mayor.&quot; However,  Lhota&apos;s rivals are unimpressed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160706/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/06/in-new-mayoral-tv-ad-rudy-giuliani-says-joe-lhota-kept-nyc-running-during-911">John Catsimatidis&apos; spokesman Rob Ryan said</a>, &quot;Mayor Giuliani along with his police, fire, and OEM commissioners all took action on 9/11. Gov. Pataki and his administration called out the National Guard, oversaw the Port Authority and the MTA and suspended many state laws. These facts beg the question: How exactly was Joe Lhota &apos;running&apos; the city?&quot; And another Republican hopeful, George McDonald, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160706/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/06/giuliani-tries-to-share-911-credit-with-lhota.html">said</a>, &quot;After 12 years, it&#x2019;s time we finally move forward and not dwell on the past.&quot;</p>
