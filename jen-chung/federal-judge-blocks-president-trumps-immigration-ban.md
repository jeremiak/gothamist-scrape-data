					<p>Last night, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that immediately blocked President Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322102327/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/refugees_detained_trump_executive_order.php">ban on immigrants and refugees</a> from seven Muslim majority nations. U.S. District Judge James Robart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322102327/https://www.wsj.com/articles/legal-feud-over-trump-immigration-order-turns-to-visa-revocations-1486153216">wrote</a>, &quot;The Executive Order adversely affects the States&#x2019; residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel. In addition, the States themselves are harmed by virtue of the damage that implementation of the Executive Order has inflicted upon the operations and missions of their public universities and other institutions of higher learning&#x2026;These harms are significant and ongoing.&quot; </p>

<p>The ruling was in response to a lawsuit from Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who said that the ruling &quot;shuts down the executive order immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>The White House reacted in typical Trumpian fashion: Issuing a press release to blast the judge, and then re-issuing it to remove the word &quot;outrageous.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now the WH reissues its denouncement of Seattle judge order against travel ban with &quot;outrageous&quot; removed... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322102327/https://t.co/dEQMnKRB2m">pic.twitter.com/dEQMnKRB2m</a></p>&#x2014; Todd Zwillich (@toddzwillich) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322102327/https://twitter.com/toddzwillich/status/827718102221783049">February 4, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170322102327js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Omar Jadwat, the ACLU&apos;s director of the Immigrants&#x2019; Rights Project, told the NY Times, &quot;What we&#x2019;re seeing here is the courts standing up to the unconstitutional ban that President Trump imposed. There&#x2019;s obviously more litigation to come, but this is truly good news for the many people both in this country and abroad who have been unfairly targeted on the basis of their religion by this ban.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322102327/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/04/president-trumps-do-it-myself-approach-just-suffered-a-big-and-rare-early-setback/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_fix-diy-856am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.af95bba93535">The Washington Post looked</a> at other instances of presidential executive orders being shot down by federal judges. Daniel P. Franklin, an executive-authority expert at Georgia State University, said, &quot;One of the many differences between Obama and Trump is Obama understood limits of what executive order could be. I think the Trump people thought they could rule by edict, and they can&apos;t.&quot;<br>
