<p>You know things are bad with the fate of the NBA when Spike Lee is at a Rangers game&#x2014;as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030184242/http://yfrog.com/hsb20dej">one person observed</a> on Thursday night while the #1 Knicks fan posed for a photo with beloved former Rangers captain Mark Messier, &quot;he must be bored without the Knicks.&quot; And now it get worse: The NBA just announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030184242/http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2011/10/28/its-go-time-in-nba-talks/">games through November 30 would be cancelled</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, NBA commissioner David Stern <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030184242/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/11/air_ball_nba_cancels_first_two_week.php">just cancelled the first two weeks of the season</a>&#x2014;now an entire month of games is gone. Stern said, &quot;We held out that joint hope together, but in light of the breakdown of talks, there will not be a full NBA season under any circumstances. It&apos;s not practical, possible or prudent to have a full season now.&quot;</p>

<p>The NBA team owners and players have been arguing over money, in the form of contracts and revenue sharing. For instance, team owners want a 50-50 split, while players want 52.5%. That 2.5% represents $100 million. At this point, the league has<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030184242/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7153136/nba-lockout-david-stern-announces-more-game-cancellations"> lost about $200 million</a> from not having a pre-season and stands to lose hundreds of millions more with the cancelled November games.  </p>

<p>As for Lee, at the Rangers game, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030184242/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/spike_sports_fix_pWJeXMAI9px1h3abHpN8rJ">he was reportedly overheard</a> saying he was there because he needed &quot;a sports fix.&quot; A witness told Page Six, &#x201C;He had 10 guys in the MSG store helping him buy a hat.&quot; And apparently a jersey too&#x2014;he&apos;s wearing a Lundqvist shirt!</p>

<p>But when will both sides just agree that they&apos;re the epitome of self-involvement? Take it away, Onion News Network:</p>
