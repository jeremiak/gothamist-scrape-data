<p>The 19-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619024630/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/27/teen_arrested_for_attacking_lgbt_ac.php">accused of beating a gay man in Manhattan</a> over the weekend was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619024630/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/teen_is_busted_in_gay_bash_xmUocfXujD9uShbMtxpyaP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">released without bail yesterday</a>. And his victim says, &quot;I am more of a man than he ever will be because I did not throw the punch.&quot;</p>

<p>Manuel Riquelme was part of a group that allegedly yelled anti-gay slurs at LGBT activist Eugene Lovendusky and his friends after 3 a.m. on Saturday. Lovendusky&apos;s group had been heading to the subway, but a group of teens turned their confrontation physical. Lovendusky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619024630/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hate-Crime-Bias-Attack-Gay-Activist-Assault-Man-Charged-Manhattan-209075521.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I got a punch in the face, and my glasses flew off.&quot; </p>

<p>They called 911 and Lovendusky was able to identify his attacker later (Riquelme was found in a pizzeria). Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;We believe these kinds of biased crimes are underreported. Now it&apos;s being reported, and we think that it is a good thing.&quot; Riquelme was arrested for assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment as a hate crime.</p>

<p>Lovendusky said, &quot;I&apos;m not scared. These are my streets just as much as it is theirs... If you&apos;re battling your own personal homophobia, then seek understanding through conversation and education, don&apos;t turn to violence.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619024630/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130527/midtown-south/teen-arrested-for-latest-anti-gay-attack-midtown-police-say">He told DNAinfo</a>, &quot;We need to open a conversation with the straight ally community. It&apos;s the only way we&apos;re going to win this fight. We need people to speak up.&quot;</p>
