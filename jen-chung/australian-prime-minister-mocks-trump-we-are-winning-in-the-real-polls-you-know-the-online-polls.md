<p>The relationship between the United States and Australia has taken a new, weird turn as video leaked from an Australian press ball showing the country&apos;s prime minister parodying President Donald Trump. Describing his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190737/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/26/president_trump_nyc_visit.php">May meeting</a> with Trump on the Intrepid in New York City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190737/https://www.wsj.com/articles/australia-leader-mocks-donald-trump-we-are-winning-so-much-1497520273?mod=e2tw">Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull mimicked Trump&apos;s fondness</a> for self-aggrandizing superlatives,<br>
telling the audience, &quot;It was beautiful. It was the most beautiful putting-me-at-ease ever. The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls. We are winning so much. We are winning like we have never won before.&quot;</p>

<p>The event, the Australian Parliament House&#x2019;s Mid Winter Ball, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190737/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/australian-prime-minister-mocks-trump-leaked-recording-article-1.3249426">supposed to be off-the-record</a> but, of course, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190737/http://www.9news.com.au/national/2017/06/15/14/18/malcolm-turnbull-impersonates-donald-trump-in-leaked-audio/?ocid=9newsfb">leaked to an Australian news station</a>.</p>

<p>Turnbull also said, &quot;We&#x2019;re winning in the real polls. You know, the online polls. They are so easy to win. I have this Russian guy. Believe me it&#x2019;s true. It is true.&quot;</p>

<p>After Trump took office, he called many world leaders; his call with Turnbull was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190737/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/malcolm-turnbull-donald-trump-pena-nieto/">reportedly &quot;heated.&quot;</a> Senior U.S. officials told the Washington Post that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190737/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-gday-mate-on-call-with-australian-pm-trump-badgers-and-brags/2017/02/01/88a3bfb0-e8bf-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html?utm_term=.0d59ee030c10">Trump informed the Prime Minister</a>, &quot;this was the worst call by far,&quot; but Turnbull later described the call as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190737/http://abcnews.go.com/International/australian-pm-malcolm-turnbull-president-trump-frank-relationship/story?id=45279036">frank and forthright.</a>&quot;</p>

It was fun, we&apos;ve got to lighten up.&quot;</p>
