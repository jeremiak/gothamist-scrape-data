<p>A 55-year-old man was savagely beaten and then robbed while walking in Brooklyn early Monday morning, police say. The victim needed 70 stitches to close the gashes on his head.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the victim was attacked and robbed at 12:48 a.m. on Monday, December 28th. Police say he was walking in front of 809 Avenue M in Midwood when two men &quot;approached him from behind. One of the suspects punched the suspect on the head, knocked him down and continued to punch and kick the victim. Both suspects went through the victim&apos;s pockets and removed his wallet containing credit cards before fleeing on Avenue M toward Ocean Parkway.&quot;</p>

<p>One graphic video shows the man being attacked and then robbed. Another shows the suspects walking down the street.</p>

<p>Shomrim executive coordinator Bob Moskowitz told the Post that the attack was &quot;horrific. It was bad enough that he was assaulted and knocked down to the ground. He didn&#x2019;t resist. But even after they got his wallet, keys and cell phone, they continued to stomp on him and punch him.&quot;</p>

<p>Assembly Member Dov Hikind met with the victim and announced a reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspects:</p>
