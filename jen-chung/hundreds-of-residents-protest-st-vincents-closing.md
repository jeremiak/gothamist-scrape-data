One person said, &quot;It&apos;s so sad it makes me cry, that they would even think of letting this hospital close. So get off their butts and do something,&quot; while others called City Council Speaker Christine Quinn a &quot;sell-out&quot;; the Daily News reports that Quinn said, &quot;No one sold anybody out. We&apos;re all angry.&quot;  Other hospitals are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723171126/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/19/beth_israel_busy_with_ex-st_vincent.php">dealing with an increase of patients</a> due to St. Vincent&apos;s closing.</p>
