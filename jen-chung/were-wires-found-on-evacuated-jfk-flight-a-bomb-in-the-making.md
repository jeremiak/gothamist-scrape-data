An air marshal apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165048/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/13/jfk_flight_searched_for_explosives.php">found some wires threaded through a drinking straw</a> in a bathroom, and the plane was evacuated.  The TSA said that the &quot;aircraft was searched with negative results,&quot; but there are still questions about what the wires were.<p></p>

<p>Adding to the discovery of the wires, a woman on the flight apparently had trouble breathing, and was initially suspected of trying to create a diversion.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165048/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jet_bomb_theories_wXvzi4wnmuuvhWsjqLCdBK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">According to the Post</a>, some law-enforcement sources think they &quot;might have been components of a bomb&quot; but other &quot;investigators are still leaning toward an innocuous explanation of the discovery, said sources.&quot;  Can&apos;t they make up their minds?</p><blockquote>Officials first believed a woman who suffered a medical emergency when the wires were found was &#x201C;supposed to be the decoy&#x201D; to &#x201C;the gentleman who [was] playing with the possible explosive device,&#x201D; according to a radio transmission from the jet.<p></p>

<p>But the man and the woman were released after questioning.</p></blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165048/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspicious-wires-delta-flight-headed-kennedy-airport-beginnings-a-bomb-source-article-1.1113813">Daily News&apos; source says</a> that the wires in the bathroom could have been a work that was interrupted.  The News also describes the female passenger as an Argentinian and the male passenger, who was the last believed to be in the bathroom, as a Pakistani-born U.S. citizen.<p></p>
