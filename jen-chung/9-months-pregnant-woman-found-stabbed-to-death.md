Naisha Delaine was stabbed multiple times in the stomach (the unborn child also died) and slashed in the throat.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141604/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/10/25/2008-10-25_9monthpregnant_queens_woman_fatally_stab.html">According to the Daily News</a>, Delaine&apos;s mother &quot;had grown concerned when she could not reach her daughter for several days,&quot; so she went to her the Ozone Park apartment to check on her.  Unable to get in, the mother contacted Delaine&apos;s boyfriend, who had keys, and together they discovered the body in the bedroom.</p>

<p>There were no signs of forced entry, and apparently the upstairs neighbors didn&apos;t hear anything.  However, a man who works at a nearby shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141604/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10262008/news/regionalnews/pregnant_qns__mom__unborn_child_brutally_135383.htm">told the Post</a> &quot;he saw a man wearing a black hooded sweatshirt running into the building shortly before Delaine&apos;s body was discovered,&quot; &quot;A few minutes later, I heard some blood-curdling screams.&quot;  Other neighbors said that Delaine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141604/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6470432">seemed happy and friendly</a>.</p>
