Officers responded to a 911 call about an assault in progress at Van Cortlandt Park and found a 29-year-old man with a two-inch laceration on the right side of his face. The victim said he was jogging on the Putnam Trail south of the Henry Hudson and east of Broadway when two males approached him.</p>

<p>Authorities say that the victim &quot;felt like one of the two males punched him in the face. He then realized that he was cut.&quot; Apparently the first suspect distracted him while the second suspect slashed him. The suspects fled northbound on the trail.</p>

<p>The first suspect is described as being 20 to 30 years old and was last seen wearing a dark colored hooded sweater while police released a sketch of the second suspect, who is described as being 20 to 30 years old and  6&apos;1&quot; to 6&apos;2&quot;, with a slim build, a small afro and last seen wearing a red hooded sweater.<br>
