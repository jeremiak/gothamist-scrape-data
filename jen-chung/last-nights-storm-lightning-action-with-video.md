</div></div>					<p>The National Weather Service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406235930/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/tornado_warning_in_queens_brooklyn.php#_login">issued a <em>tornado</em> warning</a> for most of the city last night as a fast-moving storm swept in and the city recommended residents &quot;stay away from windows.&quot;  Lightning struck repeatedly for what felt like a pretty long time (10-15 minutes or so?) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406235930/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/tornado_warning_in_queens_brooklyn.php#comment-2641323">reader Kelles described</a> it as &quot;turn on a strobe light,  then pour out a bucket of water in front of you.&quot;  Other readers shared their photos with us&#x2014;see them above.</p>

<p>There was severe flooding in the streets of Paterson, NJ&#x2014;one driver who was stuck described his car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406235930/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=weather&amp;id=7572366">as a &quot;sailboat&quot;</a> and had to be rescued by firefighters using a raft.  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406235930/http://wcbstv.com/local/fast.moving.storms.2.1822487.html">he learned his lesson</a>, &quot;If I see water again, you know what, I&apos;m just going to shut off my engine and go home walking.&quot;</p>

<p>If you have photos or video of last night&apos;s storm, you can email them to us at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406235930/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">photos@gothamist.com</a> or tag them &quot;gothamist&quot; on Flickr.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Here&apos;s video from Dan Lurie, taken from downtown Brooklyn.  Notice how Manhattan is visible...and then it isn&apos;t, because of the clouds!</p>
