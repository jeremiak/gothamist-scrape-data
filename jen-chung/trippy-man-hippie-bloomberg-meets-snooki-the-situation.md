</div></div>					<p>Last night, at the annual Inner Circle show, Mayor Bloomberg left this business attire for the hippie-stylings of <em>Hair,</em> as he spoofed the past year of his mayoralty in <em>Mair: 3 Terms of Peace and Music</em>.  But it&apos;s possible that he was overshadowed by his special guests&#x2014;Snooki and The Situation.  Snooki was excited by the prospect of meeting Bloomberg: She Tweeted, &quot;<strong>Enjoying some wine and waiten to fist pump with Mayor B!! He double fist pumps lmao!</strong>&quot;  The Situation was so thrilled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718104203/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/28/trippy_man_hippie_bloomberg_meets_s.php?gallery0Pic=5#gallery">he took off his shirt</a>!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718104203/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/flower_power_bloom_iqsesBHju8Tj4owC2s2Xl">Post said</a> he &quot;looked right at home in a groovy get-up of long, flowing locks, a headband, suede moccasins and custom-made bell-bottom jeans... festooned with funky patches, each symbolizing a city agency.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718104203/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/28/2010-03-28_bloomberg_lets_his_hair_down.html">Daily News seemed scared,</a> &quot;This year, he went full-on psychedelic - looking like the sexagenarian love child of Howard Stern and Janis Joplin.&quot; And the Post and News eported that among Bloomberg&apos;s lines were, &quot;Bette Midler will help us plant one million pot plants in the next 10 years,&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve already brought crime down at frat parties. Peeing in the bushes has dropped 15%,&quot; and, in response to whether he&apos;d want to be Public Advocate after his mayoral term ends,  &quot;It&apos;d have to be a real job.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a video montage of the event&#x2014;see Bloomberg arriving in a Volkswagen bus! see Snooki ask, &quot;If you&apos;re doing a show with hair, don&apos;t you think I should be part of it?&quot;  </p>

<p>The Inner Circle show, which is put on by the city&apos;s political reporters and raises money for charity, also poked fun at Governor Paterson.  The Post reports, &quot;Act Two opened with an actor portraying Paterson as the captain of the Titanic. He steered right into an iceberg and ended up stranded on Governors Island, surrounded by &quot;sharks,&quot; including Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch and Long Island Republican Rick Lazio.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718104203/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/29/mayor_mike_lets_out_his_colorful_se.php">went Under the Sea</a> with the cast of The Little Mermaid, the year before that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718104203/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/16/mayor_bloomberg_40.php">he wore a headband</a> with the cast of Xanadu, and in 2007, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718104203/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/17/with_a_spoonful.php">went all Mayor Poppins</a>. But of course, the most famous instance of a mayor playing along with the Inner Circle crowd is Rudy Giuliani who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160718104203/http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/election2008/ig/Election-Funny-Pictures/Giuliani-In-Drag.htm">appeared in drag</a> as Marilyn Monroe.</p>
