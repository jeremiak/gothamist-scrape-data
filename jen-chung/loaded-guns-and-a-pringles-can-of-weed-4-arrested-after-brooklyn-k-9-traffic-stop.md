<p>An NYPD K9 helped police find two loaded guns hidden in a car seized during a traffic stop last night in Brooklyn. The dog happens to named after a police officer who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030145008/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/09/two_police_offi.php">was slain just a few blocks away</a> in 2007.</p>

<p>According to police, officers from the Brooklyn South Gang Unit were on patrol yesterday when they saw a 2009 blue Nissan Maxima with &quot;heavily tinted windows and a cover on its rear license plate&quot; on Maple Street in Prospect Lefferts Gardens around 2 p.m. </p><blockquote>The detectives pulled the car over in front 264 Maple Street, and as they approached the vehicle, encountered a strong odor of marijuana emanating from the Maxima. When they reached the vehicle, the detectives observed an open Pringles container containing marijuana. <p></p>

<p>The four suspects inside the vehicle were taken out of the car and placed under arrest. The suspects, and the auto, were then taken to the 71 Precinct. Once at the precinct, Detective Dominick Latorre from the Brooklyn South Gang Unit requested ESU canine to respond to the precinct for an evidence search of the vehicle.</p></blockquote>ESU-K9 Timoshenko got the call and his handler Officer Benny Colecchia &quot;directed him to the Maxima,&quot; where the dog &quot;immediately hit on the driver&#x2019;s side door panel, grabbing the loose arm rest and ripping it off the panel. Inside the door panel, detectives found a loaded Glock 40 caliber semi-automatic handgun that had been reported stolen in Haverstraw New York and a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson 9MM semi-automatic handgun. Both weapons had high capacity magazines.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Police released a photograph of K9 Timoshenko and the weapons and ammunition. Four men were arrested&#x2014;Jilani Mitchel, 22; Ron Thomas, 34; Revor Williams, 25; and Terri Bishop, 25, were charged with criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of stolen property, criminal possession of marijuana and unlawful possession of marijuana. Mitchell, who was driving, was also charged with an equipment violation and license plate violation. </p>

<p>K9 Timoshenko is named after Detective Russel Timoshenko, who was fatally shot at age 23 during a traffic stop at Lefferts Avenue and Rogers Avenue in July 2007. The car was stolen, and Timoshenko&apos;s partner Herman Yan survived the shooting. Two suspects were convicted for the shooting. </p>
