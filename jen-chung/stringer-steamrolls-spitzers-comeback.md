<p>In spite of his opponent&apos;s name recognition and family fortune, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer defeated former Governor Eliot Spitzer to win the Democratic primary for Comptroller last night. Stringer got 286,361 votes (52.1% of the vote) to Spitzer&apos;s 263,501 votes (47.9%). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/nyregion/stringer-defeats-spitzer-in-comptroller-primary.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">Stringer said last night</a>, &quot;It was a total struggle, but New Yorkers gave me a shot. Sometimes the guy without the resources but with a lot of heart can win the election.&quot;</p>

<p>On his side, Stringer did have substantial support from unions (which helped with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/09/32bj-seiu-launches-primary-gotv-push-with-heavy-focus-on-latino-turnout">get out the vote operations</a>) as well as help from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/ny_daily_news_also_really_hates_spi.php">three dailies which endorsed him</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ny_times_and_ny_post_endorse_string.php">also pointed out Spitzer&apos;s failings</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://nypost.com/2013/09/10/stringer-leads-spitzer-for-comptroller/">Post&apos;s headline today is</a>, &quot;Stringer Saves NYC From Spitzer.&quot; </p>

<p>Stringer also upped his game, becoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/spitzer_and_stringer_continue_attac.php">rather aggressive in debates and forceful</a> when discussing Spitzer&apos;s integrity issues. Political analyst Bill Cunningham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324094704579067253461389492.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTTopStories">told the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;I think Stringer surprised everybody by being very feisty in the debates and carrying the fight to Spitzer.&quot; He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/stringer_cronut.php">ate a cronut</a>&#x2014;obviously a critical factor in his win.</p>

<p>Spitzer, who only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/ho_yes_client_no_9_is_back_eliot_sp.php#photo-1">entered the race in early July</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/12/mothers_are_the_toughest_a_spitzer.php">spent lavishly to get on the ballot</a>, had tried to dismiss Stringer&apos;s years as a state lawmaker in Albany as a deficit, while playing up his credentials from his Attorney General/Sheriff of Wall Street days. In the end, it seems voters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/spitzer_heckled_at_first_petitionin.php">couldn&apos;t forget the scandalous end of his career</a> as Governor of New York.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054449/http://www.nytimes.com/projects/elections/2013/nyc-primary/comptroller/map.html">look at the map of votes</a>, you can see where Spitzer and Stringer earned votes. The Times notes, &quot;There was a sharp racial divide, with Mr. Stringer winning about two-thirds of white voters, and Mr. Spitzer winning about two thirds of black voters.&quot;</p>
