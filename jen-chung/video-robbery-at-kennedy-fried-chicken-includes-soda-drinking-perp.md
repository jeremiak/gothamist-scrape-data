<p>Police released this surveillance video of two men robbing a Kennedy Fried Chicken at 2463 Creston Avenue in the Bronx last week. And it&apos;s comical&#x2014;if you can forget that one of the men is holding a shotgun and threatening the employees.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at around 10:58 p.m. last Thursday, two men walked into the fast food restaurant. One produced a black shotgun and, as you can see in the video, tells a more laissez-faire soda-drinking cohort to get the cash register. So he has to climb over the counter&#x2014;and ends up pushing it to the ground, so he pulls it up by the cord.</p>

The police said it contained about $500.&quot;</p>

<p>The shotgun-wielding suspect is described as a black male in his 40s, 6&apos;, and heavy-set while the soda-drinking suspect is described as a black male in his 30s, about 5&apos;9&quot; and 180 pounds. </p>

<p>Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS (8477).
