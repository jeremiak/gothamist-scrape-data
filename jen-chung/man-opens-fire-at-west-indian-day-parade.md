<p>Sigh: On top of the news that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151944/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/05/violent_start_to_september_31_shot.php">31 people have been shot over 48 hours</a>&#x2014;including four during a pre-West Indian Day parade party&#x2014;now it seems a man opened fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151944/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/04/reminder_west_indian_day_parade_tom.php">at the parade</a> itself today.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151944/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gunfire_interrupts_brooklyn_parade_ra4iBVeaKOdhB5vLKBucaJ">According to the Post</a>, the shooting took place &quot;not far from where Mayor Bloomberg was marching.&quot;</p>

<p>Luckily, it doesn&apos;t seem anyone was injured.  The suspect &quot;got out of the car at E. 94th and Winthrop streets, and then ran off after tossing his gun. Cops caught him down the street after Macing him. Police then washed the Mace out of his eyes with a carton of milk.&quot; The Post has a picture of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151944/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gunfire_interrupts_brooklyn_parade_ra4iBVeaKOdhB5vLKBucaJ">alleged gunman&apos;s milk-stained face.</a></p>
