										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_03_stuytown14.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160116im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_03_stuytown14.jpg" width="139" height="111" class="image-right"> </span>The state&apos;s highest court, the Court of Appeals, will hear arguments between Stuyvesant Town owner Tishman Speyer and Stuy Town tenants.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160116/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/nyregion/07stuy.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a> that Tishman and BlackRock Realty were given permission to appeal a ruling that said it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160116/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/06/appellate_court_tishman_speyer_wron.php">wrongfully raised rents</a> at the huge complex. Tishman bought the rent-regulated complex <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160116/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/17/stuytown_sold_t.php">for $5.4 billion</a>, hoping to profit on market-rate rents, but an appellate division found the rent increases shouldn&apos;t have happened since it was receiving tax breaks associated with rent-regulated properties. City Councilman Daniel Garodnick thinks the tenants will win in the end, &quot;This is a landlord-tenant dispute that hinges on basic principles of fairness to taxpayers and fairness to tenants. We look forward to a speedy hearing and resolution by the state&#x2019;s highest court.&quot;  If the tenants succeed, Tishman will have to pay a rumored $200 million in back rent, and other landlords around the city who took advantage of the tax breaks may also have to pay back rent to their tenants.</p>
