<p>Yesterday, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced that a former Administration for Children&apos;s Services worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310012956/http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/may/may27b_09.html">was arrested</a> for &quot;falsifying public records in order to cover up her failure to perform required home visits.&quot;  Stephanie Sabouni, 27, of Brooklyn, was supposed to visited children with chronic school truancy within 48 hours of being assigned cases.  However, the AG&apos;s office says, &quot;Sabouni allegedly failed to make the required visits in several of her assigned cases. <strong>To cover her tracks she made false entries into the ACS computer system reflecting that she had made home visits to several families with whom she never actually met.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Sabouni, who is charged with 14 felonies and one misdemeanor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310012956/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05282009/news/regionalnews/awol_acs_gal_busted_171337.htm">posted the $1,500 bail and told reporters</a>, &quot;I didn&apos;t do anything wrong...If I were to go on national TV, I wouldn&apos;t answer every question, but I&apos;d talk about the corruption of the agency.&quot;  She added, &quot;ACS is at fault for everything. I&apos;m just being used.&quot; Sabouni has been teaching at a Brooklyn public school, but the Department of Education fired her upon these allegations. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310012956/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05282009/news/regionalnews/awol_acs_gal_busted_171337.htm">According to the Post</a>, Sabouni allegedly quit ACS in 2007 when questions about her case visits arose: &quot;In one case, Sabouni later admitted to another employee that she had never met one of the families, the complaint said.&quot; Apparently families of the children <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310012956/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/05/28/2009-05-28_she_was_supposed_to_be_minding_the_kids.html">told ACS they were never visited</a>.  Her lawyer told the Daily News, &quot;Nobody was injured as a result of these [documents]... The children she worked with are fine... [She] went to some [homes], but not other homes,&quot; and suggested that Sabouni incriminated herself while making statements, because she didn&apos;t know she was being investigated.</p>

<p>Sabouni is getting married next month and had planned a honeymoon in Mexico&#x2014;but the News reports that she was &quot;ordered to hand over her passport.&quot;</p>
