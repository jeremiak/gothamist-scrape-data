										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_03_nrahman.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064118im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_03_nrahman.jpg" width="350" height="254"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Rahman with police officers (WABC 7)</i></div> Police believe a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064118/http://www.silive.com/westshore/index.ssf/2016/03/cops_infant_was_alive_when_pla.html#incart_2box_silive-homepage-featured">newborn infant was alive</a> when it was placed in a garbage bag, leading authorities to charge a Staten Island woman with murder. <p></p>

<p>Nausheen Rahman, 28, had already been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064118/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/13/si_woman_arrested_for_allegedly_thr.php">charged with concealment of a human corpse</a> after the newborn&apos;s body was discovered in the trash outside her home on Richmond Hill Road on Saturday. Apparently Rahman had gone to Staten Island University Hospital on Friday night, complaining to staff about bleeding after giving birth. The Staten Island Advance reported, &quot;Hospital officials realized they had no record of the woman having a baby at the facility, and notified police when she said she had the child at home and discarded it, the source said.&quot;</p>

<p>The news shocked Rahman&apos;s condominium complex community. A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064118/http://abc7ny.com/news/woman-charged-with-murder-after-baby-found-dead-inside-trash-bag-on-staten-island-/1243783/">told WABC 7</a>, &quot;If I heard the baby crying, I would have taken the baby to the hospital.&quot; Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064118/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/03/13/nausheen-rahman-murder-newborn/">said to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Drop [the baby] off at any fire house, go to the hospital, do something. A life deserves more than that.&quot;</p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing. </p>
