The 27-year-old man whose cursing sent 49-year-old Tracey Falco and her 75-year-old dad Lawrence Burnett is now hiding out in his East Side apartment: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171812/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/03/2010-09-03_fan_trio_in_us_open_brawl_banned_from_flushing_tennis_tourney_until_2013_as_vide.html">Daily News reports</a> that Joseph Pedeville is &quot;chastened&quot; with his girlfriend coming to his defense, &quot;He&apos;s freaking out. He didn&apos;t do anything wrong. Thank God, he didn&apos;t do anything wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>No police charges were filed against the trio, whose confrontation was apparently sparked by Pedeville&apos;s profanities. Falco slapped him, after her goaded her, &quot;C&apos;mon, smack me again. Go ahead.... I don&apos;t give a f--- what anybody wants. I got a lot of money on this game, and I f------ paid for my ticket.&quot; Burnett, who once had a stroke, then stepped in and looked like he was trying to throttle Pedeville (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171812/http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/content/pictures/family/HomerStranglesBart1.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/pictures/family&amp;usg=__5NH_PGjzAfTdxO5tldPAc-jVqB0=&amp;h=513&amp;w=500&amp;sz=29&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=1hvCvOzDhDx9WM:&amp;tbnh=147&amp;tbnw=143&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dhomer%2Bbart%2Bstrangle%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Den%26biw%3D1084%26bih%3D592%26tbs%3Disch:1&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=823&amp;vpy=67&amp;dur=3104&amp;hovh=227&amp;hovw=222&amp;tx=139&amp;ty=131&amp;ei=vYGCTPirPIOKlwf1z72JDg&amp;oei=vYGCTPirPIOKlwf1z72JDg&amp;esq=1&amp;page=1&amp;ndsp=15&amp;ved=1t:429,r:4,s:0">Homer does with Bart</a>), only to either tumble or be thrown down the seats.   </p>

Someone who knew Pedeville in high school told the Post</a>, &quot;That was the kind of guy he was -- he does have a history of a temper... But, c&apos;mon! They were yelling at him. He got attacked. What&apos;s he supposed to do? <strong>I&apos;m sure he was dropping f-bombs, but the old guy started strangling him. He&apos;s an old guy. He shouldn&apos;t be starting fights.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Burnett told the Post, &quot;I&apos;m in a lot of pain. I was defending my daughter. &quot;The guy is a jerk.&quot; And Falco complained, &quot;There was no security -- they didn&apos;t come until it was over.&quot;</p>
