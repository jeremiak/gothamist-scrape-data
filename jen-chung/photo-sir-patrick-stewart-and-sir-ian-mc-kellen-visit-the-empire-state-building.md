<p>Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen are hitting NYC tourist spots HARD. Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145416/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/behold_the_ultimate_photo_of_sir_pa.php">they visited Times Square</a>. Now, the good buddies and current co-stars in the upcoming Broadway revivals of  &quot;No Man&apos;s Land&quot; and &quot;Waiting For Godot&quot; posted a photograph of themselves on top of the Empire State Building.</p>

<p>The visit is tied to promoting the plays&#x2014;McKellen tagged it &quot;#gogodididonyc&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145416/https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/380007020633403392">Stewart Tweeted</a>, &quot;Empire State! #gogodididonyc @TwoPlaysInRep&quot;&#x2014;and it&apos;s pretty adorable! We can&apos;t wait to see them at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145416/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/the_10_best_tourist_spots_every_new.php">McSorley&apos;s or the Brooklyn Bridge</a> next.</p>
