<p>An acclaimed London revival of <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> is headed to Broadway this fall. Janet McTeer will reprise her role as the scheming Marquise de Merteuil and Liev Schreiber will play opposite her as the conniving Vicomte de Valmont.</p>

<p>The Donmar Warehouse production, directed by Josie Rourke, was called &quot;heady and intoxicating&quot; by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201636/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/les-liaisons-dangereuses-donmar-warehouse-review-heady-and-intox/">Telegraph</a> and &quot;an evening to richly savor&quot; by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201636/http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/18/les-liasons-dangereuses-review-dominic-west-janet-mcteer-donmar-warehouse">Guardian</a>. While Dominic West, the guy everyone loves to hate on <em>The Affair</em>, played Valmont in London, Schreiber will take over the role here, and he&apos;s a great choice, given his ability to play oily yet conflicted characters. </p>

<p>The play by Christopher Hampton is based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201636/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Liaisons_dangereuses">Choderlos de Laclos&apos;s 1782 novel</a> and made its debut on Broadway in 1987, with Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman matching wits and breaking hearts. Hampton also adapted the play for the 1988 Stephn Frears-film starring Glenn Close and John Malkovich (and Michelle Pffeifer, Uma Thurman, Keanu Reeves and Swoosie Kurtz). He discussed why it&apos;s still relevant today (1% shoutout):</p>
