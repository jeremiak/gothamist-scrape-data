</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, conservative radio and Fox News host Glenn Beck held his &quot;Restoring Honor&quot; rally in Washington D.C.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000220/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/28/AR2010082801106.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post reports</a> that, from the Lincoln Memorial, &quot;he championed a religious brand of patriotism and called on the nation to recommit itself to traditional values he said were hallmarks of its exceptional past.&quot;  Beck said, &quot;Something that is beyond man is happening. America today begins to turn back to God.&quot;</p>

<p>Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was rapturously received, telling the crowd, &quot;We must not fundamentally transform America, as some would want. We must restore America and restore her honor,&quot; and, &quot;Say what you want to say about me, but I raised a combat vet, and you can&#x2019;t take that away from me.&quot; While the rally was supposedly nonpolitical, many were thinking politics: One person told the WaPo, &quot;Both of us are unhappy with the perception Obama is apologizing for everything we ever did,&quot; while wearing a shirt with the slogan &quot;Does the Constitution say we the sheeple?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000220/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703669004575457422990835474.html?mod=WSJ_hps_MIDDLESecondNews">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;The organizers did not appear to have planned for a crowd so large. Thousands sat on patches of lawn out of sight of the few Jumbo-trons that displayed the action on the stage. Several times, portions of the crowd, unable to hear the speakers, chanted &apos;louder, louder.&apos;&quot; No estimates for the crowd were given (the National Park Service declines to do so), but it&apos;s believed between 300,000 and 500,000  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000220/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/us/politics/29beck.html?hp">NY Times spoke to one attendee</a> who seized on religious reasons for her presence yesterday:</p><blockquote>Becky Benson, 56, traveled from Orlando, Fla., because, she said, &#x201C;we believe in Jesus Christ, and he is our savior.&#x201D; Jesus, she said, would not have agreed with what she called the redistribution of wealth in the form of the economic stimulus package, bank bailouts and welfare. &#x201C;You cannot sit and expect someone to hand out to you,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t spend your way out of debt.&#x201D;</blockquote><br>
Thus sayeth the Lord unto his people, &quot;Thou shalt not follow Keynesian economics. Thou shalt give to the rich, for their generosity will trickle down to you.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton, who questioned Beck&apos;s attempt to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000220/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/27/rev_al_sharpton_thinks_glenn_becks.php">reclaim the civil rights movement</a>, held his own, smaller rally in D.C.  He said, &quot;We come here because the dream has not been achieved. We&#x2019;ve had a lot of progress. But we have a long way to go.&quot;  </p>
