</div></div>					<p>James Cameron has taken a break from directing Hollywood blockbusters to indulge in his love of the ocean&#x2014;specifically, to plunge into the depths of the Mariana Trench by himself in a submersible vehicle he designed. Now he&apos;s got a movie to share his experience, and he and his submersible, the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER, are at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015048/http://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of History</a> today.</p>

<p>The DEEPSEA CHALLENGER is parked outside the front of the museum (on Central Park West) all day today, and Cameron will be at the museum for a special advance screening of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015048/http://www.deepseachallenge.com/">DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D</a></em>, which opens nationally on Friday. The film will be screened at 12 p.m., with arrival at 11:30 a.m.) at the AMNH&apos;s Lefrak Theater; seats are first-come, first-serve. After the film, the Oscar-winning director will participate in a Q&amp;A.; </p>

<p>The film&apos;s website gave some details about the 36,000 foot journey to the bottom of the ocean: &quot;The temperature will drop from sauna-like at the surface to meat-locker cold at the bottom. As the sun&#x2019;s rays cannot penetrate the ocean&#x2019;s deepest parts, the water goes from brightly lit to inky black. The sub will take about two hours to reach the seafloor and will have six hours or more to explore the deep-ocean frontier for clues about new life-forms and the forces that shape our planet.&quot;</p>

<p>That&apos;s awesome, but did Cameron <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015048/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/02/sleeping_under_the_amnhs_giant_blue.php">sleep under a giant blue whale</a>?</p>
