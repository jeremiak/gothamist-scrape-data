<p>It doesn&apos;t really matter, since neither is running for President, but a poll of 600 women nationwide found that female voters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051547/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/10/06/2008-10-06_poll_women_say_hillary_clinton_makes_a_b.html">think Hillary Clinton is a &quot;better mom, role model and leader&quot;</a> than vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  Some stats: 61% prefer Clinton to Palin (27%) if the two women ran against each other in 2012 and 35% think Clinton is a better mother than Palin (24%).
