<p>In April, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052621/http://gothamist.com/tags/azizansari">Aziz Ansari</a> released a clip from his standup special, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052621/http://azizansari.com/">Dangerously Delicious</a>, which revealed that rapper and entrepreneur 50 Cent did not know what a grapefruit was.  Now, in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052621/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/magazine/aziz-ansari-voice-of-the-people.html?ref=magazine">interview with the NY Times Magazine</a>, Ansari insists the story is real.  </p>

<blockquote><strong>You tell a story onstage that you were sitting near 50 Cent at a restaurant, and he ordered a grapefruit soda and was confused when he was brought something that was not purple and grape-flavored, and the waiter had to explain that grapefruit is different from grape. Is that true? </strong>
It&#x2019;s always strange to me when people ask me in interviews, &#x201C;Like, hey, is that story true?&#x201D; Yeah, it&#x2019;s all true.

<p><strong>Has 50 Cent ever reached out to you and said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a beverage mogul, I have my own Vitamin Water flavor, I certainly know the difference between grape and grapefruit&#x201D;?</strong><br>
Every other time I&#x2019;ve done a bit about anybody famous, very quickly they reach out to you or you hear about them hearing about it. <br>
That&#x2019;s one instance where I&#x2019;ve never heard of anyone that knows if he&#x2019;s heard the bit or if he has any take on it.</p></blockquote>See? And given that Aziz has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052621/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGnWXLkawkA">been telling this story for a while</a>, if 50 Cent hasn&apos;t disputed it yet, it&apos;s obviously true.  <p></p>
