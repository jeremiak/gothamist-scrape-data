					<p>What A Girl Doesn&apos;t Want: To be arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/amanda_bynes_arrested_in_midtown_fo.php">throwing a bong out of a 36th floor window</a> and going to court in a wig. But that&apos;s what former tween star Amanda Bynes is up to this morning, after her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/amanda_bynes_arrested_in_midtown_fo.php">alleged misbehaving</a> last night. A crowd of reporters and paparazzi were outside the court this morning&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/report-amanda-bynes-arrested-midtown-apartment-article-1.1353437">she said</a>, &quot;Can I ask you something? I would like to have no photographers in there. Is that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Daily News, she &quot;was a hot mess in gray sweatpants, a black sweatshirt and a platinum blond wig with bangs covering her face&quot;&#x2014;but she seemed polite at first, saying, &quot;I&apos;m feeling fine. How are you feeling?&quot; Later, she yelled, &quot;No press is allowed in here!&quot; when she went into the press room.</p><blockquote>Later she had an animated conversation with her attorney in the court&#x2019;s soundproof box. When she wasn&#x2019;t talking she was making crazy faces, mumbling to herself and staring blankly through the glass.</blockquote>Bynes was arrested last night at 7:40 p.m., after the doorman at her apartment building on West 47th Street in midtown Manhattan called the police because she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/amanda_bynes_arrested_after_throwing_NGLst0R0lccQqxlB3l195N">seemed to be smoking from a bong</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://www.tmz.com/2013/05/23/amanda-bynes-arrested-marijuana-possession-new-york-city/">a joint</a>) in the lobby. When cops arrived at her 36th floor apartment, she let them in&#x2014;but then apparently realized the bong was in plain sight and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/amanda_bynes_arrested_in_midtown_fo.php">tossed it out the window</a>. Bynes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/report-amanda-bynes-arrested-midtown-apartment-article-1.1353437">may have been under</a>, &quot;a heavy sativa spell.&quot; Other reports say that her apartment smelled of pot. <p></p>

<p>Bynes was arrested for reckless endangerment, tampering with evidence and marijuana possession. She was taken to Roosevelt Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation (she was supposedly talking to herself) and then taken to a police station. </p>

<p>One of her Manhattan neighbors said, &quot;Pray for her. She needs help. She&#x2019;s crying out.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  Bynes&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20703248,00.html">told the judge that she denied throwing</a> the bong out the window&#x2014;she said it was a vase&#x2014;and that the cops illegally entered her apartment. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/24/actress-amanda-bynes-to-be-arraigned-on-drug-charges-in-manhattan/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;<strong>Prosecutors admit police never found the bong.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>While the DA&apos;s office wanted $1,000 bail, the judge released Bynes on her own recognizance. She took a cab home&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194050/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/disheveled_amanda_bynes_sources_pZDOMHJQbGkHaXKPqBfKuK">from the Post</a>:</p><blockquote>Her lawyer asked if she had enough money for a cab ride home.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I have none,&quot; Bynes said. &quot; If you could give me a twenty I would appreciate it.&quot;</p>

<p>Bynes arrived at the Midtown apartment in the cab &#x2014; with a Flashdancers advertisement on top - and, while still wearing the long, platinum wig, shielded her face from photographers with court papers.</p>

<p>&quot;She said close the door and drop me off in the garage,&#x201D; said her driver, Mir A. Hossain. She said lock the door and go quick...her lawyer gave me $20. The fare was $27.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
