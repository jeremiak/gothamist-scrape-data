										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:220px; "> <img alt="2009_04_soniasoto.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130195548im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_soniasoto.jpg" width="220" height="271"> <br> <i>Sonia Sotomayor, when she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130195548/http://www.pace.edu/page.cfm?doc_id=7771">received an honorary degree</a> from Pace in 2003</i></div>  U.S. Court of Appeals judge&#x2014;and Bronx native&#x2014; Sonia Sotomayor is in the headlines as a possible candidate to fill Supreme Court Justice David Souter&apos;s seat.  President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130195548/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/01/obama_guest_stars_at_press_briefing.php">said of his selection process</a>, &quot;I will seek somebody with a sharp and independent mind and a record of excellence and integrity.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Sotomayor&apos;s name has been in the mix even before the election; as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130195548/http://www.esquire.com/features/75-most-influential/obama-supreme-court-pick-100">Esquire put it last fall</a>, &quot;As a Hispanic woman with 16 years of court experience, Sotomayor would slay two of the court&apos;s lack-of-diversity birds with one swift stone.&quot; ABC News&apos; George Stephanopoulos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130195548/http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/03/is-sotomayor-a.html">thinks she&apos;s a shoo-in</a>:  &quot;<strong>What are the chances that Obama DOESN&apos;T pick Sonia Sotomayor?</strong>  In her favor, she was appointed to the federal bench by George H.W. Bush. Elevated to the Appeals Court by Bill Clinton. She&apos;s a protege of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and a prosecutor with Robert Morgenthau.  Graduate of Princeton and Yale after growing up in the South Bronx... 1-10 she gets the nod.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in 1998, Sotomayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130195548/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/05/01/2009-05-01_president_obama_bronx_judge_sonia_sotomayor.html">spoke to the Daily News about her career</a>.  She said that when she was a little girl, she had hoped to become a detective, but then was diagnosed with diabetes, which put an end to those dreams: &quot;I became very disappointed about not having a life plan. <strong>At the time, &apos;Perry Mason&apos; had become a very popular show, and I loved Perry Mason. If I couldn&apos;t do detective work as a police officer, I could do it as a lawyer</strong>.&quot; </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130195548/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/05/02/2009-05-02_bronx_girl_makes_good_sonia_sotomayor_merits_look_for_us_supreme_court_.html">News editorial is also very excited</a> about the prospect of Obama considering Sotomayor: &quot;Up from the Bronxdale Houses via Cardinal Spellman High School to serious consideration for the highest bench in the land. That&apos;s a hell of a journey, one that deserves note by the young in today&apos;s hard-scrabble city.&quot;</p>
