<p>Torres&apos;s father told the News, &quot;It&#x2019;s an unforeseen tragedy. I&#x2019;m feeling like a block of ice. I&#x2019;m numb.&quot; A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154835/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/08/bronx-girl-9-commits-suicide-in-bathroom-of-familys-morris-park-home/">spoke to CBS 2</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s hard to believe that a 9-year-old even has a concept of how to do it. I mean, she must have been going through something very terrible to even think of that.&quot;</p>
