<p>The police are hoping the public can help them identify the suspect who forced his way into an Upper West Side woman&apos;s apartment and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013151/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/27/woman_sexually_assaulted_in_uws_apa.php">sexually assaulted her last week</a>.</p>

<p>Just after 10:30 p.m. on Friday, September 26, a 36-year-old woman was walking home near Central Park West and West 105th Street when she was followed by a man. He entered the building after her, and she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013151/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/28/uws_sexual_assault_victim_goes_publ.php">reportedly confronted him on the third floor</a>, but he insisted he was seeing a friend. Later, he managed to enter her apartment and sexually assaulted her. </p>

<p>The police released video of the suspect, who is described as a man in his 40s, about 6&apos;2&quot; in height and 200 pounds who was wearing a striped long-sleeved shirt and brown slacks:</p>
