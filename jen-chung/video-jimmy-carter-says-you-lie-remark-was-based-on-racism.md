Joe Wilson&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210452/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/10/obama_forgives_rep_wilson_for_heckl.php">&quot;You lie!&quot; outburst</a> during President Barack Obama&apos;s health care reform speech last week.  And Carter was blunt, saying, &quot;I think it&apos;s based on racism. There is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African-American should not be president.&quot;</p>

<p>Carter also said that the South&apos;s inherent racism was also leading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210452/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32869276/ns/politics-capitol_hill/">some protesters to equate Obama to the Nazis</a>, &quot;Those kind of things are not just casual outcomes of a sincere debate on whether we should have a national program on health care. It&apos;s deeper than that.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210452/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0909/Carter_on_race.html">Politico&apos;s Ben Smith writes</a>, &quot;Jimmy Carter tonight becomes the most prominent Democrat to say what very many Democrats are thinking: That there&apos;s a large element of ancestral racism in the Southern hostility toward Obama. He&apos;s succeeded, now, in making that the nation&apos;s central conversation. And regardless of it&apos;s merits, it&apos;s hard to overstate what bad politics that is for the White House. There&apos;s a reason that candidate Obama virtually never cried racism, and it wasn&apos;t because he doesn&apos;t believe it exists.&quot;</p>

<p>The former South Carolina Democratic party leader Dick Harpootlian told the AP, &quot;I think Joe&apos;s conduct was asinine, but I think it would be asinine no matter what the color of the president. I don&apos;t think Joe&apos;s outburst was caused by President Obama being African-American. I think it was caused by no filter being between his brain and his mouth.&quot;  </p>

<p>As for Wilson, a Republican representing South Carolina who is up for re-election, he was r<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210452/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/blogging-the-house-action-on-wilson/">ebuked by the House</a>&#x2014;in a mostly partisan vote of 240-179&#x2014;and he reiterated that his remarks were made at the &quot;wrong place, wrong time,&quot; but added, &quot;I&apos;m very disappointed because it seems like a double standard. I see, as people &#x2014; look, I was there on the floor when President Bush was booed and not a word was said. That&apos;s a double standard &#x2014; I&#x2019;m willing to live with that.&quot;</p>
