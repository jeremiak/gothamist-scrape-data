</div></div>					<p>Last night was the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821014927/http://www.dressedtokilt.com/">Dressed to Kilt</a> fundraiser, hosted by Sean Connery and his wife Micheline.  The event was themed &quot;Mad For Scotland,&quot; letting its kilt-wearing models strut their stuff in not so traditional outfits.  For instance, Joan Jett wore a feather mohawk headdress and Kelly Bensimon wore a plaid bustier. Today show weatherman Al Roker did not go &quot;au naturel&quot; under his kilt, while country singer Kelly Pickler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821014927/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1635491/20100406/pickler__kellie.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler">gave this advice to MTV</a>, &quot;Just keep your legs together. Be a lady or a gentleman. No cartwheels down the runway.&quot;</p>

<p>The event raised money for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821014927/http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/">Wounded Warrior Project</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821014927/http://www.pva.org/">Paralyzed Veterans of America</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821014927/http://www.erskine.org.uk/">Erskine Hospital</a> in Scotland.  Three wounded soldiers also modeled kilts.</p>
