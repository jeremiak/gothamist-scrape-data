<p>A chimpanzee lost his fight for personhood, after the New York State Appellate Court ruled that a locked-up chimp doesn&apos;t have the same rights as humans.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011232/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/03/activists_file_habeas_corpus_motion.php">Nonhuman Rights Project has been suing</a> to free a 26-year-old chimpanzee named Tommy from his upstate NY cage. Steven Wise, a lawyer from the group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011232/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/09/do_chimps_have_rights_ny_appeals_co.php">had argued</a> that Tommy was being unlawfully imprisoned, &quot;Keeping a legal person in solitary confinement in a cage is unlawful.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011232/http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/qa-about-the-nonhuman-rights-project/">The Nonhuman Rights Project says</a> it&apos;s &quot;the first and only organization petitioning courts to recognize that, based on existing scientific evidence, certain nonhuman animals&#x2014;specifically great apes, dolphins, and elephants&#x2014;are entitled to such basic legal rights as bodily liberty and integrity.&quot; And it offers this evidence: &quot;Our legal claims are based on the best scientific findings on genetics, intelligence, emotions and social lives of these animals showing they are self-aware, autonomous beings. Our work is supported by an international group of the world&#x2019;s most respected primatologists.&quot; Here&apos;s video of Tommy in his cage: </p>

<p>However, Presiding Justice Karen Peters wrote in a decision, &#x201C;(Wise) requests that this court enlarge the common-law definition of &#x2018;person&#x2019; in order to afford legal rights to an animal. <strong>We decline to do so, and conclude that a chimpanzee is not a &#x2018;person&#x2019; entitled to the rights and protections afforded by the writ of habeas corpus.</strong>&quot; Peters was backed by Justices John Lahtinen, Elizabeth Garry, Robert Rose and Michael Lynch. </p>

In our view, it is this incapability to bear any legal responsibilities and societal duties that renders it inappropriate to confer upon chimpanzees the legal rights &#x2014; such as the fundamental right to liberty protected by the writ of habeas corpus &#x2014; that have been afforded to human beings.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011232/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/nyregion/chimps-dont-have-same-rights-as-humans-court-says.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1">The Nonhuman Rights Group told the NY Times </a>it will appeal the case to the NY Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in the Empire State. Executive director Natalie K. Prosin said, &quot;That habeas corpus has never been demanded before on behalf of a chimpanzee is not a reason for denying it now... [Common law should] change in light of new scientific discoveries, changing experiences and changing ideas of what is right or wrong.&quot;</p>
