<p>Last night, the police found a woman, unconscious with head trauma, by an highway entrance ramp. Now they are hoping the public can help them identify her.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 8:55 p.m., officers &quot;responded to the entrance ramp from the west bound Pelham Parkway heading into Interstate 95 where a female was discovered unconscious and unresponsive with trauma to her head and a laceration to her arm.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman is in critical condition at Jacobi Hospital. It&apos;s unclear what caused her injuries. </p>

<p>The police say the woman is in her 30s, with a tattoo that reads &quot;I will fear no evil for thou art with&quot; as well as a tattoo of flower with rosary beads tattooed on her left arm. Photographs of the woman&apos;s arm were also released.<br>
