<p>Two men were injured during violent muggings in Manhattan yesterday afternoon. The first happened outside a Soho clothing store, while the second was on an Upper West Side street.</p>

<p>A large group was waiting outside the Supreme store on Lafayette Street for the company&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191147/https://www.facebook.com/supremeofficial/photos/a.10150750195133739.432873.5726358738/10153943483773739/?type=3&amp;theater">new spring/summer collection</a>, when the attack occurred around 2 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191147/http://pix11.com/2016/02/18/man-slashed-in-the-face-in-soho-suspect-on-the-loose/">PIX 11 reports that</a> the victim was leaving the store when a man walked up to him and demanded his shopping bags. Police tell the station that when the victim refused, the man &quot;cut him across the face with a sharp object before fleeing.&quot;</p>

And he said no. And with no reaction, he just sliced him up.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191147/http://nypost.com/2016/02/18/man-slashed-in-face-on-busy-street-in-soho/">A teen told the Post</a>, &quot;His right cheek was bleeding. It was all leaking.&quot; The victim was taken to the hospital while the suspect, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191147/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/man-slashed-face-manhattan-5th-blade-attack-3-days-article-1.2536406">apparently wearing a ski mask</a>, fled.</p>

<p>At 4:55 p.m., police say that a 33-year-old man was approached by a male suspect in front of 105 West 88th Street: The suspect &quot;grabbed the victim from behind, placed a knife to his neck and demanded his property.&quot; The victim handed over his Kindle and Apple headphones, but then a struggle ensued. Police say the mugger stabbed the victim in the upper back before fleeing eastbound on West 88th Street.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital and is in stable condition. The suspect&#x2014;who is described as being in his mid 20s, 5&apos;9&quot; and 160 pounds with a thin build and was least seen wearing a blue jogging jacket, blue jeans, black Nike sweatshirt, black sneakers and a red baseball cap&#x2014;was captured on video: </p>

<p>The violent muggings come less than 24 hours after a waiter was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191147/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/greenwich_village_diner_slashing.php">slashed by a teen apparently soliciting donations</a> at the Silver Spurs diner near NYU on Wednesday. A forensic psychologist, Dr. Jemour Maddux, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191147/http://pix11.com/2016/02/18/copycat-attacks-psychologist-has-possible-theory-behind-recent-uptick-in-slashings/">told PIX 11</a> that &quot;what&#x2019;s happening on the streets may be a combination of a raw increase in criminal activity and the theory posed by NYPD Commissioner Bratton&#x2014;a slashing spree fueled by the media&#x2019;s fixation on the incidents.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Maddux explained, &quot;This is a public health issue, this connecting these different things. And that&#x2019;s what all of these individuals have in common. They have the media in common. And it&#x2019;s my opinion they have psychiatric issues in common. When you see that they have operated in some of the same systems, you wonder if there&#x2019;s a public health view of this situation can capture the variability that we&#x2019;re seeing cross these different perpetrators.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801191147/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
