Here are his suggested approaches, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323045357/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/fire_hire_guidelines_2g2P52Oafr5uM1KYfSUazL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">via the Post</a>: <br>
<blockquote>* Randomly selecting enrollees from the top 2,500 scorers on the last test. To increase the pool of black and Hispanic candidates, the city would eliminate the lowest-scoring whites in the group and add the highest-scoring minorities who did not make the top 2,500.<p></p>

<p>* Hire candidates who represent a racial breakdown of the test takers. Sixty percent would be white; 17 percent black; 18 percent Hispanic; 2 percent Asian and 1 percent others.</p>

<p>* Hire candidates based on their scores on the last test, even though minorities would be under-represented, on condition that the next two classes enroll a higher percentage of black and Hispanic candidates.</p></blockquote><br>
Garaufis found that the city&apos;s past three FDNY exams discriminated against nonwhites.  The Center for Constitutional Rights, which questioned the exam&apos;s merits, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323045357/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/14/2010-09-14_compromise_lets_fdny_bring_on_300_probies.html">told the Daily News</a> that the judge&apos;s options were fine, &quot;There is no perfect alternative, all of these methods will inevitably result in someone getting screwed.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The city has until this Friday at noon to decide whether to go ahead with one of these methods.</p>
