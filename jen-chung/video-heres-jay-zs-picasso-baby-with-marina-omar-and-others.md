</div></div>					<p>Earlier this month, Jay Z invited numerous people from music (Fab Five Freddy), film (Judd Apatow, Jim Jarmusch), TV (Michael K. Williams, Jemima Kirke) and art (Marina Abramovic) to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143908/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/photos_jay-z_is_dancing_with_strang.php#photo-1">take part in the filming of a video</a> for his song &quot;Picasso Baby.&quot; The video was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143908/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/jay-zs_artful_mockery_of_the_art_wo.php#photo-7">based on performance art</a>, which involved him rapping for six hours and interacting with the crowd at the Pace Gallery. Now, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143908/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/photos_jay-z_is_dancing_with_strang.php#photo-1">seeing numerous photos and Vines</a>, here&apos;s what director Mark Romanek cut down from 30 hours of film his crew shot:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150523143908if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/xMG2oNqBy-Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143908/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/mark-romanek-talks-jay-zs-picasso-baby-music-video-its-a-tsunami-of-joy-20130731">Romanek told IndieWire</a> that Jay Z asked him to do the video for &quot;Picasso Baby&quot; (Romanek directed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143908/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHSRgwvbcI">video for &quot;99 Problems&quot;</a>):</p><blockquote>My reaction was, I definitely want to work with Jay-Z. It&apos;s very exciting. And something about making a &apos;music video&apos; in a traditional sense, didn&apos;t seem very interesting to me. The song name-checks a lot of fine artists and I thought, what could we do with that fine art world that isn&apos;t a traditional musical video but is part of the zeitgeist&#x2014;something unpredictable and [that] utilizes social media? I didn&apos;t want it to be a hermetically sealed experience.<p></p>

<p>The idea of performance art came to mind. I was aware of Marina Abramovic&apos;s Artist is Present, even though I was in London shooting &apos;Never Let Me Go&apos; and didn&apos;t get to go. And the idea that Jay-Z regularly performs to 60,000 people at a time, I thought, &apos;What about performing at one person at a time?&apos; He absolutely loved it. He interrupted me and said, &apos;Hold on! I&apos;ve got chills. That idea is perfect.&apos; He thinks, like me, that the music video has had its era. I also wanted to make sure we had Marina&apos;s blessing. So she attended the event and took part in the event. She couldn&apos;t have been more happy or enthusiastic about us using her concept and pushing it forward.</p></blockquote>In the interview before the &quot;Picasso Baby&quot; video, Jay Z points out, &quot;Concerts are pretty much performance art. The venues change.&quot;<p></p>
