He thought somebody was joking with him.&quot;</p>

<p>James was not injured, but other residents were upset. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516073320/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9062144">One told WABC 7</a>, &quot;Got the ex-mayor out here, minding his business and these, whoever they are, thugs, it is totally unnecessary,&quot; and another said, &quot;I guess the guy thought he was an average guy and did what he did, that&apos;s all.&quot;</p>

<p>The Newark police will release more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516073320/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/12/suspect-arrested-in-mugging-of-former-newark-mayor/">details about the arrest later</a>.
