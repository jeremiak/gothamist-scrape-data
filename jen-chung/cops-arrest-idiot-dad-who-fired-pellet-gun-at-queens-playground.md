<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_04-idiotdad.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011712im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04-idiotdad.jpg" width="300" height="305"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Via QueensMamas.com</i></div> Yesterday, it was reported that a father brought a loaded pellet gun to Ditmars Park in Astoria, Queens and fired it on Tuesday morning. Though Jack Pawlowski aimed it at a tree, parents were alarmed because the playground was full of children&#x2014;and he gave the loaded gun to his child, who then aimed it at other kids. Now Pawalowski has been arrested.<p></p>

<p>Parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011712/http://www.queensmamas.com/queens_mamas/2013/05/gun-wielding-dad-daughter-terrorize-astoria-playground.html">had called the police</a> about the fake gun and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011712/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/08/exclusive-man-arrested-for-allegedly-shooting-realistic-toy-gun-with-kids-in-queens-park/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that Pawlowski was &quot;led out of his Queens home in handcuffs Wednesday, with his stunned wife and three young kids looking on. He said nothing as detectives put him into a squad car.&quot; Earlier in the day, he had insisted other parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011712/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/pellet-gun-dad-defends-target-practice-article-1.1338262">were overreacting</a>, telling the Daily News, &quot;There&#x2019;s a lot going on in the world &#x2014; killing kids, stuff like that. Maybe they&#x2019;re a little paranoid.&quot;</p>

<p>Pawlowski had been using a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011712/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/father-daughter-shoot-pellet-gun-ditmars-park-article-1.1337810">realistic looking silver gun</a> his family bought in Poland. In New York, it&apos;s illegal to have realistic fake guns (cops will not hesitate to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011712/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/07/cop_shoots_15-year-old_in_face_afte.php">shoot you if you pull a BB gun</a> on them, too).</p>

<p>City Councilman Peter Vallone was not buying Pawlowski&apos;s attitude, &quot;This is really a way to educate people. You cannot run around with a realistic looking gun. It&#x2019;s against the law, and you could get arrested and actually go to jail.&quot;</p>
