										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_06_flight1549.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913043818im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_06_flight1549.jpg" width="260" height="172" class="image-left"> </span>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913043818/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/plane_crash_in_hudson.php">Flight 1549 splash landed into the Hudson River</a> in January&#x2014;and with everyone surviving&#x2014;one of the flight attendants, Doreen Welsh, said that a panicked passenger had pushed past her and opened up the rear door, sending water into the cabin. However, a few passengers have told the National Transportation Safety Board that Welsh was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913043818/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jCgE8KpmtvmBh1TqBLy963SaumpwD98KS3H00">actually the one who opened the rear door</a>. </p>

<p>Welsh, the only flight attendant in the back of the Airbus 320, told the Today Show in February,  &quot;I turned around to start guiding the people away, just then a passenger knocked me over and went and just wildly, I mean, she was just frantic and said, &apos;Open the door, open the door,&apos; and she cracked the door. I had to take her and get her away, but she had put it up just enough that it broke the seal and that water came gushing in.&quot; She also testified with the same story to Congress (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913043818/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6t9d-baez8">video</a>); Welsh also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913043818/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/08/60minutes/main4783586_page3.shtml">told 60 Minutes</a> she tried to re-close the door twice.</p>

<p>The NTSB is holding three days of hearings on Flight 1549 next week; board member Roger Sumwalt told the AP, &quot;That&apos;s what we want to straighten out. We want to get [the passenger&apos;s] testimony on that, was it a passenger or a flight attendant?&quot;  The Association of Flight Attendants said Welsh was not able for comment and gave a statement, &quot;<strong>While there may be conflicting reports regarding the exact actions of what happened immediately after crashing, the bottom line is that everyone was evacuated</strong>.&quot; Welsh suffered a deep laceration and her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913043818/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/09/amazing_sullenberger_flight_1549_cr.php">uniform was in shreds</a> by the time she was rescued.</p>
