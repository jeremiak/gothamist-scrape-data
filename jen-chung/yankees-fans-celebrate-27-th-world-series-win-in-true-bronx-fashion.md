</div></div>					<p>Last night&#x2014;and into this morning&#x2014;the city celebrated the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529091820/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/05/last_nights_action_yankees_win_world_series.php">Yankees&apos; 27th World Series win</a>.  Of course the win also meant that New York fans got to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529091820/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/27/world_series_gauntlet_thrown_down_b.php">gloat over Phillies fan</a>s&#x2014;check out the photographs above, taken by reader peterkreder, who witnessed various acts of fan superiority outside Yankee Stadium.  </p>

<p>One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529091820/http://wcbstv.com/worldseries/yankees.canyon.of.2.1293540.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I&apos;m so excited,. I live in Philly, I have to deal with their fans all my life. And I&apos;m so happy they finally won. I have lifetime bragging rights.&quot;  A &quot;lifelong&quot; Yankees fan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529091820/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/11/05/2009-11-05_fans_trumpet_yankees_world_series_2009_win_at_new_stadium.html?r=ny_local">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I&apos;m feeling like this is the most special moment in life - except giving birth.&quot;  Another declared, &quot;<strong>We found Pedro&apos;s daddy. He&apos;s from Japan, and his name is Matsui</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>And it&apos;s unclear whether this was victory related, but there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529091820/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/bronx/091105-stabbing-outside-yankee-stadium">even a stabbing</a> outside the stadium.</p>
