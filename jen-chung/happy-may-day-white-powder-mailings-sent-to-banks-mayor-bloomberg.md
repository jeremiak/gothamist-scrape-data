<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130435/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/at_least_five_suspicious_powder_inc.php">envelopes containing a suspicious white powder</a> were sent to seven Manhattan locations: Five were Wells Fargo branches; one was the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase; and another was the mail sorting room for Mayor Bloomberg.  Hazmat teams were dispatched to the various locations, but ultimately the police found the substance to be corn starch.  However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130435/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/nyregion/envelopes-with-white-powder-sent-to-bloomberg-and-6-banks.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">some of the envelopes did contain a note</a>, with the words, &quot;Happy May Day,&quot; and &quot;This is a reminder that you are not in control. Just in case you needed some incentive to stop working. We have a little surprise for you. Think fast.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130435/http://abcnews.go.com/US/day-protest-banks-white-powder-envelopes/story?id=16248124#.T5_SOMRYtfQ">told ABC News</a> that the mailings targeted mail room workers, &quot;Apparently, the message was aimed at the mail room workers among the &apos;99 percent.&apos;&quot;  While Occupy Wall Street has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130435/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/not_on_strike_tomorrow_may_day_will.php">planning May 1 disruptions</a>, members of its media team have insisted, &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t sound like anything that&#x2019;s part of the plans for tomorrow.&quot;  </p>
