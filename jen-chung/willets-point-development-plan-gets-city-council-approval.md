title: Willets Point Development Plan Gets City Council Approval
---

	
										<p>The City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020342/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/88856/city-council-approves-willets-point-plan/Default.aspx">voted to approve the Willets Point redevelopment plan</a> 42 votes to 2, aided by critical Council member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020342/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/13/monserrate_paves_the_way_for_willet.php">Hiram Monserrate&apos;s support</a>.  NY1 reports that while many Council members and Mayor Bloomberg are happy (Bloomberg said, &quot;For nearly half a century, Willets Point has been an environmentally-degraded area in the heart of Queens, but today, it finally has a brighter future&quot;), some business owners are against the plan--Bono Sawdust Supply Company&apos;s Jake Bono said, &quot;There&apos;s 70 landowners out here and 250 businesses that the City didn&apos;t even talk to and that it&apos;s property is not for sale and is not going anywhere. <strong>So they made a deal with Monserrate and all these other parties but we still own the land and we&apos;re not for sale and we&apos;re not going anywhere</strong>.&quot;</p>
