</div></div>					<p>Just after noon yesterday, a crash occurred at Atlantic Avenue and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, leaving the driver dead and another injured. Now it&apos;s reported that the car had been fleeing the police and slammed into a flatbed truck, resulting in the driver&apos;s decapitation.</p>

<p>Police say that Leroy Samuel, 22, was driving a 2003 black Infiniti eastbound on the BQE when he tried to exit at Atlantic Avenue. But he collided into a flatbed truck waiting at the light. </p>

The lights were flashing and the sirens were on.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907054840/http://nypost.com/2014/06/25/driver-loses-his-head-while-trying-to-lose-the-cops/">A bicyclist said to the Post</a>, &quot;When he exited here he was driving 70 to 80 miles per hour, and the trailer was waiting for the light... Highway patrol was chasing him. When I went to see what happened to the driver, he had no head. His head was in the back seat. It was horrible.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the police haven&apos;t said anything official about the pursuit&#x2014;apparently the car was initially pulled over on the Gowanus Expressway and Hamilton, but fled.</p>

<p>Witnesses say that Samuel&apos;s female passenger was screaming after the crash and tried to flee, but was caught by the police. She was treated for her injuries.</p>
