<p>The FBI says that a Long Island man shared his sick fantasies about raping and torturing babies and children on an Internet message board. Christopher Grief, of Ridge, Long Island, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013214/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/fbi-li-man-likes-child-porn-sex-plush-toys-article-1.1956837">arrested on child pornography charges</a> after FBI agents found disturbing videos on his computer. The FBI agent,  Danielle Messineo, said in the complaint that one video showed graphic sexual assault of a three-year-old while another showed sexual assault of an infant.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Grief was found on an online message board mainly used to share child pornography, a site that the FBI was monitoring. Grief, after waiving his Miranda rights, admitted that he posted on the board to download and view the child porn. The complaint also detailed his praise for horrifying clips posted to the board.</p>

<p>Grief, who lives with his parents, also told agents that a video of him mutilating a rat might be on his computer and that he liked to have sex with stuffed animals. The Daily News reports, &quot;Although plushophilia is not in the diagnostic literature of psychiatry, the bizarre behavior is included under the broad category of a disorders for sex with inanimate objects.&quot;</p>

<p>He is being held without bail.</p>
