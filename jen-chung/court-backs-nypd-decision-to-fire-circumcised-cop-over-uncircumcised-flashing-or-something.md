Owen Hopper argued that he could not have exposed himself to her, because she claimed her flasher was uncircumcised, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621081224/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/24/alleged_flasher_cop_uses_the_old_bu.php">but Hopper himself is circumcised</a>. Now, a NY appeals court has upheld Hopper&apos;s dismissal.<p></p>

<p>Hopper had also claimed that he wouldn&apos;t have exposed himself to a woman at the stationhouse that has surveillance video. He also took offense that his hearing officer never got an expert opinion about circumcised vs. uncircumcised penises and only used his &quot;personal expert opinion on how penises may appear when erect.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621081224/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/court-rules-nypd-cut-circumcised-article-1.1346665">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The state Appellate Division sided with the NYPD hearing officer, who recommended he be canned for that and another incident where his weapon was unsecured. He&#x2019;d once left his gun in a backpack in a college library.&quot; </p>

<p>So, here&apos;s the lesson: Junk and guns, bad; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621081224/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/cops_told_not_to_arrest_topless_wom.php">breasts, good</a>.</p>
