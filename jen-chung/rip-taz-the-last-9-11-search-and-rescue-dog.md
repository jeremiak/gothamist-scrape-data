He was nine years old.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618210345/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/dog-from-911-search-and-rescue-uni-dies/">According to City Room</a>, Taz was almost 2 years old when he was assigned to search Ground Zero: &quot;During the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attack, an average of eight dogs were on duty for each of two 12-hour shifts every day, according to the Police Department. The dogs typically worked 30 minutes at a time, then were given breaks.&quot;</p>

<p>Taz (yes, named after the Tasmanian Devil) worked with Officer Scott Ryan. The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618210345/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/pets/2009/10/02/2009-10-02_taz_the_last_of_the_heroic_911_ground_zero_dogs_has_died.html"> Daily News spoke</a> to a &quot;heartbroken&quot; Ryan who said, &quot;He was the best partner I ever had... He was easygoing. We liked to have fun, but when it came to work, we did what we had to do.&quot;  Taz was ill last month but had recovered a bit; the News reports, &quot;Doctors speculated he had lymphoma but cardiac arrest claimed him before he could have surgery.</p>

<p>And in a statement to City Room, Ryan said, &quot;His passing is not just a loss to me, my family and fellow K-9 officers, but to the city that Taz and his K-9 comrades so proudly and courageously served...  I will ride with my partner Taz for the last time, as I head to Hartsdale Pet Cemetery to bring his ashes home.&#x201D;</p>
