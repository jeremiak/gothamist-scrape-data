<p>Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan finally spoke out about how his security <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/watch_msg_security_remove_charles_o.php">guards threw beloved Knicks legend Charles Oakley out</a> of the Garden on Wednesday night&#x2014;and he decided to put Oak on blast. &quot;He&#x2019;s both physically and verbally abusive,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/charles-oakley-banned-stepping-foot-garden-report-article-1.2969466">he said on ESPN Radio</a>. He may have a problem with alcohol, we don&#x2019;t know. But those behaviors, being physically and verbally abusive, those are personality problems ... People need to sort of understand that.&quot;</p>

<p>Oakley attended the Knicks-Clippers game by buying his own tickets and was a few rows near Dolan&apos;s seat. Oakley claims that guards told him he had to leave because Dolan doesn&apos;t want him there, while the Knicks say that he &quot;behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner.&quot;</p>

<p>Oakley punched three security guards in the ensuing scuffle, and was later charged with three counts of assault. But he has support: a police officer outside the Midtown South Precinct where he was being held yelled, &quot;Free Oakley!&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/10/msgs_security_chief_reportedly_fire.php">head of security at Madison Square Garden was fired</a>, and before last night&apos;s game against the Denver Nuggets, Dolan tried to take his case to the public and blame Oakley for everything. </p>

<p>The Daily News&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-owner-james-dolan-classless-league-article-1.2969637">Stefan Bondy calls Dolan&apos;s behavior &quot;classless&quot;</a>:</p><blockquote>Dolan thinks everybody else is the problem, unless it&#x2019;s untouchable Phil &#x2014; even with his Knicks (22-33) in a free-fall and losing in embarrassing fashion again Friday in a 131-123 defeat to the Nuggets. The franchise needs a restart - or a carbon copy of &#x2019;90s Oakley to get some stops &#x2014; but Dolan is only concerned with booting and insulting the former All-Star.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;To me, I think that Charles has got a problem. I&#x2019;ve said this before. We&#x2019;ve said this before. We said it one time that he&#x2019;s his own worst problem. He has a problem,&#x201D; Dolan said. &#x201C;People need to sort of understand that. He has a problem with anger. He&#x2019;s both physically and verbally abusive. He may have a problem with alcohol, we don&#x2019;t know. But those behaviors of being physically and verbally abusive, those are personality problems.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If none of this makes any sense, it&#x2019;s because very little about Dolan&#x2019;s Knicks seems logical. All-time greats arrived in Dolan&#x2019;s Garden and plummeted spectacularly, like Jackson, Isiah Thomas and Larry Brown.</p>

<p>And maybe Dolan felt entitled to announce on radio that Oakley, &#x201C;may have a problem with alcohol,&#x201D; because Dolan himself is a recovering alcoholic.</p>

<p>But it was classless. It was insulting. It was completely unbecoming of an NBA owner.</p></blockquote>Oakley has now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/http://nypost.com/2017/02/11/knicks-fans-in-full-revolt-over-dolan-banning-charles-oakley/">been banned from MSG</a>, but last night, fans chanted for him:<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/http://nypost.com/2017/02/10/msg-bans-charles-oakley-for-life/">Oakley&apos;s team told the Post </a>that Dolan&apos;s accusations were &#x201C;outrageous&#x201D;. The Post also pointed out that while MSG has presented various witness statements about Oakley&apos;s alleged abusive behavior was unattributed.</p>

<p>Anyway, Oakley has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/sports/basketball/charles-oakley-james-dolan-knicks-madison-square-garden.html">insisted he does not have a drinking problem</a> (he admitted have drinks before going to the game) and will address the incident next week:</p>

<p>One Knicks fan at the Garden&#x2014;wearing a &quot;Fire Dolan&quot; shirt no less&#x2014;last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111903/http://nypost.com/2017/02/11/knicks-fans-in-full-revolt-over-dolan-banning-charles-oakley/">told the Post</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s shameful. I&#x2019;ve been a Knicks fan for my entire life, and Charles Oakley reps what the Knicks should be. The fact he has been banned, it&#x2019;s pathetic.&quot;</p>
