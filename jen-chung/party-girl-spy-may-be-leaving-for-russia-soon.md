A lawyer for the accused Russian spy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628190808/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/accused-russian-spy-stunner-anna-chapman-fly-home/story?id=11116194">tells ABC News</a> that she &quot;will appear in New York court today and then head directly to the airport to fly back to Moscow.&quot;  And ABC News adds, &quot;Chapman&apos;s mother, Irina Kushenko, said her daughter will arrive by noon Friday in Moscow.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628190808/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/world/europe/09russia.html?_r=1&amp;hp">NY Times says</a> most of the 10 defendants, including numerous couples who apparently had children as part of their deep covers, are expected to plead guilty: &quot;As often occurs in plea bargains, the defendants will be allowed to plead guilty to one charge &#x2014; conspiring to act as an unregistered foreign agent, which carries a maximum penalty of five years and has no minimum term. The government will presumably drop a second charge that most of the defendants face, conspiring to launder money, which carries a 20-year term.&quot;  Chapman&apos;s lawyer told the Wall Street Journal his client, the redheaded &quot;spy&quot; the tabloids love, wanted to fight the charges, but was facing &quot;odious&quot; detention.</p>

<p>This would then allow the U.S. and Russia to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628190808/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/07/accused_spies_may_be_plead_to_lesse.php">swap spies</a>.

It&apos;s the 1970s now.&quot;  </p>
