<p>Last year, Six Flags Great Adventure announced it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706124236/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/video_worlds_tallest_and_most_terri.php">was adding a 415-foot drop ride called Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom</a> for 2014. But now the ride&apos;s opening has been delayed for a second time.</p>

<p>The Star-Ledger reports, &quot;Just a few hours before members of the press were scheduled to get a taste of a steep drop ride at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson today, park officials again delayed the opening. Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom was first slated for a Memorial Day weekend opening to the public, then that was nixed. Now, with a new opening date of July 4 just days away, the press preview of Zumanjaro as been canceled because the park has not secured a state permit to run the ride.&quot;</p>

<p>On Zumanjaro, passengers experience a 90 mph drop, which means the ride lasts 10 seconds.</p>

<p>The park said, &quot;The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs&#x2019; Carnival-Amusement Ride Safety Unit has not yet granted the operating permit. Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom is a very complex, innovative ride, and the state&#x2019;s review of documentation is still underway.&quot; The Star-Ledger adds that a spokesperson &quot;attributed the May delay to bad weather during construction of the ride, citing wind as a menace to workers in building a ride so high off the ground, since gusts can prove more troublesome to a crane 500 feet in the air.&quot;  </p>

<p>Here&apos;s how the amusement park envisioned the ride: </p>
