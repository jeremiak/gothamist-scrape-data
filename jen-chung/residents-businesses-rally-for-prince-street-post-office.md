</div></div>					<p>A group of residents, businesses, lawmakers and others rallied outside the Prince Street Post Office (located on Greene Street) in Soho.  The U.S. Postal Service<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225620/mailto:http://www.nypost.com/seven/04012009/news/regionalnews/us_postal_disservice_162291.htm"> has been considering closing the branch</a> when its lease expires in July, but the group points out, &quot;<strong>The Worst Post Office is Better Than No Post Office!</strong>&quot;  As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225620/http://66squarefeet.blogspot.com/2009/04/prince-street-station-to-close-july.html">66 Square Feet said</a>, &quot;It is not unusual to wait in line for forty minutes. The mutters of dissent in the queue regularly approach the level of mutiny, strangers bonding in intense frustration.&quot;</p>

<p>The Soho Alliance&apos;s Sean Sweeney explains, &quot;[The post office] had occupied for eighty years the Apple SoHo building, but was relegated to a tiny space around the corner in the same building when Apple moved in.  Immediately, service suffered.  It must be the most congested post office in the city, if not the country. SoHo is a booming commercial district in need of its own post office.  Already long lines are common at Prince Street, up to an hour long. Yet USPS cut the hours last year... The nearest post office is almost half a mile away.&quot;  He also sent us these photos from today, where Tax Day filings brought a line of people that snaked inside the post office and onto the street&#x2014;apparently the line wasn&apos;t helped by just having three workers available.</p>

<p>Sweeney says that Rep. Jerrold Nadler is trying to help save the post office.
