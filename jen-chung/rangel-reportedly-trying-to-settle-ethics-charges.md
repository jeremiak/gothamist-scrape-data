Charles Rangel this past weekend (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Two days before the House ethics committee is scheduled to release details of violations it is charging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135554/http://gothamist.com/tags/charlesrangel">Rep. Charles Rangel</a> (D-Harlem) with, the embattled Congressman is reportedly<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135554/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rangel_working_on_last_minute_settlement_7dNVKtb6ojbXzipXqMgpGL"> trying to make a deal</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135554/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/07/27/2010-07-27_rep_charles_rangel_seeki_lastminute_deal_to_settle_slew_of_ethics_charges_agains.html">Daily News reports</a> that when House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) was asked about about the &quot;closed-door talks on whether Rangel will accept a wrist-slap deal to avoid an &apos;adjudicatory process&apos; similar to a trial,&quot; he said &quot;everyone would like this to go away.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoyer also namechecked a rather infamous former Congressman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135554/ttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40270.html">when he told reporters</a>, &#x201C;What I believed, and continue to believe, is that we have made the ethics process work. And we made it work in a meaningful way. And, in fact, when confronted with the prospect [of] the ethics committee proceeding, [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135554/http://gothamist.com/tags/ericmassa">former New York Rep. Eric Massa</a>] decided he wanted to resign because he knew, as I think everybody knows, I think the Rangel issue is demonstrative of, is the ethics process is working in a meaningful way.&quot;</p>

<p>At first, Rangel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135554/http://wcbstv.com/national/rangel.ethics.violations.2.1825912.html">was blustering to WCBS 2</a>&apos;s Marcia Kramer, telling her, &quot;What this means is that reporters have said why don&apos;t you resign, why don&apos;t you quit? And I have been saying why don&apos;t you wait and see what the facts are?&quot; But then he said, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s like a boil that&apos;s been building up for close to two years and it&apos;s gonna burst on Thursday. </strong>It may not be pleasant. It&apos;s painful to have to say &apos;no comment&apos; when people are attacking the very reason that you exist.&quot; </p>
