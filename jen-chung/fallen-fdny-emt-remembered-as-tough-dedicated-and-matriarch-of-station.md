<p>Jose Gonzalez, 25, the man accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/17/fdny_emt_killed_ambulance.php#photo-1">stealing an FDNY ambulance and deliberately killing an EMT</a> by running her over with the ambulance was held without bail yesterday. At the Bronx courthouse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/17/bronx-emt-worker-killed-suspect-charged/">his defense lawyer said</a>, &quot;Mr. Gonzalez is severely mentally ill. Whatever happened in this case was certainly&#x2014;&quot; only to be interrupted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://nypost.com/2017/03/17/slain-medics-colleagues-arent-buying-killers-mentally-ill-excuse/">EMTs gathered there</a>, who yelled, &quot;He&#x2019;s a criminal!!</p>

<p>According to WCBS 2, attorney Alice Fontier continued, &quot;Whatever happened in this case was not intentional.&quot;</p>

<p>FDNY EMT Yadira Arroyo, 44, and her partner, Monique Williams, were responding to a call on Thursday night about a pregnant woman in the Bronx when a civilian alerted them to the fact that a man was riding on the ambulance&apos;s bumper. (Video below shows Gonzalez standing on the bumper.) They stopped the ambulance near Watson and White Plains Road, got out and confronted Gonzalez, who then went around the ambulance and got into the driver&apos;s seat. </p>

<p>Arroyo and Williams tried to stop him, but Gonzalez then, authorities say, reversed the ambulance, running over Arroyo and dragging her as he tried to flee. After hitting a number of cars, the ambulance got stuck in a snowbank. Gonzalez was caught by an MTA police officer, Officer Dan McDade, and a few witnesses. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170318/soundview/mta-officer-dan-mccade-yadira-arroyo-stolen-ambulance">McDade told DNAinfo</a> &quot;that he knew something was wrong when he saw the ambulance driving erratically, striking cars and veering up onto snowbanks.&quot; </p>

<p>A distraught Williams, 31, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/bronx-man-charged-stealing-ambulance-killing-emt-worker-article-1.3000873">seen yelling at Gonzalez</a>, &quot;How could you do that to my f-----g partner?&quot;</p>

<p>Arroyo was pronounced dead at Jacobi Medical Center. Williams was treated for minor injuries.</p>

<p>Gonzalez, who had injuries on his face, was charged with murder. He is reportedly a member of the Bloods and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://nypost.com/2017/03/17/ex-con-charged-with-killing-emt-has-troubled-violent-past/">has 31 prior arrests</a> for offenses including assault and robbery. He was living at the Creston Avenue Residence, a homeless shelter, and another resident said to the Post, &quot;You knew he had serious mental issues and different personalities.&quot;</p>

<p>Family, friends and colleagues mourned Arroyo, remembering her as a devoted mother of five as well as an important presence at FDNY Station 26 in the Bronx. At a ceremony to place black and purple bunting at the station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://pix11.com/2017/03/17/fdny-emt-fatally-struck-by-stolen-ambulance-was-matriarch-of-the-station/">PIX11 reports that Lt. George Lamson said</a>, &quot;Yadi was the matriarch of the station. She was not only a mother of five, but a mother to the 100-plus people who worked here. She will live on in the lives she saved and the people she helped.&quot;</p>

<p>Arroyo&apos;s brother also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/17/remembering-bronx-emt-yadira-arroyo/">became an EMT because of her</a>. Joel Rosado said, &quot;She just saw the school down the block and she went for it. She took me to work and I saw what she really had to do and how she was taking care of people, and she did what she had to do - and inspired me.&quot;</p>

<p>Two of Arroyo&apos;s children, who range in age from 7 to 24, are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232334/http://nypost.com/2017/03/17/oldest-son-of-slain-emt-vows-to-be-a-rock-for-his-brothers/">planning to become EMTs as well</a>.</p>

<p>Rosado&apos;s fiancee, Monica Salazar, told WCBS 2 that Arroyo was &quot;dedicated&quot; and &quot;spunky&quot;: &#x201C;She was an amazing person. She was a single mother. She put herself through EMT school, got in the Fire Department, and served them for 14 years. She did it all on her own. She died doing what she loved, protecting her partner.&quot;</p>
