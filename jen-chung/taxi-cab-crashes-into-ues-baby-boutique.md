Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611061408/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/15/taxi-crashes-into-baby-clothing-store-in-nyc/">WCBS 2 has a photograph</a> of the damage.  Apparently a cab &quot;plowed&quot; into the Upper East Side <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611061408/http://www.zbabycompany.com/">location</a> of Z&apos;Baby, a baby clothing boutique, after 2 a.m. on Saturday morning: &quot;It took out the front window and shattered a display at the high end children&#x2019;s clothing store. One person suffered minor injuries. The cause of the crash is under investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Almost two weeks ago, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611061408/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/04/taxi_vs_scaffolding_four_hurt.php">&quot;out-of-control&quot; taxi SUV struck scaffolding</a> on Park Avenue South, injuring four people, just before 2 a.m. </p>
