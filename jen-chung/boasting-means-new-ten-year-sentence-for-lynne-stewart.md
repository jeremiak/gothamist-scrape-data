                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:210px; "> <img alt="2009_11_lynstewa.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106131803im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_11_lynstewa.jpg" width="210" height="205"> <br> <i>Stewart after her sentencing in 2006</i></div> Earlier this week, a judge sentenced activist lawyer Lynne Stewart to an additional ten years in prison. In 2006, Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106131803/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/16/28_months_in_ja.php">was sentenced to four years</a> (considered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106131803/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/17/stewart_sentenc.php">too low by critics</a>) for smuggling messages from a radical leader to his followers in Egypt, but more recently an Appeals Court had suggested she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106131803/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/24/judges_trade_barbs_over_alleged_ter.php">receive more prison time</a>. Judge John Koetl noted on Thursday that Stewart&apos;s remarks about her 28-month sentence&#x2014;specifically how she &quot;could do [28 months] standing on my head&quot;&#x2014;plus finding that she perjured herself during the trial showed the original sentence wasn&apos;t sufficient.  <p></p>

<p>A Washington Post article from 2006 found that Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106131803/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/17/lawyer_gets_28_months_for_aiding_terrorist_sheik/">seemed &quot;jaunty&quot;</a> after the 28-month sentence was announced.  But she was not so jaunty in court: Stewart, who is being treated for breast cancer and has been serving her sentence since last fall, responded, &quot;I have learned that no one, but particularly this 70-year-old woman, can do 28 months standing on their head. I was wrong.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106131803/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/why-a-self-imposed-gag-rule-is-important/">City Room spoke</a> to defense lawyer Andrew Lankler, who explained that when lawyers or clients speak to the media, &quot;You invite the law of unintended consequence.&quot; </p>

<p>He added, &quot;There are three occasions where people speak to the media. The first is, you didn&#x2019;t do it, your client didn&#x2019;t do it, and it&#x2019;s important for the world to know your client didn&#x2019;t do it. The other time you talk to the media is when you totally did it - there&#x2019;s no ifs, ands or buts. You might as well get out ahead of it and try to poison the jury pool as fast as possible. <strong>Every other reason, in my opinion, it&#x2019;s a mistake because you don&#x2019;t know how it&#x2019;s going to spin.</strong>&quot;</p>
