A joint funeral for Armstrong and 5-year-old Landon, 2-year-old Lance and 11-month old Lanaina was originally planned, but the father of the deceased children announced yesterday that the children <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064129/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/21/2011-04-21_mom_wont_be_buried_with_3_kids_she_killed.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">would be buried apart from their mother</a>. Armstrong&apos;s aunt was seething and told the Daily News, &quot;I am very angry. This jackass just came in here and messed everything up. She should be buried with her children, regardless of what she did.&quot;<p></p>

<p>While Armstrong did not leave behind a suicide note, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064129/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/hudson_river_murder-suicide_mothers.php#photo-1">many believe that she was distraught over her boyfriend</a> Jean Pierre&apos;s behavior.  Friends and neighbors said he cheated on her and  was emotionally abusive and noted the pair had many fights.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064129/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/20/jean-pierre-father-of-3-kids-killed-in-hudson-river-tragedy-speaks-out/">Pierre said in a statement,</a> &quot;I have been inaccurately portrayed as being directly responsible for the tragedy. If I could, I would have changed some things in my past... I loved Landen, Lance, Laianna, Lashanda and still love La&#x2019;Shaun with all my heart and am shocked and distraught by what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>LaShaun Armstrong, Armstrong&apos;s 10-year-old son by another man, survived the ordeal by managing to open his window and swimming to shore.  He flagged down cars until a driver, Meave Ryan, stopped and took him back to the river to see if they could see the sinking minivan (they couldn&apos;t) and the a firehouse.  Ryan attended the funeral and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064129/http://www.lohud.com/article/20110421/NEWS03/104210439/An-emotional-farewell-LaShanda-Armstrong-mother-who-killed-3-kids?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage/">according to the Journal News</a>, &quot;said she has nightmares and feels &apos;regretful&apos; that she could not rescue the rest of the family. She said she wants to tell LaShaun, &apos;I will always be here for you and I<br>
apologize for not doing more than I could.&apos;&quot;</p>
