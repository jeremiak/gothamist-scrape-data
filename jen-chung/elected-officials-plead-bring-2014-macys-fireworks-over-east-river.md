<p>Tonight, Macy&apos;s will hold its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312105835/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/map_where_to_watch_the_2013_macys_f.php">Annual Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular</a> over the Hudson River, denying millions Brooklyn and Queens residents waterfront views of pyrotechnics for the <em>fifth year in a row</em>. Well, some elected officials are trying to stand up for the outer-boroughs, not to mention East Side Manhattanites: Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, State Senator Daniel Squadron and City Councilman Stephen Levin held a press conference yesterday asking the city to hold next year&apos;s display over the East River.</p>

<p>de Blasio said, &quot;The outer-boroughs aren&#x2019;t an afterthought. They should be the main event. We&#x2019;re grateful to Macy&#x2019;s for bringing the show to New York City every Fourth, but it&#x2019;s time the City put the fireworks where the most New Yorkers can actually enjoy them. Let&#x2019;s alternate between the Hudson and East Rivers, beginning with a return to the Brooklyn-Queens waterfront next year. As a Brooklynite, this is a tradition we want back on our doorstep!&quot; </p>

<p>de Blasio and Squadron have been campaigning to bring the fireworks back east for a while&#x2014;last year, they mapped signatures of New Yorkers who want the fireworks moved and, shockingly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312105835/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/map_these_people_want_the_fireworks.php">many near the East River</a> agreed that there should be the chance to see the fireworks silhouetted by the Brooklyn Bridge, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312105835/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/how_many_new_yorkers_saw_the_firewo.php#photo-1">instead of from far away</a>.</p>

<p>Squadron pointed out, &quot;New York&#x2019;s Fourth of July celebration should be a citywide celebration. Yet year after year, millions of New Yorkers in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan&#x2019;s East Side are left out while we send visitors and business to New Jersey. I&#x2019;m grateful to Macy&#x2019;s for its willingness to work with us. Now let&#x2019;s bring the fireworks back to the East River - so more New Yorkers can join the party.&quot; Levin emphasized the financial aspect, &quot;Not only has the move from the East River to the Hudson limited the number of New Yorkers who can enjoy the display, but it is also sending business out of the state as well.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyway, for those of you who enjoy Hudson River fireworks, they&apos;ll look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312105835/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/photos_video_check_out_all_the_fire.php">something like this</a> but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312105835/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/usher_to_curate_macys_4th_of_july_f.php">&quot;curation&quot; from Usher</a> (please let there be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312105835/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPhCS-15eE">pimp cup firework</a>). </p>
