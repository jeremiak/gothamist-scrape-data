Guess that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160719/http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/8/30/121350/137/486/580223">scurrilous pregnancy-conspiracy gossip</a> that the youngest Palin (baby Trig) is actually Bristol&apos;s will have to end.  Palin and her husband issued a statement, &quot;Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realize very quickly the difficulties of raising a child, which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family,&quot; and asked for the media to respect their privacy.  Question: When is Fox News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160719/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/11/fox-news-calls-michelle-o_n_106655.html">going to use a &quot;Baby Mama&quot; graphic</a>, because wouldn&apos;t that be &quot;fair and balanced&quot;?</p>
