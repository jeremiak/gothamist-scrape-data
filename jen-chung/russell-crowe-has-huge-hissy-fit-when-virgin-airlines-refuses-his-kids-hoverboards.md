<p>Apparently being a movie star means you&apos;re totally ignorant of news reports that clearly state <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165838/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/28/hoverboard_boom.php">hoverboards can explode</a>, prompting their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165838/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/15/hoverboard_explosion.php">removal from Amazon</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165838/http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/262905-major-airlines-ban-hoverboards-on-flights">major airlines</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165838/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/15/a_night_at_the_mercer_hotel_costs_russell_crowe_11_million.php">Reliably surly</a> actor Russell Crowe tried to Twitter shame Virgin Australia for not allowing his sons to bring their hoverboards on a plane&#x2014;and it backfired spectacularly, much like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165838/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbR0RE-b84A">flaming self-balancing scooter</a>.</p>

<p>Crowe entertained everyone yesterday with his Angry Tweet:</p>

<p>In a perfect world, Crowe will take his family to NYC, spend thousands on hoverboards for everyone, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165838/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/mcfly_and_get_fined.php">run right into the NYPD</a>.</p>
