<p>Connor Cummings, the 20-year-old college student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161607/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/31/20-yr-old_falls_to_his_death_while.php">who fell to his death</a> on December 30th, 2015 while scaling the roof of a midtown hotel, captured a series of haunting and previously-unseen photographs just before he died. Four days after his death, police returned the camera to Cummings&apos;s family, and they&apos;ve now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161607/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/photos-atop-seasons-show-view-photographer-died-article-1.2513007">shared his final shots</a> with the Daily News. In an exclusive interview, Connor&apos;s mother insists that her son was a gifted photographer, and not &quot;a daredevil.&quot;</p>

<p>Cummings and his friend Dimitri Oliveras were not hotel guests, but on the night of Connor&apos;s death they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161607/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/01/college_student_who_died_after_clim.php">managed to take the elevator to the top floor</a> of the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street. The pair climbed more stairs to access the roof. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161607/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/01/nyregion/man-falls-to-his-death-trying-to-climb-four-seasons-hotel.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">The NY Times reports</a>:</p><blockquote>There they gained access to a fenced-off area that contained cooling equipment and fans surrounded by ladders leading to metal catwalks. After clambering up a 25-foot ladder to the catwalk area, the pair began taking photos using hand-held cameras, police officials said. <p></p>

<p>Around 11:15 p.m., as rain was falling over Manhattan, Mr. Cummings stepped back and fell through an opening in the floor of the catwalk, where the ladder joined with the landing. His friend, 18, told investigators he heard a bang and found Mr. Cummings&#x2019;s body on the roof 25 feet below the catwalk.</p></blockquote>Olivares <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161607/http://nypost.com/2015/12/31/man-dies-after-falling-from-four-seasons-trying-to-take-photo/">reportedly fled the hotel by cab</a> but, after 10 blocks, returned.<p></p>

<p>After Connor&apos;s death, Oliveras posted these images:</p>

He actually died doing what he loved best. It&apos;s supposed to give me some consolation, someone told me, but it hasn&apos;t yet.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_01_fourseasonscc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161607im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_01_fourseasonscc.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> A photo from the roof of the Four Seasons was taken minutes before the photographer fell to his death during an illegal &quot;urban exploration,&quot; which has become increasingly popular in recent years. (Conor Cummings)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Connor&apos;s final images show the bright lights of midtown through the rainy evening. One photo is from north of Times Square, while another is from the 52-story Four Seasons. </p>

<p>Police sources told the News that Connor was on the catwalk, backing up to take a picture of Dimitri, but did not realize there was a second opening on the scaffolding. He fell through the hole, but his camera landed on the platform &quot;unscathed.&quot; Linda Cummings told the News, &quot;They said it was quick &#x2014; that he died right away. It&apos;s a small blessing.&quot;</p>

<p>An obituary posted on a NJ funeral home&apos;s website says of Cummings, &quot;He was 20 years young and has left us broken hearted, but grateful for having had him bless our lives. Connor&#x2019;s spirit will live on forever in our hearts, our minds and in the images he&#x2019;s captured.&quot;</p>
