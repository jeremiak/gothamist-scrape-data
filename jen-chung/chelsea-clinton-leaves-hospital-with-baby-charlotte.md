Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013209/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/27/chelsea_clinton_gives_birth_to_baby.php">just three days old</a>, was carried by her mother Chelsea Clinton, who looked radiant.</p>

<p>The mother and child were accompanied by Clinton&apos;s husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and Clinton&apos;s parents, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013209/http://www.people.com/article/chelsea-clinton-takes-baby-charlotte-home">Well-wishers reportedly yelled</a> &quot;Congratulations!&quot; and &quot;Mazel tov!&quot; (Oddly, no one was heard to shout, &quot;Dynastic politics are a cancer upon the Republic!&quot;)</p>

<p>The younger Clinton also Tweeted her thanks to the hospital staff:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Marc &amp; I are very grateful to the drs, nurses &amp; staff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013209/https://twitter.com/lenoxhill">@lenoxhill</a> for their excellent care!</p>&#x2014; Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013209/https://twitter.com/ChelseaClinton/status/516725652335382529">September 29, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind, Lenox Hill Hospital is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013209/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/beyonce_jay-z_and_lenox_hill_hospit.php">where the most important baby of all time</a>, Blue Ivy Carter, was born.</p>

<p>Grandma Hillary went back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013209/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/hillary-clinton-talks-new-grandmother-status-fundraiser-new-york-democrats-blog-entry-1.1957113">raising money for Democrats on Monday</a>. Rep. Carolyn Maloney told the Daily News that she told her she  &quot;was no longer ready for Hillary. It&#x2019;s time for her to make a decision! I did several Ready for Hillary events, but now I am ready for her to make a decision.&quot; </p>
