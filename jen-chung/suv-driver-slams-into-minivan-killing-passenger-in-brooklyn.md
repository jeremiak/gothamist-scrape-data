<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred just before 10 p.m., at the intersection of Livonia Avenue and Georgia Avenue. Police say a 2016 black Ford Explorer had been traveling northbound on Georgia Avenue &quot;at a high rate of speed&quot; when it hit a 2001 silver Toyota Sienna, which was going east on Livonia Avenue at the intersection. </p>

<p>The Sienna&apos;s driver, 32, was taken to Brookdale Hospital with neck and and back pain, while the passenger, 20-year-old Mohammed Saber, was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>

<p>The Explorer&apos;s driver, Christopher Cates, 29, fled from the car, but officers apprehended him and later charged him with manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene of an accident, criminal possession of marijuana, operating a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs, unlawful possession of marijuana, failure to stop at a stop sign and speeding. His passenger, Janpoli Ramos-Colon, 21, was also charged with criminal possession of marijuana. </p>

<p>Neither Cates nor Rarmos-Colon were injured.</p>
