Bennett, 27, was assigned to the 9th Precinct in the East Village last fall. She was engaged to be married and had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312012434/http://nypost.com/2017/02/02/cop-killed-in-crash-was-set-to-marry-high-school-sweetheart/">posted on her Facebook earlier that day</a>, &quot;Awww can&#x2019;t wait for my wedding.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Bennett was in a Dodge Charger driven by her friend and fellow off-duty cop Sgt. Randolph Price. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312012434/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/off-duty-critically-injured-woman-killed-bronx-car-crash-article-1.2962108">According to the Daily News</a>, the pair had joined some friends for dinner on City Island when the &quot;speeding car... careened into a tree stump, flipped upside down &#x2014; and burst into a fireball.&quot;</p>

<p>Police responded to the scene at 11:43 p.m., at City Island Road at Park Drive (City Island Circle). Two other off-duty police officers, who had just left the Rodman&apos;s Neck firing range, were able to pull Price, 32, from the vehicle but the fire was too intense to get Bennett. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312012434/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Off-Duty-Police-Officers-Save-Man-From-Fiery-Bronx-Crash-Killed-Woman-412525213.html">A witness said</a> of the car: &quot;Instantly it started like exploding.&quot; </p>

<p>Price is reportedly &quot;fighting for his life.&quot; The Post reports that he is in stable condition with burns covering the lower half of his body, and that sources say he may lose his legs.</p>

<p>&quot;(Doctors) said he seemed like he&#x2019;ll make it,&quot; his father said. &quot;They said he&#x2019;ll be in a coma for two days. I do a lot of praying. But it&#x2019;s bad, and it&#x2019;s sad.&quot;</p>

<p>Bennett&apos;s Twitter account showed her enthusiasm for her job:</p>
