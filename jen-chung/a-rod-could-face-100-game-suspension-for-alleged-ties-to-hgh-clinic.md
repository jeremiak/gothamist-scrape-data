<p>Numerous baseball players, including the Yankees&apos; Alex Rodriguez, may be suspended by Major League Baseball for their relationships with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/29/a-rod_accused_of_buying_hgh_from_mi.php#photo-7">Miami health clinic that was a front for a human growth hormone ring</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9301536/major-league-baseball-suspend-18-players-including-alex-rodriguez-ryan-braun-part-miami-investigation">ESPN&apos;s &quot;Outside the Lines&quot; broke the news</a>:</p><blockquote>Tony Bosch, founder of the now-shuttered Biogenesis of America, reached an agreement this week to cooperate with MLB&apos;s investigation, two sources told &apos;Outside the Lines,&apos; giving MLB the ammunition officials believe they need to suspend the players.<p></p>

<p>One source familiar with the case said the commissioner&apos;s office might seek 100-game suspensions for Rodriguez, Braun and other players, the penalty for a second doping offense. The argument, the source said, is the players&apos; connection to Bosch constitutes one offense, and previous statements to MLB officials denying any such connection or the use of PEDs constitute another....</p>

<p>The development is a major break for MLB, which has pursued the case vigorously since Bosch&apos;s name was brought to MLB&apos;s attention last summer. In exchange for Bosch&apos;s full cooperation, sources said, Major League Baseball will drop the lawsuit it filed against Bosch in March, indemnify him for any liability arising from his cooperation, provide personal security for him and even put in a good word with any law enforcement agency that might bring charges against him. Sources said negotiations over the agreement, which lasted several weeks, stalled over the last point, as Bosch wanted the strongest assurances he could get that MLB would help mitigate any prosecution.</p></blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/a-rod-braun-face-100-game-suspensions-bosch-ready-talk-article-1.1363300">Daily News reports</a> that Bosh is &quot;apparently desperate for money, according to the source, and MLB was rushing to complete the deal because it is concerned that one of the players involved in baseball&#x2019;s latest doping scandal might offer him money not to cooperate.&quot; The source said, &quot;They were afraid someone else would pay him. Bosch is the only guy who can provide them with what they need.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Among the players who supposedly face suspensions: A-Rod, Ryan Braun, Nelson Cruz, Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon, Gio Gonzalez, Yasmani Grandal, Francisco Cervelli, Jesus Montero, Jhonny Peralta, Fernando Martinez, Everth Cabrera, Fautino de los Santos and Jordan Noberto. </p>

<p>The Miami New Times&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/specialReports/anthony-bosch-and-biogenesis-mlb-steriod-scandal-3698782/">investigation into Biogenesis</a> revealed the simmering scandal. Bosch apparently kept a notebook and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2013/01/the_a-rod_files_every_mention.php">Rodriguez&apos;s name is repeatedly in it</a>: &quot;Alex Rodriguez appears 16 times in the documents we reviewed. His name is recorded as &apos;Alex Rod&apos; or &apos;Alex R.&apos; or by his nickname at the clinic, &apos;Cacique.&apos; This is particularly interesting because on ESPN, he acknowledged using PEDs but said he stopped in 2003. It&apos;s also important to note that Rodriguez&apos;s cousin, Miami resident Yuri Sucart, frequently appears in the same records on the same days as Rodriguez. Sucart has been identified in the past as Rodriguez&apos;s source for performance-enhancing drugs.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2009, Rodriguez publicly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/17/alex_rodiguez_talks_to_the_media.php#photo-1">admitted he used a steroid</a>&#x2014;but claimed he had no idea it was a steroid at the time. He faces a 100-game suspension because it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/report_rod_among_those_mlb_wants_WnL5vQ9z3VRHAQ8bcXSojJ">would be his second doping offense.</a> However, if players are suspended, they can appeal and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153434/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/report_rod_among_those_mlb_wants_WnL5vQ9z3VRHAQ8bcXSojJ">question evidences and witnesses</a>. ESPN notes there may be a lack of evidence, &quot;Several sources told ESPN that Bosch dealt only in cash and usually used friends as couriers, sometimes never seeing some of the athletes he served.&quot;</p>
