<p>Early this morning, police officers from the NYPD&apos;s Emergency Service Unit managed to rescue a man who was standing on the outside of a Manhattan Bridge bike path, perched over the East River. The authorities released dramatic video of the incident.</p>

<p>According to the police, officers in the 5th Precinct responded to 911 calls about an emotionally disturbed person on the bridge&apos;s lower roadway bike path:</p><blockquote>Upon arrival, officers encountered a 22 year-old male on the outermost ledge, located on the exterior side of the safety fence, toward the Brooklyn side of the bridge. The Emergency Service Unit (ESU) also responded and began a dialogue with the individual. Over the next 30 minutes, ESU personnel proceeded to cut a hole in the fence in order to facilitate a safe exit for the individual from the ledge. Once completed, ESU personnel traversed the fence from the top and flanked the individual, bringing him to safety through the hole in the fence. The individual was uninjured and removed to an area hospital for evaluation.</blockquote><p></p>
