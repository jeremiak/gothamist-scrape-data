                            <p>After getting a special fleece from NJ Governor Chris Christie, Prince Harry of Wales made his way to New York City yesterday. First stop: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204224/http://www.harlemrbi.org/">Harlem RBI in East Harlem</a>, a group which turned an empty lot into baseball diamonds for children to have a place to learn and play. Prince Harry showed the crowd he can play games that us Yanks play, especially when the baseball is thrown by Mark Teixeira of the Yankees.</p>

<p>The third in line to the British crown (he&apos;ll be fourth after his niece or nephew is born) charmed the children&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204224/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/prince-harry-heads-jersey-shore-hurricane-sandy-destruction-article-1.1343485">one told the Daily News</a> that he wasn&apos;t mean &quot;he&apos;s quite nice&quot; and looks &quot;sweet&quot; (see the video below)&#x2014;and a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204224/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-harry/10057825/Prince-Harry-hits-home-run-as-he-learns-to-play-baseball.html">nother told the Telegraph</a> she was impressed his batting, &quot;All of us were like &#x2018;is that a bird or is that a ball?&#x2019;. I didn&#x2019;t think anyone could swing that fast - he hit that thing out, all of us were like &#x2018;wow&#x2019;. Who thinks that a Prince is going to play baseball? Princes are usually in castles or doing something important.&quot;</p>

<p>Teixeira said, &quot;Everybody here enjoys having Yankees around but when Prince Harry shows up it takes it up to a whole different level,&quot; adding that Harry is &quot;a very good athlete, you can tell that right away. I was just telling him &#x2018;keep round the ball&#x2019;, he knew what he was doing, he played some cricket growing up and he&#x2019;s seen American baseball - he&#x2019;s a natural.&quot; Harlem RBI is working with the Prince&#x2019;s Royal Foundation.</p>

<p>Prince Harry also attended a British tourism event in the Meatpacking District with Prime Minister David Cameron&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204224/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22535160">they got 3D dolls of themselves</a>.</p>
