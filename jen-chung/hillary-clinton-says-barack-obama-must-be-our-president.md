</div></div><p>After a bitter primary season, Hillary Clinton gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053501/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/26/dnc.main/index.html">rousing and passionate speech in support</a> of presidential candidate Barack Obama during the second night of the Democratic Convention.  She said she was a &quot;proud supporter of Barack Obama&quot; and &quot;<b>Barack Obama is my candidate, and he must be our president</b>.&quot; </p>

<p>Clinton, who remembered staunch surrogate Representative Stephanie Tubbs and thanked numerous people--especially her &quot;sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits&quot;-- articulated why Obama had her vote and asked her supporters, &quot;I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me?...Whether you voted for me, or you voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines.&quot; She also got the crowd going with a call-and-response type questioning of whether they wanted &quot;four more years of the last eight years&quot; (the audience responded &quot;No!&quot;).</p><blockquote>That is our duty, to build that bright future, to teach our children that in America there is no chasm too deep, no barrier too great, &#xAD; no ceiling too high, &#xAD; for all who work hard, who keep going, have faith in God, in our country, and in each other. That&#x2019;s our mission, Democrats. Let&#x2019;s elect Barack Obama.&#x201D;</blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053501/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/us/politics/27DEMSDAY.html">NY Times noted</a> that former President Bill Clinton looked on &quot;tenderly&quot; and tears were in the eyes of her supporters. And perhaps more powerfully, when a Times reporter asked a Clinton fan if she would vote for Obama, she replied, &#x201C;Absolutely&#x2013;she just told us to, didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201D;  Here is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053501/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12869.html">full transcript of her speech</a>; video is below.  <p></p>

<p>Obama, who watched her speech from Billings, Montana, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053501/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/road-to-the-rockies-obama-praises-clintons-speech/">said</a> he thought she was &quot;outstanding.&quot;  He loved the &quot;No way, no how, no McCain&quot; line.  Obama will be heading to Denver tomorrow, when his VP pick Joe Biden speaks; he will speak on Thursday night.</p>
