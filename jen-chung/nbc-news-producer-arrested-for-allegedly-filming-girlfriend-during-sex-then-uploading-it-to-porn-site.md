<p>He then slipped into bed with her and kept the camera rolling as they did the deed, and later posted the video the on XTube, the sources said. The woman discovered the video on the accused perv&#x2019;s home computer several months later on Sept. 4 &#x2014; and promptly dumped Dellaverson and moved out of the love nest.</p></blockquote>Apparently Dellaverson admitted that he &quot;put the steamy footage online&quot; in an email. He&apos;s been charged with disseminating unlawful surveillance and harassment.<p></p>

He had been saving money by living with his parents: &quot;Living at home had its perks. &apos;My parents are amazing,&apos; Mr. Dellaverson said. &apos;They didn&#x2019;t charge me rent and my mom would do the laundry and cook me dinner.&apos; A car was available. &apos;All of the things that made living in New York City so annoying, I didn&#x2019;t have to deal with,&apos; he said.&quot;</p>
