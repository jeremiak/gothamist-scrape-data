Three people were shot; one of them, 18-year-old Brian Scott, died from his injuries while the other two, a 20-year-old man and a 23-year-old man, are in stable condition.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203239/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7061602">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;Friends say Brian Scott was a well-known rollerblader called &apos;Cozmik.&apos; He was said to be a person that everybody in the area knew. The 18-year-old&apos;s skating moves and video were popular on the web.&quot; (Here&apos;s a profile of him on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203239/http://www.believeinone.com/?p=436">Believe in One</a>.)  Scott&apos;s father said, &quot;He was real humble and wouldn&apos;t start trouble with anyone,&quot; and other friends suspect that &quot;his murder is a case of mistaken identity.&quot;  Police are investigating and will be looking at surveillance video.</p>
