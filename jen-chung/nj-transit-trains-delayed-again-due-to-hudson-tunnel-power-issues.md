<p>Yesterday, a survey revealed the unsurprising news that customers are pretty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083303/http://www.northjersey.com/news/transportation/NJ_Transit_gets_low_grades_in_customer_service_survey.html">unhappy with NJ Transit&apos;s customer service</a>, rating the service a 4.2 on a scale of 0 to 10.  Now, NJ Transit is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083303/http://www.njtransit.com/hp/hp_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=HomePageTo">telling its customers</a>, &quot;Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast Line trains are subject to 30-60 minute delays in/out of NY due to power problems in one Hudson River tunnel. Midtown Direct trains are operating to/from Hoboken. PATH cross honoring rail tickets/passes at Newark, Hoboken and 33rd St.&quot;  D&apos;oh!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083303/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/nj_transit_trains_to_new_york.html">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole says the problem involves overhead wires in the south tube so trains are forced to use the single track in the north tube. Amtrak trains are facing delays of up to 30 minutes.&quot; A Nj.com commenter who commutes from Princeton to NYC said, &quot;NJT is working hard for that under 4 rating!&quot; who added, &quot;Single lane in. And they are letting 7 trains OUT before any into NY. Happy Friday!&quot;</p>

<p>Last month, a power outage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083303/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/22/power_outage_leaves_four_trains_stu.php">left four trains stranded in the tunnel</a>.</p>
