<p>An order was placed to a Chinese restaurant for a delivery to 40 Morningside Heights.  The video shows three suspects beating the deliveryman, with a fourth acting as a lookout.  The suspects appear to attempt to rob the deliveryman, but flee before taking anything.  The deliveryman suffered facial injuries.</p>

<p>In 2005, a Chinese food deliveryman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605062038/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/11/chinese_food_delivery_man_shot_in_the_eye.php">was shot in the eye after being robbed</a> in the Bronx.  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605062038/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/13/chinese_food_delivery_man_dies_shooters_still_on_the_loose.php">later died of his injuries</a> and it was noted that the robbers didn&apos;t take his $9. Then-City Councilman (now Comptroller) John Liu said, &quot;There&apos;s an undercurrent to these brutal attacks on immigrant workers, because they are sometimes not considered to be real people by the perpetrators.&quot;</p>
