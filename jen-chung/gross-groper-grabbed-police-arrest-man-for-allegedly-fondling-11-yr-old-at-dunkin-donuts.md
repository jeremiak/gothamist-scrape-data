<p>The incident occurred at the Dunkin Donuts at 361 East 21st Street.  The girl wasn&apos;t injured and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323171707/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/03/22/police-suspect-in-alleged-dunkin-donuts-groping-of-11-year-old-girl-arrested/">according to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Employees say the Dunkin Donuts was very crowded at the time of the incident and that the little girl never told them what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say the (allegedly) portly pervert is Kerry Abrams, a 54-year-old East Village resident.  Abrams was charged with sexual abuse.  The Daily News reports, &quot;He has no prior arrests on his record, officials said. Authorities were led to the man by a tipster who recognized him on surveillance video that was released.&quot;  The video was the tip-off, and not the amazing sketch by Detective Harvey?!?!?</p>
