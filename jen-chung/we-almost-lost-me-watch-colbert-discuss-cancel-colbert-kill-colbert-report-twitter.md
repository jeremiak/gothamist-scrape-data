</div></div>					<p>Last night, Stephen Colbert finally addressed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054240/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/28/cancel_colbert.php">controversy that sparked #CancelColbert</a> on his show, The Colbert Report. After a dream sequence where his show was really cancelled (with an assist from B.D. Wong as a psychoanalyst) and more racially diverse emojis, Colbert told viewers, &quot;We almost lost me... The dark forces trying to silence my message of core conservative principles mixed with youth-friendly product placement have been thwarted.&quot;</p>

<p>After someone working on Comedy Central&apos;s Twitter for the show, @ColbertReport, Tweeted, &quot;I am willing to show #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever,&quot; without any context (like a link to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054240/http://t.co/e0Pqz7U7i9">The Colbert Report segment</a> mocking Washington football team owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054240/http://dcist.com/2014/03/dan_snyders_latest_charity_stunt_is.php">Dan Snyder&apos;s &quot;Washington R*dskins Original Americans Foundation&quot;</a>) on Thursday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054240/http://twitter.com/suey_park">Suey Park</a> started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054240/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CancelColbert&amp;src=hash">#CancelColbert hashtag</a>. Colbert, who had already taped his Thursday show before the hashtag started trended, chimed into the debate, pointing out he was not personally Tweeting from the account, &quot;#CancelColbert - I agree! Just saw @ColbertReport tweet. I share your rage. Who is that, though? I&apos;m @StephenAtHome&quot;</p>

<p>In front of his Monday night audience, Colbert said, &quot;When I saw the tweet with no context, I understood how people were offended,&quot; and emphasized that he&apos;s not racist, &quot;I don&apos;t even see race, not even my own. People tell me I&apos;m white and I believe them because I just devoted six minutes to explain how I&apos;m not a racist.&quot; Also, since he wasn&apos;t able to respond for three days, &quot;In a sense, I was canceled for three days... just like Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p>He made pokes at Twitter, asking, &quot;Who would have thought a means of communication limited to 140 characters would ever create misunderstanding?&quot; and reassured America that he only Tweets at @StephenAtHome, disclosing, &quot;I sometimes Tweet at @StephenAtHome at work in bathroom.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also mentioned how there were stories on Slate, The New Yorker, Variety, three on Time.com and seven on Salon, plus cable news (CNN even cut away from their Malaysian Airlines coverage): &quot;To recap, a web editor I&apos;ve never met posts a Tweet in my name on an account I don&apos;t control, outrages a hashtag activist and the news media gets 72 hours of content. The system worked!&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert had Twitter co-founder Biz Stone on, to ask why Stone was so intent on destroying him. Then Stone helped Colbert use a kill switch to destroy the @ColbertReport Twitter account once and for all.</p>

<p>Oh, and about the Washington football team owner&apos;s &quot;Original Americans Foundation,&quot; Colbert said, &quot;Twitter seems to be fine with [it], because I haven&apos;t seen shit about that.&quot;</p>
