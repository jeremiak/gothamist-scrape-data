<p>You the know huge Ferris wheel&#x2014;to be the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151536/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/27/the_worlds_tallest_ferris_wheel_is.php#photo-1">world&apos;s biggest if actually built</a>&#x2014;planned for Staten Island? Well, the New York Wheel&apos;s developers are working hard on making it happen&#x2014;and there might be Google Glass. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151536/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/a_peek_at_google_glass_nightmare_dy.php">ALL HAIL, GOOGLE GLASS</a>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151536/http://adage.com/article/media/york-wheel-create-outdoor-ad-opportunities/240972/?utm_source=mediaworks&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=adage&amp;ttl=1367259045">AdAge article mostly about the sponsorship opportunities</a> (projected 4.5 million visitors/year, but billions of impressions!), there were some inklings about some hi-tech accessories:</p><blockquote>Technology and social media are playing a crucial role in the design of the wheel. Developers are in talks with Google to use its technology, like Google Glasses, to offer riders an augmented-reality experience. Carts will feature touch-screen glass to add to the multimedia experience, which could incorporate brand messaging. A New York Wheel app will provide information on the structure, as well as on the metropolitan area, and could serve as another advertising platform.<p></p>

<p>But developers are most focused on the social aspects of the New York Wheel. The site will be wired and equipped with all forms of technology, including cameras and tablets. &quot;By allowing riders to share their experience, we are extending the reach globally,&quot; Mr. Taggart said.</p></blockquote>Also, the ride itself will be 38 minutes.<p></p>
