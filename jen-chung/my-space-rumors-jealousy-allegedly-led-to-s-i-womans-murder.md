Calvin Lawson was charged with murder and while police didn&apos;t not disclose a motive, Wimmer&apos;s parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030300/http://www.silive.com/news/advance/index.ssf?/base/news/124152480442430.xml&amp;coll=1">told the Staten Island Advance</a> that their daughter was killed due to rumors on MySpace: The victim&apos;s mother Martha (Marti) Wimmer &quot;said<strong> investigators believe a female enemy of her daughter&apos;s used the social networking site to suggest to another girl that Lawson had been cheating on her with Ms. Wimmer</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Wimmer&apos;s parents had found their daughter&apos;s dead body after not hearing from her for a few days.  The 26-year-old had been beaten and strangled with a hair dryer cord.  Lawson had allegedly gone to Wimmer&apos;s West Brighton apartment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030300/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/05/05/2009-05-05_dissed_on_myspace_he_strangled_staten_island_girlfriend_caroline_wimmer_say_cops.html">to confront her, but then snapped</a>.  Lawson, when being led from the precinct, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030300/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/suspect_in_slaying_of_staten_i.html">told reporters</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t have anything to say. I told them who did it already.&quot;  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030300/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/top_cop_alleged_killer_said_st.html">Lawson confessed</a>, with his written confession reading, &quot;<strong>I choked the victim accidentally. I didn&apos;t mean for this to happen and I&apos;m truly sorry</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Marti Wimmer told the Advance that her daughter and Lawson were never involved.  She added, &quot;My daughter lost her life over a lie. It was over nothing. I want him to rot in jail for the rest of his life. If I have to live to 100 to go to parole hearings so he never walks out of jail, I will.&quot;</p>
