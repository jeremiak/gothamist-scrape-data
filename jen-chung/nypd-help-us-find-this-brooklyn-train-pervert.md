<p>According to the NYPD, on August 5, at around 6:30 p.m., a 22-year-old woman on a 4 train says a man &quot;rubbed his penis against her&quot; near Atlantic Avenue. The suspect then fled from the train at Franklin Avenue. </p>

<p>Police describe the suspect as a man in his 50s, 5&apos;10&quot; and 250 pounds. The victim apparently also got a photo of him as well.<br>
 <br>
Anyone with information in regards to this forcible touching is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130922/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
