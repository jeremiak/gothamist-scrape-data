In an interview yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053312/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/71-year-old-woman-slashed-face-riding-6-train-article-1.2508315">71-year-old victim recalled</a>, &quot;I didn&apos;t even realize he was cutting me. &#x201C;It didn&#x2019;t hurt because he didn&#x2019;t hit any nerves. I didn&#x2019;t even realize until the guy told me, &#x2018;Hey you&#x2019;re bleeding.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>While the police initially said the assault <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053312/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/25/woman_slashed_on_6_train.php">occurred on a downtown 6 train</a>, investigators now say the slashing happened on a D train. According to the NYPD, at about 6:50 a.m., the victim &quot;was on board a northbound &apos;D&apos; train approaching the Broadway-Lafayette subway station.  When the doors opened, the suspect slashed the victim in the left cheek causing a laceration.The individual fled the station on foot to the street.&quot;</p>

<p>Victim Carmen Rivera, who lives in Borough Park, told the Daily News, &quot;You see all this on TV. You never think it&#x2019;s going to happen to you. He was so calm sitting down like everybody else.&quot;</p>

<p>She added to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053312/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/25/subway-slashing-street/">WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I take that train every morning. It was somebody I didn&#x2019;t even know, because you don&#x2019;t stare at people on the train.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Police describe the suspect as approximately 25 years old and about 5&apos;10&quot; and 160 pounds, with a thin to medium build, with brown eyes and black hair. He was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a dark colored jacket, red hoodie, multicolored sneakers. </p>

<p>The authorities also released a sketch and surveillance video; the video shows the suspect fleeing through the turnstiles and then falling.</p>
