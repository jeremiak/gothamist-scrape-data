I just buried my oldest son a little over two years ago, to a car accident, and I haven&apos;t even found closure yet, and now, I have to place my younger boy in the same hole that his older brother&apos;s in... Take a look at my life, and understand what I&apos;m saying to you. I&apos;m the mother of a teen. A teen that&apos;s been a regular teen, as you say. They&apos;re young, they make stupid moves.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164416/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/cops_fatally_shoot_16-year-old_gunm.php">Police said</a> that on Saturday night, at around 11:30 p.m., two Brooklyn South Anti Crime plainclothes officers had been on patrol when they noticed young males near 473 East 52nd Street. According to the NYPD&apos;s statement, the cops noticed one&#x2014;Kiminai Gray&#x2014;&quot;break away from the group upon noticing the police. The male... adjusted his waistband and continued to act in a suspicious manner. The officers exited their unmarked auto and attempted to engage the suspect, who turned on them, and pointed a .38 caliber revolver at the officers. Both officers fired at the suspect, striking him about the body.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164416/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/brooklyn_violence_during_protest_bl.php">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly had said</a>, &quot;We have three [civilian] witnesses, two of which said that one of the officers shouted &apos;Don&apos;t move&apos; and &apos;Freeze.&apos; Two witnesses also said they heard officers say, &apos;What do you have in your hands?&apos;&quot; However, one witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164416/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/witness_claims_kimani_gray_was_not.php">claims that the teen wasn&apos;t armed</a>.</p>

<p>Kimani had previous arrests and was reportedly a member of the Bloods.  Carol Gray said today, &quot;As a mother... I want to speak of Kimani. Kimani Gray is my son. My baby. My 16-year-old baby... He&#x2019;s not the public&#x2019;s angel, but he&#x2019;s my angel and he&#x2019;s my baby and he was slaughtered and I want to know why.&quot;  She said, &quot;He has a curfew, sometimes he&apos;s late. Whatever time he gets there, I&apos;ll be real happy to seem him&quot; and pointed out that he wasn&apos;t &quot;at a robbery site, not at the murder scene, Kimani was killed in front of his best friend&apos;s house, after leaving a sweet 16 party.&quot;</p>

<p>A report from the medical examiner&apos;s office said that Kimani had been hit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164416/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/kimani_gray_shot_7_times_by_nypd_3.php">seven times by the police officers&apos; bullets</a>, three of them in the back. Carol Gray asked for justice and wondered, &quot;Why was Kimani been murdered, and slaughtered? Why was Kimani begging for his life? Why was Kimani saying [those things] if he had a weapon? ... He&apos;s my angel, and my baby, and he was slaughtered, and I want to know why. After the first shot, why the second bullet, why the third bullet? ... Just walk in my shoes, please, and understand my grief... I want justice, for his civil rights, for being an American citizen.&quot;</p>

<p>City Council Member Charles Barron said they weren&apos;t going to address the violence during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164416/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/brooklyn_violence_during_protest_bl.php">vigils on Monday</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164416/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/dont_shoot_me_hundreds_turn_out_for.php">Wednesday nights</a> (the Grays have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164416/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/14/dozens-arrested-after-3rd-day-of-protests-for-brooklyn-teen-shot-by-police/">condemned the violence through a spokeperson</a>), but did say that justice would help, &quot;The best way to stop violence in our community is that&#x2014;no pleas for peace are going to do it, just justice.&quot;</p>
