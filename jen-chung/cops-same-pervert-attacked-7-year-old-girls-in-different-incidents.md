<p>Police believe that the same man is behind two assaults on seven-year-old girls in Queens on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The first incident occurred at 2:45 p.m. The NYPD says the little girl was on the stoop of her house in South Ozone Park &quot;when the suspect approached her and grabbed her buttocks.&quot; The girl&apos;s 12-year-old sister, also on the stoop, yelled at the man who then ran away.</p>

<p>The second incident was also in South Ozone Park, at 5:50 p.m. Apparently the suspect approached a seven-year-old girl in her driveway (she had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035755/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pervert_earlier_attack_jvXt9sH3ulweqqoIR9lhFJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">gone to fetch her ball</a>) and, police say, &quot;performed a criminal sexual act on the female and then fled the location on foot.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released a sketch of the suspect from the first incident and video of the suspect after the second incident:</p>
