<p>After a six year absence, the W train is back and running today, with service between 6:30 a.m. and 11 p.m. on weekdays. Here&apos;s what it means for people who have been taking the N, R and Q trains:</p>

<p>- The <strong>W</strong> serves as a local train in Queens and Manhattan on weekdays, operating between Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard and Whitehall Street-South stations. </p>

<p>- The <strong>N</strong> will run express in Manhattan on weekdays and local during late nights and on weekends. It will stop at 49th Street at all times.</p>

<p>- The <strong>Q</strong> will only run in Manhattan and Brooklyn now, and service will be between 57th Street-7th Avenue and Coney Island. The Q will remain an express train in Manhattan, and if you want to get to Queens, take the N or W.</p>

<p>- The <strong>R</strong> will now also run in Manhattan during late night hours, with service after 11:30 p.m., between Bay Ridge-95 Street and Whitehall Street-South Ferry. </p>

<p>The MTA has a very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320080800/http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/nqrw/">handy map and infographic outlining the changes</a>, which are in place to get ready for the Second Avenue Subway&apos;s return. The W line was eliminated in 2010 during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320080800/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/mta_may_eliminate_w_train_among_oth.php">round of MTA &quot;doomsday&quot; cuts</a>, and MTA board member Andrew Albert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320080800/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/w_train_return.php">said earlier this year</a> that the W should be more fully restored, &quot;I will still put in a pitch for, during rush hour, extending the W down to say, a Bay Parkway terminus. Having the R the only train along local stations along 4th Avenue and rapidly developing areas of Southern Brooklyn is not enough.&quot;</p>
