</div></div>					<p>Jeremy Lin, whose last-minute heroics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303060552/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/last_nights_action_lin_outdoes_hims.php">completed the Knicks&apos; Linvasion of Toronto</a>, has stopped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303060552/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/before_yesterday_knicks_jeremy_lin.php">couchsurfing on his brother&apos;s and fellow Knicks&apos; furniture</a>: He is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303060552/http://www.nydailynews.com/real-estate/knicks-phenom-jeremy-lin-homeless-moving-a-swanky-bachelor-pad-white-plains-article-1.1022464">subletting former Knick David Lee&apos;s apartment at Trump Tower</a> in White Plains.  Hey, there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303060552/http://www.pfchangs.com/Locations/LocationDetail.aspx?sid=5500&amp;checked=1">P.F. Chang&apos;s in White Plains!</a></p>

<p>According to the Daily News, &quot;The Trump Tower in downtown White Plains, a 35-story building right off Main St. that&#x2019;s home to several other Knicks players and some New York Rangers as well. It&#x2019;s the same two-bedroom apartment that another Knicks star, Amar&#x2019;e Stoudemire, rented before he moved into his palatial pad in Manhattan, sources said... Experts estimated that Lin, who is 23 and single, will pay around $3,800 a month in rent. That&#x2019;s not chopped liver, but he should be able to afford it on his $800,000 salary.&quot; <br>
