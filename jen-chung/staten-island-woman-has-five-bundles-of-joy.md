The Staten Island Advance reports, &quot;The children -- in order of birth -- are: Allesia Louise, 2 pounds; Amanda Frances, 1 pound, 8 ounces; Emily Ann, 2 pounds, 1 ounce; Matthew Sabatino, 2 pounds, 4 1/2 ounces; and Ella Lilliana, 1 pound, 15 1/2 ounces.&quot;  Ferrante, who used fertility treatments and delivered by C-section, said, &quot;Once I&apos;d seen them in the neonatal nursery, that&apos;s when it was real, and it was like, &apos;Oh my God.&apos; I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do when I get home.&quot; But she added, &quot;In the beginning, we thought we were having four, and then they found another one, so we kind of laughed it off. What&apos;s one more?&quot; Her ecstatic dad said, &quot;<strong>I&apos;ve got eight grandchildren ... and in 10 minutes, I&apos;ve got 13 grandchildren. It&apos;s incredible.</strong> Now we need to try somehow to get them help. We need to call the Pampers people, or Gerber food, or something. I love it.&quot;</p>
