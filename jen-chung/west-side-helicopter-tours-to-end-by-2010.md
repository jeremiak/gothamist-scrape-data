The NY Times reports Air Pegasus will cut its tourist flights over the next two years, &quot;capped at 25,000 for the year that ends on May 31, 2009, then to 12,500 over the next 10 months, then halted completely.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, another &quot;disgruntled&quot; helicopter operator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150118/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/09/nyregion/09heliport.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">sued Air Pegasus and the Hudson River Park Trust</a>, claiming the heliport was not legal, because, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150118/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_251/heliportfloats.html">per the Villager,</a> &quot;state legislation...prohibits a heliport on park property east of the bulkhead, or shoreline.&quot;  The park&apos;s advocacy group, Friends of Hudson River Park, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150118/http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_243/editorial.html">demanded the heliport be shut down</a>, complaining about fumes and noise.  Adding to the controversy was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150118/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/08/tour_chopper_cr.php">crash/ &quot;emergency landing&quot; of a helicopter from Liberty Helicopter</a>, which operates out of the heliport, in the Hudson last July.</p>

<p>Air Pegasus has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150118/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_251/heliportfloats.html">proposed moving the heliport to a floating barge</a> nearby until a permanent space is found; the heliport will still operate a limited number of corporate and emergency flights.  The company is owned by Alvin S. Trenk (who also has a minority stake in Liberty) and his family, and the Times adds the decision to allow the Trenks (through another company called FirstFlight) operate the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150118/http://www.panynj.gov/COMMUTINGTRAVEL/airports/html/dmh.html">Downtown Manhattan Heliport</a> prompted &quot;two sightseeing helicopter companies [to appeal] to city officials to reconsider granting FirstFlight control of the downtown heliport because they do not want the Trenks to be their landlord.&quot;</p>
