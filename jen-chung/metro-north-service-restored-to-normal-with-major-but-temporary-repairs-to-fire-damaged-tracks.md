<p>After two weekdays of limited service, Metro-North commuters are enjoying regular weekday service this morning. This comes after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190223/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/17/2-alarm_fire_under_east_harlem_metr.php">four-alarm fire</a> damaged tracks at Park Avenue and East 119th Street. The MTA said, &quot;The railroad has completed major but temporary repairs to a small section of the railroad&#x2019;s Park Avenue Viaduct... The return to a full schedule was made possible by round-the-clock work on the part of dedicated employees who on Thursday safely completed the installation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190223/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/metronorth_2016_fire_update.php">six temporary steel columns</a> to brace a column damaged in Tuesday&#x2019;s fire.&quot;</p>

<p>There are, however, speed restrictions for trains traveling on the damaged area; the MTA has asked customers to be patient:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Customers traveling in/out of Grand Central Terminal should anticipate delays up to 10mins due to speed restrictions on the Park Ave Viaduct</p>&#x2014; Metro-North Railroad (@MetroNorth) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190223/https://twitter.com/MetroNorth/status/733632520953167872">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>The MTA tested trains on the tracks and determined the maximum speed to be 30 mph. Metro-North President Joseph Giuletti said, &quot;I would like to thank our customers for bearing with us during what has been a very challenging two-and-a-half-day period. I also thank all the employees who responded to this crisis starting the moment it was reported, and who will continue to respond to it in the weeks ahead as we build permanent repairs to the viaduct. </p>

<p>&quot;It took a team effort of enormous proportions to get this service back as quickly as we did and to manage limited service over the past two and a half days,&quot; Giuletti said, &quot;while dealing with reduced track capacity, and reduced fleet size and shorter trains on Wednesday that resulted when trains were blocked from leaving Grand Central on Tuesday evening.&quot;</p>

<p>The May 17th fire, which started at 6:42 p.m. during the evening rush hour, started at the Urban Garden Center, located right under the tracks. Over 150 firefighters were needed to get the blaze under control, and Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190223/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/18/metro-north_fire_update.php">noted how some of the Metro-North track girders were warped</a> by the &quot;tremendous heat.&quot; The FDNY determined that the fire was accidental, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190223/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/metronorth_2016_fire_update.php#photo-1">caused by the garden&apos;s employees refueling a hot generator</a>&#x2014;a no-no because generators should only be refueled when cool (fuel can ignite on a hot generator). It also turns that the garden did not have permits to handle or store flammable or combustible materials.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190223/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Metro-North-Tracks-Fire-Fueled-Wood-Fertilizer-East-Harlem-380029961.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;The Urban Garden Center was apparently storing firewood, plywood and what appear to be soil and fertilizer products underneath the tracks on Park Avenue in East Harlem. Piles of the charred material were being cleared away Wednesday, but photos taken last fall, found through a simple Google search, show the flammables stacked high on the lot there.&quot; </p>

<p>Glenn Corbett, a fire safety expert, told NBC New York that the city and MTA should have realized that there were flammable materials under the tracks, given that they were damaged  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190223/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/12/no_metro-north_service_in_and_out_o.php">during the 2014 East Harlem gas explosion</a>, &quot;It should have raised red flags a long time ago... The fact that we have a business operating under the bridge exposing people to the fire is unconscionable in my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>The Urban Garden Center is a tenant of La Marqueta, which is operated by the NYC Economic Development Corporation. Anthony Hogrebe, NYC EDC senior vice president of public affairs, said, &quot;NYCEDC is currently supporting FDNY in its investigation of the incident. All EDC tenants are required by lease to adhere to all relevant laws and regulations. If anything is found to have been in violation, we will take swift and appropriate action.&quot;</p>
