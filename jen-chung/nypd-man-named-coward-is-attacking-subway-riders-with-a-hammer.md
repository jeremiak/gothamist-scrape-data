And the cops say his name is Anthony Coward.</p>

<p>According to police, the first incident was on March 5 at 7 a.m., in front of 138-49 Pershing Crescent  in Queens. A 26-year-old woman (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515005513/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/09/hammer-wielding_robber_has_attacked.php">who is pregnant</a>) was approached from behind by a man who struck her on the head with a silver hammer. He fled with her purse while she was treated at Jamaica Hospital. The victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515005513/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hammer-Attacks-Subway-Stations-MetroCards-Riders-258523891.html">showed off her scars to NBC New York</a> and was stunned, &quot;I&apos;m 5&apos;1, 130 pounds...did you really have to hit me behind the head? Couldn&apos;t you just take the bag and run?&quot;</p>

<p>Then, a week ago at 11 a.m. on Sunday, May 4, police say that at a 23-year-old man in the Rockaway Avenue subway station in Brooklyn was attacked. In this incident, the victim was hit on the head with the hammer and then the attacker struck him with hammer all over his body. The suspect fled with the victim&apos;s wallet; the victim was treated at Brookdale Hospital.</p>

<p>Most recently, a 32-year-old man buying a MetroCard at the same Rockaway Avenue subway station was attacked by the hammer-wielding suspect who struck him on the back on his head. The suspect demanded his money, the victim complied. The victim, Richianand Brijanand, said, &quot;I guess he held it with two of his hands, because when I saw him with the hammer in hand, he held it with both hands.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that Coward is 28, 6&apos;1 and about 160 pounds and had black hair and brown eyes. Anyone with information regarding this robbery has been asked to contact the NYPD&#x2019;s Crime Stoppers hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com or by texting tips to 274637 [CRIMES] and entering TIP577.</p>
