<p>A charity hockey game between teams from the NYPD and FDNY devolved into a bench-clearing brawl yesterday, fueled by raucous crowd chants of &quot;Dunkin&apos; Donuts&quot; and &quot;PD Sucks.&quot;</p>

<p>The two teams were playing at the Nassau Coliseum, where tickets were going for $20. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530105345/http://nypost.com/2014/04/06/nypd-fdny-get-into-massive-brawl-at-charity-hockey-game/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;The brawl led to a 25-minute delay as equipment was picked up and refs made laundry lists of penalized and ejected players.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530105345/http://deadspin.com/fdny-nypd-charity-hockey-game-features-bench-clearing-b-1559517529">Deadspin declared</a> they were fighting like &quot;minor league goons&quot;:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530105345/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/66408/Went-to-a-fight-and-a-hockey-game-broke-out#.U0KYOq1dUrc">experts at NYPD Rant</a> are having a field day. Here are a few of their observations:</p>

<p><i>- &quot;I smell jam sammiches for a whole bunch of guys coming out of this. I hope not.&quot; </i></p>

<p><i>- &quot;Boys will be Boys.It&apos;s on the ice and it shouldn&apos;t go any further.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>- &quot;Agreed. I was there. The rest of the game was clean, we finally tightened up our defense and pulled it out. Think that last goal was an open-netter. Nothing happened that should concern anyone outside the teams themselves. Beautiful day, good tail-gating, put that one in the books.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>- &quot;It is a hockey game.  Fights happen.  Nobody is getting jammed up.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>- &quot;Whats embarrassing is that some doosh-nozzle sought fit to post the video. As far as the game, hard fought contest on both sides, emotions boiled over, it was rectified, it is done. Relax.&quot; </i></p>

<p>- And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530105345/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/66408/Went-to-a-fight-and-a-hockey-game-broke-out#.U0KYOq1dUrc">from Cosmo Kramer</a>, <i>&quot;I&apos;ll try my best to be smart on this one, especially because I was not there.. But there is a history of pd&apos; ALWAYS bashing fd either in the street or on the rant here mostly out of jealously.. Land pirate this and that, or complaining that they can theoretically get paid to sleep on duty, etc. sporting events in the past with us and them have also had their fair share of really visceral, unsportsmanlike comments coming from pd players or their fans while fd was just there to play a game and have a good time.. That&apos;s the past, just saying.. And it is pretty embarrassing for this story to get picked up nationally, especially since half of ny news coverage about nypd is usually negative to begin with.&quot;</i></p>
