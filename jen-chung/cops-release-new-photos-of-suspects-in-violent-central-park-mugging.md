<p>The police are still looking for two people who allegedly put a woman in a chokehold to steal her purse last week. </p>

<p>The NYPD release two new surveillance photos of the suspects in the subway system.

The female suspect then took the victim&apos;s handbag, and both suspects fled the scene.&quot; </p>
