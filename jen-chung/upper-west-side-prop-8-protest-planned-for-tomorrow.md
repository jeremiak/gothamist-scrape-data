And tomorrow evening, New Yorkers are planning a protest on the Upper West Side, outside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304095200/http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/manhattan/">Church of Latter Day Saints</a> at Columbus Avenue and West 65th.  (Details after the jump.)</p>

<p>Why the Church of Latter Day Saints?  A lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304095200/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/10/25/Mormons_scale_back_Prop_8_effort/UPI-11341224980973/">support</a> and funding for advertising to support Proposition 8 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304095200/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/27/BAP113OIRD.DTL">came from Mormons</a> whose support was gained after the Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco reached out to them.  Prop 8 opponents have staged protests at Mormon churches--there&apos;s even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304095200/http://sfist.com/2008/11/10/no_on_8_folks_this_isnt_necessary.php">&quot;F*** MORMONS&quot; sign in Noe Valley</a> in SF.  </p>

<p>There are also regrets from Prop 8 opponents for not doing more to explain Prop 8 is more than sexual orientation.  Mogul David Geffen, referring to how African-Americans voted 70% to ban gay marriage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304095200/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-11-11/hollywoodrsquos-race/">told the Daily Beast</a>, &quot;So many African Americans don&#x2019;t look at gay marriage as a civil rights issue. They look on it as a religious one. And we, for whatever reason&#x2026;fear? Arrogance? Complacency? We did not do enough outreach to them. <strong>We need to begin a dialogue with them, because we should be putting this back on the ballot every election every year until we win.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Last night, MSNBC&apos;s Keith Olbermann made a &quot;Special Comment&quot; on Prop 8, wondering why people supported Prop 8 and pointing out, &quot;I keep hearing this term &apos;re-defining&apos; marriage. If this country hadn&apos;t re-defined marriage, black people still couldn&apos;t marry white people. Sixteen states had laws on the books which made that illegal in 1967. 1967.&quot; Full transcript <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304095200/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27650743/">here</a> and video below:</p>

<p>On Sunday, Governor Schwarzenegger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304095200/http://laist.com/2008/11/10/schwarzenegger_wans_prop_8_overturn.php">said he wanted Prop 8 overturned</a>, telling the LA Times, &quot;I think that we will again maybe undo that, if the court is willing to do that, and then move forward from there and again lead in that area... I learned that you should never ever give up.&quot; </p>
