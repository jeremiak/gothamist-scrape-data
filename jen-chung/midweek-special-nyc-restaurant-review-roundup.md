The NY Times restaurant critic admires the former bodega decor, where the &quot;woodwork and pressed tin ceiling look like lovingly restored&quot; and its &quot;long, gorgeous mahogany bar,&quot; but ultimately offers one star: &quot;Rye needs to be more consistent... when Mr. Elliott hits his mark, the cooking appealingly complements that atmosphere. It&#x2019;s mostly a mix of bistro stalwarts and of-the-moment comfort foods like a side of macaroni and cheese, the non-slider sliders and the meatloaf sandwich, wet and wild enough to qualify as a sloppy Joe &#x2014; an enormous, fantastic one at that. The mix of meats in its crunchy embrace included beef, veal, duck and pork.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Gael Greene is back to reviewing restaurants for a publication: Her first review for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170828/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090614/FREE/306149977">Crain&apos;s New York is of Locanda Verde</a>, the Robert DeNiro-owned eatery located inside the former Ago in Tribeca. With chef <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170828/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/28/andrew_carmellini_and_gwen_hyman_au.php">Andrew Carmellini</a> at the helm, Greene swoons over the &quot;handmade farfalle&#x2014;pasta butterflies with clams, sweet pepper and chorizo,&quot; &quot;sensational garlic-roasted chicken for two turns out to be more than enough for four,&quot; and &quot;lamb meatball sliders with goat cheese.&quot; </p>

<p>The Village Voice&apos;s Robert Sietsema <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170828/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-06-17/restaurants/flushing-s-hunan-house-welcomes-you-to-mt-fish-head/">falls under the spell of Hunan House</a>, on Northern Boulevard in Flushing, suggesting, &quot;It may be the first authentic Hunan restaurant in town, though Manhattan places like Hunan Pan and Hunan Balcony have been fecklessly name-checking the province since the 1970s, while offering little that was identifiably Hunanese.&quot; Pickled peppers were a frequent component of dishes, such as the &quot;braised fish with pickled chile sauce&quot;: &quot;Dramatically, the head of the fish rose, nose-up, from the middle of the plate, like a volcanic atoll. Peeling the flesh off its cheeks, neck, and forehead, we confirmed that the head was the prize of the plate.&quot;</p>

<p>Flatiron District Mediterranean joint Aldea may not elaborately decorated, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170828/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/food/2009/06/16/2009-06-16_george_mendes_introduces_his_vibrant_mediterranean_style_to_the_flatiron_distric.html">Daily News&apos; Danyelle Freeman</a> enjoys the &quot;sophisticated and complex&quot; dishes like the &quot;wonderful riff on paella made with duck confit, rice, chorizo, black olives and crispy duck cracklin&apos;s&quot; and a &quot;cuttlefish a la plancha with coconut-curry foam, squid ink and herb pur&#xE9;e,&quot; which &quot;comes alive in a playground of harmonious flavors.&quot; However, the bacalao was a disappointment.</p>

<p>And the even more modestly appointed Katsuno (&quot;all the atmosphere of your therapist&#x2019;s waiting room&quot;) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170828/http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/restaurants-bars/75262/katsuno-forrest-hills-restaurant-review">wins praise from Time Out New York</a>: &quot;Katsuyuki Seo (who also operates Seo in midtown) has clearly funneled his energy into where it ought to be: the kitchen. There, he conjures some of borough&#x2019;s most impressive, finely wrought Japanese cuisine&#x2014;authentic, modern preparations he honed working in the kitchens of Tokyo.&quot; For instance, one standout dish at the Forest Hills restaurant was a &quot;a pristine appetizer offered a refreshing tangle of yuzu-drizzled greens topped with thick folds of raw salmon, capers and sprigs of dill; on the side were generous mounds of golden uni balanced on sturdy, pleasingly bitter petals of endive.&quot;</p>
