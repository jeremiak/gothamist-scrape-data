<p>Over the past few years, erosion has left Field 5 in sad shape.  Ronald Foley, of the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said, &quot;The majority of the beach is submerged at high tide.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604155528/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/25/with-beach-erosion-a-problem-officials-hope-to-fully-reopen-l-i-beach-by-july-4/">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The beach looks pretty decent at times, but at high tide, the high water mark is just 10 steps from the boardwalk.&quot;</p>

<p>While in previous years, they would replenish sand from a stockpile, but ever since Army Corps of Engineers stopped dredging the Fire Island inlet, sand hasn&apos;t been replenished. The Army Corps of Engineers told WCBS 2, &quot;We don&#x2019;t have any current plans for dredging the inlet because we&#x2019;re still waiting for funding from Congress.&#x201D; Good luck! </p>

<p>Field 5 is open, but it&apos;s limited to visitors (there&apos;s only half the usual parking), so go there early. Many beachgoers are finding it too crowded.  Field 4 has an erosion problem, too, but its parking hasn&apos;t been limited yet. </p>

<p>State Parks officials hope the beach can be fully reopened by July 4.</p>
