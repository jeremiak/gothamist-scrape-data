<p>A NJ middle school principal&apos;s decision to ban strapless dresses from an upcoming dance has seriously pissed off parents, many of whom have already bought stupid dresses (and probably cut the tags off!) for their daughters. So it looks like there&apos;s going to be a show-down at tonight&apos;s school board hearing in Readington Township.</p>

<p>Principal Sharon Moffat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061908/http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2013/04/post_819.html">told eighth graders&apos; parents</a>, &#x201C;Young gentlemen are encouraged to wear collared shirts and trousers; many boys wear ties or jackets. Young ladies should wear a skirt, dress with straps, or dressy pants outfit. Jeans or sneakers are not appropriate for this event.&quot; While Moffat apparently told parents that the strapless attire was distracting for boys, this sounds suspiciously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061908/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/25/stuyvesant_basically_tells_female_s.php">like slut-shaming</a>.</p>

<p>Mother Charlotte Nijenhuis is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061908/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130422/NJNEWS/304220047/Readington-middle-school-dance-dress-code-girls-upsets-some-parents?nclick_check=1">opposed to what she calls an arbitrary ban</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m objecting to the fact that government can come in and change the rules without asking parents. That&#x2019;s an abuse of authority.&quot; She sent a three-page letter to the superintendent, who said that Moffat was within her rights to ban the clothing:</p><blockquote>Ms. Moffat has stated that such dresses &#x2018;distract boys&#x2019; and are &#x2018;inappropriate&#x2019; for young girls. As a parent, she is free to dictate the attire of her children, but as a principal of a public school and representative of all of the residents of Readington, she ought to not unilaterally dictate what our children may or may not wear....<p></p>

<p>Ms. Moffat&#x2019;s comment about &#x2018;distraction&#x2019; to the boys is particularly offensive because it suggests that boys are not able to control &#x2014; or ought not to be required to control &#x2014; their behavior when in the presence of girls wearing strapless dresses...</p>

<p>It is neither a woman&#x2019;s nor a girl&#x2019;s responsibility to control a man&#x2019;s or boy&#x2019;s behavior.</p></blockquote>Further, the formal is being held at a private venue (not the school) called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061908/http://www.razberrys.net/">Razberry&apos;s</a> and the parents have paid for it! <p></p>

<p>Another mother told MyCentralJersey, &quot;As parents, we should have the ability to say what our children wear.&#x201D; In reality, if you go into a store trying to purchase anything in a junior section... <strong>You can&#x2019;t buy a pair of shorts for a young girl that goes mid-thigh.</strong>&quot; </p>
