										<p>During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021815/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/debate_takeaways.php">Monday night&apos;s feisty presidential debate</a>, Hillary Clinton brought up Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021815/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/mr_misogyny.php">demeaning treatment of Miss Universe Alicia Machado</a>, who Trump had previously insulted for gaining weight. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021815/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-2016-10-10?mbid=social_twitter">The New Yorker has taken it as inspiration</a> for next week&apos;s cover:</p>

<p>New Yorker art editor  Fran&#xE7;oise Mouly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021815/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-2016-10-10?mbid=social_twitter">writes</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;She was the worst we ever had, the worst, the absolute worst, she was impossible,&#x201D; Donald Trump told Fox News the morning after his debate with Hillary Clinton, defending his treatment of Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe whom he called &#x201C;Miss Piggy,&#x201D; when she gained weight after the pageant, and &#x201C;Miss Housekeeping,&#x201D; in apparent reference to her heritage. Watching the debate, the artist Barry Blitt recognized a significant moment in the Presidential campaign. Of all Trump&#x2019;s dangerous beliefs, Blitt said, his misogyny &#x201C;might just be his Achilles&#x2019; heel.&#x201D;</blockquote>And here&apos;s a video of Machado that the Clinton campaign put together:<p></p>

<p>A female Republican strategist who is not supporting Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021815/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/us/politics/alicia-machado-presidential-race.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;It was a golden opportunity for the Clinton campaign. It&#x2019;s every woman&#x2019;s worst nightmare, but it also speaks beyond just women, to Latinos.&quot;</p>

<p>The cover, however, isn&apos;t a hit with everyone.</p>
