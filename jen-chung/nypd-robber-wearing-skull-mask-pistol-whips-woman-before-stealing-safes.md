<p>A man wearing a skull mask terrorized a Bronx woman in her home last night, pistol-whipping her and stealing two safes, police say.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 8 p.m. on December 28th. A 43-year-old woman was at her apartment on Pilot Street, &quot;when her door-buzzer rang and someone stated she had to come downstairs to sign for a package,&quot; according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>She went downstairs and didn&apos;t see anyone, so she returned her apartment, where police say she found a stranger, in a skull-mask, &quot;standing in the foyer displaying a silver and black firearm&quot; who then grabbed her by the hair and &quot;dragged her into the bedroom,&quot; where he pistol-whipped her. </p>

<p>The suspect allegedly took a small safe from the bedroom and then dragged her by the hair to a different bedroom, where he took another safe. The NYPD says, &quot;He told the victim to lay on the ground until he left. She stayed on the ground and he left to parts unknown. The stolen safes contained cash and personal documents.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released surveillance footage of the suspect who was wearing dark blue jeans, black and white sneakers, black hooded sweatshirt and a black-and-white skull ski-mask.</p>
