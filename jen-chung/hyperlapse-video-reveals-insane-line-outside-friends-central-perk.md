But who really knew until now? Luckily, there&apos;s a hyperlapse documenting the extent of the madness.</p>

<p>The pop-up, located at 199 Lafayette Street in Soho, is to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the popular TV sitcom. </p>

<p>Last night, there was a special party to kick-off Central Perk&apos;s month-long residency. The Rembrandts were there:</p>

<p>So was Gunther (James Michael Tyler), who sang &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;:</p>

<p>David Mazouz, who plays a young Bruce Wayne in the new Fox series, <em>Gotham</em>, was there last night, too:</p>

<p>We&apos;ve done the math: David, who is 13, is younger than Ross&apos;s son Ben Geller-Willick and Phoebe&apos;s nieces, Leslie and Chandler Buffay, and nephew, Frank Buffay Jr. Jr. But David is older than Emma Geller-Green, so maybe they can date in any future <em>Friends</em> movie.</p>
