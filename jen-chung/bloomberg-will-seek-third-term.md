<p>It&apos;s happening:  Mayor Michael Bloomberg will reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528225404/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/nyregion/01bloomberg.html">announce that he will seek a third term</a> on Thursday.  The NY Times writes, &quot;<b>The extraordinary move promises to upend New York City&#x2019;s political world.</b>.&quot;</p>

<p>Three people tell the Times that the billionaire mayor will &quot;propose trying to revise the city&#x2019;s 15-year-old term limits law, which would otherwise force him and dozens of other elected leaders out of office in 2009.&quot;  And he will use the financial crisis as a reason for why he should be in office for four more years.  </p>

<p>This comes after the NY Post reported today that Ronald Lauder, another billionaire who spent millions on voter referendums to introduce two-term limits for city lawmakers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528225404/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/30/term_limits_proponent_blesses_third.php">supported the idea of Bloomberg pursuing a third term</a> in these difficult times, &quot;To me, Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s brilliance in the financial sector, particularly Wall Street, would be invaluable.&quot;  It&apos;s believed that the City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528225404/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/30/bloomberg_and_council_play_chicken.php">would pass legislation to overturn term limits</a> in this instance.</p>

<p>City Comptroller Bill Thompson, who has been eying a mayoral run next year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528225404/http://www.wcbs880.com/Reports--Bloomberg-to-Seek-Third-Term/3058115">told WCBS 880</a>, &quot;I will be very disappointed if the Mayor attempts to do this to the legislation of the City Council.  <strong>He will undermine the will of the voters, who under two occasions have said they believe in term limits. Any change to that law should go back to the public.</strong>&quot;</p>
