<p>It felt like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160720/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/it_officially_feels_like_105_degree.php">105 degrees yesterday</a>, and naturally that meant New Yorkers were left with two options: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160720/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/fire_hydrants.php">Opening up fire hydrants</a> and/or cranking the air conditioning. And it looks New Yorkers didn&apos;t hold back on the A.C.&#x2014;yesterday was an all-time record for Sunday electricity use!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160720/http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20130707.asp">According to Con Ed</a>, &quot;Con Edison&#x2019;s overall electric use peaked at 11,241 megawatts (MW) at 6 p.m. today, eclipsing the all-time Sunday record of 10,866 MW on August 14, 2005. The all-time peak record is 13,189 MW, which occurred on July 22, 2011 at 4 pm.&quot; The utility adds, &quot;The company continued to urge customers to use energy wisely while keeping cool as New Yorkers in the city&#x2019;s five boroughs and Westchester cope with sizzling heat and stifling humidity,&quot; and offered some tips to conserve energy like &quot;Keep shades, blinds and curtains closed. About 40 percent of unwanted heat comes through windows&quot; and &quot;Try using fans instead of air conditioners, but leave your windows open for ventilation. Fans use as little as one-tenth the energy as air conditioners.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, and Con Ed urges customers to &quot;Set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees. Each degree lower increases cooling costs by 6 percent.&quot; But won&apos;t refreshingly sub-78 degree apartment be worth it now that you know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160720/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/air_conditioner.php">how to split the A/C bill</a>?</p>
