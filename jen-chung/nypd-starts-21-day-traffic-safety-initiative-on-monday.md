<p>After a series of two-day and week-long crackdowns on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021212/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/heads_up_assholes_nypd_cracks_down.php">distracted driving</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021212/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/20/watch_out_leadfoot_nypd_starts_2-da.php">speeding</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021212/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/26/nypd_starts_new_week-long_traffic_s.php">general hazardous driving</a>, now the NYPD has announced its longest traffic crackdown.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, for the next 21 days, starting Monday, June 16, and ending Sunday, July 6, the police department &quot;will focus on hazardous driving behaviors such as speeding, passing through red lights, driving while using a cellphone, driving while texting, making improper turns, disobeying traffic signs, and failing to yield to pedestrians.&quot; P.S.&#x2014;the NYPD doesn&apos;t like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021212/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/15/two_cyclists_arrested_for_public_le.php">nakedness during bike rides either</a>.</p>

<p>Further, the NYPD says, &quot;The traffic safety operation will focus on the most problematic intersections around the city and take place during all hours of the day.&quot; Which means we expect increased police presence on Delancey Street and Queens Boulevard, among MANY OTHERS intersections.</p>
