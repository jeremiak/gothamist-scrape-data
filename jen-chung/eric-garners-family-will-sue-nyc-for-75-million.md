<p>The family of the Staten Island man who died <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">during a police chokehold</a> intends to sue NYC for $75 million. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/10/8554108/garner-family-seeks-75m-questions-broken-windows">Capital New York reports</a> that Eric Garner&apos;s family filed a notice of claim, &quot;In the notice, filed Oct. 6, lawyers for the Garner family say police officers involved in the July 17 incident &apos;failed to use proper police procedure and tactics as reasonably prudent and careful police officers would have used under similar circumstances.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/073314garner.jpg"> <img alt="073314garner.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2014/07/073314garner-thumb-640x505-851986.jpg" width="280" height="220" class="image-right"> </a> </span>Garner, 43, died in July while police officers tried to arrest him (cops claim he was selling untaxed cigarettes while witnesses say he was just breaking up a fight), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">a shocking video shows</a> Garner arguing with the police moments before his death: &quot;I was just minding my own business. Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I&#x2019;m tired of it. It stops today!&quot; When a number of cops try to subdue him, Garner, who weighed 400 pounds, is seen swatting their hands away and saying, &quot;Don&#x2019;t touch me, please.&quot;</p>

<p>As Officer Daniel Pantaleo puts him in a chokehold, other officers struggle to pull him to the ground and get his arms behind his back. Garner, an asthmatic, can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe.&quot; He was later pronounced dead at Richmond University Medical Center, and the first police report didn&apos;t even mention the chokehold. Pantaleo, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/21/cop_who_put_eric_garner_in_chokehol.php">sued twice for civil rights violations</a>, was stripped of his badge and gun while Officer Justin Damico was placed on modified duty. Garner&apos;s death <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/eric_garners_death_ruled_a_homicide.php">was ruled a homicide</a>.</p>

<p>Capital New York notes, &quot;The claim also states that the city and the New York Police Department &#x201C;continued to improperly supervise officers in the field,&quot; with the claim calling out &quot;broken windows... The incident herein may have a direct relationship and/or may have been caused by the &apos;broken windows&apos; policing being implemented and utilized&quot; by NYC and the police force. Bratton, who supports &quot;broken windows&quot; policing, had said that it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/de_blasio_eric_garner.php">appeared Garner died of a chokehold</a>, which is prohibited by the NYPD.</p>

<p>The comptroller&apos;s office confirmed it received the claim and that it was reviewing it. After Garner&apos;s death was ruled a homicide, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012908/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/eric_garners_death_ruled_a_homicide.php">Mayor de Blasio said</a>, &quot;My administration will continue to work with all involved authorities, including the Richmond County District Attorney, to ensure a fair and justified outcome.&quot;</p>
