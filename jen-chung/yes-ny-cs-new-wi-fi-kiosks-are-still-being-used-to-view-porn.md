title: Yes, NYC's New WiFi Kiosks Are Still Being Used To View Porn

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_07_linknyc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_07_linknyc.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> One of the kiosks (LinkNYC)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The new WiFi kiosks dotting various city sidewalks have been touted for unleashing the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/05/linknyc_wifi_2_fast_2_furious.php">fastest Internet you&apos;ve ever used</a>&quot; on New Yorkers. While we had difficulty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/nyc_free_wifi_test.php">downloading a video from Dropbox</a>, others have been able to clearly stream porn&#x2014;and pleasure themselves in the meantime. </p>

<p>Last month, the Post reminded everyone complaining that Times Square was too clean that maybe, just maybe, the bad old days are back, with a story about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017/http://nypost.com/2016/06/19/horny-homeless-men-use-times-square-wi-fi-to-watch-porn/">&quot;horny homeless men&quot; using a kiosk in Times Square</a> to watch porn (there&apos;s a tablet on the kiosk). Kiosk operator LinkNYC responded to the spate of public masturbation by adding a filtering system, which a spokesperson to described to the Post as a &quot;highly regarded content monitoring system used by thousands of public schools and libraries across the country.&quot; The spokesperson also said LinkNYC had recently added an image search filter. </p>

<p>One disappointed LinkNYC user confirmed the change, &quot;I was watching porn on one of them things on, like, Saturday.... Then on, like, Monday or Tuesday, all of a sudden I couldn&#x2019;t... Once word got around, it stopped. It sucks, man. It was great.&quot;</p>

<p>But don&apos;t worry&#x2014;while your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/miners_meet_data.php">LinkNYC activity will likely be added</a> to the NYPD&apos;s magical, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdjf4lMmiiI"><em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>-like trove</a> of flotsam and jetsam (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/banksy_balloon_being_processed_as_a.php">that Banksy balloon has gotta be there</a>)&#x2014;some other enterprising connoisseurs of &quot;Internet porn in public&quot; have apparently found a loophole. Reader Matthew reported, &quot;I was walking down Park Ave and I noticed the screens on those new WiFi Hubs being used to watch porn by two homeless men. They stood there and were jerking off around it.&quot; He captured the moment on video:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fc300eGHvhI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>&quot;I was both amused and disturbed,&quot; he admitted. &quot;In a city where nothing surprises, this certainly did. Especially because it was before midnight. However, after laughing the situation off, it&apos;s a bit unsettling that this type of material can be accessed so easily. Which makes me concerned about the safety of others and the sterility of the sidewalks.&quot;</p>

<p>While it&apos;s great that the city now has hotter-than-Hades Internet speed and is offering free access for email, users need to follow basic Internet etiquette. (I.e., no jerking off.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051017/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/25/pokemon_go_fort_greene_ticket.php">We&apos;ll have to see how the NYPD feels</a> when you&apos;re charging your phone for Pokemon Go:</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: A LinkNYC spokesperson tells us, &quot;While no content filtering system can ever be perfect, we are constantly monitoring and updating LinkNYC to block inappropriate content on the tablets, and we are looking into this incident.&quot;<br>
