<p>A four-alarm fire ripped through several Union City, NJ buildings yesterday morning at 11 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165248/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/four_alarm_fire_explosions_rocks_tpFnneCHJb1PC9N9C2EnGN">One resident said</a>, &quot;People were all over the streets. The black smoke was hitting all the buildings. Tires were popping, tanks exploded, and the gas lines went.&quot;  And Jersey City Assistant Fire Director Armando Roman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165248/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/04/union_city_fire_guts_apartment.html">said</a>, &#x201C;When I got there, the three story wood-frame building was almost demolished. Fully involved, fully involved. I haven&#x2019;t seen a fire like that in a while. It just completely destroyed the building.&#x201D;</p>

<p>One person whose Toyota Camry was destroyed told the Post, &quot;I watched as the third floor collapsed on my car. I just sat there thinking, &#x2018;Oh, my God.&#x2019; Thank God I&apos;m insured.&quot; The fire was under control by 1:30 p.m. and fire officials are still trying to determine the cause of the blaze. Some firefighters suffered minor injuries and 50 residents are homeless.  </p>

<p>The thick, black smoke could even be seen from New York City, prompting the NYC Office of Emergency Management to tell residents, &quot;Due to a large fire in Union City, New Jersey, Manhattan residents may see or smell smoke in the area.&quot;</p>
