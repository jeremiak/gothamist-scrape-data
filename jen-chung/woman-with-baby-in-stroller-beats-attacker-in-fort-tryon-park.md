<p>A woman jogging&#x2014;and pushing her eight-month-old baby in a stroller&#x2014;was attacked in Fort Tryon  Park earlier today. Fortunately, she was able to fight off the man by beating him with a bike pump.</p>

<p>Just after 9 a.m., Mary Jane Jarman, 33, was in Fort Tryon Park, near the Henry Hudson Parkway and 190th Street, when a man attacked her with a broken bottle. Jarman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930164705/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130927/washington-heights/mom-jogging-with-baby-stroller-fights-off-attacker-with-bike-pump#slideshow_modal_slot_1">told DNAinfo</a> that the man was saying, &quot;Come here, come here,&quot; but she ran and made &quot;it about 100 yards down the path before he grabbed her in a bear hug and took her down to the ground, knocking over the stroller in the process.&quot;</p>

<p>He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930164705/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2013/09/mother-attacked-in-fort-tyon-park.html">apparently put her in a headlock</a> but during the struggle, Jarman managed to reach for her bicycle pump, which was attached to the stroller, and beat him on the head with it. The suspect, who was bleeding, fled but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930164705/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9264771">left his hat and sunglasses</a>.</p>

<p>Police describe the attacker as being 25-30 years old, 5&apos;9&quot; and 160 pounds, and wearing a blue thermal shirt and blue jeans. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
