David Kellerman had been with the mortgage giant for 16 years and was made acting CFO last September, when the company, troubled by its subprime mortgages, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122818/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/08/world_markets_happy_about_fannie_ma.php">taken over by the U.S. Treasury</a>.  While Kellerman&apos;s wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122818/http://www.cnbc.com/id/30344311">reportedly called about an apparent suicide</a>, authorities say they are still investigating the incident and that the final determination about whether this was a suicide will come from the medical examiner.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122818/http://www.wtop.com/?nid=25&amp;sid=1657033">WTOP Radio says</a> that Freddie Mac has no comment at this time.  </p>
