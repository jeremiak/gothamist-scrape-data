<p>After weeks of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162417/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/report_tonight_show_headed_back_to.php">basically confirmed rumors</a>, NBC is set to reveal its latest worst-kept secret: Jimmy Fallon will take over the Tonight Show and the show will move to New York from Los Angeles. The NY Times reports, &quot;NBC plans to announce on Wednesday its plan to install Mr. Fallon as the show&#x2019;s sixth host at the conclusion of the network&#x2019;s coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics from Sochi, Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>While the whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162417/http://laist.com/2010/01/10/nbc_confirms_lenos_primetime_run_en.php">Jay Leno-in-primetime</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162417/http://laist.com/2010/01/07/oh_wait_maybe_jay_leno_will_replace.php">Conan O&apos;Brien debacle</a> is fresh in everyone&apos;s memory, the NY Times reports that Jay Leno is cool about all this. Leno said in an interview, &quot;The main difference between this and the other time is I&#x2019;m part of the process. The last time the decision was made without me. I came into work one day and &#x2014; you&#x2019;re out.&#x201D; This time around &#x201C;there really aren&#x2019;t any complications like there were the last time... This time it feels right.&quot;</p>

<p>Um, in 2004, after Conan O&apos;Brien was announced as Leno&apos;s successor in 2009, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162417/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html?_r=1&amp;">Leno said</a>, &quot;When I signed my new contract, I felt that the timing was right to plan for my successor, and there is no one more qualified than Conan. Plus, I promised my wife Mavis I would take her out for dinner before I turned 60.&quot; But Leno <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162417/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/02/video_jay_leno_jimmy_fallon_sing_du.php">never sang a duet with Conan</a>!</p>

<p>Anyway, according to the Times, NBCUniversal President Steve Burke reached out to Leno to make sure he felt okay with everything. Burke said, &#x201C;Clearly our goal has been to make this a smooth transition. Jay deserves to be treated like someone who has done a wonderful thing for our company for two decades.&quot; And Leno says he suggested that Fallon&apos;s first Tonight Show be after the Winter Olympics, &quot;If we really want to give him a good send-off, how about after the Olympics?... I&#x2019;ve kept it No. 1 one for about 90 percent of my term here, and I would like to see Jimmy keep it at No. 1, which I&#x2019;m sure he will.&quot;</p>

<p>Fallon insisted he wasn&apos;t involved in the transition plan, &quot;I just kind of wanted to keep doing my job well,&quot; and added that he has &quot;nothing but respect for Jay. If it weren&#x2019;t for him, I wouldn&#x2019;t have a show to be taking over.&quot;</p>

<p>Leno claims he&apos;ll just be on the road for stand-up comedy and not back on television, &quot;I&#x2019;ve done this job for a long time and I really enjoy it. Would I do it again? Believe me, the phone&#x2019;s not ringing off the hook. It will be nice if people seem interested. But I&#x2019;ll let it sit where it is.&quot;<br>
