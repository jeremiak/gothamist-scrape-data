<p>The Royal Baby Bump Watch all over again: Duchess of Cambridge Catherine, a.k.a. Kate Middleton to us commoners, is pregnant again. </p>

<p>Her first pregnancy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013857/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/03/royal_bun_in_the_oven_duchess_of_ca.php">announced in 2012</a>, sent much of Britain (and all of the paparazzi) into a frenzy. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013857/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/royal_baby_emerges_nameless_prince.php">birth of Prince George</a> also created much good will for the royal family, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013857/http://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/484893/Proof-our-sovereign-really-is-worth-her-weight-in-gold">cost British taxpayers about $58 million last year</a>.</p>

<p>The official statement said:</p><blockquote>Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their second child.<p></p>

<p>The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news.</p>

<p>As with her first pregnancy, The Duchess is suffering from Hyperemesis Gravidarum. Her Royal Highness will no longer accompany The Duke of Cambridge on their planned engagement in Oxford today. The Duchess of Cambridge is being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013857/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2747642/BREAKING-NEWS-Duchess-Cambridge-pregnant-second-child.html">The Daily Mail claims</a>, &quot;The couple only found out very recently. The Duchess has not even reached the crucial 12-week stage.&quot; Radio stations, <em>please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013857/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/after_falling_for_radio_dj_prank_ka.php">do not prank call the hospital</a> when Kate goes into labor, okay?<p></p>
