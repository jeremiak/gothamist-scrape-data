<p>A trio of women beat up another woman for her cellphone last week, and police are still searching for the perpetrators. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, it happened last Tuesday in a park (probably the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015646/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/morrisgarden/">Morris Garden</a>) at East 181st Street and Morris Avenue in the Bronx.  Just after 6 p.m., police say  three women &quot;acting in concert, repeatedly punched and assaulted&quot; a 26-year-old woman with a stick before fleeing with her phone. The victim had numerous injuries.</p>

<p>The first suspect is described as a teenager approximately 5&apos;2&quot;, 90 lbs., with long brown hair, and was wearing a brown tank top and black pants (who seems to be carrying a child). The second suspect is described as another teenager, approximately 100 lbs., with brown hair, and was wearing a sleeveless pink button-down shirt and black pants. The third suspect is described as a woman in her 30s, approximately 5&apos;4&quot;, 220 lbs., with brown hair in a pony-tail, and was wearing a red t-shirt and black pants.</p>
