</div></div><p>After years of work, the Theater Development Fund unveiled the new TKTS Discount Booth in the heart of Times Square yesterday.  A glowing red glass amphitheater-style staircase, designed by  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063321/http://www.vanalen.org/html/04_1999_TKTS2K.php">John Choi and Tai Ropiha</a>, is the centerpiece of Father Duffy Square (Broadway &amp; 47th Street).</p>

<p>The rest of the structure is a fiberglass shell; the ticket booths, which are under the stairs, now take credit cards.  There&apos;s also one booth for plays only, &quot;where there is rarely a wait for tickets to non-musical productions.&quot; As has been widely reported over its nine years of construction, the project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063321/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/nyregion/17tkts.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">wound up costing eight times more</a> than initially thought.  But it has silver linings: Not only does it give people a chance to buy theater tickets at 50% off but also allows them an amazing view of Times Square from the top of the steps&#x2014;16-feet above street level&#x2014;for free. </p>

<p>The NY Times describes it as &quot;<strong>a kinetic panorama: the perfect picture-postcard angle on the colossal sluice of entertainment, commerce and humanity that has bedazzled Americans and bemused foreign visitors for more than a century.</strong>&quot;  And the NY Post, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063321/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10172008/news/regionalnews/a_boffo_revival_134007.htm">which calls it a &quot;Boffo Revival,&quot;</a> has this quote from the Times Square Alliance&apos;s Tim Tompkins: &quot;New Yorkers are always trying to get somewhere and you see the tourists standing around.  Now there is someplace to stop and have a look at the other great show - Broadway and Times Square.&quot;</p>

<p><i>TKTS Times Square booths are open: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 3pm to 8pm for evening performances, Tuesdays from 2pm to 8pm for evening performances; Wednesday and Saturday from 10am to 2pm for matinee performances; and Sunday from 11 to 3pm for matinee performances and 3pm to 7pm for evening performances. There are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063321/http://www.tdf.org/TDF_ServicePage.aspx?id=56">TKTS booth locations</a> in the South Street Seaport and downtown Brooklyn.</i></p>
