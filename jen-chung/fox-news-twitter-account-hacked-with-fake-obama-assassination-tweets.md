The President is dead. A sad 4th of July, indeed. President Barack Obama is dead,&quot; and that he was &quot;shot twice in the lower pelvic area and in the neck; shooter unknown. Bled out.&quot;</p>

<p>A group called The Script Kiddies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153513/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14012294">claimed responsibility for the Tweets</a>; the Twitter account for The Script Kiddies was suspended. Fox&apos;s politics account has nearly 35,000 followers. The Daily News reports, &quot;In an interview with Stony Brook Magazine&apos;s Think magazine, a person claiming to be a part of the organization said the group had close ties to the infamous hacking clan Anonymous.&quot;</p>

<p>Fox News apologized for the hack and &quot;any distress the false tweets may have created&quot; and said it was investigating. <b>Update</b>: According to Fox News, it took hours for the Tweets to be deleted because they were waiting for Twitter to suspend the account first.  Jeff Misenti, vice president and general manager of Fox News Digital, said, &quot;We will be requesting a detailed investigation from Twitter about how this occurred, and measures to prevent future unauthorized access into FoxNews.com accounts.&quot;</p>
