<p>Though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508210734/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/17/rent-stabilized_tenants_score_lowes.php">many people, including Mayor de Blasio</a>, had been pushing for a rent freeze, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508210734/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/24/despicable_rent_increases_caused_by.php">Rent Guidelines Board decided on increases</a> of 1% for one-year leases and 2.75% for two-year leases. While these are the lowest increases ever for the board, which regulates about 1 million rent-stabilized apartments in NYC, many were upset. <em>[Read our coverage of the meeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508210734/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/24/despicable_rent_increases_caused_by.php">here.</a>]</em></p>

<p>The vote was 5-4 in favor of the low increases; six of the members of the board were appointed by de Blasio. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508210734/http://nypost.com/2014/06/24/rent-guidelines-board-enacts-nycs-lowest-ever-rent-hike/">Post reports</a>, &quot;The slight increases were proposed by RGB member Steven Flax, a de&#x2009;Blasio appointee who is vice president for community development at M&amp;T; Bank. &apos;It costs money to run buildings and I do believe that my proposal is sincerely a historic change,&apos; Flax said at a raucous meeting at Cooper Union in the East Village. He conceded, &apos;It is not a political win for the mayor.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The hikes start October 1. And, FWIW, last year the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508210734/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/21/rent_is_too_damn_high_rent-stabiliz.php">board voted on increases</a> of 4% for one-year leases and 7.75% for two-year leases, the highest in five years. </p>
