Now Eshaghoff is going public, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104800/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57349991/college-test-scammer-says-he-saved-lives/?tag=contentMain;cbsCarousel">telling 60 Minutes he was just being a good guy</a>, &quot;A kid who has a horrible grade-point average, who, no matter how much he studies is going to totally bomb this test. By giving him an amazing score, I totally give him...a new lease on life. He&apos;s going to go to a totally new college...be bound for a totally new career...new path in life.&quot;  So they could then drop out of college?</p>

<p>Eshaghoff took tests for a number of students (including a girl with a gender neutral name), scoring between 2170 and 2220.  The Emory University sophomore says the scam started when someone told him, &quot;Yo, you&apos;re good on your SATs and I&apos;m not. And you know this is possible. How much is it going to take?&quot;  As for criticism that the cheating meant other students who were honest and got crappy SATs scores on their own were punished by the fakery, he said, &quot;[My clients] really [weren&apos;t] displacing somebody...I feel confident defending the fact that [my clients] getting into the schools that they ended up getting into didn&apos;t really affect other people.&quot;</p>

<p>A plea deal will allow Eshaghoff to avoid jail time and tutor low-income students on their standardized test-taking. </p>
