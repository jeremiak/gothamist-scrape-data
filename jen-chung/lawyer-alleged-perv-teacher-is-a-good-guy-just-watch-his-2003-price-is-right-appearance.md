										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_04_rhovenprice.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034825im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_rhovenprice.jpg" width="400" height="249" class="image-left"> </span>The former private school teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034825/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/17/ex-private_school_teacher_accused_o.php">charged with criminal sex act and endangering the welfare of a child</a> for allegedly having oral sex with a 16-year-old student twice was defended by his lawyer (of course) and, more interestingly, by the sister of his ex-fiancee.  Richard Hovan&apos;s ex-fiancee was the one who called police after discovering Hovan was allegedly having sex with the teen.</p>

<p>Hovan, 30, who went to MIT for undergrad and Columbia for his master&apos;s in teaching, had worked at Riverdale Country School when allegations about an inappropriate relationship with a student surfaced.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034825/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/prep_teacher_in_sex_shock_8NgX4pnxxDIfaIkHRj82SI">According to the Post&apos;s sources</a>, Hovan&apos;s then-fiancee, Marina Bontkowski, found out and called the police on him.  (The private school says it heard allegations and contacted the authorities, too.)  But Bontkowski&apos;s sister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034825/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/the_vice_is_right_fLJblxnLwkpb7GgXshT5TM">told the Post yesterday</a>, &quot;He&#x2019;s a good guy who got caught up in a bad situation. He was just helping a girl out with personal issues, and it got out of hand.&quot;</p>

<p>His lawyer, Vinoo Varghese, also agrees that his client is a good guy, pointing to Hovan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034825/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLvxDYtndqk&amp;feature=youtu.be">2003 appearance on the Price is Right</a> as evidence (Hovan, at MIT at the time, is happy and giggling): &quot;You can see his genuine nature here.&quot; Varghese adds, &quot;He is an outstanding human being, and he has been wrongly charged. As teachers go, [he] is as good as it gets.&quot;  </p>

<p>Before roadtripping to The Price is Right, Hovan and other MIT students had<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034825/http://tech.mit.edu/V122/N65/65price.65n.html"> studied prices of common items featured on the show</a> to prepare to win big.  Hovan was actually called down and won three vacations and a dinette set; he said Bob Barker was &quot;really nice.&quot; </p>
