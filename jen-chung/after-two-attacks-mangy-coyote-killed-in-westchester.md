The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195937/http://www.lohud.com/article/20100907/NEWS02/9070330/Coyote-killed-in-Rye-Brook-after-series-of-attacks">Journal News reports</a>, &quot;He and trappers witnessed the sickly creature turn on its own pup and bite its head off.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The coyote had lunged at a trapper, who had been following it; Jim Horton told the Journal NEs, &quot;I hit, it flipped over, then it lunged at me again. Then I just chased it through the woods for 45 minutes.&quot; Then, when the coyote&apos;s pup appeared, &quot;<strong>The mother started chewing on its head.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that the coyote attacked Eric Mandel, 14, who said he<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195937/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/nyregion/07coyote.html?ref=nyregion"> managed to fend her off by slapping her twice</a>. He added, &quot;It was just really skinny and the fur was all loose and not how a coyote&#x2019;s fur should look like, and it wasn&#x2019;t walking, you know, normal.&quot;  Later in the evening, Jared Zuckerman grabbed his daughter when a coyote scratched her arm; the coyote bit him on his leg and then ran off.  He and his daughter were treated for rabies; DNA swabs from their wounds were also taken to see if they match the coyote that was killed.</p>

<p>Rye Brook has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195937/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7652162">tracking coyotes this summer</a> after other attacks.  Police Sergeant Rich Carroll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195937/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/06/2010-09-06_coyote_in_two_attacks_on_kids_in_westchester_suburb.html">said</a>, &quot;We&apos;ve had at least 150 sightings all over the village. They are just following the food supply, which are turkeys.&quot;</p>
