<p>For the first time since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012055/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1944">1944</a>, both presidential candidates will be in New York City on Election Day, with Republican nominee Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012055/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/03/president_elect_nightmare.php">holding court at the Hilton in midtown Manhattan</a> and Democrat Hillary Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012055/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/01/hillary_clintons_already_booked_fir.php">taking over the Jacob Javits Convention Center</a> on the West Side. Which means midtown will probably be a real nightmare for anyone in a car and on a bike.</p>
