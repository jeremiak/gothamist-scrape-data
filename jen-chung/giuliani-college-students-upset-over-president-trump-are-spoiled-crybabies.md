<p>Rudy Giuliani, lifelong Mayor of 9/11 Town who may also be your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183513/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/07/trumps_america_includes_attorney_ge.php">future Attorney General</a>, was on Fox &amp; Friends this morning to continue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183513/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/trump_president.php">his victory lap</a>. And of course the Fox &amp; Friends crew asked him about college students who are coping with Donald Trump&apos;s win with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183513/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/11/09/colleges-try-to-comfort-students-upset-by-trump-victory/">cry-ins, Play-Doh and therapy dogs</a>. &quot;The reality is they are a bunch of spoiled crybabies,&quot; he said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;They&apos;re a bunch of spoiled crybabies.&quot; - Rudy Giuliani reacts to colleges pandering to students upset by the election by canceling tests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183513/https://t.co/4ZtA67kNMB">pic.twitter.com/4ZtA67kNMB</a></p>&#x2014; Fox News (@FoxNews) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183513/https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/796717548645584896">November 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Barring the fact that many people were crying yesterday (and are still crying today), because they are women, immigrants, Muslim and/or LGBTQ and know exactly what Trump and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183513/http://chicagoist.com/2016/10/10/trust_us_you_dont_want_a_mike_pence.php">his henchman Mike Pence</a> stand for, Giuliani continued, &quot;Most of the kids aren&apos;t crying. They&apos;re going to class.&quot; </p>

<p>Also, Giuliani knows today&apos;s youth. &quot;I speak at a lot of college campuses... this might be heartening,&quot; he said to the hosts. &quot;We&apos;re growing a slightly higher percentage of conservative college students than we used to, because they&apos;re rebelling against their professors... The real left-wing loonies on campus are the professors, not the students.&quot;</p>

<p>He further said that Trump&apos;s message resonated with most college students because many of them are worried about getting jobs.</p>

<p>Giuliani had advice for Trump, if he were talking to these young Americans, &#x201C;You should find a way to listen and talk about it and say to them, &apos;Look, you are overdoing it. Take a while and evaluate my presidency a year from now.&apos; My advice to Donald would be to say that. And say, &apos;Look, calm down, things are not as bad as you think. <strong>Give me a year and I think you are going to find you are living in a much better country than you are living in right now. If not, I don&apos;t know, you can go cry then</strong>.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>As we said yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626183513/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/getting_involved_organize.php">don&apos;t despair&#x2014;get involved</a>.</p>
