										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2011_07_tauner.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406041455im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_tauner.jpg" width="300" height="261"> <br> <i>Victor Burgos</i></div> Hey, look at this, Facebook is good for not only taunting the federal authorities trying to arrest you, it&apos;s also good for them to succeed in catching you!  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406041455/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/07/28/2011-07-28_catch_me_if_oh_youre_here.html">Daily News reports</a> that U.S. Marshals arrested Victor Burgos, 29, who was wanted upstate &quot;on multiple arrest warrants for domestic violence and harassment of his ex-girlfriend&quot; after he posted this message on Facebook: &quot;Catch me if you can, I&apos;m in Brooklyn.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>The Utica Police Department had been searching for Burgos and included him on their most wanted list (he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406041455/http://www.uticapd.com/warrants/TenMostWanted.htm">listed as Ruben Burgos</a>), which apparently made Burgos arrogant enough to make the online challenge. A police spokesman said, &quot;He told us via Facebook to come and get him and we did.&quot; Burgos was found in a Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment.</p>

<p>The News adds, &quot;Even more brazen, Burgos posted on his Web page a video showing him walking into an unidentified NYPD stationhouse believed to be in Brooklyn, authorities said.&quot;</p>
