<p>Bronx State Senator Ruben Diaz Jr. has not been shy about his crusade against gay marriage. In fact, he&apos;s done <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101514/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/08/would_this_man_turn_you_in_favor_of.php">everything he can</a> to stop gay marriage from passing in New York and tried to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101514/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/state_sen_ruben_diazs_awkward_photo.php">use his lesbian granddaughter</a> as a prop in his anti-gay marriage rally.  So we find it wonderfully fitting that the Bronx&apos;s largest gay rights group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101514/http://www.bronxpride.org/">Bronx Pride</a>,  is moving into new offices in a &quot;building funded by, and named after, the city&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101514/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/diaz_restarting_his_anti-marriage_e.php">No. 1 gay-marriage opponent</a>, state Sen. Ruben Diaz,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101514/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/gay_pride_parades_in_bx_foe_building_uwT0rBsgPrvBzLG7GpaJOI#ixzz1dagalGNc">according to the Post</a>.</p>

<p>The Rev. Ruben Diaz Gardens building, at Kelly Street and Westchester Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101514/http://www.nychdc.com/pressroom/pr_board%20meeting%2004-12-06.html">has apartments, retail and office space</a>. The Post explains that his non-profit raised money for the effort&#x2014; and apparently Diaz is furious about the fabulous new tenant: A source says, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s furious. It&#x2019;s such a direct shot at him.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Bronx Pride executive director Dirk McCall just chalks it up to coincidence but doesn&apos;t deny the elegance of the situation, telling the Post, &#x201C;It [just] happens to be entertaining that the building&#x2019;s named after someone who opposes marriage for us.&quot;</p>
