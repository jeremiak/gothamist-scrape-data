                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_09_mncommuters12.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083813im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_mncommuters12.jpg" width="640" height="360"> <br> <i> Metro-North commuters along the New Haven line last week (MTA Photos)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Six days after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083813/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/con_ed_feeder_loss_suspends_metro_n.php">Con Ed feeder failed</a> on the New Haven line, sending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083813/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/photos_hell_is_other_people_trying.php">commuters into a hellish tailspin</a>, the MTA has the line at 50% capacity, thanks to a temporary power substation. While the MTA wants commuters back, they hope they&apos;ll avoid the rush hour!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083813/http://new.mta.info/news/2013/09/29/metro-north-railroad-expands-new-haven-line-options-limited-electric-service-and">MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast said</a>, &quot;Con Edison&#x2019;s temporary substation allows us to run very limited electric trains through this critical section of the New Haven Line for the first time since power was disrupted last week, but it&#x2019;s still far less than the normal service our customers expect. While Con Edison works to restore full power to their damaged feeder cable, the MTA is doing everything it can to accommodate New Haven Line customers on other services.&quot;</p>

<p>Which includes offering <em>free</em> park-and-ride spaces in the Bronx and Westchester County, where commuters can get shuttles to the Harlem Line or go to bus and subway stops. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083813/http://new.mta.info/news/2013/09/29/metro-north-railroad-expands-new-haven-line-options-limited-electric-service-and">Here are the MTA&apos;s details</a>:</p><blockquote>Orchard Beach - 5,000 parking spaces, with a free shuttle bus to MTA New York City Transit&#x2019;s Pelham Bay Park station on the 6 Subway Line Icon subway line.<br>
8 E. 153rd St. Garage (Yankee Stadium) - 1,500 parking spaces, a short walk to Metro-North&#x2019;s Yankees-E 153 St station and the 161 St station on the B Subway Line Icon, D Subway Line Icon and 4 Subway Line Icon subway lines.<br>
Rye Playland - 1,500 parking spaces, with a free shuttle bus to the White Plains station on the Metro-North Harlem Line.<br>
Kensico Dam, 600 Park Drive West, Valhalla - 600 parking spaces, with a free shuttle bus to the North White Plains station on the Harlem Line, and walking distance to the Valhalla Station on the Harlem Line.</blockquote>The MTA explains, &quot;The new schedule, available at mta.info/mnr, is constrained by the power supply available to the eight-mile section between Harrison and Mount Vernon, which can only accommodate two electric trains at one time under very limited loads. Electric trains draw the most power when starting, so they will only operate express through that eight-mile section. About 20 percent of normal New Haven Line rush-hour service will be provided by electric trains, in addition to the 30 percent provided by diesel trains borrowed from other Metro-North lines.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Richard Blumenthal are annoyed with how this is yet another problem. &quot;The answer we get right now on something this serious is, &#x2018;Blah blah blah,&apos; &quot; Schumer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083813/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/metro-north-woes-continue-article-1.1471094">told reporters Sunday</a> at Grand Central Terminal. One big question that remains unanswered is why the feeder cable had been in place for 36 years, when its &quot;useful life&quot; ends at 30. </p>
