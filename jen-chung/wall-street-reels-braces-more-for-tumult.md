<p>After the Dow Jones industrial average <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/worst_day_on_wall_street_since_911.php">fell 504 points</a>--the most since September 17, 2001--yesterday upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/panic_on_wall_street_lehman_files_f.php">news of Lehman Brothers&apos;s bankruptcy, the sale of Merrill Lynch, and A.I.G.&apos;s troubles</a>, Wall Street is in for another difficult day.  Asian stock markets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/business/worldbusiness/16asiastox.html">were down sharply</a>: Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei was down 5%, Seoul&apos;s Kospi was down 6.1% and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng fell 5.9%.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122152314746339697.html?mod=special_coverage">Wall Street Journal reported</a>, &quot;<strong>Steps unveiled by the Federal Reserve to expand its emergency lending arsenal did little to snap the sense of gloom.</strong>&quot;  Indeed, the NY Times called out how Bush&apos;s remarks did little to soothe nerves in its front page headline.</p>

Goldman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09162008/news/regionalnews/the_new_york_shock_exchange_129310.htm">said</a>, &quot;We have a very, very nervous market, and folks hate uncertainty. <strong>They&apos;ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop, and two of them dropped on Sunday.</strong>&quot;  City Comptroller William Thompson said, &quot;Today is a sad and stunning day. Thousands are losing their jobs; many are unsure about their future.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/09/15/2008-09-15_stock_shock_felt_around_the_world_dow_pl.html">tried to remain upbeat</a>, reminding, &quot;New Yorkers have gotten through the ups and downs of Wall Street before, and we will get through this.&quot;  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson added, &quot;What we are going through in the short term doesn&apos;t make anything easier. But in the longer term, it&apos;s going to make things better, because we&apos;ve got excesses we need to work through,&quot; and noted the &quot;soundness and resilience of the American financial system.&quot;</p>

<p>Right now, Barclays may be in a deal to buy parts of Lehman Brothers, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122156586985742907.html">statement from the British bank</a>, but the statement also says, &quot;there can be no assurance that the discussions will result in an agreement.&quot;  The WSJ says Lehman executives hope jobs and operations can be preserved in New York.</p>

<p>AIG <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221008/http://www.cnbc.com/id/26728368">shares fell 40%</a> before the market opened this morning.  Moody&apos;s and Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s downgraded AIG&apos;s credit, and CNBC reports that the Federal Reserve &quot;has hired...Morgan Stanley to review options for AIG.&quot;</p>
