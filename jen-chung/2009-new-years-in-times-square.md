</div></div>					<p>It was a cold start to 2009, but it was worth it for the reported hundreds of thousands that flocked to Times Square to ring in the new year.  The temperature was about 0 degrees, when counting the wind chill, and the revelers made the best of it.  One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115300/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/91503/cold-crowd-welcomes-2009-in-times-square/Default.aspx">told NY1</a>, &quot;I just feel like it&apos;s something you have to do once in your life,&quot; and another added, &quot;I mean, growing up as a kid you always got to watch the ball drop, right? So I&apos;m like, why not do it in real life?&quot; </p>

<p>Many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115300/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01012009/news/regionalnews/nys_fear_year_gets_put_on_ice_146754.htm">arrived as early at 8.am.</a>; one teen who came all the way from Venezula told the Post, &quot;<strong>I came here for the Jonas Brothers and the show... </strong> I&apos;m wearing tights under my jeans, Ugg boots, extra underwear, anything I can - and I&apos;m still freezing.&quot; And, like in years past, there was a corporate presence amongst the crowd: Nivea, a sponsor for the celebration, handed out balloons for celebrants to wave and hats for them to wear (not to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115300/http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/agency/e3i4bf70b129a07520824ccc6daa520d78a">mention samples of its lip balm</a> for the midnight kiss), while Pepsi, another sponsor, gave out scarves and dropped a 1,000 balloons with its messages of &quot;optimism&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115300/http://adage.com/article?article_id=133502">and its new logo</a>) a few minutes before midnight. </p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg, Secretary of State-designate (and Senator) Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115300/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/12/31/2008-12-31_crowds_cheer_in_the_new_year_at_times_sq.html">pressed the button</a> that started the New Year&apos;s Ball&apos;s descent, and right after the countdown hit 1 second, cheers rang out, confetti fell and swirled around, and the sound of Frank Sinatra signing &quot;New York, New York&quot; was played on speakers.</p>

<p>This morning, the Mayor was back in Times Square to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115300/http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=8178573&amp;version=2&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1"> thank the Department of Sanitation crews cleaning up</a>: Last year, there were 40 tons of garbage!  Oh, and Bloomberg told NY1 what his resolutions are: &quot;<strong>I always have the same three New Years resolutions, which typically last a day - improve my golf game, improve my Spanish and reduce my waistline</strong>.&quot;</p>
