<p>The NFL <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123049/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/giants_and_jets_both_get_home_games.php#comments">announced yesterday</a> that the Giants would get the first regular season game at the New Meadowlands Stadium, and the Jets aren&apos;t very happy!  Jets owner Woody Johnson blasted NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell&apos;s coin toss process, first chastising him for straying from tradition, &quot;An NFL coin toss has a few fundamental elements that are missing here, most notably the presence of the teams involved. That&apos;s how it&apos;s always done in the League, whether it&#x2019;s determining the order of the draft or deciding who&#x2019;s going to kick off the game.&quot; </p>

<p>His statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123049/http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2010/03/what_exactly_is_ny_jets_owner.html">continues with further veiled accusations</a>, &quot;When the issue of which team would be hosting the first regular season game could not be resolved on the merits, I suggested a coin toss as the fairest way to resolve this issue. The League rejected that idea. Then, I was told on Friday that a coin toss had taken place at the League office and that the Jets had lost. We rejected a process in which neither team was present.  The League departed from our time-honored tradition and declined the opportunity to set the matter straight with a transparent process.&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily News&apos;s Gary Myers  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123049/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2010/03/16/2010-03-16_better_hope_tantrum_is_not_supercostly.html">suggests</a> that Johnson is sabotaging hopes of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123049/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/26/will_new_yorkernew_jerseyhost_the_s.php">2014 NY (well, NJ) Super Bowl</a> by criticizing Goodell. Also interesting: Johnson knew about the coin toss on Friday... but the Jets&apos; website said that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123049/http://www.newyorkjets.com/news/articles/show/3631-host-of-stadium-s-opener-we-ll-flip-you-for-it">coin toss had yet to happen</a> on Saturday!  </p>

<p>It&apos;s probably little consolation that the Jets will get the first preseason game at the New Meadowlands.</p>
