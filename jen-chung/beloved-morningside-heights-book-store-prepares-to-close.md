Owner Peter Soter, who opened the bookshop on Broadway &amp; West 114th five years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150628142639/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2009/05/06/morningside-books-close-next-month">told the Columbia Spectator</a> earlier this month that while Columbia was &quot;very supportive, and very helpful,&quot; he just couldn&apos;t make enough money to stay open.  Soter put up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150628142639/http://www.bwog.net/articles/morningside_books_goes_under">letter to the community in the window</a>: &quot;We wanted to be the little bookstore that could. We couldn&apos;t.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150628142639/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/nyregion/30metjournal.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times chronicles</a> the farewells the bookshop has been receiving, plus some of the economic realities. Some residents feel Columbia could have done more, some have offered a total of $68,000 in &quot;unsolicited donations&quot; to keep the store open.  One teacher said, &quot;One of the reasons I lived on the Upper West Side is that it has a sense of being a vital neighborhood. A neighborhood bookstore becomes part of you.<strong> I love that bookstore. It&#x2019;s not like losing a finger. It&#x2019;s like losing an arm</strong>.&quot;  </p>
