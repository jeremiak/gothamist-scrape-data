But there&apos;s skepticism about whether the clothes could be related to the Etan Patz case.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/kiddie-clothes-found-confessed-etan-patz-killer-house-sources-belong-lost-boy-police-children-clothes-found-predro-hernandez-home-belonged-slain-etan-patz-article-1.1092172">A Daily News source says</a>, &quot;We found nothing that we believe belongs to the boy&quot; (Etan Patz was last seen wearing pants, not shorts).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120609/soho/lies-can-kill-families-says-patz-suspects-sister-after-news-reports">DNAinfo&apos;s source says</a>, &quot;The clothes are too f-ing big and could not fit [Etan].&quot; Also, the Matchbox car appears to have been made after Etan&apos;s disappearance.</p>

<p>Hernandez rented part of the home and lived there with his wife and daughter; skeptics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/nyregion/boys-clothes-found-in-search-of-home-of-patz-case-suspect.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">suggest that the clothing and toy could have belonged</a> to his daughter or other relatives&#x2014;or previous tenants of the home.  </p>

<p>Etan&apos;s disappearance from his Soho neighborhood&#x2014;he was walking the few blocks from his home to his school bus stop by himself for the first time&#x2014;on May 25, 1979 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/etan_patzs_1979_disappearance_in_so.php">shocked the city and then the country</a>. In April, the FBI and NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/21/etan_patz_case_fbi_removes_concrete.php">investigated the basement of a Soho</a> to investigate whether a neighborhood handyman might  be involved, but apparently came up empty. Then, late last month, a NJ man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/etan_patz_suspect_admits_to_stabbin.php">allegedly confessed to the decades-old crime</a>. </p>

<p>Hernandez, who was a stock clerk at a bodega across from Etan&apos;s bus stop, allegedly confessed to the murder.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/nyregion/patz-suspect-said-to-write-short-confession-on-boys-picture.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reported</a>, &quot;By the end of the interrogation [last month], Mr. Hernandez had not only looked at the picture; he had also signed his name across it and even written a brief confession on the picture, one law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said &apos;They had him sign on the photograph, and write, &quot;I killed him&quot; or &quot;I strangled him,&quot; &apos; said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>The lawyer for Hernandez, Harvey Fishbein, says his client has mental problems, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/26/suspect_in_1979_etan_patz_murder_ha.php">from schizophrenia to hallucinations</a>.  And one of Herdnandez&apos;s sister said news reports were wrong about him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233719/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120609/soho/lies-can-kill-families-says-patz-suspects-sister-after-news-reports">&quot;A lie can kill a family.&quot;</a></p>
