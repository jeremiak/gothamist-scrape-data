<p>Back in 1999, the Brooklyn Museum held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132000/http://www.artsjournal.com/issues/Brooklyn.htm">Sensation</a>, an exhibit of works from up-and-coming British artists like Damien Hirst and Rachel Whiteread. But the Giuliani administration freaked out because of Nigerian-British artist Chris Ofili&apos;s painting, &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary,&quot; which depicted the Virgin Mary, with elephant dung and cutouts of genitalia from porn magazines, and tried to shut down the show. Now, former Giuliani top aide-turned-MTA chief-turned mayoral candidate Joe Lhota <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132000/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/nyregion/for-lhota-mayoral-hopeful-who-lost-fight-to-remove-art-no-regrets.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">discusses the controversy with the NY Times</a>, &quot;<strong>I have a much clearer understanding of the First Amendment now.</strong>&quot; Better late than never?</p>

<p>Lhota never actually saw the painting&#x2014;he only heard about it and saw photos of it&#x2014;and says, &quot;As a concept, it was offensive.&quot; (A 72-year-old man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132000/http://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/121899brooklyn-museum.html">arrested for throwing paint </a>on it at the Brooklyn Museum.) The city threatened to cut off the museum&apos;s city funding if the painting wasn&apos;t removed, and eventually the Brooklyn Museum sued and won, with the judge noting that Lhota&apos;s testimony (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132000/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/28/nyregion/28lhota-deposition.html?ref=nyregion">PDF</a>) showed the City of New York &quot;has never contemplated that the city or the mayor would have veto power over the museum&#x2019;s decisions as to what to display.&quot;</p>

<p>The museum&apos;s lawyer, Floyd Abrams, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132000/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec99/art_10-8.html">told PBS in 1999</a>, &quot;[Giuliani] is saying, in effect, if there is a book in the library that we fund, I can take it out if it&apos;s offensive. That is profoundly dangerous, profoundly dangerous, and that&apos;s why we had to go to court.&quot;</p>

<p>If he was faced with this issue as mayor, Lhota says he would &quot;Probably go see it. Enjoy it. Hope there is a ribbon cutting.&quot; Right after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132000/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/05/08/lhota-apologizes-for-mall-cops-remark/">calling Port Authority cops mall cops,</a> perhaps?</p>

<p>Ofili&apos;s &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot; can be seen at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132000/http://www.mona.net.au/">Museum of Old and New Art</a> in Australia. </p>
