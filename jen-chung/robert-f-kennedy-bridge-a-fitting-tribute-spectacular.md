</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, the Triborough Bridge was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153130/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/19/rfk_bridge.php">renamed the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge</a>  to honor former Attorney General and Senator from New York.  Former president Bill Clinton, Mayor Bloomberg and Governor David Paterson joined RFK&apos;s children and widow, Ethel Kennedy, for the event.  Paterson said, <strong>&quot;Robert F. Kennedy was a champion of social justice and human rights and his spirit is kept alive by his family&#x2019;s continued commitment to those causes.</strong> I am particularly pleased to have had the opportunity to sign this bill into law, making possible the renaming of the Triborough Bridge as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, which is a fitting tribute to the man and his legacy.&#x201D;  The idea was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153130/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/09/rfk.php">proposed earlier this year</a> by former governor Eliot Spitzer.</p>

<p>Ethel Kennedy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153130/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11202008/news/regionalnews/rfk_bridge_to_past_139686.htm">told the NY Post</a>, &quot;It&apos;s spectacular, so wonderful.  I love that now people will be crossing over the bridge and thinking of Bobby&apos;s life.&quot;  There&apos;s been talk that the cost to change roads signs could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153130/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/robert.f.kennedy.2.868247.html">be up to $4 million</a>, but the Post reports that the &quot;city says changing its signs will cost $100,000, and the MTA say its signage costs will be around $3,200.&quot;</p>

<p>Additionally, Paterson announced that public school students in the 4th, 8th and 12th grades will have a set of &quot;RFK Lesson Plans&quot; added to their curriculums, to teach them about RFK&apos;s &quot;commitment to helping others.&quot;  Today would have been RFK&apos;s 83rd birthday; you can read more about his legacy at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153130/http://www.rfkmemorial.org/">RFK Memorial website</a>.</p>
