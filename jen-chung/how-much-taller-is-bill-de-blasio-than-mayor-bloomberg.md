<p>Last month, Fran Lebowitz psychoanalyzed Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161909/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/watch_fran_lebowitz_hilariously_psy.php">for the NY Times</a>, noting that Bloomberg&apos;s height has something to do with the man he is today. Lebowitz, who hates Bloomberg, explained:</p><blockquote>I think it&apos;s very important that we don&apos;t ever have a mayor this rich or this short. The richness comes from the shortness, this is what I believe. I believe every single person suffers for what happens to boys on playgrounds. So I really believe that a short boy gets bullied by taller boys, or ignored by them, or doesn&apos;t have the same status as they do, they grow up, they get very rich, to kind of get back at these tall boys, and then everyone suffers for this. I like de Blasio for many reasons, but his height is very important.</blockquote>Jon Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161909/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/video_jon_stewart_addresses_the_ant.php">also noted that if de Blasio wins</a>, there will be the &quot;greatest incumbent-successor size discrepancy in the history of swearing-in ceremonies&quot; and provided this visual:<p></p>

<p>So how much taller<em> is</em> de Blasio than Bloomberg? Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161909/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/nyregion/26tall.html">de Blasio is 6&apos;5&quot;</a> and the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161909/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/nyregion/25owner.html">has reported</a>, &quot;Mr. Bloomberg&#x2019;s height has been reported as being anywhere from 5-feet-6 (in news articles) to 5-feet-10 (on his driver&#x2019;s license).&quot; We haven&apos;t been able to locate any photographs of Bloomberg and de Blasio standing next to each other, so we found two images from the 2010 swearing-in ceremony and created the image at top for an approximation of the differential. The original images are below.</p>

<p>Now we just need to know how de Blasio looks in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161909/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/18/summer_fashion.php">a pair of pleated khaki shorts and loafers with white socks</a>!</p>
