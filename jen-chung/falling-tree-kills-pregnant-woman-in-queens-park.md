<p>A six months pregnant woman was killed after a tree struck her in a Queens park last night. Yingyi Li, 30, had been sitting on a bench in Kissena Park when the huge oak hit her. A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928033837/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/04/pregnant-woman-killed-by-falling-tree-in-queens/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;<strong>We were standing around, and just heard a loud crash and a boom. So my friend and I &#x2014; we ran over, and when we got there, we saw a girl lying face down and blood just pouring out of her head</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>The witness, Sam Kim, added that an EMT who happened to be in the park was there, &quot;He immediately turned her over, and he checked her pulse and noticed her pulse was really weak, and he immediately performed compressions on her chest.&quot;</p>

<p>Li&apos;s husband, Aleksandar Dikov, was bereft. He<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928033837/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queens_tree_horror_3wQQ6xdXOiIytZx8p622gK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens"> spoke to the Post</a>, &quot;She was a very great, loving person. It&#x2019;s a big shock to me. She was alone. We usually go together,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928033837/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/pregnant-woman-dies-falling-branch-hits-article-1.1417509">said to the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>I was so happy to be with her. She was the one for me. She was the best thing. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll find another girl like her. I know I won&#x2019;t.</strong>&quot; <b>UPDATE</b>: Daily News reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928033837/https://twitter.com/OrenNYDN/status/364370855301615616">Oren Yaniv Tweeted</a>, &quot;Heard from EMT who treated pregnant woman crashed by tree: &apos;Please tell her husband that she fought hard, she fought as long as she could.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Resident Salvatore Delligatti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928033837/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Pregnant-Woman-Critically-Injured-by--218303721.html">said to NBC New York</a>, &quot;The park is old, the trees are old.  A lot of trees have been coming down in the past few years with the storms we&apos;ve been having.&quot; A second woman was injured as well.</p>
