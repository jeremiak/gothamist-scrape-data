The DOJ accuses developer AvalonBay Communities of, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521063735/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/nyregion/14building.html?ref=nyregion">per the NY Times</a>, &quot;illegally discriminating against disabled people by failing to provide them with sufficient access at a 361-unit rental building on the Lower East Side.&quot;</p>

<p>The building, which ushered in a new era of large, modern apartment buildings to the formerly &quot;gritty&quot; Bowery, with amenities and retail offerings like a Whole Foods on the first floor, opened in 2005, with rents around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521063735/http://curbed.com/archives/2005/04/04/what_rents_will_come_at_avalon_chrystie_place.php">$2850 for a one-bedroom</a> (now it&apos;s more like $3895).  DOJ&apos;s issue is that there are no &quot;routes into and through dwellings, reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow the installation of grab bars, and kitchens and bathrooms usable by a person in a wheelchair.&#x201D; The lawsuit also notes SLCE Architects in it.  </p>

<p>The DOJ says the case is &quot;the government&#x2019;s first lawsuit in Manhattan alleging violations of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521063735/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/housing_coverage.htm">Fair Housing Act</a> in the design and construction of multifamily housing.&#x201D;  AvalonBay says the building &quot;was designed and constructed, and is operated, with a view to full compliance with all accessibility codes and laws.&quot;</p>
