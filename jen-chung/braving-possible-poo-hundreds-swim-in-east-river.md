										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_07_kramea.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074027im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_kramea.jpg" width="365" height="267" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, NYC Swim held its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074027/http://www.nycswim.org/Event/Event.aspx?Event_ID=2107">annual Brooklyn Bridge swim</a>, a 1K across the East River.  About 400 people participated, which apparently was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074027/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/144049/hundreds-span-east-river-during-annual-race/">less than in previous years</a>. It seems that some may have been thinking about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074027/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/city_says_hudson_east_and_harlem_ri.php">warnings about raw sewage</a> which was dumped into waterways after a four-alarm fire that devastated a wastewater treatment plant.</p>

<p>One swimmer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074027/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/07/31/2011-07-31_were_in_the_swim__whoknowswhat.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I had two moments when I felt something that wasn&apos;t water, but I don&apos;t want to know what it was. It could&apos;ve been a plastic bag, it could be ...seaweed, but you don&apos;t ask. You just swim.&quot;  Another explained his secret to keeping healthy after swimming in the river: &quot;I do a shot of tequila to clean out my system.&quot;</p>

<p>The swim race&apos;s founder says the water is clean and the race was won by Katherine O&#x2019;Connor, who crossed the river in 13 minutes and 30 seconds.  For what it&apos;s worth, the East River has always had an infamous reputation, whether as a place where the mob would dump bodies or as being polluted. In an episode of Seinfeld, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074027/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hK3pBcY3k0">Kramer takes to swimming in the East River</a>.  Jerry was concerned, &quot;You&apos;re swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?&quot; but Kramer pointed out, &quot;Technically Norfolk has more gross tonnage,&quot; and noted that he had company, &quot;I saw a couple of other guys out there... Floating, they weren&apos;t moving much. But they were out there.&quot;</p>
