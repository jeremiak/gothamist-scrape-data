</div></div>					<p>Mike Nichols, who fled Nazi Germany as a child and became one of the most celebrated directors of film, stage and television, passed away last night at age 83. </p>

<p>James Goldstein, president of ABC News, announced his death, noting his &quot;triumphant career that spanned over six decades,&quot; calling him a &quot;true visionary, winning the highest honors in the arts for his work as a director, writer, producer and comic and was one of a tiny few to win the EGOT&#x2014;an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.&quot; (Nichols&apos;s wife, Diane Sawyer, is the anchor of ABC News.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011607/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/movies/mike-nichols-celebrated-director-dies-at-83.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">The NY Times obituary notes his rich career</a>:</p><blockquote>Dryly urbane, Mr. Nichols had a gift for communicating with actors and a keen comic timing, which he honed early in his career as half of the popular sketch-comedy team Nichols and May. He accomplished what Orson Welles and Elia Kazan, but few if any other directors have: He achieved popular and artistic success in both theater and film. He was among the most decorated people in the history of show business, one of only a handful to have won an Oscar, a Tony, an Emmy and a Grammy.<p></p>

<p>His career encompassed an entire era of screen and stage entertainment. On Broadway, where he won an astonishing nine Tonys (including two as a producer), he once had four shows running simultaneously. He directed Neil Simon&#x2019;s early comedies &#x201C;Barefoot in the Park&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Odd Couple&#x201D; in the 1960s, the zany Monty Python musical, &#x201C;Spamalot,&quot; four decades later, and nearly another decade after that, an acclaimed revival of Arthur Miller&#x2019;s bruising masterpiece, &#x201C;Death of a Salesman.&#x201D;</p>

<p>...The first time Mr. Nichols stepped behind the camera, in 1966, it was to direct Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, in an adaptation of Edward Albee&#x2019;s scabrous stage portrayal of a marriage, &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&#x201D; The film was nominated for 13 Academy Awards, including one for best director. Though he didn&#x2019;t win then, the film won five.</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols did win an Oscar for his second film, &#x201C;The Graduate&#x201D; (1967), a shrewd social comedy that defined the uncertainty of adulthood for the generation that came of age in the 1960s and made a star of an unknown actor, Dustin Hoffman, who was nearly 30 when he played Benjamin Braddock, the 21-year-old protagonist of the film, a Southern Californian and a track star who sleeps with the wife of his father&#x2019;s best friend and then falls in love with her daughter. A small, dark, Jewish New Yorker, he was an odd choice for the all-American suburban boy whose seemingly prescribed life path has gone awry.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There is no piece of casting in the 20th century that I know of that is more courageous than putting me in that part,&#x201D; Mr. Hoffman said in an interview in The New Yorker in 2000.</p></blockquote>Nichols produced Whoopi Goldberg&apos;s Broadway monologue in 1984; directed one of the best New York City movies ever, <em>Working Girl</em>; directed a searing TV adaptation of <em>Angels in America</em> for HBO; cast Philip Seymour Hoffman as Willy Loman in the recent revival of <em>Death Of A Salesman </em>; and countless others.<p></p>

<p>Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin in 1931. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011607/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/mike-nichols/5/">As Nazis began arresting Jews</a>, his family fled to the United States; Nichols was seven when he and his brother met up with their father in New York City; he grew up on the Upper West Side. In a 2000 profile for The New Yorker (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011607/http://johnlahr.com/articlePDF/2000_02_21_196-214-Lahr-web.pdf">PDF</a>), John Lahr wrote:</p><blockquote>When he arrived from Berlin, at the age of seven, he was totally bald; he&#x2019;d been permanently denuded of all body hair at the age of four, a reaction to a defective whooping-cough vaccine. He knew just two English sentences. &#x201C;I do not speak English&#x201D; and &#x201C;Please do not kiss me.&#x201D; He&#x2019;d lost his homeland, his language, his class pedigree, and, by the age of twelve, he was would also lose his father. &#x201C;I was a zero,&#x201D; Nicholas says now. He adds, &#x201C;In every way that mattered, I was powerless.&#x201D; Nichols sought something to counteract his paralyzing sense of inadequacy and to disarm a world that he saw, and still sees, as predatory and cruel. &#x201C;The most useful thing is if your enemy doesn&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s you enemy,&#x201D; Nicholas told me, setting out the rule of dissimulation by which, over the years, he has kept the world in his thrall. &#x201C;Never let people see what you want, because they will not let you have it. Never let anybody see what you feel, because it gives them too much power. You&#x2019;re probably better off not showing weakness when you can avoid it, because they&#x2019;ll go for you.&#x201D; With its aspects of detachment, generosity, and control, the imperial posture has served him well.</blockquote>Nichols is survived by Sawyer, his wife of 26 years; three children; and four grandchildren. He had most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011607/http://deadline.com/2014/07/tca-hbo-reveals-details-of-mike-nicholsmeryl-streep-master-class-queen-latifah-bessie-project-launch-date-for-boardwalk-empire-final-season-801743/">recently been working on an adaptation</a> of Terrence McNally&apos;s <em>Master Class</em> with frequent collaborator Meryl Streep as Maria Callas for HBO.<p></p>
