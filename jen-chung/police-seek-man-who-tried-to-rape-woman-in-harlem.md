<p>Police are looking for a suspect in an attempted rape that took place earlier this week.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 12, in central Harlem, a 41-year-old woman was sitting on the steps outside an apartment building. A man approached her, police say, and started talking to her, but she got up and went into the building&#x2014;and he followed her. Inside, he tried to rape her, but she was able to fight him off.</p>

<p>The victim was not injured, and the suspect is desribed as being in his mid-twenties, 5&apos;8&quot; to 5&apos;10&quot; tall with a thin build and wearing black shorts and a green shirt with a number &quot;4&quot; on it. Here&apos;s surveillance video of the suspect:</p>
