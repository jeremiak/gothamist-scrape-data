<p>Police are searching for a man accused of sexual abuse on a Brooklyn train last month. It&apos;s a pretty awful incident.</p>

<p>On October 16th, around 1:20 a.m., the NYPD says that the suspect &quot;rubbed his privates on the 55 year-old female victim&apos;s shoulder while she slept aboard a southbound &apos;Q&apos; train as it entered the Church Avenue station.&quot; </p>

<p>The suspect then got out at the station and fled west on Church Avenue. He is described being around 45 years old, 5&apos;2&quot; and 160 pounds, and was last seen wearing a black jacket, blue jeans, a dark colored baseball cap and white and black sneakers. Here&apos;s surveillance footage:</p>
