<p>With the strong winds, the Department of Buildings is asking builders and property owners to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172806/http://wcbstv.com/cbs2crew/gusty.winds.nyc.2.1395031.html">secure their construction sites and buildings</a>.  WCBS 2 reports, &quot;The Buildings Department will be performing random spot-check inspections of construction sites around the city&quot; and that suggestions include &quot;Tie down and secure material and loose debris at construction sites,&quot; &quot;Secure netting and scaffolding,&quot; and &quot;Suspend crane operations and secure crane equipment.&quot;</p>
