<p>The Rangers are hoping to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417021006/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/12/rangers_and_devils_look_to_advance.php">cap their great season with a run at the Stanley Cup</a>, but their Game 2 overtime loss to the Ottawa Senators has had some other repercussions: Forward Carl Hagelin was suspended for three games for elbowing Senators forward Daniel Alfredsson in the head during the second period.  Watch here:</p>

<p>In a video, NHL vice president of player safety <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417021006/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/rangers/bontemps_sub_rangers_main_effXfOxTpf6NtM3hhw6WLN">Brendan Shanahan said</a>, &quot;After Alfredsson chips the puck up the boards, Hagelin continues on his path, and finishes his check with his arms up high, recklessly striking Alfredsson in the side of the head with his elbow. This hit is a clear violation of what the NHL rules as elbowing... It&#x2019;s important to note that while Alfredsson saw this hit coming and braced himself for it, in doing so he not significantly changes the position of his head. Also, although Alfredsson&#x2019;s stick briefly comes up prior to contact, we do not feel this was a reasonable excuse.&quot;</p>

<p>Alfredsson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417021006/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/rangers/2012/04/senators-daniel-alfredsson-confirms-he-suffered-concussion-on-carl-hagelin-elbow-gam">suffered a concussion</a>. The Rangers are not going to appeal the decision, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417021006/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/sports/hockey/nhl-suspends-rangers-carl-hagelin-three-games.html?ref=sports">but said</a>, &quot;We are thoroughly perplexed in the ruling&#x2019;s inconsistency with other supplementary discipline decisions that have been made throughout this season and during the playoffs.&quot;</p>

<p>Shanahan suspended Senators defenseman Matt Carkner for one game for his attack on the Rangers&apos; Brian Boyle.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417021006/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/rangers/ny-rangers-rookie-chris-kreider-ready-step-carl-hagelin-suspended-elbowing-daniel-alfredsson-article-1.1062076">Daily News reports that fight</a> &quot;involved sucker punches and pounding on Boyle&#x2019;s head and back as he lay flat on the ice.&quot;  Watch it:</p>
