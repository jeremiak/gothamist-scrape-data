					<p>The man who used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/10/trump_climber.php">giant suction cups to scale the exterior of Trump Tower</a> yesterday apparently just wanted a private meeting with Donald Trump, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Trump-Tower-Man-Climbing-Building-Glass-Windows-Midtown-Manhattan-389775792.html">telling cops</a>, &quot;I just want to climb. I just want to talk to Trump.&quot; However, the 19-year-old, whose identity still hasn&apos;t been released, is currently at Bellevue Hospital undergoing an evaluation, and hasn&apos;t yet gotten his meeting.</p>

<p>The police say they received a 911 call at 3:30 p.m. &quot;for an individual scaling the facade of 725 5th Avenue (Trump Tower)&quot; and when officers arrived, they &quot;discovered a 19-year-old male, clinging to the windows of the atrium at approximately the 5th floor of the building using power-grip suction cups.&quot; </p>

<p>After three hours of unsuccessfully trying to block his path, by cutting out openings from air conditioning vents and knocking out windows, NYPD Emergency Service Unit officers grabbed him at the 21st floor. Detective Christopher William said he told him, &quot;Sir, would you come with me?&quot;</p>

He was climbing for awhile, I could see he was getting tired. &apos;If you lock this in, we will tie it, we will have you.&apos; He refused to take the line.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://nypost.com/2016/08/10/man-uses-suction-cups-to-scale-trump-tower/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;The daredevil, whom sources identified as a Virginia man named Stephen Rogata, began his ascent from street level at about 2:45 p.m. and made it more than 200 feet up the glassy Trump Tower... The man had multiple ID&#x2019;s on him, and police officials have not yet formally confirmed his name.&quot;</p>

<p>However, other reports say that he started his climb from Trump Tower&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/https://www.6sqft.com/donald-trumps-secret-public-gardens-gave-him-extra-height-at-trump-tower/">fourth-floor gardens</a>, which are open to the pubic. &quot;We were in the public garden at Trump Tower when all of a sudden the guy took off his basketball shorts and sprinted down the side of the building on the ledge,&quot; a tourist from Virginia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-scales-trump-tower-manhattan-suction-cups-article-1.2746270">Blake Crowson, 20, told the Daily News</a>. &quot;We thought he was BASE jumping. He had two duffel bags that looked like they had climbing ropes.&#x201D;</p>

<p>NYPD Chief Of Manhattan Detectives William Aubry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/nyregion/man-climbs-trump-tower.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a> the climber &quot;told them he sought to scale the tower with one purpose: to gain a personal meeting with Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Police officials said he told them about a YouTube video he posted on Tuesday that explained his motives.&quot;</p>

<p>This appears to be the video:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP493LmSJrE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>In it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://abc7ny.com/politics/trump-tower-climber-captured-by-nypd-now-at-bellevue/1465368/">a young man says</a>, &quot;I am an independent researcher seeking a private audience with you to discuss an important matter. I guarantee that it&apos;s in your interest to honor this request. Believe me, if my purpose was not significant, I would not risk my life pursuing it. The reason I climbed your tower is to get your attention. If I had sought this via conventional means, I would be much less likely to have success because you are a busy man with many responsibilities.&quot;</p>

<p>The Republican presidential nominee is pleased, but has not signaled whether he will meet with &quot;Steve&quot;:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.</p>&#x2014; Donald J.

<p>Police have not charged the climber with anything yet, but the investigation is ongoing. The authorities also emphasized that the climber did not wish to harm Trump. <b>Update</b>: The police just confirmed that the climber&apos;s name is Stephen Rogata and that he was charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass.</p>

<p>In 2008, activist Alain Robert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/alain_robert_sc.php#photo-1">climbed the NY Times&apos; building</a> (no suction cups needed because of the ladder-like rungs on its exterior) and, hours later, a second man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/encore_ny_times.php">climbed the building</a>. After a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/third_ny_times_building_climbers_le.php">third man climbed the building</a>, the Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612155144/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/10/rungs_removed_from_ladderlike_times.php">removed some of its exterior rungs</a>. Sad! Donald Trump would never surrender like that.</p>
