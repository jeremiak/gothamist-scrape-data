<p>Last night, John Oliver took over hosting duties of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232919/http://thedailyshow.com/">The Daily Show</a> for John Stewart, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232919/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/jon_stewart_leaving_the_daily_show.php">who will be directing</a> his first feature film, <em>Rosewater</em>. Oliver said, &quot;Let&apos;s all acknowledge for a moment that this is weird. This looks weird. It feels weird. it even sounds weird. It even sounds weird to me and it&apos;s my actual voice.&quot;</p>

<p>He joked that Stewart was off in an Italian village, learning to cobble shoes, and read from a reassuring letter in which Stewart promised that no news happens over the summer.
