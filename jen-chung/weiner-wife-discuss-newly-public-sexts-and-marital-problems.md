                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_anthonyweinerhuma.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020515im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_anthonyweinerhuma.jpg" width="640" height="422"> <br> <i> Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin today </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Former congressman and mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner addressed the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020515/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">sexually explicit conversations</a> he had with a young woman in a press conference just now. He admitted to sending the sexts, but said he wasn&apos;t leaving the race, &quot;What happened today&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t represent all that much that is new.&quot; But more notably, his wife Huma Abedin spoke at a press conference for the first time, &quot;Anthony&apos;s made some horrible mistakes. But I do very strongly believe it&apos;s between us, and our marriage.&quot; </p>

<p>In a packed room at the GMHC before a mayoral forum, Weiner said, &quot;For the past several months I&#x2019;ve been asking New Yorkers to also give me a second chance. It&apos;s personally reasonable for people to ask these questions,&quot; adding, &quot;I&apos;m sorry I did these things. I am sorry to those who got these messages or any inconvenience or embarrassment.&quot;  He emphasized that the timeline of sexts didn&apos;t matter, &quot;The resignation was not a point in time nearly as significant as working through challenges... Some things happened before the resignation and after,&quot; and credited his wife for staying with him. </p>

<p>Weiner also insisted that he&apos;s been upfront, &quot;This is entirely behind me. That is why if you remember the early days of the campaign, people were pressing me if there were more out there and I said yes. &#x201C; Then he ceded the microphone to his wife.</p>

<p>Abedin, who works for Hillary Clinton, revealed, &quot;It&apos;s not an easy choice in any way but I made the decision that it was worth staying in this marriage... for me, our son and our family. I didn&apos;t know how it would work out but I knew I wanted to.&quot; She also said, &quot;I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him. As we have said from the beginning, we are moving forward.&quot; She also said that &quot;it took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy&quot; to get to this place.</p>

<p>In a brief Q &amp; A, Weiner said the new &quot;Carlos Danger&quot; sexts were sent last summer (keep in mind, in July 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020515/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/18/weiner_family_exposed_in_people_mag.php">Abedin told People magazine </a>they were &quot;normal family&quot; after &quot;a lot of work&quot;). He also said that Abedin knew about these sexts. </p>

<p>Weiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 following revelations that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020515/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/crying_weiner_admits_to_sending_exp.php">he had sent pictures of his penis</a> to women through Twitter, was leading or nearly leading in polls to become the next mayor after making a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020515/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/22/anthony_weiner_announces_mayoral_ru.php">last-minute entrance</a> into the race. And, thanks to him, we have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020515/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/low_concept/2013/07/carlos_danger_name_generator_use_our_widget_to_get_a_name_like_anthony_weiner.html">Carlos Danger name generator</a>.</p>
