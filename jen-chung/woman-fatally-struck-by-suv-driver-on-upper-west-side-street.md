<p>A 69-year-old woman died after being hit by an SUV driver in Manhattan last night. Police say the pedestrian ran into the Upper West Side intersection against traffic.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the police responded to a 911 call about a pedestrian who was struck at Broadway and West 75th Street and found Stephanie Dains &quot;lying on the roadway with head trauma.&quot; Dains, who lived on West 60th Street, was pronounced dead at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital.</p>

<p>The NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Squad says that the driver of a 2013 Infiniti SUV was headed southbound in the left lane of Broadway &quot;with a green traffic signal in its favor&quot; when Dains &quot;was crossing West 75 Street, from west to east, in the marked crosswalk, against the pedestrian signal. As [the SUV] was crossing the intersection, the pedestrian ran in front of the vehicle&apos;s path and was struck by the front of the vehicle, throwing her to the ground.&quot;</p>
