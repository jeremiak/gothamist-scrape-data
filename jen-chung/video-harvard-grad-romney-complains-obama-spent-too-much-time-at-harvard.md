<p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney really wants to seal up the Republican nomination, so during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania (which is Santorum territory) he tried to reiterate how out of touch President Obama is, &quot;We have a president, who I think is is a nice guy, but he spent too much time at Harvard, perhaps.&quot; Of course, it&apos;s not like Romney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093655/http://thinkprogress.org/special/2012/04/05/458987/romney-who-has-two-harvard-degrees-says-obama-has-spent-too-much-time-at-harvard/">admitted to the crowd that he went there, too</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093655/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/romney-harvard-obama.html">Daily Intel points out</a>, &quot;Romney [is] a person who earned a joint JD/MBA degree at Harvard over the course of four years &#x2014; one year longer than the three years Obama spent at Harvard getting his law degree, and two years longer than the time spent by three of Romney&apos;s sons at Harvard Business School.&quot;</p>

<p>Whatever, it&apos;s not like Romney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093655/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/romney-plays-down-chances-in-pennsylvania-primary/2012/04/05/gIQAePfYxS_blog.html">thinks he&apos;s going to win Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
