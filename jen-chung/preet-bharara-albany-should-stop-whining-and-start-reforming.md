<p>Having won convictions for two of the (once) most powerful men in New York&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/30/sheldon_silver_verdict.php">ex-Assembly Leader Sheldon Silver</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/skelos_guilty.php">ex-Senator Majority Leader Dean Skelos</a>&#x2014;U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is taking a victory lap by blasting Albany for stalling on ethics reform. </p>

<p>On Brian Lehrer&apos;s WNYC show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://observer.com/2015/12/preet-bharara-chides-albany-lawmakers-for-whining-instead-of-reforming/">Bharara said</a>, &quot;There has been, I hate to say it, a little bit more whispered whining on the part of some legislators in the press, without attribution, than focus on how to solve the problem&quot; of corruption. </p>

<p>Silver, the longtime kingmaker from the Lower East Side, was found guilty of extortion, taking bribes, and money laundering, in a rather nuanced case surrounding millions in kickbacks he got for referring tax and mesothelioma cases to the law firm that retained him as counsel. </p>

<p>Skelos, along with son Adam, was convicted for bribery, extortion, and fraud conspiracy. The jury believed that Skelos strong-armed firms interested in doing business with Albany into giving his son no-show jobs and fees for work he never did.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/nyregion/preet-bharara-us-attorney-sees-lessons-in-albany-corruption-trials.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">In an interview with the NY Times</a>, Bharara &quot;recalled one piece of testimony that he had found particularly revelatory &#x2014; &apos;stunning,&apos; as he put it.&quot;</p><blockquote>State Senator Tony Avella, a Democrat from Queens, testified that as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, he had been barred from holding any committee hearings.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;The idea that the chair of the ethics committee has never had the opportunity to mark up a bill, has never had the opportunity to hold a hearing,&#x201D; Mr. Bharara said, &#x201C;tells you everything you need to know about the enabling nature of all the people in the State Legislature who may not have been convicted of crimes, but seem not to care that they&#x2019;re going on. I think that&#x2019;s indisputable.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Last year, Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/23/cuomos_corruption_commission_finds.php">disbanded his farce of an ethics commission</a> because he found it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/28/governor_cuomo_calls_disbanded_ethi.php">an &quot;overwhelming success.&quot;</a> <p></p>

<p>Most voters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/nyregion/new-yorkers-want-new-ethics-laws-to-clean-up-albany-poll-finds.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">want ethics reform</a>, though lawmakers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/skelos-conviction-won-bring-major-reforms-senate-leaders-article-1.2463721">seem reluctant to change</a>. FWIW, Cuomo&apos;s bestest enemy, Mayor Bill de Blasio, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120319/http://observer.com/2015/12/bill-de-blasio-new-yorkers-owe-a-debt-of-gratitude-to-preet-bharara/">loves what Bharara has done</a>: &quot;I think the U.S. attorney has done a fantastic job. I think we all owe him a debt of gratitude. He&#x2019;s managed to do something both in terms of stopping some very bad things from happening but also he&#x2019;s shown a light on the problems in Albany that have to be addressed.&#x201D;</p>
