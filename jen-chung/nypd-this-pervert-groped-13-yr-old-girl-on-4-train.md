<p>According to the NYPD, at 5:50 p.m. on Wednesday, March 26th, a 13-year-old girl boarded a Bronx-bound 4 train at the 125th Street station. A man, who was already on the train, approached her and started to grope her, police say.</p>

<p>When the girl got out at the 161st Street station in the Bronx, the suspect followed her and then fled the station. </p>

<p>Police, who released a photo of the suspect, described the suspect as being between the ages of 20 and 40 wearing a black coat and carrying a black duffle bag. Anyone with information in regards to this forcible touching is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
