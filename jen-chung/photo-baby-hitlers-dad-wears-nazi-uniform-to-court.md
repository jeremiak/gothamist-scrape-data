<p>Obviously if you&apos;re going to family court to prove you&apos;re a suitable parent, you have to look your best. And for Heath Campbell, that meant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094738/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Nazi-Dad-Fights-for-His-Childs-Custody-209910241.html">wearing a Nazi uniform</a>!</p>

<p>Campbell invaded our consciousness in 2008 and he and his wife were outraged that a NJ ShopRite supermarket <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094738/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/17/no_shoprite_cake_for_baby_hitler.php">refused to inscribe a birthday cake</a> for their son, Adolf Hitler Campbell, with &quot;Happy Birthday Adolf Hitler.&quot; Campbell had pointed out, &quot;There&apos;s a new president and he says it&apos;s time for a change. Well, then it&apos;s time for a change. They need to accept a name. A name&apos;s a name. The kid isn&apos;t going to grow up and do what [Hitler] did.&quot;</p>

<p> A month later, Hitler and his sisters JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094738/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/safety_concerns_over_baby_toddler_h.php">were taken by the NJ child welfare authorities</a> over concerns about their parents and Heath Campbell&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094738/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/judge_baby_hilter_siblings_do_not_b.php">domestic abuse allegations</a> and the parents&#x2014;now separated&#x2014;have been fighting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094738/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/judge_delivers_final_solution_for_b.php">with authorities ever since</a>.</p>

<p>Campbell told NBC 10, &quot;I&apos;m going to tell the judge, I love my children. I wanna be a father, let me be it. Let me prove to the world that I am a good father.&quot; He added, &quot;I&apos;ve never abused my children, I only name my children and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s right anymore&quot; that he can&apos;t see them. </p>

<p>As for his get-up, Campbell said, &quot;If they&apos;re good judges and they&apos;re good people, they&apos;ll look within, not what&apos;s on the outside.&quot; Oh, the way the Nazis looked within?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094738/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Nazi-Dad-Fights-for-His-Childs-Custody-209910241.html">According to NBC 10</a>, &quot;Heath Campbell started wearing the uniform in June 2012 after forming &apos;Hitler&apos;s Order,&apos; a pro-Nazi organization. He was accompanied to the hearing by a member of that organization, Bethanie White. White also wore Third Reich garb -- with swastika patches -- to the proceedings.&quot;</p>
