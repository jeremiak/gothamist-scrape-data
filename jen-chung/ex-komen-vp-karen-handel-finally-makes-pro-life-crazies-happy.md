Komen Foundation, it seems that she can get back into Georgia Republican politics with her head held up high. One Georgia-based GOP strategist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/02/07/resignation-from-komen-could-burnish-politician/">tells the AP</a>, &quot;It&apos;s kind of hard to criticize her now. She comes out of this with some really strong bona fides with pro-life voters across the state.&quot; Right, the pro-lifers who made an issue of her... being &quot;barren,&quot; &quot;infertile&quot; and &quot;desperate.&quot;</p>

<p>Komen&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/susan_g_komen_foundation_ends_plann.php">surprising decision to defund Planned Parenthood</a>&apos;s breast cancer-prevention programs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/04/planned_parenthood_raised_3_million.php">sparked a backlash</a> against the breast cancer charity, forcing Komen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/actually_planned_parenthood_made_65.php">try to spin the news</a>  and ultimately reverse its decision.  Komen sources revealed that Handel, Komen&apos;s VP for public policy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/komen_source_planned_parenthood_def.php">was the driving force behind the defunding</a>, which made since given that Handel&apos;s failed 2010 Georgia gubernatorial platform included a vow to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood (&quot;First, let me be clear, since I am pro-life, I do not support the mission of Planned Parenthood&quot;).  </p>

<p>Handel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/komens_pro-life_anti-planned_parent.php">stepped down from Komen yesterday</a>, claiming responsibility for the move but also laid blame on the rest of Komen, and  is now well-positioned back in Georgia.  Back in 2010, during her gubernatorial campaign, she was slammed by Georgia Right to Life, which brought up her infertility.  The group&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/7723814066.html">president Dan Becker said</a>, &quot;Ms. Handel proclaims herself pro-life; however, she does not meet the 21st century demands of being pro-life. For instance, Handel believes that a child may be aborted based on its manner of conception. When I asked her directly her thoughts on the value of embryos, she answered that she does not believe that an embryonic human is a child.&quot;  Hello, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/26/latest_threat_to_womens_right_to_ch.php">personhood</a>!</p>

<p>But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007235727/http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2010/06/03/georgia-right-to-life-picks-a-fight-with-karen-handel/">Handel&apos;s campaign said that was false, claiming</a>, &quot;First, [GRTL] disagree with her stance regarding exceptions to an abortion ban in cases of rape and incest. Secondly, Karen opposes the group&#x2019;s push to ban invitro fertilization, which has helped so many couples realize their dream of having children. The group has proposed legislation to virtually eliminate invitro. In a meeting with Karen, the group&#x2019;s leadership told her directly that fertility treatments are immoral and that their goal is to completely ban the procedure.&quot; Handel had to address her own infertility&#x2014;&quot;My husband Steve and I tried for nearly ten years to have children. It is the single greatest disappointment in my life, and I can say with certainty that no one in this race cherishes human life more than I do.&quot; But that wasn&apos;t good enough for Becker, who said, &quot;<strong>Someone&#x2019;s desperate right to parenthood - because they&#x2019;re infertile, they&#x2019;re barren, whatever term you want to use - is an emotionally fraught subject that has our highest sympathy. But it should never be attempted to be addressed where a life is taken in the process</strong>.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Now, though, Becker says, &quot;I commend her for&quot; her role in the whole Komen-Planned Parenthood debacle.</p>
