<p>The Navy veteran who is accused of intentionally plowing his car onto Times Square pedestrians, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/18/times_square_lockdown.php">killing one and injuring at least 20 others</a>, said he was &quot;trying to get help&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://nypost.com/2017/05/20/i-was-trying-to-get-help-times-square-driver-says-in-jailhouse-interview/">during what the NY Post called a &quot;weepy&quot; jailhouse interview</a>.</p>

<p>Richard Rojas 26, is being held without bail, as he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/19/times_square_crash_video.php#photo-1">faces murder and attempted murder charges</a>. Authorities say that on May 18, around noon, he made a U-turn from Seventh Avenue at West 42nd Street and mounted the sidewalk, striking pedestrians for three blocks until a bollard stopped him. Surveillance footage shows the terrifying moments [<b>warning: the footage is graphic and may disturbing to some viewers</b>]:</p>

<p>A witness told Gothamist that he thought Rojas was driving at &quot;past 100 MPH.&quot; </p>

<p>Alyssa Elsman, an 18-year-old tourist from Michigan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/19/times_square_victim.php">was killed and died at the scene</a>; her 13-year-old sister Ava suffered a collapse lung, broken pelvis, broken leg and broken teeth. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/20/father_of_teen_killed_in_times_squa.php">Their father Thomas Elsman said</a>, &quot;There&apos;s no words. I want to scream... My first born daughter is gone. My heart died in New York yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>One of Rojas&apos; friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170518/times-square-theater-district/who-is-richard-rojas-driver-times-square-seventh-avenue?_ga=2.71416211.1457088673.1495375472-533795570.1487519429">explained that he had turned to drinking</a> to escape dark thoughts. Harrison Ramos said, &quot;I asked him to get help, but he didn&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;s not a terrorist. He served his country. He loved his country. He&#x2019;s not a bad person. He just needs help.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://nypost.com/2017/05/20/i-was-trying-to-get-help-times-square-driver-says-in-jailhouse-interview/">In the interview with the Post</a>, Rojas said, &quot;I was trying to get help. I wanted to fix my life. I wanted to get a job. Get a girlfriend.&quot; He claimed that he had recently spoken to a mental health counselor, who said that he&apos;d be back in touch on Monday. </p><blockquote> The unemployed vet had allegedly yelled at police, &#x201C;You were supposed to shoot me! I wanted to kill them,&#x201D; sources said. He later told cops he had laced the pot he smoked with PCP.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I guess it was laced with something,&#x201D; said Rojas, who claims not to recall any of the statements he made after he was arrested.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The last thing I remember is driving in my car,&#x201D; he recalled. &#x201C;Then, I woke up in the precinct ... I was terrified.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/nyregion/times-square-crash-driver-richard-rojas.html">had said that Rojas&apos; family told him</a> Rojas suffered from &quot;mental health issues going back to childhood that, like so many other such situations in our society, went unaddressed, even during the time he was in the U.S. military.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Rojas said, &quot;I just want to apologize to all the victims&#x2019; families ... I want to apologize to my mom.&quot;</p>

<p>Other victims include a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170519/greenwood-heights/william-nelson-sr-critical-injuries-bellevue-hospital-times-square-crash">retired teacher from Park Slope</a>, who has a broken leg and bleeding in the brain, and a high school senior from NJ, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/n-high-schooler-critical-condition-times-square-crash-article-1.3182052">who was in NYC for senior skip day</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas Elsman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205236/http://www.fox5ny.com/news/255861869-story">had told Fox 5</a>, &quot;If it was an accident I would forgive. The fact that I found out he was on drugs, and then also today in court said &apos;I wanted to kill everyone&apos; and he wanted to go suicide-by-cop, that&apos;s intent. He knew what he was doing and I don&apos;t care what happens to him.&quot;</p>
