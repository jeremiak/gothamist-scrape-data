Queens DA Richard Brown also announced that a second suspected Crips gang member was arrested for Miller&apos;s murder, &quot;This case is another example of the mindless gun-related violence and street gang mentality that turns our streets into battlefields and too often takes innocent lives and recklessly endangers public safety.&quot;</p>

<p>Miller, a freshman at Campus Magnet High School in Cambria Heights, had been walking from school to McDonald&apos;s last Friday when a fight between the Bloods and Crips broke out.  Miller was fatally hit while a 17-year-old car wash employee was wounded.  DA Brown said that Gregory Calas, 18, was arrested and awaiting arraignment on second-degree murder, second-degree assault and other charges.  Earlier this week, Nnonso Ekwegbalu, 16, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203222/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/05/teenager_confesses_to_shooting_inno.php">apparently confessed</a> to shooting Miller and faces similar charges.</p>

<p>Calas&apos;s mother reacted to her son&apos;s arrest, telling the News, &quot;They have the wrong guy. He was there but there was no evidence he shot anyone. My son isn&apos;t the kind of person who runs around with a gun. This is scary. I hope they catch the right person.&quot;  And Miller&apos;s grieving mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203222/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/10/10/2009-10-10_13yearold_kevin_miller_.html">said at the funeral</a>, &quot;Maybe it will wake up some young people who are into gangs or thinking about gangs and they&apos;ll just see it&apos;s just so wrong.&quot;  </p>
