<p>Back in August, we noticed that the Squibb Park Pedestrian Bridge, a.k.a the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006115016/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/this_brooklyn_pedestrian_bridge_wil.php#photo-1">Most Important Pedestrian Bridge Of Our Time</a> (it connects Brooklyn Heights to the Brooklyn Bridge Park), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006115016/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/29/squibb_bridge_false_flag.php">had been closed for a few weeks</a>. Then, on September 8th, we were told the bridge was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006115016/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/08/squibb_park_pedestrian_bridge_fail.php">being monitored but would open the next week</a>. Now it turns out bridge won&apos;t be back <em>until the spring</em>.</p>

<p>The bridge has always been bouncy (it&apos;s 450 feet long, zig-zagging over Furman Street)&#x2014;here&apos;s what it looked like last year:</p>

<p>But over the summer, it felt creaky, slanted and somewhat terrifying especially with the many people crossing it and the winds off the East River. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006115016/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/nyregion/Squibb-Park-Bridge-bounces-too-far-and-is-closed-until-the-spring-.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">The NY TImes reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>On Friday, however, park officials said that Squibb Park Bridge, which cost $5 million, would remain closed until spring as engineers continued to study its movements.

<p>&#x201C;At this point, because of the movement we notice, it would be overly optimistic to say we could solve this in two to three weeks,&#x201D; said Regina Myer, president of Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation, the nonprofit group that oversees development and operations there.</p>

<p>The new bridge, which is designed with trail bridge technology that gives it a little bounce, provides a faster way to access Brooklyn Bridge Park from Squibb Park in Brooklyn Heights.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We need to fully understand the bridge,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;and we want the public to know that we are really erring on the side of caution.&#x201D;</p>

<p>... Initially, investigators thought that the bridge&#x2019;s stability might have been affected by the construction of Pierhouse, a mixed-use development that is rising on an adjacent parcel. But it is unclear if that is the case, they said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Myer added, &quot;We&#x2019;re thoroughly committed to the design. We love having this beautiful wooden bridge to access the park.&quot;</p>

<p>It sure has pretty views, even if it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006115016/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/5_million_brooklyn_pedestrian_bridg_1.php">doesn&apos;t save you any time</a> from Brooklyn Heights:</p>

<p>Perhaps when the Pierhouse is completed, it&apos;ll shield the bridge. On the other hand, it could create a wind tunnel!</p>
