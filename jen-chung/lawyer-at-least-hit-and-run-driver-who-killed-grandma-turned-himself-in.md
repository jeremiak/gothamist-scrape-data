Brian McGurk, who faces a felony charge of leaving the scene of a fatal accident, had the case adjourned until June and sported a very different look than last week: He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051022/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/staten_island_hit-run_suspect.html">shaved his beard and was wearing a suit</a> (here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051022/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/si_man_who_mowed_down_bXRo5Bbcx3Rf9ieYAvxjMK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Staten%20Island">another comparison</a>).<p></p>

<p>McGurk&apos;s SUV hit Clara Almazo, 57, on Cary Avenue last Thursday night.  Almazo was able to push her 8-year-old grandson out of the way (the child says he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051022/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/at_funeral_boy_saved_by_grandmother.php">yelled at McGurk, but McGurk wasn&apos;t paying attention</a>), but she was apparently sent flying 10-20 feet by the vehicle.  McGurk did not slow down or stop and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051022/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/07/hit_run_driver_turned_himself_in_3.php">turned himself later on</a>.  </p>

<p>While McGurk and his lawyer Matthew Zuntag did not take questions from the media, Zuntag gave a statement. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051022/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/full_statement_from_lawyer_for.html">read the whole thing at SILive</a>, but here are some excerpts:</p><blockquote>The events of April 5, 2012 that lead to the death of Mrs. Almazo were undoubtedly tragic. However, not every death is a crime. Thousands of people are tragically killed daily on the roadways of America-- both motorists and pedestrians -- and a very small percentage of those deaths result in a criminal prosecution. Indeed, Mrs. Almazo&apos;s death is not the issue here -- it is whether or not Brian reported this accident in a reasonable manner. Whether Brian stopped his car or not Mrs. Almazo would have died. For her death Brian and his family are sorrowful and regretful. This is the kind of accident that can happen to anyone, and there are no words to express Brian&apos;s sorrow for the loss of life here...<p></p>

<p>It is important here to realize that Brian did do the right thing. He went to the precinct as soon as he was physically able to do so. He did not hide from the authorities, as has occurred in dozens of accidents throughout the area where death has occurred and those many culprits remain at large. He did not cover up the damage to his vehicle and avoid the police as occurred a few years ago when ALLMIR LEKPERIC caused the death of PETER and LILLIAN SABADOS on New Dorp Lane, tried to cover up his crime by reporting his vehicle stolen, and had a revoked license. Here, Brian has an excellent driving record. Here, Brian allowed the police complete access to his vehicle.</p></blockquote>In other words, defense lawyers LOVE IT when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051022/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/23/defense_attorneys_love_it_when_driv.php">drivers leave the scene of an accident</a>.<p></p>

<p>Zuntag also noted that McGurk, a 21-year postal carrier, is a lifelong Staten Islander.  </p>
