<p>A fire broke out in a home in Far Rockaway late last night, and two young children died from their injuries. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140421234808/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/20/far-rockaway-fire-leaves-two-4-year-olds-dead/">A neighbor told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The firemen were taking the kids&#x2019; limp bodies out of the house, and it was devastating. This morning, I get up and I heard that they died &#x2014; I&#x2019;m sad. I cried. It&#x2019;s hurtful. Look at our babies. They&#x2019;re angels.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the police and FDNY, there was a 911 call at 11:51 p.m., and responders were on the scene five minutes later. The fire was in the basement of 10-31 Bay 30th Street, and five people were removed from the residents. Three children, all four-years-old, were removed as were a 55-year-old woman and 63-year-old man. </p>

<p>Two of the children, a boy and a girl, were pronounced dead at St. John&apos;s Hospital. They were identified as Jai&apos;Launi and Ayina Tinglin. WCBS 2 reports the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140421234808/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/20/far-rockaway-fire-leaves-two-4-year-olds-dead/">children were half-siblings</a> and apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140421234808/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Children-Killed-Fire-Far-Rockaway-Queens-Bay-30th-Street-255920541.html">died of smoke inhalation</a>. The boy&apos;s twin sister was the other four-year-old who survived the fire.</p>

<p>Their grandmother, Estella Jackson, 80, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140421234808/http://nypost.com/2014/04/20/two-children-dead-in-far-rockaway-fire/">told the Post</a>, &quot;The children were in the basement with their grandfather, they were visiting.&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY says the fire was under control by 1:17 a.m.; they are still investigating the cause of the blaze.</p>
