AccuWeather says, &quot;The nor&apos;easter is destined to be the biggest storm of the new year so far for New York City to Boston. Unlike the last storm, this one will &apos;not&apos; miss these areas... The blowing snow will create near-zero visibility at times.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>The Department of Sanitation is on stand-by and even the USPS sent out a notice saying that pick-up of mail would conclude by noon in all five boroughs!  As for accumulation, one guess is that NYC could see between eight and 14 inches; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926010213/http://wcbstv.com/local/winter.storm.nyc.2.1479069.html">WCBS 2&apos;s John Elliott said</a>, &quot;The six to ten inches in the Big Apple could easily be 10 to 18 inches in parts of the Garden State... It&apos;s going to be a big deal. It&apos;s going to be an all day thing.<strong> You&apos;ll be able to get here just fine, if you head out early enough, but the problem will be getting home</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking of getting around, the MTA wants customers to check the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926010213/http://mta.info/">MTA.info website</a> for the latest information as its various divisions work to prepare for the storm. Here are details from the MTA&apos;s press release:</p>

<blockquote>Tomorrow morning, rush-hour service on subways and buses, the Long Island Rail Road, and bridges and tunnels is expected to remain normal. Metro-North Railroad will operate on a reduced schedule, with about 70% of inbound morning rush-hour trains running. As the day progresses, service on Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road will differ from a normal weekday schedule, with more trains being added between noon and 4 p.m., and fewer trains operating during the usual height of the evening rush hour. Customers should visit MTA.info to find schedules for tomorrow&#x2019;s trains.<br><br>
 
Subway service should remain on or close to regular service levels during rush hours and middays, but delays and disruptions are possible as snow accumulates on tracks and streets, and express subway service may be reduced or eliminated on some routes during evening and overnight hours as underground express tracks are put to use for train storage.<br><br>
 
The steps that the MTA agencies will take to ensure continued operations throughout and immediately after the storm include the following:</blockquote>
