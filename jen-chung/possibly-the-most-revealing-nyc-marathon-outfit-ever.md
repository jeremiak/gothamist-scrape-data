Based on that, it appears the runner is 27-year-old Jack Markham of Great Britain, who finished with a time of 4:33:29.  And for the truly brave, Flickr user Lori (ldp1109) says she saw Markham many times because he was running near her brother--she has more photographs with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151007004751/http://flickr.com/photos/54421714@N00/2999529399/">front</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151007004751/http://flickr.com/photos/54421714@N00/2999529449/">back</a> views.
