</div></div>					<p>Time for an <em>awwww</em> break!  Five peregrine falcon chicks were born atop the towers of MTA bridges!  The MTA says that three were born at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, while the Throgs Neck and Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridges each welcomed one chick.  Some details about the fuzzy birds, which are 3-4 weeks old (their talons are already the size of an adult human hand!), from the MTA:<br>
</p><ul>	<li>The Verrazano-Narrows falcons are two girls and one boy; the other Throgs Neck and Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges falcons are both boys. All chicks were banded by a state volunteer wildlife expert.</li><li>The falcons at the Verrazano nest at a tower that&apos;s 693 feet above the water and they have returned every mating season since the MTA Bridges and Tunnels team replaced the falcons&apos; original nesting box on the lower roadway in 2000.</li><li>The Throgs Neck Bridge&apos;s nesting box used to be on the Queens tower, but was moved to the Bronx tower (360 feet above the water) in 2007, due to a painting project.  Throgs Neck Maintenance Superintendent Ray Higgins explained, &quot;We have a good relationship with the falcons because we&#x2019;re like absentee landlords. We set them up with a nice place to live and then try not to bother them.&quot;</li> <li>The Marine Parkway nesting box is 215 feet above the water on the Rockaway side, &quot;inside an old gun turret that was installed during World War II.&quot;  The MTA plans some renovations for the nesting box, because the wood inside is split.</li></ul>Falcons love high perches because they &quot;provide an excellent vantage point for hunting prey, including pigeons and small birds&quot; (falcons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519232634/http://www.55water.com/falcons/">hang out at the top of 55 Water Street</a> in lower Manhattan). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519232634/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/news/falcon.shtml">More details on falcons</a> from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection.  Remember these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519232634/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/23/baby_falcons_at.php">baby falcons from the Throgs Neck Bridge</a> back in 2007?<p></p>
