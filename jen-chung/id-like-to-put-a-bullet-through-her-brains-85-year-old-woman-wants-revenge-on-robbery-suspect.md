<p>The 86-year-old woman whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120157/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/12/wheelchair_mugger.php">purse was snatched away</a>&#x2014;while she sat in her wheelchair&#x2014;is very, very mad. Bernice Starnes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120157/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/elderly-woman-wheelchair-robbed-bronx-article-1.2788416">told reporters yesterday</a>, &quot;I want to get a gun and shoot her damn brains out. I want to put her brains in the ocean so the animals will eat it up.&quot;</p>

<p>Starnes, a former nanny, was sitting outside her apartment building at East 179 Street and Marmion Avenue in the Bronx on Sunday morning when a woman came up to her. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120157/http://pix11.com/2016/09/12/woman-86-tearfully-speaks-out-after-being-robbed-while-sitting-in-wheelchair-outside-bronx-home/">The senior citizen recalled</a>, &quot;She came up to me and I said good morning. She said, &apos;oh it is a good morning,&apos; then grabbed my pocketbook and started to run.&quot;</p>

<p>Since she wasn&apos;t able to chase after her, Starnes said she yelled, &quot;Give me my bag, give me my bag&quot; as well as &quot;I want to put my foot up your ass and my fist down your throat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s money I worked for,&quot; Starnes said of the cash in the purse, which she said she wanted to use for a future trip. </p>

<p>Officers from the 48th Precinct took a collection and gave her $130, which surprised and touched Starnes:</p>
