<p>After released a &quot;Wanted&quot; poster and questioning someone who may have been involved with an escape, law enforcement officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054734/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121336664114871731.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">doubt that hedge fund founder Samuel Israel killed himself</a>.  Israel, who was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for swindling $450 million out of investors, was supposed to arrive at federal prison on Monday, but instead his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054734/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/10/convicted_hedge_funders_mysterious.php">empty SUV was found</a> the Bear Mountain Bridge. The words &quot;Suicide is Painless&quot; were written on the dusty hood, suggesting suicide.</p>

<p>Or a staged suicide:  Both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054734/http://www.wnbc.com/news/16588491/detail.html?dl=mainclick">WNBC</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054734/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6202114">WABC</a> report that authorities had spoken to someone whose car was seen on the bridge, a possible getaway driver.  Per WNBC, &quot;Officials said there is a chance Israel is still in the U.S. and they are following some leads suggesting he may now be making his getaway in an RV-type motor home.&quot; </p>

<p>The U.S. Marshals released a &quot;Wanted&quot; poster of Israel, noting that he&apos;s armed and dangerous, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054734/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/business/13bayou.html?ref=business">that&apos;s standard language</a>, since most people on the run definitely don&apos;t want to be caught. And the police say they will continue to search the Hudson River, &quot;We&apos;ll continue to search, if it takes a week, a month, you know, the rest of the summer.&quot;</p>
