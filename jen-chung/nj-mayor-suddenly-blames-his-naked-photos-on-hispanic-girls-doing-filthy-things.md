                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_04_jerhealy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807023221im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_jerhealy.jpg" width="240" height="300"> <br> <i style=" width:240px; ;display:block"> Jerramiah Healy (via his campaign website)</i></div> Jersey City Mayor Jerramiah Healy is no stranger to weirdness&#x2014;he was convicted for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807023221/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/23/nyregion/23mayor.html">scuffling with police in 2007</a>&#x2014;but an incident from his 2004 days as a city councilman is being revisited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807023221/http://blog.nj.com/njv_tom_moran/2013/05/moran_jersey_city_mayor_jerram.html">because of a Star-Ledger column</a> published yesterday: &quot;This is a guy who was photographed naked on his front porch at 2 a.m. during the 2004 campaign, and won the race anyway.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In 2004, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807023221/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E4DB143BF933A25753C1A9629C8B63">the NY Times reported</a>, &quot;Mr. Healy, a diabetic, said that photographs showing him naked were the result of a night out drinking six to eight beers over a three-hour period&#x2014;though he is still scratching his head and wondering how he ended up on the porch. &apos;I wish I recall how I got back out there,&apos; he said. &apos;But I don&apos;t.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Suddenly, nine years later and facing re-election, Healy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807023221/http://blog.nj.com/njv_tom_moran/2013/05/moran_jersey_city_mayor_jerram.html">spoke to Star-Ledger columnist Tom Moran</a>:</p><blockquote>Last week he offered a new version of the story with a bizarre sexual twist. Now he says three young women woke him by banging trash cans outside his house, so he rose from bed, wrapped a towel around himself, and went to investigate.<p></p>

<p>Take the naked photo incident. At the time, Healy acknowledged he had been drinking and said he could not remember what happened. &#x201C;Three Hispanic girls, young kids,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;So I go out on the porch and they pulled the towel off me. Now I start laughing, and then they started doing other stuff. I said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m old enough to be your grandfather.&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D;</p>

<p>What other stuff? &#x201C;It was filthy,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I chased them away, and I just sat down.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And that, he says, is when a political enemy snapped the photograph. Why he would be changing this story now, in the final stretch of the campaign, is anyone&#x2019;s guess.</p></blockquote>His rival, Councilman Steven Fulop, told the Star-Ledger, &quot;It&apos;s another embarrassment in a statewide newspaper courtesy of Jerry Healy and it&apos;s sad that 10 years after the fact, he now decides to blame Hispanic women for his personal problems.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Councilwoman Nidia Lopez said, &quot;I think the Hispanic community deserves an apology and I think our mayor needs psychological help ... For this mayor to degrade Hispanic women by creating this wild story eight years later ... three young kids molested him, he&apos;s laughing about it. How the hell did he know they were Hispanic?&quot; She added, &quot;When I ran in 2009, I asked him if that was really him on the stoop, and he said, &apos;I don&apos;t know baby. I was so drunk I don&apos;t remember.&apos; Those were his exact words to me .... There is absolutely something wrong with this picture.&quot;<br>
