Amauri Azcona, 17, a Brooklyn resident, was charged with attempted rape, sex abuse, assault and strangulation.</p>

<p>The victim had told police she was followed into Theatre Alley, where the suspect &quot;threw her to the ground and attempted to rape her.&quot; The suspect apparently pulled down her underwear, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523112504/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-hunt-city-hall-perv-article-1.1316295?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reported</a> that he &quot;penetrated with his finger and told her not to scream.&quot;</p>
