<p>Police arrested a suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170529170357/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/28/woman_slashed_in_the_face_on_5_trai.php">accused of slashing a woman</a> on a subway on Saturday morning. The attack was apparently provoked when the victim moved her baby, who was sitting in a stroller, away from a female passenger. The suspect then cut the mother in the face, according to police.</p>

<p>Just before 11 a.m., police officers responded to a 911 call at the subway station at Grand Central Terminal, where they found the slashed 31-year-old woman who had been on a southbound 5 train. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The wounded was a &quot;6-inch gash...  from her head down to her left eye,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170529170357/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/05/28/midtown-subway-slashing-2/">WCBS 2 reports</a>. </p>

<p>The suspect fled the scene after the slashing, according to the NYPD. But cops say after a search of the immediate area, Jacqueline Sanjurjo, 53, was arrested. </p>

<p>A source said that the victim&#x2014;identified by family members as Anna Martinez&#x2014;and Sanjurjo did not know each other, though both boarded the subway at 125th Street. The women were apparently sitting next to each other when Martinez decided to move the baby&apos;s stroller to the other side, away from Sanjurjo. </p>

<p>That&apos;s when Sanjurjo allegedly lashed out, without saying anything. The baby was not injured.</p>

<p>Sanjurjo was charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and acting in a manner injurious to a child. The source said Sanjurjo had a &quot;lengthy criminal history.&quot;</p>
