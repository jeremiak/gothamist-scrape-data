<p>A man accused of<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014439/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/31/woman_sexually_assaulted_in_her_inw.php"> threatening, sexually assaulting and then robbing</a> a woman in her Manhattan apartment was arrested yesterday&#x2014;and authorities believe he&apos;s linked to another, similar sexual assault-and-robbery in the neighborhood, as well as two taxi cab robberies.</p>

<p>Just before 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, October 30th, a 26-year-old woman reported to police that while she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014439/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Suspect-Charged-Sexual-Assault-Robbery-Woman-Inwood-Apartment-399429501.html">video-chatting with her husband</a>, who was out of town, a man had entered her apartment near West 213th Street in Inwood and then threatened her with a screwdriver. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014439/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-arrested-charged-in-sexual-assault-of-two-women-in-inwood/1583147/">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;She screamed, and the suspect took out the screwdriver and said, &apos;I will kill you.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The intruder sexually assaulted her after demanding to know where the valuables in the apartment were; WABC 7 adds, &quot;He tied her hands with nylon, told her to lie down and climbed out the kitchen window. He stole her MacBook, iPad, two cell phones and $300.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. </p>

<p>Yesterday, Yenson Reyes, 35, was arrested and charged with a criminal sex act, robbery, burglary and unlawful imprisonment. Apparently Reyes was back at the apartment building while police and TV crews were on the scene. From PIX 11:</p><blockquote> Detectives believe the suspect walked right passed them and PIX11&apos;s crew during the investigation on West 213th Street Monday afternoon. Investigators used PIX11 video footage (watch below) as part of their evidence, in an effort to identify Reyes. NYPD members assigned to the case are all but certain he left the scene of the crime hours after returning. Police wouldn&apos;t discuss any further details.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>A police source said that he was also linked to an October 6th incident, also in Inwood, near West 212th Street. Reyes allegedly entered an apartment and threatened a 66-year-old woman and a 17-year-old girl with a kitchen knife before groping the girl over her clothing and fleeing with electronics and other property. He is being charged with robbery, burglary, sexual abuse, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. </p>

<p>The taxi cab robberies that Reyes allegedly perpetrated also occurred in Inwood; Reyes&apos;s address is 140 Seaman Avenue in the neighborhood. Police say that in one of the robberies he threatened the driver with a handgun.</p>

He was cut loose in both instances. &apos;It&#x2019;s the court system and justice system failing these people,&apos; one police source said.&quot;<br>
