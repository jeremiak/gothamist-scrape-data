<p>A pack of politicians gathered this morning outside of a Midtown Manhattan SUNY building to protest the closing of Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn&#x2014;and two got arrested. Mayoral candidate and Public Advocate Bill de Blasio was handcuffed, as was City Councilman Steven Levin. The police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151653/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/185261/lich-rally-ends-in-mayoral-hopeful-s-arrest">also arrested others for obstructing traffic</a> and said they would be charged with disorderly conduct. </p>

<p>SUNY trustees had voted on the hospital&apos;s closure earlier this year, and while a judge blocked it for a while, services have dwindled as doctors have resigned. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151653/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/07/10/de-blasio-arrested-at-lich-protest/">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, de Blasio and other protesters &quot;blocked the hospital&#x2019;s entrance for about 20 minutes. He delivered a speech saying he wouldn&#x2019;t move until he received answers about plans for the Cobble Hill hospital. &apos;We want to know what&#x2019;s going on,&apos; Mr. de Blasio said in the speech. &apos;We&#x2019;re going to block this entrance until we do.&apos;&quot; And here&apos;s footage:</p>

<p>Residents in Cobble Hill, as well as professionals, like nurses and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151653/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/lich-bars-ambulances-bringing-patients-cobble-hill-hosp-article-1.1378085">EMTs</a>, have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151653/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/184206/lich-diverts-ambulances--transfers-patients-from-critical-care-units">been worried about the hospital&apos;s closing</a>. Other mayoral candidates, like City Comptroller John Liu and former Congressman Anthony Weiner, were also at the protest (hospital closings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151653/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/super-pac-plans-mail-campaign-christine-quinn-article-1.1338731">are a big deal to potential voters</a>), though they weren&apos;t handcuffed with plastic ties. </p>

<p>de Blasio was released from the Midtown South Precinct around 1:20 p.m. and charged with disorderly conduct. His office had released a statement on his behalf at about the same time, &quot;We&apos;re going to lose Long Island College in a matter of weeks if we don&apos;t act now; we&apos;re going to lose Interfaith Hospital. We have to stop hospital closures in this city. People are going to be much sicker in this city if we keep losing hospitals; people are going to lose their jobs. We have to fight it.&quot; </p>

<p>de Blasio has been arrested at protests before (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151653/http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YD381_NYDEBL_D_20130710122815.jpg">once with Steve Buscemi</a> while protesting the closing of Engine Company 204 in Brooklyn) but it&apos;s impossible to forget that there is an election around the corner:</p>
