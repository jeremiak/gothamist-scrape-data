Apparently Christian Ferninand, 22, thought his teen girlfriend was pregnant, and wanted her to get an abortion.<p></p>

<p>In January 2013, police found the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011350/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/burned_body_found_on_brooklyn_beach.php">partially burned body of Shaniesha Forbes</a>, a freshman at the Academy for Young Writers, in Gerritsen Beach. Investigators said that Shaniesha, who met the six-years older Forbes on Facebook, had told him she was pregnant but refused to get an abortion. So Forbes smothered her with a pillow in his cousin&apos;s Brooklyn apartment until she stopped breathing. Then he tried to get rid of the body, first stashing it in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011350/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/maine-man-accused-killing-shaniesha-forbes-thought-pregnant-article-1.1345779">suitcase on the building&apos;s rooftop</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011350/http://nypost.com/2014/12/02/man-found-guilty-of-killing-teen-girlfriend-he-thought-was-pregnant/">From the Post</a>:</p><blockquote>He doused her corpse with Axe body spray and then used a Bic lighter to char her body before stuffing it in a suitcase and tossing it into Gerritsen Bay, court papers state.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;The defendant hoped that the saltwater would destroy any evidence the flames didn&#x2019;t,&#x2019;&#x2019; prosecutor Robert Walsh said in closing arguments.</p></blockquote>The Medical Examiner&apos;s office confirmed that that Shaniesha <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011350/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/man_arrested_for_murder_of_14-year-.php">actually wasn&apos;t pregnant</a>.<p></p>

<p>Police confronted Ferdinand with texts he sent to Shaniesha, and after he confessed, he reportedly asked, &quot;Do you think I can get some kind of community service?&quot;</p>

<p>Ferdinand will next face sentencing, and Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson said, &quot;The defendant brutally took the life of a 14 year-old girl all because he believed that she was pregnant. We will now seek the maximum at sentencing to ensure that we get justice for the victim.&quot; The maximum would be life in prison, the minimum 25 years. </p>

<p>A juror <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011350/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/maine-man-accused-killing-shaniesha-forbes-thought-pregnant-article-1.1345779">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;It was open and shut... Young girls should be careful who they hook up with on the Internet. But he should not have done what he did.&quot;</p>
