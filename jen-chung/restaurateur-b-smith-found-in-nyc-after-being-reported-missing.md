<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011436/http://bsmith.com/">Restaurateur</a> and former model B. Smith was found in Manhattan yesterday, after being reported missing from her Long Island home on Tuesday. Smith, who has early onset Alzheimer&apos;s, was found at a Midtown diner by her daughter.</p>

<p>Smith&apos;s husband, Dan Gasby, was expecting Smith home in Sag Harbor earlier this week, but she didn&apos;t show up. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011436/http://sagharboronline.com/sagharborexpress/page-1/b-smith-found-in-new-york-city-34851">She apparently</a> &quot;took a Hampton Jitney from New York to Sag Harbor, where the couple owns a home, on Tuesday night, but apparently got off in Southampton and was last seen there at about 8 p.m. on Tuesday.&quot;</p>

<p>The bus driver told Gasby there was a confused passenger who got off the bus. Smith was spotted today around lunch at La Parisienne. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011436/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-model-restaurateur-b-smith-missing-hamptons-article-1.2024772?utm_content=buffer2fce8&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">A waiter told the Daily News</a>, &quot;She was here with an older woman. They were just regular customers. They paid and left. She was normal.&quot; The News reports, &quot;It was not immediately clear where Smith, one of the first African-American models to grace the cover of Mademoiselle, had spent the night &#x2014; or what kind of shape she was in after her ordeal.&quot;</p>

<p>In June, Smith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011436/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/b-smith-and-her-diagnosis-of-alzheimers/">revealed she had early onset Alzheimer&apos;s</a>. The diagnosis shocked the couple, as Gasby noted: &quot;I mean, she&apos;s got the blood pressure of an athlete. You know, she&apos;s 64 years old. I mean, she can wear a bikini. And you curse God. You get angry. You say, &apos;Well, how could this happen?&apos;&quot; Smith said, &quot;Even with Alzheimer&apos;s, I think that things are gonna work out. I&apos;m gonna do my best to make it work out for me, and for as many people that I can possibly help, too.&quot;</p>
