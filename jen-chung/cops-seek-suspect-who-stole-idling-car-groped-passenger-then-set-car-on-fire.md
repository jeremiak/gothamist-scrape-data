<p>A car thief ended up setting a vehicle on fire&#x2014;after molesting a woman sleeping in the backseat. Now police have surveillance video of the suspect and hope the public can help identify him.</p>

<p>The grand larceny occurred last Sunday, at 2 a.m. in Queens. According to the NYPD, around Springfield Boulevard and Merrick Boulevard, the suspect &quot;sat inside the 29 year-old male victim&apos;s unattended running car and drove away. A second victim, a 26 year-old female, was asleep in the back seat of the vehicle and awoke to find the suspect groping her.&quot;</p>

<p>She managed to fight him off and get out of the car near 135 Street and Farmers Boulevard, police say. Then, the suspect allegedly &quot;drove off and parked the car in front of 140-45 Coombs Street where he set it on fire before fleeing on foot in an unknown direction.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Police describe the suspect as bald and 220 pounds and was last seen wearing a black shirt, green and black plaid shorts and blue socks.</p>
