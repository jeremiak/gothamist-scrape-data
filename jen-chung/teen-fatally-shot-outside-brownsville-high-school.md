Malachi Cotton was standing at a city bus stop by when, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203147/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/10/27/2009-10-27_teen_shot_dead_outside_school.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Three men approached him around 3:15 p.m., police said. The armed trio, who were targeting Cotton, fired several shots at him and then fled.&quot;</p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203147/http://ny1.com/7-brooklyn-news-content/top_stories/107959/teen-shot--killed-in-front-of-brooklyn-school">told NY1</a>, &quot;When I came outside I saw the boy laying on the floor holding his stomach rolling. And people were telling him to stay on his back and don&apos;t move and don&apos;t try to speak, because the ambulance was on the way,. And he tried to say that he got shot and that was saying he was shot and that he was in a lot of pain.&quot; Cotton died at Brookdale Hospital.  Other students fled back into the school; NY1 says the school locked the doors and contacted parents to pick up children. </p>

<p>A vigil will be held outside the school tonight; his girlfriend told the News, &quot;He was going to be 17 [today]. We were planning to get married.&quot; Police are still searching for the shooters.  </p>
