<p>Remember the claims of racial profiling and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131020000122/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/apple_3.php">discrimination against Chinese people</a> at the SoHo Apple Store, as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131020000122/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/07/apple_discrimination_investigation_underway.php">one in the Meatpacking District</a>?  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131020000122/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/technology/23iphone.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times confirms</a> what was suspected: Many Chinese immigrants are buying Apple products to be resold in China, where they aren&apos;t available (yet). </p>

<blockquote>Participants in New York and Shanghai say the process works like this: People wait in line at an Apple store to buy the newest iPhone for $600, paying a premium to skip the AT&amp;T; contract. They then sell the phones to middlemen, usually at electronics stores in Chinatown, for about $750.

<p>The phones are shipped off to China, where the iPhone 4 is not yet on sale, and are distributed to local shops and e-commerce sites, where they sell for as much as $1,000. Once the phones have been &#x201C;unlocked&#x201D; to break their ties to AT&amp;T;, they can be used with local carriers.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>People in line told the Times they were &quot;buying the iPhone for a friend&quot; and if they went in the store to buy another, &quot;I have two friends.&quot; And friends say that the import-export business pays: A Sunset Park resident explained, &quot;Many workers make a few dollars an hour working in restaurants or factories. If they wait in line for an hour at the Apple store to buy and sell phones, they can make $300 in a single morning.&quot;  They better make their money fast&#x2014;the iPhone 4 is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131020000122/http://shanghaiist.com/2010/09/20/get_iphone_4s_on_saturday_at_new_sh.php">on sale this Saturday in China</a>.</p>
