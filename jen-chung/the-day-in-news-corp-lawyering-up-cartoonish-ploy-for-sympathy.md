<p>News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch may be two days removed from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/rupert_murdoch_this_is_the_most_hum.php">his testimony</a> (and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/someone_tried_to_accost_rupert_murd.php">pie throwing incident</a>) in front of a Parliamentary hearing about the phone-hacking scandal at his now-closed British tabloid, The News of the World, and, sure, maybe people just think he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/murdochs_doddery_testimony_nearly_f.php">really clueless and old and sounds like Crocodile Dundee</a>... but that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/07/21/2011-07-21_murdoch_hiring_big_legal_guns_may_fear_scandal_spreading_to_us.html">hasn&apos;t stopped News Corp. from hiring criminal lawyers</a> here in the U.S.!  </p>

<p>Former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White and former Attorney General Michael Mukasey were hired by the News Corp. independent board. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/07/21/2011-07-21_murdoch_hiring_big_legal_guns_may_fear_scandal_spreading_to_us.html"> According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The FBI is looking into whether any News Corp. employees hacked phones in the United States, and whether the bribes the midtown-based company has admitted were paid to cops in Britain violate the corrupt practices act. The 1977 law cracks down on U.S. companies using bribery abroad.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, one of Murdoch&apos;s remaining British papers, The Times of London, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/cartoon-in-murdochs-paper-calls-hacking-inquiry-a-distraction-from-african-famine/?hp">published an editorial cartoon</a> featuring starving Somali children&#x2014;and one with a stomach saying, &quot;I&#x2019;ve had a bellyful of phone-hacking,&quot; with word &quot;Priorities...&quot; in the corner.  This might be the comic equivalent of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/18/wall_street_journal_to_non-murdoch.php">Wall Street Journal&apos;s editorial</a>.</p>

<p>And let&apos;s not forget about that new Murdoch inner-circle figure, former NYC Schools Chancellor Joel Klein. When Klein left the Department of Education last fall, he was going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/09/schools_chancellor_resigns_to_join.php">head News Corp.&apos;s education technology division</a> (and, hey, connections probably helped News Corp. land <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/10/what_cronyism_state_awards_27m_cont.php">a $27 million deal with the city</a>). But with the scandal, Klein has been swept to the center of the maelstrom to do damage control and investigate News Corp. internally.  WNYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2011/jul/20/why-ex-nyc-schools-chancellor-joel-klein-murdochs-fixer/">looks at why Klein was tapped</a> and the Daily Beast&apos;s Lloyd Grove <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144230/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/07/21/joel-klein-is-rupert-murdoch-s-secret-weapon-at-news-corp.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29&amp;utm_content=Googl">calls him Murdoch&apos;s consigliere</a>. </p>
