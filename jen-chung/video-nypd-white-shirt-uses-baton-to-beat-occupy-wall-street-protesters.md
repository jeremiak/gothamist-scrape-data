Mounted police officers. Barricades block Broadway and Liberty.&quot;  And then there&apos;s this video of a high-ranking NYPD official (wearing a white shirt) batoning protesters who are trying to breach a barrier:</p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005854/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/video_cop_hopes_his_nightstick_will.php">here&apos;s video</a> of one cop he hoped his nightstick would get a &quot;workout&quot; tonight.</p>

<p>Police apparently started to pepper spray protesters when they tried to cross over to Wall Street. While some protesters returned to Zuccotti Park, others remained and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005854/http://live.nydailynews.com/Event/Occupy_Wall_Street_Protests_Rock_New_York_City?Page=0">tried to pass the police barricades</a>. Police also kettled protesters there.  The Daily News reporter Christina Boyle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005854/http://twitter.com/#!/christinaboyle/status/121773383015858177">Tweeted after 10 p.m.</a>, &quot;Helicopter hovering overhead as crowd go east on Platt St then south on Pearl. Don&apos;t think it&apos;s more than 200 walking. Majority are young.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier in the evening, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005854/http://twitter.com/#!/buckyturco/status/121734122858229760">Bucky Turco Tweeted</a>, &quot;Crowd surrounding Michael Moore at #occupywallst. He walked over and thanked a group of NYPD officers. Asked them to join the movement.&quot; Here&apos;s video of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005854/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/06/photos_peaceful_occupy_wall_street.php#photo-1">Michael Moore addressing the demonstrators, and a full photo feature</a> on yesterday&apos;s march. </p>
