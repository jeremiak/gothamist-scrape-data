<p>A week after managing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032802/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/dow_crosses_13000_for_first_time_si.php">cross the 13,000 mark</a> but falling back into the 12,000-zone, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 13,005 points today.  The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032802/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204520204577250860017813248.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories"> Wall Street Journal says</a>, &quot;The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 13000 points for the first time in nearly four years Tuesday, before the financial crisis and global slowdown sent markets reeling.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032802/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html?ref=business">The NY Times notes</a>, &quot;The index, which tracks 30 of the biggest companies on Wall Street, last surpassed the milestone mark in a closing on May 19, 2008, when it ended trading at 13,028.16.&quot;</p>

<p>An analyst explained to the Times, &quot;Thirteen thousand is not so very important technically as it is emotionally, simply because it is not 12,000. It is on the way to 14,000. It is kind of a landmark on the way... The market has rallied significantly since the October lows and everything seems to be trending in the right direction. We are waiting for the next catalyst.&quot;</p>

<p>And a chief investment officer in Indiana <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032802/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-28/u-s-stock-futures-rise-before-consumer-confidence-durable-goods-reports.html">told Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;13,000 is just a number. The U.S. economy is in decent shape. The market is not expensive.&quot; Subtext: BUY.</p>
