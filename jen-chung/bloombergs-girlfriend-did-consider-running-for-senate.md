<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_06-dtaylor.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085351im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_06-dtaylor.jpg" width="200" height="287" class="image-left"> </span>Back in March, Diana Taylor&apos;s name was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085351/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/12/_will_bloombergs_girlfriend_run.php">added to the long list </a>of possible Republicans challengers to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.  With her credentials as a one-time Pataki administration staffer and former NY State banking official&#x2014;not to mention being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085351/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/13/diana_taylor.php">Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s girlfriend</a>&#x2014;she reportedly met with Republican Senators about the idea.  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085351/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/nyregion/04diana.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times confirms</a> that she &quot;was not only intrigued by the idea, but also eager to delve into the details of a potential campaign and future career in the Senate.&quot; </p>

<p>The long, front page article suggests that Taylor, 55, may be positioned to run for office once Bloomberg finishes his third (and final?) term: &quot;Republican lawmakers, consultants and operatives continue to describe Ms. Taylor &#x2014; a former investment banker and state banking regulator &#x2014; as a &apos;perfect candidate,&apos; a &apos;grand-slam home run&apos; and a &apos;shoo-in&apos; for offices ranging from governor to mayor of New York... She vigorously opposed a 2004 decision that allowed banks like J. P. Morgan and HSBC Holdings to escape state supervision...  In 2006, two years before the housing market imploded, Ms. Taylor gave a speech warning that mortgage brokers were peddling exotic products to unsophisticated consumers that &apos;hide or bury information about the real terms of the loan.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>However, Bloomberg wasn&apos;t very enthusiastic about her running, because it might be a little awkward for the junior Senator to be co-habitating with the mayor of New York.  Still, other Republicans are hopeful that Taylor will run for office; former Pataki aide John Cahill said, &quot;I get the sense that she would really like to do it.&quot;</p>
