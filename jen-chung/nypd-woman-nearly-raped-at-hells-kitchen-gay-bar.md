<p>Police are looking for man suspected of trying to rape a woman at a midtown Manhattan bar last week.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident happened around 10:35 p.m. on Friday, October 3rd, at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012804/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/29/flaming_saddles_nycs_new_country_we.php">Flaming Saddles Bar</a> (793 9th Avenue): &quot;The 34-year-old victim was exiting the restroom when she was confronted by the suspect who choked her until she lost consciousness, threw her to the ground and removed her underwear. The suspect was interrupted by security at the location and he fled the scene.&quot;</p>
