---

	
										<p>Veteran NYC news anchor Ernie Anastos, who currently appears on MyFoxNY (channel 5)&apos;s 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. broadcasts, spiced things up last night.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082042/http://gawker.com/5361335/ny-fox-news-anchor-anastos-keep-fcking-that-chicken">Gawker explains</a>, &quot;Perhaps overloaded by transitive small talk between the weather report and a commercial break, Anastos &#x2014; who once said &apos;dot cock&apos; on live television &#x2014; told meteorologist Nick Gregory that &apos;it takes a tough man to make a tender forecast,&apos; and then, to the utter shock and appall of his co-anchor, Dari Alexander continued, &apos;Keep fucking that chicken.&apos;&quot;  Huh?</p>

<p>Still weird!  Last year, WNBC (now NBC New York!)&apos;s Sue Simmons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082042/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/13/sue_simmons_unw.php">dropped the f-bomb</a> during an off-camera live read promotion (but not during the actual newscast), &quot;What the fuck are you doing?!&quot;  She appeared on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082042/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/14/sue_simmons_fbo.php">next day&apos;s broadcast</a>.</p>
