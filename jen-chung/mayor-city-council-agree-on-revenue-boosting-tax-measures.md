The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150107/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/nyregion/02tax.html?ref=nyregion"> NY Times reports</a> there will not be a 5-cent plastic bag tax or sales tax on all clothing; Bloomberg and the Council &quot;instead proposed increasing the city&#x2019;s sales tax by half a percentage point, to 8.875 percent. In addition, the city would begin charging sales tax on clothing over $110. All clothing was previously exempt from such taxes.&quot; These, plus other measures, like &quot;applying the full City Sales Tax to electric and natural gas customers that purchase energy from non-utility companies and a tax conformity package&quot; must be approved in Albany.  According to the Times, the Independent Budget Office estimates a household making $35,000/year will need to pay an additional $74 in sale taxes, while a household making $125,000/year &quot;would pay an additional $237 a year, and one making $500,000 would pay $687 more.&quot;</p>
