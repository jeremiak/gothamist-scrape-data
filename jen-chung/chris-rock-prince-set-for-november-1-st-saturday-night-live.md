<p>Lately, Prince&apos;s showtimes have been much later than SNL&apos;s 11:30 p.m. start time (when he played at City Winery last year, he started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012712/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/purple_reign_prince_threw_a_funk_pa.php">after midnight</a> or more like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012712/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/purple_sunrise_prince_plays_another.php">after 3 a.m.</a>), but he knows the drill&#x2014;he&apos;s been on the show twice before, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012712/http://snl.wikia.com/wiki/Prince">back in 1981 (!) and again in 2006</a>. Surely, SNL will ask Fred Armisen to stop by, right?</p>
