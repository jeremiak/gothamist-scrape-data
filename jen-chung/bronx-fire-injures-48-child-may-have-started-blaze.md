<p>The fire started at 7:40 a.m. in the East 149th Street building in the Bronx&apos;s Melrose section, and it quickly spread. Over 130 firefighters fought the blaze. FDNY Deputy Assistant Chief Jack Mooney said, &quot;When we opened the door to put the fire out, it just fills the building up -- the hallways, the stairs -- up with smoke.&quot; A resident on the 22nd floor who suffers from asthmas and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519165532/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/3-Alarm-Bronx-Melrose-Fire-Blaze-10-Injured-Hospital-202838681.html">needed to be assisted by firefighters said</a>,&quot; Smoke was so thick... It was a trying time.&quot; </p>

<p>Twelve residents had to be carried down; 48 people, including firefighters, were injured, with five critically injured.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519165532/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9063673">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;Witnesses say a mother briefly dangled her two-year-old child out of a broken 21st floor window to try to get some fresh air.&quot; The Red Cross was on the scene, working with residents to get back into their apartments and provided food and cleanup kits to those who needed them.</p>

<p>It&apos;s suspected a child playing with a cigarette lighter started the fire.</p>
