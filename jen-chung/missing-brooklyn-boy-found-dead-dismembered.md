Police have made one arrest and other in custody; Assemblyman Dov Hikind said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just a horror for every parent. I mean it&#x2019;s just a tragedy today for everyone in New York.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Leiby had been on his way back from the camp at 44th Street and 12th Avenue to Borough Park to meet his parents seven blocks away&#x2014;at 50th Street and 13th Avenue&#x2014; where they had a doctor&apos;s appointment.

Surveillance video showed him following a bearded man on 45th Street and Dahill Road. </p>

<p>The man was later driving in a gold, possibly Japanese-made car, but the cops weren&apos;t sure whether Leiby was in the car. According to the Post, &quot;Police stormed a Kensington home just before 4 a.m. and arrested a 35-year-old man who told cops where to find the body, sources said. He is currently being held at the 67th Precinct... Investigators tracked him down by tracing credit-card purchases and through video surveillance footage.&quot;   </p>

<p>The police found remains in a suitcase at a dumpster at 651 Fourth Ave., at 20th Street, and in the man&apos;s refrigerator in Kensington at Avenue C and East 2nd Street.  </p>

<p>Hikind, other local politicians, and the Shomrim Patrol had contributed to a $100,000 reward for Leiby&apos;s return. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023085839/http://www.vosizneias.com/87349/2011/07/13/brooklyn-ny-bde-body-of-missing-boy-may-have-been-found-2">Hikind said</a>, &quot;Whoever did this is sick beyond belief.&quot;</p>
