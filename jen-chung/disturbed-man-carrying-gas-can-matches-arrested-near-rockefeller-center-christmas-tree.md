<p>A Bronx man was taken into custody Monday afternoon after a Fox News employee reported his strange behavior to the police. Yuriy Alterman, 38, was seen in midtown Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183737/http://nypost.com/2016/12/06/man-carrying-gas-can-and-matches-arrested-at-rock-center/">&quot;acting erratically&quot;</a> and was allegedly found carrying a half-full gas can, matches, and the book <em>Son of Hamas</em>.</p>

<p>A witness believed Alterman was &quot;walking erratically towards the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree&quot; and alerted a police officer near 48th Street and 6th Avenue, by the News Corp. building. Officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183737/http://nypost.com/2016/12/06/man-carrying-gas-can-and-matches-arrested-at-rock-center/">then followed Alterman to Rockefeller Plaza</a>.</p>

<p>When officers arrested him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183737/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-With-Gas-Can-Shouting-Arrested-Rockefeller-Center-Tree-Terroristic-Threat-405091615.html">sources say Alterman yelled</a>, &quot;F--k the NYPD!&quot; and said &quot;Sometimes you guys do things that make others do things, even though that&apos;s not who we are... Have you seen the news today?&quot; He also allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183737/http://nypost.com/2016/12/06/man-carrying-gas-can-and-matches-arrested-at-rock-center/">threw a glass bottle</a>.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183737/https://www.amazon.com/Son-Hamas-Gripping-Political-Unthinkable/dp/1414333080">Son of Hamas</a></em> is the memoir of Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of a founding member of Hamas; Yousef writes about rejecting the teachings of Hamas and converting to Christianity. </p>

<p>Police do not believe the incident was connected to any terrorist plot, and Alterman was arraigned on charges of disorderly conduct and weapon possession. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183737/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/cops-find-son-hamas-book-no-terrorism-links-article-1.2900751">His Legal Aid lawyer said</a>, &quot;He bought the gas just to buy it. I don&#x2019;t think these charges are sufficient to this point.&quot;</p>
