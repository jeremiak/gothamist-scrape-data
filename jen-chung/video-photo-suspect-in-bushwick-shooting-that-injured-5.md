<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_06_suspehge.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725045452im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_suspehge.jpg" width="200" height="206" class="image-right"> </span>Police have named a suspect in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725045452/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/20/at_least_four_shot_in_bushwick_this.php">Saturday afternoon shooting</a> that left five people injured in Brooklyn. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the suspect, Curtis Peterson, 23, &quot;was among a group of males who approached the victims in the vicinity of 191 Menahan Street.&quot; Then he &quot;produced a firearm and fired numerous times,&quot; hitting a 22-year-old male in the leg and a 62-year-old male in the right ankle, as well as a 52-year-old woman and 45-year-old man in their stomachs and a 37-year-old woman in the right knee. Cops recovered a 9mm Taurus semiautomatic handgun. </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that the shooting was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725045452/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/21/bushwick_park_shooting_apparently_s.php">sparked by an incident on Friday</a>: The teen daughter of one of the victims, 45-year-old Rolando Pizarro, was working at a nearby McDonald&apos;s when a group of young men started harassing her. Apparently she refused their advances, prompting one of them to throw a milkshake in her face. Pizarro made a police complaint on her behalf, and a family friend thinks the gunfire was payback.</p>

<p>Police released a photograph of Peterson (at right) and describe him as being about 5&apos;10&quot;, 160 lbs. with brown eyes and short, black hair. And here&apos;s video of the group:</p>
