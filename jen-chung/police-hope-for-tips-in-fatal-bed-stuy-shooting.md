More chillingly, it&apos;s suggested that the fatality, 21-year-old college student Zeanie White, may have been used as a &quot;human shield&quot; by another shooting victim who may have been the real target.  Police are offering $12,000 for information leading to an arrest and successful conviction; they urge people to call Crimestoppers at 800-577-TIPS.</p>
