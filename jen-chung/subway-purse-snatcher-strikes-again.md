<p>The police believe the same man who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140818102520/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/16/robber_targets.php">robbed four female subway commuters</a> last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140818102520/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6153950">stole the purse of another woman</a> yesterday morning.  </p>

<p>A 24-year-old woman had been waiting on the Rector Street subway platform when, according to WABC 7, &quot;the suspect grabbed her purse just before 10 a.m.&quot;  She was knocked down and the suspect ran into the subway tracks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140818102520/http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=6590584&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1">threw the purse on the ground after taking the cash</a>, and ran into the tunnel.  </p>

<p>The other subway purse robberies have all occurred in the morning at downtown Manhattan subway platforms:  The L on 14th Street and First Avenue, the 1 at Christopher Street, the L and 14th and Third, and the 6 at Bleecker and Lafayette.  The NYPD and MTA are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140818102520/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/05/21/2008-05-21_as_nypd_mta_beef_snatcher_hits_again.html">currently in a power struggle over who can cut the power to the tracks</a>--naturally, the cops would like the power off ASAP so they can investigate immediately, but the MTA requires &quot;senior level&quot; approval for such a request, to avoid stranding passengers in train cars.</p>
