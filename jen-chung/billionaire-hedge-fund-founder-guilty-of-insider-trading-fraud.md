<p>After nearly two months of testimony and 11 days of deliberations, a jury found the billionaire co-founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund guilty of all charges related to what had been described as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512040420/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/17/hedge_fund_billionaire_5_others_arr.php">&quot;biggest insider trading ring in a generation&quot;</a>:  Raj Rajaratnam was convicted of 14 counts o securities fraud and conspiracy. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512040420/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/rajaratnam-found-guilty/?hp">NY Times called him</a> the most prominent figure convicted in the government&#x2019;s crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street&quot; while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512040420/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/jury_reaches_verdict_in_galleon_BLOFURM2jShtjx3zRbfM9I?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post declares</a> it &quot;a major victory for the government&#x2019;s largest battle against illegal trading since Rudy Giuliani took on Michael Milken in the 1980s.&quot;</p>

Former Galleon employees also testified that Rajaratnam received revenue numbers from various top business executives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512040420/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-11/rajaratnam-is-found-guilty-of-all-counts-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial.html">before the earnings numbers were made public</a>.<p></p>

When the judge&apos;s deputy polled the jury to see if it was their verdict, the last jurors said &apos;Yes,; very loudly. Juror Leila Gorman Gonzalez, swiping a subway card to get on a train a block from the courthouse, said of the verdict, &apos;There was just a lot of evidence.&apos; She said she was &apos;relieved&apos; that the trial was over, and declined to comment further.&quot; See that, fat cats accused of misdoings&#x2014;people who take the subway will be on your juries (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512040420/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/10/galleon_insider_trading_trial_jury.php">hipsters, too</a>).  </p>

<p>Rajaratnam, who had a net worth of over $1 billion in 2009 and who faces up to 19 1/2 years in prison, is expected to appeal, and prosecutors have asked that he be held in custody, because he is a flight risk (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512040420/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/19/alleged_insider_trading_billionaire.php">$100 million bail aside</a>, he has foreign properties). A Wayne State law professor and former federal prosecutor, Peter Henning, told Bloomberg News, &quot;He joins the pantheon of Ivan Boesky and Gordon Gekko.&quot;</p>
