<p>Today, NBC&apos;s Chairman of Entertainment Robert Greenblatt announced that Diane Lane, who can now be seen as Superman&apos;s &quot;Ma Kent,&quot; will play Hillary Clinton in a miniseries for the network. As for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time_rule">pesky equal time rules</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-orders-hillary-clinton-rosemarys-594405">Greenblatt opined</a>, &quot;She&apos;s not going to declare her candidacy for two more years so I think it will be the late spring or early summer of &apos;15 that she will declare. This could well have aired before that. We have to talk through all that.&quot; </p>

<p>The film will be written and directed by Courtney Hunt, who wrote and directed the searing human smuggling film, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978759/"><em>Frozen River</em></a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-orders-hillary-clinton-rosemarys-594405">According to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, it &quot;will recount Clinton&apos;s life as a wife, mother, politician and cabinet member from 1998-present. The script will begin with Clinton living in the White House as her husband is serving the second of his two terms as president. It will include her likely run for president.&quot; </p>

<p>The timeline, 1998 to present, would suggest it could include her decision to run for NY&apos;s Senate seat and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/01/photos_newlyweds_chelsea_clinton_ma.php#photo-1">daughter Chelsea&apos;s wedding</a>! It&apos;ll also need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://gothamist.com/tags/humaabedin">Huma Abedin</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://textsfromhillary.tumblr.com/">some texting</a>. How about some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/22/photos_bill_hillary_clinton_went_to.php#photo-1">hipster pizza in Bushwick</a>?</p>

<p>Lane, who has been acting since 1979 (she was on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19790813,00.html">cover of Time that year</a>, too), has experience playing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i0-inOd4Jw">cheating spouse</a> as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162406/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACihGpP5A4">cheated-upon spouse</a>.  As for who will play Bill Clinton, that&apos;s a mystery, but we&apos;d like to suggest Billy Bob Thornton. He basically played Clinton in <em>Love Actually</em> and he definitely has Southern charm:</p>
