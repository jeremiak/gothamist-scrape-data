<p>A police officer currently suspended without pay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/good_cop_bad_cop_same_cop.php">over a pending assault case</a> was found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://nypost.com/2016/05/22/sleepwalking-cop-accused-of-assault-arrested-for-dwi/">reportedly &quot;reeking of booze&quot;</a> after crashing his car in Manhattan early Sunday. </p>

<p>Eugene Donnelly, 29, was charged with driving while intoxicated after allegedly crashing his Audi on Riverside Drive by West 135th Street around 12:30 a.m. Donnelly apparently struck three park cars before his car rolled over on its side, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://abc7ny.com/news/nypd-officer-charged-with-assault-in-2014-arrested-again-on-dwi-charges/1350984/">a resident said</a>, &quot;You could hear it, man, it was loud. You could hear all the glass shattering, people screaming.&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY needed to extract Donnelly from his car:</p>

<p>One of the owners of a damaged car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Cop-on-Trial-for-Assault-Charge-Now-Faces-DWI-Charge-NYPD-380437311.html">told NBC New York,</a> &#x201C;I ran downstairs and I saw a car in the middle of the street upside down. My car was destroyed. Then I found out it was a cop.&quot;</p>

<p>The officer is currently suspended without pay for a 2014 incident&#x2014;just days after receiving a recognition from Mayor de Blasio for stopping a gunman while he was off-duty&#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/25/after_being_honored_by_de_blasio_co.php">where he allegedly attacked a woman</a> after breaking into her apartment. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_06_edonnelly.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_06_edonnelly.jpg" width="640" height="451"> <br> <i> Eugene Donnelly (with green ribbon medal) after receiving the Combat Cross (NYC Mayor&apos;s Office)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Donnelly had apparently been staying at a friend&apos;s apartment, but couldn&apos;t find his way back and instead broke down the door to the victim&apos;s apartment and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/04/nypd_honors_violent_cop.php">hit her over 20 times before drinking her milk</a>.</p>

<p>While prosecutors have accused Donnelly of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/good_cop_bad_cop_same_cop.php">having an &quot;alcoholic blackout,&quot;</a> Donnelly&apos;s defense has been that he has PTSD and was sleepwalking (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007071526/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/29/sometimes_im_good_guy_but.php">video shows him running around</a> the apartment complex in his underwear, buzzing on the door to get back in) at the time. He is due in court next month for that incident.</p>
