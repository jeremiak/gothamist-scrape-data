Sadie Mitchell was apparently struck by a stray bullet on Tuesday evening, when a shot was fired during a fight between two groups of youths.  Witnesses told cops that Jamal Blair, 18, was the shooter and he allegedly confessed.  A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203306/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/22/2009-10-22_cops_closing_in_on_arrest_in_.html">tells the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>He told cops he thought he was shooting up in the air.  The lady was 15 feet [above ground] in her home when the bullet hit.</strong>&quot;</p>

Mitchell had been getting ready to watch TV and the bullet went through her room window, hitting her in the hip and then traveling to her lungs.  Though she managed to call a friend, Mitchell died at the hospital.  </p>

One homicide is one too many. There are way too many guns in the hands of young people.&quot; Mitchell was a beloved figure in the neighborhood, having settled on the Williamsbridge Street in 1954, and her death <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203306/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/anger_over_beloved_bronx_womans_dea.php">provoked the outrage</a> of her family and friends. </p>
