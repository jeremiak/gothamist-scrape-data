<p>On this hot and humid day, police required backup to deal with a melee at the McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn.  Like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/30/day_after_opening_mccarren_park_poo.php">incident the day</a> after the pool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/photos_mccarren_park_pool_opens_wit.php#photo-11">opened last month</a>, a fight between pool-goers and authority figures broke out over backflips into the pool. At least three people were arrested, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2012/07/nypd-arrest-3-in-mccarren-pool-assault.html">according to A Walk In The Park</a>&#x2014;one for assaulting a police officer and two for disorderly conduct. A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mccarren-park-pool-mishap-day-nypd-cops-pepper-spray-subdue-brawling-bathers-fight-shuts-williamsburg-hot-spot-article-1.1116525">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;You could tell something was going to happen. It was obvious. You just had that feeling in the air.&quot;  </p>

<p>A Walk In The Park reports that the pool&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/15/mccarren_park_pool_lifeguard.php">beleaguered lifeguards</a> closed the pool due to &quot;an unruly crowd of between 10 -20 [who] were told numerous times to stop doing back-flips and throwing people into the air.&quot;  The crowd, which booed, was nearly cleared, but then &quot;a few decided to take jump back into the pool. A fight broke out and multiple officers were wrestling on the ground in the sprinklers.&quot;  An officer said, &quot;They went wild on us.&quot;</p>

<p>The News&apos; witness seemed shocked:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;There was a complete breakdown of control. It looked like these kids were running the show.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>The witness said he saw one teen being marched away by cops.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Then something obviously happened - he tried to resist arrest maybe - and they forced him to the ground,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Then a group of people come rushing in and that&apos;s when the cop used mace,&#x201D; he said, saying two others were taken into custody.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There was a palpable tension in the air,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a really tense, unpleasant situation. &#x201D;</p></blockquote>The witness added, &quot;Had that cop not used the mace they would have all piled in... You could see moms and their children being: &apos;Oh my God.&apos; One lady outside was saying &apos;I&#x2019;m done with this pool, it&apos;s too much. I&apos;m never coming back here.&#x2019;&#x201D;  <p></p>

<p>The pool, which underwent a years-long $50 million renovation, has had a rough start: Besides the June 29 attack on lifeguards, police officers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/03/two_cops_sent_to_hospital_after_mcc.php">attacked on July 2</a> and pool-goers&apos; locked lockers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/03/in_addition_to_beatings_people_also.php">have been broken into</a>. Oddly enough, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215218/http://prospectheights.patch.com/articles/mccarren-pool-safe-nypd-says">Prospect Heights Patch has a story</a> today about the NYPD saying that everything&apos;s safe at the pool, &quot;There will be no issues there&#x2014;there are a lot of police.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update 10:24 p.m.</b>: The NYPD says that a 23-year-old black male was charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment while two 24-year-old black males were both charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. </p>
