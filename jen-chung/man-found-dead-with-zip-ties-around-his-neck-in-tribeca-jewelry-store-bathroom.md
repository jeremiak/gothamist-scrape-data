<p>After family members reported him missing, a 43-year-old Brooklyn man was found dead inside a Manhattan jewelry store with zip ties reportedly cinched around his neck.</p>

<p>Omid Gholian was missing for several days before the grisly discovery. His family filed a missing person report with the First Precinct, and when his brother went to check for him at the Tribeca jewelry store where he worked, the gate was locked, sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218174949/http://nypost.com/2017/02/16/police-find-dead-man-in-tribeca-jewelry-store/">tell the NY Post</a>.  </p>

<p>Officers went to World of Gold N Diamond at 193 Church Street at the corner of Duane Street last night just after 6 p.m., where they found Gholian in the bathroom, unconscious and unresponsive. He was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>

<p>Police reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218174949/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-found-dead-zip-tie-neck-manhattan-jewelry-shop-article-1.2973949">found blood next to Gholian</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218174949/http://pix11.com/2017/02/16/man-found-dead-with-zip-ties-around-neck-inside-tribeca-jewelry-store/">PIX 11 reports</a>, &quot;While the cause has yet to be determined by the medical examiner, investigators believe the death was not natural.&quot;</p>

<p>A customer told PIX 11, &quot;I saw him twice this week I was shocked when I heard. He&#x2019;s a really good guy, He was a really good guy, family man and had some nice conversations with him.&quot;</p>
