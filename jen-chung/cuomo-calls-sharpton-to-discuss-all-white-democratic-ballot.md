Which is why Cuomo has reportedly called the Reverend Al Sharpton. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507011233/http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/cuomo-calls-sharpton-discuss-diversity"> According to the Observer</a>, Cuomo &quot;pledge[d] that, despite the lack of racial diveristy on the Democrats&apos; statewide ticket, there will be diversity in his administration if he gets to the governor&apos;s mansion.&quot;  A minority political operative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507011233/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/05/27/2010-05-27_hope_race_isnt_blinded_by_the_white.html">joked to the Daily News,</a> &quot;Cuomo, DiNapoli &amp; Duffy - it sounds like a Long Island law firm.&quot; And City Councilman Al Vann (D-Brooklyn) warned, &quot;The problem is going to be one of getting enthusiasm in the black community, so they will want to come out and be supportive... [Cuomo] has work to do. Hopefully he will do the work that is necessary to pull together the support he has to have in the African-American community.&quot;</p>

<p>Cuomo, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507011233/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/nyregion/25race.html">&quot;aggressively courting&quot; black leaders</a> for a while, told reporters, &quot;We strive for diversity everywhere. There&apos;s a certain amount of geographic diversity with Bob joining the ticket... My administration will be an administration that reflects diversity.&quot;  </p>
