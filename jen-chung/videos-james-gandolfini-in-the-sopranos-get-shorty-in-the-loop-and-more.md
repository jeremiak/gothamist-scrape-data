                            <p>James Gandolfini, the burly NJ native whose portrayal of Tony Soprano made him a star, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729104046/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/james_gandolfini_has_died_at_51.php">passed away today in Italy</a>. His death was untimely&#x2014;he was just 51&#x2014;but we were lucky that we got to see him in a variety of roles. While his richest work is certainly over the six seasons and 86 episodes of <em>The Sopranos</em>, Gandolfini made even small roles memorable. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729104046/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/arts/television/james-gandolfini-sopranos-star-dies-at-51.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1371693823-6R%20l7U%20MZfqs7cyAE5/VbQ">NY Times&apos; obituary notes</a>:</p><blockquote>Mr. Gandolfini, who had studied the Meisner technique of acting for two years, said that he used it to focus his anger and incorporate it into his performances. In an interview for the television series &#x201C;Inside the Actors Studio,&#x201D; Mr. Gandolfini said he would deliberately hit himself on the head or stay up all night to evoke the desired reaction.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re tired, every single thing that somebody does will piss you off,&#x201D; Mr. Gandolfini said in the interview. &#x201C;Drink six cups of coffee. Or just walk around with a rock in your shoe. It&#x2019;s silly, but it works.&#x201D; </p></blockquote>Here are a few clips of his work&#x2014;and if you haven&apos;t see <em>In The Loop</em>, rent it, stream it, SEE IT:<p></p>

I mean, after all I went through, all this death, and then it&#x2019;s over like that?&quot; but then later, he realized it was brilliant:</p>
