<p>Three years ago today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014808/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/01/multiple_people_killed_in_fatal_met.php#photo-1">four people were killed and 60 injured when a Metro-North train derailed</a> at the Spuyten-Duyvil curve in the Bronx. Now the train&apos;s engineer William Rockefeller has sued the commuter railroad, blaming Metro-North for not installing technology that would have automatically braked at excessively high speeds and for not having an &quot;alerter&quot; system in the cab to make sure he remained attentive.</p>

<p>The curve is a dangerous stretch of track where train operators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014808/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/02/metro-north_operator_says_he_dumped.php">must drop their speeds from 70 mph to 30 mph</a>. At the time of the crash, Rockefeller claimed the brakes failed, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014808/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/02/metro-north_operator_says_he_dumped.php">he had to &quot;dump the brakes&quot;</a>; the train was going 82 mph around the curve.</p>

<p>It was later revealed that Rockefeller had undiagnosed sleep apnea&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014808/http://abc7ny.com/news/metro-north-engineer-its-horrifying-to-me/1116284/">he told investigators he was in a trance</a>&#x2014;and he was never charged criminally. In an interview with WABC 7 last year, Rockefeller described being racked with guilt, &quot;It feels like I want to climb out of my skin. It&apos;s horrifying to me. It&apos;s horrifying to me. I just wish it never happened. I&apos;m sorry for it happening. I&apos;m sorry for ev-, I just see the faces. I can&apos;t stop seeing the faces. I&apos;m just haunted by those faces.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It feels like yesterday,&quot; he told the news station. &quot;It really feels like yesterday. It feels like it just happened. Every day, it feels like it just happened yesterday. And no matter what I do, I just can&apos;t shake that feeling.&quot;</p>

<p>The lawsuit also takes issue with Metro-North&apos;s alleged priorities, saying it failed &apos;to modify its signal system which would have required mandatory speed reductions approaching critical curves and instead, due to its &apos;Deficient safety culture&apos; that prizes on-time performance at the expense of protecting riders and workers, relied on engineer to make only one reduction in speed from 70 mph to 30 mph.&quot;</p>

<p>In September, the MTA&apos;s pension board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014808/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/09/15/pension-metro-north-engineer-fatal-bronx-crash/90368416/">denied Rockefeller&apos;s claim for a lifetime pension</a>. He has received a federal pension. </p>

Much of that total &#x2014; $23.8 million &#x2014; has gone to settle lawsuits filed by passengers injured in the crash.&quot;</p>
