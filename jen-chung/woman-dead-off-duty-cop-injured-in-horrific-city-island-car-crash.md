<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020410/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/02/fiery-bronx-crash-off-duty-officer/">A witness told CBS New York</a>, &quot;I heard like the people screaming and what was more traumatizing was I heard like the people, who I guess witnessed the accident, were screaming &#x2014; you know, screaming they&#x2019;re still alive, they&#x2019;re breathing, screaming for help. That was actually, that&#x2019;s something I probably won&#x2019;t ever forget.&quot;</p>

<p>Another described, &quot;The vehicle turned over. It flipped and turned over, flipped over and then it stopped. When it turned over, then everybody stopped the car and tried to run over there to it but nobody could get to it because it [blew] up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Instantly it started like exploding. I&#x2019;m sure the fuel, the radiator, all that&#x2026; you know?&quot; Alex Corleone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020410/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Off-Duty-Police-Officers-Save-Man-From-Fiery-Bronx-Crash-Killed-Woman-412525213.html">said to NBC New York</a>.</p>

<p>Two off-duty police officers who were at the Rodman&apos;s Neck firing range <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020410/http://pix11.com/2017/02/02/1-dead-1-critically-injured-after-vehicle-caught-fire-on-bronx-road/">pulled a 32-year-old man</a>, an off-duty cop, from the 2012 Dodge Charger when they saw the crash. </p>

<p>The NYPD says the injured off-duty officer sustained &quot;trauma and burns to both legs,&quot; while the woman was &quot;unconscious and unresponsive, with severe burns.&quot; The woman died at Jacobi Hospital while the male victim, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020410/http://nypost.com/2017/02/02/tragic-crash-leaves-off-duty-cop-dead-another-injured/">was apparently driving</a>, is in critical condition and is &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020410/http://pix11.com/2017/02/02/1-dead-1-critically-injured-after-vehicle-caught-fire-on-bronx-road/">fighting for his life</a>.&apos; The off-duty cops who responded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020410/http://abc7ny.com/news/1-dead-off-duty-officer-hurt-after-car-flips-in-bronx/1733162/">suffered smoke inhalation</a>.</p>
