<p>The bicycle that was t<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012238/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/06/cop_injured_by_falling_bike_in_crow.php">hrown from a fifth floor Brooklyn apartment</a>, which then hit four police officers, was a 28.6 pound Barbie bicycle. The suspect was caught and is now being held on $500,000 bail.</p>

<p>Police had been responding to a report of shots fired outside 959 St. Mark&#x2019;s Avenue near Albany Avenue just after 2 a.m. Sunday. When they appeared, debris was thrown at them&#x2014;including the bike. The police arrested the shooting suspect, Jeanick McVane, but then,  the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012238/http://nypost.com/2014/07/06/cops-injured-by-barbie-bike-tossed-off-brooklyn-balcony/">Post reports</a>, &quot;the officers were allegedly set upon by two men &#x2014; Nicholas John, 20, and Samuel Clark, 21 &#x2014; who tried to keep McVane from getting hauled off, sources said.<br>
A cop had Tasered one of the alleged interlopers when the pink-and-purple bicycle with training wheels came plummeting at them.&quot;</p>

<p>Bryan Jimenez was the one who allegedly threw the bike at the cops; one police officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012238/http://nypost.com/2014/07/07/man-arraigned-in-barbie-bike-throw-that-injured-cops/">needed six staples and a stitch to close up</a> his wound while another had a concussion. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012238/http://nypost.com/2014/07/06/cops-injured-by-barbie-bike-tossed-off-brooklyn-balcony/">The Post adds</a>, &quot;The attack raised fears of a new wave of anti-cop violence &#x2014; with a police union president blaming the assault on Mayor Bill de Blasio and his crackdown on stop-and-frisk. &apos;The atmosphere is, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re going to do what we want,&#x2019; that &#x2018;We&#x2019;re going to get away with it,&#x2019;&apos; said Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association. &apos;There&#x2019;s a perception that the mayor is soft on crime. The perps&#x2019; perception is that the cops are backing down.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Jimenez , who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012238/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/injured-bike-thrown-apartment-article-1.1856556">requested a psych evaluation</a>, was charged with four counts of attempted murder of a police officer.<br>
