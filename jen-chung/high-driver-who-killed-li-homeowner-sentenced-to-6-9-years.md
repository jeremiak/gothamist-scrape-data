Gerdes, who was 18 at the time of the incident and high on marijuana, Xanax and oxycodone during the April 2010 incident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005314/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/gerdes-sentenced-in-death-of-woman-mowing-lawn-1.3828871">said to Rebecca Twine&apos;s son</a>, &quot;If I could trade my life to give your mother back her life, I really would.&quot;<p></p>

<p>However,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005314/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/gerdes-sentenced-in-death-of-woman-mowing-lawn-1.3828871">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;Chauncey Twine sat with his face deliberately turned away from her. <strong>&apos;She didn&apos;t deserve my respect, or an acknowledgment of her apology</strong>,&apos; Twine told reporters after the proceeding.&quot;  His mother, a retired doctor, had been gardening when the van barreled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005314/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/police_fatal_runaway_van_driver_was.php">into her Hempstead house</a>.  </p>

<p>While Gerdes told reporters that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005314/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/22/high_driver_doesnt_feel_so_bad_abou.php">she was sorry about death</a> and claimed it was an accident, in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005314/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/high_or_confused_driver_admitted_to.php">police statement taken after the incident</a>, Gerdes had said, &quot;The thing that made me not feel so bad was, she was old. I mean, 70 years is a long time to live. I want to see a newspaper or the news to see what I look like.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, Gerdes had turned down a plea deal that would have put <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005314/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/26/allegedly_high_driver_was_fatally_s.php">her in prison for 10 years</a>. With this plea deal, prosecutors had sought a 5-15 year sentences, but the judge opted for a 6-9 year sentence.  Gerdes, who only had a learner&apos;s permit at the time and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005314/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/24/mom_high_driver_is_a_very_sensitive.php">allegedly took the wheel</a> because she thought her boyfriend was going too slow (because she needed to get to a court appearance over jewelry she stole from her mother), has already served two years.</p>
