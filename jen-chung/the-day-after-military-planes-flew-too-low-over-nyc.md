</div></div>					<p>The verdict is out, and yesterday&apos;s lower Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003919/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/27/buildings_evacuated_as_air_force_on.php">flyover by the &quot;Boeing 747 sometimes known as Air Force One&quot; and military jets</a> was a bad idea.  So bad that the White House Military Office&apos;s director Luis Caldera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003919/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/27/department_of_defenses_plan_to_scar.php">apologized for the mission</a>.  It was so bad that the city official who knew about the event but didn&apos;t tell the mayor was &quot;reprimanded and a disciplinary letter has been placed in his file,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003919/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nyscar2812702437apr27,0,6680181.story">according to Newsday</a>.  </p>

<p>Newsday explains that many city employees actually knew about the photo opportunity, which was apparently intended to amass updated photographs of Air Force One near landmarks: &quot;The New York Police Department knew. The 911 dispatchers knew. And Mayor Mike Bloomberg&apos;s citywide event coordination and management director, Marc Mugnos, knew. In fact, the FAA and several other public agencies knew.&quot;  Mayor Bloomberg only found out through messages to his Blackberry and he was pissed:&quot;I&apos;m annoyed&#x2014;furious is a better word&#x2014;that I wasn&apos;t told. If I had known about it, I would have called them right away and asked them not to.&quot;  President Obama was reportedly furious as well, though that message came late last night.</p>

<p>One Jersey City brokerage employee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003919/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04282009/news/regionalnews/air_heads_in_dc_terrorize_city_166544.htm">told the Post</a>, &quot;We all ran to the window, and I thought, that&apos;s it, we&apos;re all dead. It brought back all the memories of 9/11. I said, &apos;I have to get out of here now!&apos;&quot; Another downtown Manhattan employee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003919/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/nyregion/28plane.html?ref=nyregion">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;As soon as someone saw how close it got to the buildings, people literally ran out. Probably about 80 percent of my office left within two minutes of seeing how close it got to our building.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003919/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/04/27/2009-04-27_plane_stupid_mayor_bloomberg_outraged_over_military_photoop_involving_lowflying_.html">Daily News had these quotes</a> from worried workers:</p><blockquote> &quot;I was crying and praying to God to forgive me my sins because I thought I was going to get killed,&quot; said Kathleen Filandro, who fled from 1New York Plaza when she spotted the planes.<p></p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s like someone coming up to you, sticking a gun to your head for 15 seconds, walking away and hearing 20 minutes later it was an undercover cop posing for a photo,&quot; said Wall Street worker Bill Privett.</p></blockquote>Apparently the plane&apos;s flyover was done during a regular military exercise (to save money), but Keith Olbermann still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003919/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/#30443239">named Caldera as his worst person in the world</a> on Countdown last night.<p></p>
