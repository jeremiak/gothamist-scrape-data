<p>Given that the MTA project billion-dollar budget gaps in future years and that the cash cow of congestion pricing never made it to the altar, there may be a good idea of increasing revenue by way of Japan.  The Associated Press has a story about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915042545/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/R/RAILWAY_CAT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2008-05-26-07-35-03">&quot;money-losing Japanese train company&quot; whose new lease on business life</a> is thanks to a calico cat named Tama:</p><blockquote>All the 9-year-old female cat does is sit by the entrance of Kishi Station in western Japan, wearing a black uniform cap and posing for photos for the tourists who are now flocking in droves from across the nation.<p></p>

<p>Tama has been doing such a good job of raising revenue for the troubled Kishikawa train line that she was recently promoted to &quot;super-station-master.&quot;</p></blockquote>Super-station-master!  Cats are considered good luck (hello, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915042545/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneki_Neko">Maneki Neko</a>) in Japan, and people have flocked to take pictures with Tama, as well as buy her various merchandise--&quot;postcards, erasers, notebooks and pins...even a special 1,365 yen ($13) book of photos of Tama called, &apos;Diary of Tama, the Station Master.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>Let&apos;s face it, cats in the train stations could do wonders with the rodent problem (do cats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915042545/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/08/bedbugs_found_o.php">eat bedbugs?</a>).  Heck, there&apos;s even a cat at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915042545/http://www.mta.info/mta/museum/">Transit Museum</a>--the lovely Sadie!  </p>
