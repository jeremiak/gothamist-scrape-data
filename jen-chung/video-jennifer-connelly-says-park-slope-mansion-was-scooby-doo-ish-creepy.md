The mystery of why actors Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany fled from Brooklyn, leaving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053520/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2008/05/house_of_the_da_492.php">beautiful Prospect Park West mansion</a> to take up residence in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053520/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/05/05/celebrity_real_estate_wrap_paulifer_ditching_brooklyn.php">Manhattan penthouse</a> was revealed last Friday night.  Connelly was on the Tonight Show and told Conan O&apos;Brien that frankly, the house, as much as she loved it, was spooky, &quot;<strong>It was a little big...frankly, it was a little like Scooby-Doo, creepy, you know, like the haunted mountain mansion.</strong>&quot; Zoinks!</p>

<p>Then Connelly added/joked that she was worried that Children&apos;s Services would call on her, because her kids were too scared to sleep in their own rooms and instead slept in sleeping bags on her and Bettany&apos;s bedroom floor. Now, safely ensconced in Manhattan, the children sleep in their own rooms.</p>

<p>The &quot;spooky&quot; house at 17 Prospect Park West was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053520/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/11/sarah_jessica_parker_is_not_moving.php"> bought by a Google engineer and his wife</a>, who found Soho very stroller unfriendly.  Maybe they should stock up on sleeping bags&#x2014;or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053520/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/26/ghostbusters_sure_know_how_to_draw.php">some real-life ghostbusters</a>.</p>
