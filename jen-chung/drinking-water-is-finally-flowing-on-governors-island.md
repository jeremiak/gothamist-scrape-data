<p>Governors Island hasn&apos;t had drinking water&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034642/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/31/bring_your_own_water_to_governors_i.php">even ran out of bottled water last month</a>&#x2014;until now! The Trust for Governors Island announced that its drinking fountains are now working after a long restoration: &quot;To celebrate this important moment in the Island&#x2019;s progress, The Trust will give away 200 free water bottles at noon on Saturday at the new drinking fountains in Liggett Terrace and near Yankee Pier.&quot; Just please don&apos;t use the drinking fountains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034642/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/12/water_fountain_or_dog_bidet.php">to clean your dog&apos;s butt</a>. <br>
 <br>
Here are some infrastructure details from the Trust:</p><blockquote>The restoration of potable water is a cornerstone project in the Island&#x2019;s comprehensive capital program to ready the Island for its next chapter. The first phase of the project, the construction of nearly 2,500 linear feet of new pipe from Red Hook to Governors Island, started in summer 2013 and was completed in spring 2014. The new pipe was installed via horizontal directional drilling through bedrock beneath the Buttermilk Channel. The remaining pipe and associated equipment to successfully connect the Island to New York City&#x2019;s water system was completed in early June 2014. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has performed water quality testing to successfully confirm the water is potable.<br>
 <br>
The second phase of the project is the installation of approximately 15,000 linear feet of distribution piping to channel potable water to buildings throughout the Historic District. This portion of the project is ongoing with an expected completion date of December 2014. The project will serve current and future tenants in the Historic District.</blockquote>There are two public drinking fountains, one at Liggett Terrace and the other is near Yankee Pier. Others will be added as the infrastructure grows. <p></p>

<p>The Trust adds, &quot;Later this summer, new play fountains will be open in the Liggett Terrace hedge garden. These three fountains, set within the hedges, feature 90 jets creating playful swirling patterns with water.&quot; </p>
