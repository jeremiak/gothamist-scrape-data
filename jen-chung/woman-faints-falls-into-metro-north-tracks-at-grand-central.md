<p>A woman was rescued from the Metro-North tracks at Grand Central Terminal this morning.  Authorities say that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120212215701/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/woman_faints_tumbles_onto_tracks_trPUVqRPLp80Qn6z1mwN5M">30-year-old &quot;fainted and tumbled&quot;</a> into Track 28 after geting off a train that had arrived from Hartsdale around 8:30 a.m.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120212215701/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120209/manhattan/woman-falls-on-tracks-at-grand-central-terminal">DNAinfo reports</a>, &quot;She fell between the train and the bumper block at the station.&quot; According to the Post, &quot;Workers quickly shut power to the third rail and the woman was pulled back up to safety. The victim regained consciousness and was rushed to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, FDNY officials said.&quot;</p>

<p>A few years ago, MTA EMTs said that many of the fainting cases in the subway system <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120212215701/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/02/subway_delays_c.php">were due to women on diets</a>.</p>
