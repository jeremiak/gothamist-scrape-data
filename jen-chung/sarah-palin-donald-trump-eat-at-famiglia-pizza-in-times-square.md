</div></div>					<p>If you&apos;re going to have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://gothamist.com/tags/sarahpalin">Maverick</a> meet a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/trump_i_have_always_had_a_great_rel.php">Good Friend To The Blacks</a>, why wouldn&apos;t it be at the Famous Famiglia at Broadway and 50th Street? Former 2008 vice presidential candidate, Grizzly Mom and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/palin_swears_her_tour_isnt_for_publ.php">possible 2012 candidate</a> Sarah Palin met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/donald_trump_will_not_run_in_2012.php">2012 Flirter</a> Donald Trump at the Times Square pizzeria tonight.  (So much for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/feel_that_its_sarah_palin_the_donal.php">&quot;low key&quot; meal</a>.)  When asked, &quot;How about a Trump-Palin ticket?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/05/sarah-palin-donald-trump-praise-each-other-over-pizza.html">Palin reportedly crowed</a>, &quot;<strong>That sounds exciting! Sounds unconventional!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>ABC News also recounts the love fest: Trump said: &quot;I&#x2019;ll tell you she&apos;s a great woman, a terrific woman, and a great friend,&quot; and added, &quot;I&apos;d love her to run,&quot; while Palin said, &quot;What do we have in common? A love for this country and a desire to see our economy put back on the right track,&quot; and she likes &quot;his independence, his willingness to speak his mind.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/palin-visits-trump-in-new-york/?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;seid=auto">Caucus reports</a>, &quot;Artan Brdakic, a worker there, said they had a pepperoni pizza, a sausage pizza and a meatball pizza, with Mr. Trump wearing a suit with a blue tie for the meal and accompanied by his wife, Melania.&quot;  Yes, Melania Trump was there, along with Palin&apos;s parents and Palin&apos;s youngest daughter Piper. Another weird note: Palin was eating her pizza with fork and knife. </p>

<p>Don&apos;t worry&#x2014;Palin did stop by Trump&apos;s gilded apartment at Trump Tower.  Apparently the Hockey Mom requested the meeting, as Trump&apos;s special counsel Michael Cohen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/05/31/2011-05-31_sarah_palin_donald_trump_split_a_pepperoni_pizza_at_famous_famiglia_in_times_squ.html">told the Daily News</a> that &quot;Palin requested the meeting, saying she was coming through town on her &apos;One Nation&apos; bus trip to New Hampshire. They are friends and have been talking for a while about getting together when the governor is in town,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;Not for nothing, I think Mr. Trump can teach a lot of these politicians a lot.&quot; Yeah, like how to take attention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/donald_trumps_strong_showing_in_nh.php">away from Mitt Romney</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://twitter.com/#!/pattymo/status/75754894644097024">One person Tweeted</a>, &quot;Palin/Trump 2012! Definitely want someone who picked Famous Famiglia&apos;s in Times Square to have the nuke codes.&quot;  Why were Palin and Trump at Famiglia, besides the fact that it&apos;s located at the Crossworlds of the Lamestream Media?  Well, Trump&apos;s latest batch of Celebrity Apprentice contestants had to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/19/lil_jon_at_famiglia.php">sell pizza at Famiglia</a>. (Former Celebrity Apprentice contestant/Real Housewife of Atlanta Nene Leakes calls Famigilia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325005849/http://twitter.com/#!/NeNeLeakes/status/75730389515251713">her favorite pizza spot</a>.) </p>

<p>So, where will Palin be today? Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.  </p>
