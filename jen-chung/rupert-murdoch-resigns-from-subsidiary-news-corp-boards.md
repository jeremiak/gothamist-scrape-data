<p>Rupert Murdoch, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144139/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/01/rupert_murdoch_disses_romneys_staff.php">Twitter-loving</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144139/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/rupert_murdoch_this_is_the_most_hum.php">battered</a> media mogul, is making some big moves: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144139/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/murdoch-resigns-news-corp-subsidiary-boards">AP reports</a> that he &quot;has resigned from a number of News Corp. subsidiary boards in Britain and the United States. Daisy Dunlop confirmed a report Saturday in Britain&apos;s Telegraph newspaper, which said that Murdoch had stepped down as a director of NI Group, Times Newspaper Holdings and News Corp. Investments in the U.K.&quot; </p>

<p>The U.S. boards were not specified, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9417815/Rupert-Murdoch-steps-down-from-NI-boards.html">Telegraph reports that the move</a> &quot;[fuels] expectations that he is preparing to sell the newspaper group.&quot;  An analyst told the Telegraph that this is the &quot;slow fade of Rupert and [his son] James from the UK,&quot; prompted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144139/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/07/as_phone_hacking_scandal_grows_rupe.php">phone hacking scandal</a>. Claire Enders  said, &quot;The grip of the Murdochs, finger by finger, has been loosened and it&#x2019;s not in order to return triumphantly. It&#x2019;s a permanent shift. James and Rupert have decided that they are not welcome in the UK, and they&#x2019;re right. there is an enforced emotional withdrawal from these assets because they are no longer useful [in terms of influence].&quot;</p>

<p>Murdoch faces a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9410035/Rupert-Murdoch-faces-shareholder-revolt-at-News-Corporation-AGM.html">contentious shareholder meeting this fall</a>.</p>
