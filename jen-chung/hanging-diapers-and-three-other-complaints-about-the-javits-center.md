<p>Last week, we found out that Governor Andrew Cuomo wants to raze the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to make way for a new convention center in Queens, even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020445/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/16/we_must_renovate_the_javits_center.php">$400 million is being spent to renovate the Javits Center</a>.  While Empire State Development Corporation spokesman Austin Shafran said of the renovations, &quot;This is essential work. Finishing this work will allow Javits to hold on to the business it has and be an acceptable facility while it still stands,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020445/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/arts/design/javits-center-plans-are-deflating-for-architects.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times has some damning statements about the place</a>.  <br>
</p><ul><li>Mark Wigley, the dean of Columbia University&#x2019;s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation: &quot;<strong>It&#x2019;s just such an awful building that the only reason to keep it would be as a monument to stupidity.</strong>&quot;</li>	<li>Governor Cuomo to the NY Times: &quot;<strong>The day it opened it was outdated and already behind schedule.</strong>&quot;</li>	<li>ESDC spokesman Shafran further clarified his comments, &quot;<strong>This is essential work to fix basic issues such as well-documented roof leaks that have been covered by hanging diapers.</strong>&quot;</li>	<li>And even architect Bruce S. Fowle, who is overseeing the renovation, is backhanded in his praise: &quot;<strong>It&#x2019;s not the black hole that it was.</strong> The space will feel brighter, more cheerful.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
