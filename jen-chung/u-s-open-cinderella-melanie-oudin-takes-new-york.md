<p>Yesterday, 17-year-old Melanie Oudin continued her surprise run at the U.S. Open, defeating 13 seed  Nadia Petrova 1-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3 and advancing to the quarterfinals.  The crowds at Arhur Ashe Stadium have been rallying around the 70th-ranked Georgia native (for instance, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155419/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekHaKO3H8jU">listen to the crowd at match point</a>, right before beating Maria Sharapova), but the attention is also a bit overwhelming.  </p>

<p>Oudin needed security when she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155419/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2009/09/07/2009-09-07_melanie_oudin_sees_just_how_big_she_came_up_at_us_open_in_visit_to_times_square.html">went to practice on Sunday</a> and her coach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155419/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/sports/tennis/08oudin.html?ref=sports">told the NY Times</a> her Monday play has been at least a little compromised: </p><blockquote>According to [coach Brian] de Villiers, she was not at her best, in part because he felt she had become distracted by two public appearances Sunday, which included a trip to Times Square for a photo shoot that ended up being cut short when a pair of photographers got into a shoving match.<p></p>

<p>Oudin said the incident &quot;wasn&#x2019;t that big of a deal,&quot; but according to de Villiers, she has been struck by the speed with which she has begun to be recognized. &quot;With all the distractions in the last couple days, I don&#x2019;t think she had quite the same mind-set at the start of the match,&quot; he said. &quot;You could just see from her demeanor and that it took a while to get going.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155419/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/tennis/it_love_love_between_teen_queen_IakRfQ1yjMNF57yVrxzddM">Post says</a> the Times Square appearance involved Oudin receiving a Junior&apos;s cheesecake inscribed with &quot;New York loves Oudin,&quot; and &quot;Believe,&quot; which is what&apos;s stamped on her sneakers. But she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155419/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/open/2009-09-07-oudin-success_N.htm">won&apos;t let the attention go to her head</a>, &quot;Just because all of this is happening, it&apos;s not like I&apos;m going to change the person. I just love to play tennis, and I&apos;m doing well and I&apos;m winning. That&apos;s the only thing that&apos;s changing.&quot;  </p>

<p>Oudin will meet Caroline Wozniacki, the 9th seed from Denmark, tomorrow. And Roza Islamova, mother and former coach of number 1 seed Dinara Safina, says that while Oudin is playing well, the Russian women she&apos;s beaten <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155419/http://abcnews.go.com/International/american-girl-melanie-oupin-fells-russias-tennis-stars/Story?id=8514964&amp;page=2">weren&apos;t really ready for the U.S Open</a>, psychologically or physically.  </p>
