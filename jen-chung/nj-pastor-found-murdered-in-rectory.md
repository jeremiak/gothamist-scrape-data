A friend said of Rev. Edward &quot;Father Ed&quot; Hinds, 61, &quot;He was an exceptional, exceptional ma. He didn&#x2019;t offend anybody. He didn&#x2019;t take on issues, he didn&#x2019;t use the pulpit to take on anything political. A lot of time he&#x2019;d talk and he&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Well where&#x2019;s God in this?&#x2019;&quot; Morris County prosecutor Robert Bianchi said, &quot;The fact is that this was a community leader whose arms were wide open to downtrodden. Maybe one of those individuals was involved. That kind of generosity is preyed upon.&quot;  </p>
