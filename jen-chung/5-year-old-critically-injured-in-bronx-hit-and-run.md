Joshua Saunders was ran into East 214th Street to chase a ball his older brother hit when a SUV, described as a green Nissan Pathfinder, hit him and continued on without stopping.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406190908/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/08/29/2010-08-29_bx_boy_5_critical_in_hit__run.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Daily News says</a> he was dragged halfway down the street while a neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406190908/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/heartless_hit_run_knocks_boy_into_jJpcCSdo5Vi8oOy0chJVeN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;This psycho comes out of nowhere and knocks Joshua 30 feet into the air. My heart sunk -- he looked like a rag doll in the air.&quot;</p>

<p>Witnesses told WCBS 2 that the vehicle was speeding and that Joshua was thrown under another car. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406190908/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/28/police-seek-driver-in-brutal-bronx-hit-and-run/">boy&apos;s sister said</a>, &quot;I was there beside him, looking him in the face, and I said, &#x2018;Bro, get up.&apos;&quot; And his uncle said of the driver, &quot;I want him to turn himself in. How do you hit a little kid like that and drive off?&quot;</p>

<p>The boy is at Jacobi Medical Center in stable but critical condition; he sustained two broken legs and &quot;massive&quot; internal injuries.  Another neighbor said, &quot;I think it&#x2019;s a shame. He actually should have stopped, actually made sure everything was okay, but again, people come through, speed, and disregard the speed limit around here.&quot; </p>
