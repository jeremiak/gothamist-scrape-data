<p>Reminder: Swimming in the Central Park Reservoir is illegal.  This was confirmed in 2004 when two Canadian tourists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032320/http://gothamist.com/2004/04/21/central_park_reservoir_is_not_a_swimming_hole.php">decided to scale the four-foot fence and take a dip</a>, but, hey, that was seven years ago, so we were due for another incident: a man was removed from the reservoir today by the Fire Department because he refused their requests to get out.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032320/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/swim_nut_dragged_from_central_park_1U3et4zCFKtT921APuhCAO">According to the Post</a>, &quot;The man, described as a white male in his 40s, allegedly scaled the chain-link fence at the Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and jumped into the 40-foot deep body of water sometime before 3 p.m, officials said.&quot;  When the man refused to agree to firefighters&apos; requests for him to come back to dry land, he was floating and &quot;then drifting about 20 feet from the northeast edge of the reservoir, and three FDNY firefighters swam over to him with a yellow rope and lassoed him, officials said.&quot; </p>

<p>The man is currently in stable condition at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032320/http://gothamist.com/2004/04/21/central_park_reservoir_is_not_a_swimming_hole.php">Back in 2004</a>, the pair of Canadians&#x2014;who were removed by a scuba team (the cops also cut the fence)&#x2014;had to spend the night in jail.  And pro-tip: The only place to go swimming in Central Park is the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032320/http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/north-end/lasker.html">Lasker Pool</a>. </p>
