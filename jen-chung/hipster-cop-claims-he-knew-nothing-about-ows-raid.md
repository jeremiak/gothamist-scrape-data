<p>NYPD Detective Rick Lee, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/http://gothamist.com/tags/hipstercop">Hipster Cop</a> whose love of Burberry and Ralph Lauren and DIY J.Crew glasses made him an Internet meme, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/https://twitter.com/#!/ChristRobbins/status/136542290691887104">seen today at Zuccotti Park</a> after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/nypd_evicts_occupy_wall_street_clea.php">1 a.m. eviction of Occupy Wall Street&apos;s encampment</a>.  And Lee says he had no idea the protesters were being swept out.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/familiar-police-presence-in-park-says-he-was-kept-in-the-dark/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">CityRoom spoke to Lee</a>, who said, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t know anything about it until I got into work this morning. So much for letting you know - they kept it very hush-hush.... It could have been a lot worse, which nobody really wants. I think it went well, all things considered.&quot; He also explained his job getting to know protesters these nearly two months: &quot;You just have to kind of follow them around and get a feel for what they&#x2018;re going to do.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD has allowed Lee to speak with various publications, which is unusual since the police like to control the image of the department, but Ray Kelly probably sees Lee&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/hipster_cop_talks_fashion_with_gq_t.php">thoughts on fashion with GQ</a> as a welcome antidote to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/anonymous_outs_nypd_officer_who_all.php">Tony Baloney</a>.  </p>

<p>Lee also told CityRoom that when he observed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/occupy_wall_street_claims_new_park.php">protesters trying to take Duarte Park</a> at Canal Street and 6th Avenue earlier today, he didn&apos;t recognize them, &quot;It was a different group. They were more radical. I tried to talk to them, to get them out, but they weren&#x2019;t looking to do any kind of talking.&quot; Well, maybe that&apos;s because he was gone for two weeks: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522054855/https://twitter.com/#!/Newyorkist/status/135744218982395905">NewYorkist found out this past weekend</a>, &quot;Detective Rick Lee informs he was out sick for two weeks. A serious health matter but he&apos;s back now.&quot;</p>
