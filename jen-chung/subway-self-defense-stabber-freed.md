										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="032910twotrain.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160742im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/032910twotrain.jpg" width="250" height="231"> <br> <i>sandrus10009&apos;s Flickr</i></div> Brenddy Garcia, who fatally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160742/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/28/two_dead_after_1_train_stabbing_inc.php">stabbed two men on a 2 train</a> in March, was freed from Rikers Island yesterday. On Friday, a grand jury believed that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160742/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/22/man_wont_face_murder_charges_for_fa.php">acted in self-defense</a> and did not indict him for murder. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160742/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_slasher_self_defense_salvation_KwBL3aJKMxM9qe9hYP6EdJ">Post caught</a> the 19-year-old &quot;relish[ing] his first seconds outside of prison, beaming a big smile and deeply breathing in the fresh air,&quot; and Garcia sarcastically said to the reporter, &quot;I&#x2019;m a monster, right?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Garcia was referring to how he was initially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160742/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/02/suspect_in_subway_stabbing_claiming.php">painted as the aggressor</a> in the early morning confrontation (and the machete picture probably didn&apos;t help either). Witnesses confirmed that Garcia was being attacked by a group of people on the subway when he used a folding knife with a four-inch blade to stab Ricardo Williams and Darnell Morel.  Garcia&apos;s lawyer said, &quot;He got jumped and had no other choice than to do what he did.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post spied what looked like a party at his family&apos;s home in Brooklyn. While Garcia&apos;s family did not comment, one person heading in said, &quot;Justice has been served.&quot;   And speaking of subway violence, a 20-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160742/http://www.1010wins.com/Man-Injured-in-Stabbing-On-the-Subway-in-Queens/7160466">was stabbed</a>, possibly by a group of men, in the neck, arm and stomach last night at 9 p.m. on a J train. </p>
