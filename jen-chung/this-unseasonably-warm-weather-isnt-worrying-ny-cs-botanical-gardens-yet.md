Climate scientists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153433/https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/how-bad-is-an-early-warm-spring-climate-change/517992/?utm_source=atltw">tell the Atlantic</a> that due to &quot;human-caused climate change, spring is happening about 2.5 days earlier every decade,&quot; and plants are blooming &quot;earlier and earlier every year.&quot; As the earth burns, we wondered how its plant life is holding up, and reached out to a couple local experts to check in.<br>
 <br>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153433/http://nybg.org/">New York Botanical Garden</a>, which shared these recent flower photos with us, &quot;is not worried about this stretch of unseasonably warm weather,&quot; according to Brian Sullivan, Vice President for Gardens, Landscape and Outdoor Collections at the New York Botanical Garden. &quot;We&apos;ve been enjoying late winter flowers, for example, witch hazels and snowdrops, which are having a great year,&quot; Sullivan told us. &quot;We are also seeing some early spring flowers, such as daffodils and crocuses.&quot; </p>

<p>If we do get winter temperatures now, however, Sullivan says, &quot;we might lose some of those open flowers or see some damage to the foliage tips. But we&apos;d still expect to see a wide variety of flowers across the landscape in April and May.&quot; </p>

<p>Melanie Sifton, the Vice President of Horticulture at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153433/http://www.bbg.org/">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a>, said that some of its plants are in an earlier-than-typical bloom now, like the <em>Prunus subhirtella &apos;Autumnalis&apos;</em>&#x2014;a.k.a. the cherry tree (this one blooms in both the fall and early spring). Sifton added, &quot;Overall, it may be too soon to say if this will have any damage to the plants or if these will lead to an earlier spring bloom than is typical.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Maybe one day we&apos;ll have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153433/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/11/see_it_palm_trees_in_nyc.php">palm trees in NYC</a>, or at least whatever&apos;s left of it that isn&apos;t underwater. In the meantime, down in D.C. they may be seeing a cherry blossoms peak in two weeks&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153433/http://dcist.com/2017/03/cherry_blossom_peak_bloom_is.php">earliest cherry blossom bloom on record</a>!</p>
