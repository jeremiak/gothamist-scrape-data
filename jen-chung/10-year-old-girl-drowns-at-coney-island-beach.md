<p>According to police, Takara McDuffy, 10, and a nine-year-old girl had been playing on a jetty near Stillwell Avenue when they fell in. The girls were pulled out by a lifeguard and other beachgoers at 6:30 p.m. Lifeguards are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015511/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/coneyisland/facilities/beaches">on duty from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</a></p>

One dude&#x2014;there was another gentleman helping me as well&#x2014;he grabbed the girl. He was having some problems helping her back to the shore, so I told him to put her on my back and I&#x2019;d bring her halfway, pretty much bring her to safety.&quot; </p>

<p>Murray said many people tried to help with CPR and added, &quot;I&#x2019;m not sure what exactly happened, but from the looks of it, it looks like the waves must have pushed them back to where they couldn&#x2019;t come back to shore, because the waves were pretty heavy today.&quot; Takara was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital.</p>

<p>Borough President Eric Adams and City Council Member Mark Treyger will be asking for reforms to how the city approaches water safety, with Adams&apos;s office noting that it&apos;s the sixth drowning death this summer. The other deaths include a two-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015511/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/06/missing_2-yr-old_found_drowned_in_p.php">who drowned in Prospect Park Lake</a>, two 13-year-olds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015511/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/21/13-yr-old_drowns_while_swimming_in.php">who died in the Bronx River</a>, and a 21-year-old man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015511/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/26/21-year-old_man_missing_after_jumpi.php">drowned in the East River</a>.  <br>
