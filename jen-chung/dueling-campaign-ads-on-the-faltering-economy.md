<p>It&apos;s totally the economy, stupid!  With yesterday&apos;s trouble on Wall Street adding to economic unease (higher gas prices, the mortgage crisis), Barack Obama and John McCain addressed the economic climate.</p>

<p>McCain first said the &quot;fundamentals of our economy are still strong...I promise you, we will never put America in this position again. We will clean up Wall Street.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130713072611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4KY39jLdu4">video</a>) but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130713072611/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/15/mccain_fundamentals_of_economy.html">later shifted</a> saying the fundamentals are &quot;at great risk.&quot;  And he also claimed that the fundamentals he meant were American workers, innovations, etc. to use them as a buffer in case Obama attacked.

Obama&apos;s campaign also used the Republican&apos;s words against him <i>three times</i> in an ad that also uses footage of yesterday&apos;s Wall Street chaos:</p>
