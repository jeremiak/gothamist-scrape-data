Christopher Hanney is now facing a possible life sentence for the crime.  <p></p>

<p>Hanney, 46, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129084008/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-nypd-detective-guilty-attack-torching-wife-article-1.1013243?localLinksEnabled=false">once worked for the 66th Precinct as well as the TSA</a>, and wife, Audrey Mabrey, 29, were separated during the November 2009 incident.  Mabrey had moved out of their home, but still visited because it was closer to a community college where she was taking classes.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129084008/http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/local/hillsborough/i-instantly-went-up-in-flames-01242012">According to MyFoxTampaBay</a>, &quot;She said there were no cars at the house, so she thought Hanney wasn&apos;t home. But when she went into, she found him standing there.&quot;</p><blockquote>&quot;As soon as I entered the home, Christopher was standing stark naked with a butcher knife and bummed rushed me immediately,&quot; Mabrey recalled.<p></p>

<p>She says he forced her into the garage, and put her down on a blanket where she says he assaulted her with the knife to her throat.</p>

<p>She says Hanney began to question the paternity of their oldest child.</p>

<p>She told him, &quot;We planned him what are you talking about? We planned him. He&apos;s yours.&quot;</p>

<p>Mabrey testified Hanney took out a hammer and began hitting her with it. She made the motion to jurors, showing how he swung it back and forth.</p></blockquote>After beating her, he poured gasoline on her and tossed a candled &quot;like he&apos;s tossing a remote... I instantly go up in flames.&quot;  She has burns on 80% of her body.<p></p>

<p>Hanney had claimed that a masked man tied him up and Mabrey was trying to burn him with gasoline, but when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129084008/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-nypd-detective-guilty-attack-torching-wife-article-1.1013243?localLinksEnabled=false">he kicked to get free,</a> his wife was burned, &quot;Audrey just went up in a fireball.&quot;  But apparently Hanney ran from the burning house and asked someone who helped him,  &#x201C;Did I kill the bitch?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Hanney&apos;s public defender said, &quot;Mr. Hanney never intended for this to happen,&quot; explaining if he really wanted to kill Mabrey, he would have.  After five and a half hours of deliberations, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129084008/http://www2.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/2012/jan/27/memeto1-husband-found-guilty-of-setting-wife-on-fi-ar-351964/">jurors found Hanney guilty</a>. He now faces a possible life sentence.</p>
