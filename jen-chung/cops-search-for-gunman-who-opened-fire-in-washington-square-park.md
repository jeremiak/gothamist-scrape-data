<p>Gunfire broke out in the heart of Greenwich Village on Wednesday night, in Washington Square Park. Police believe the shooting may have been sparked by a drug deal gone bad... or romantic jealousy. </p>

<p>Around 11:15 p.m. on August 31st, the NYPD says officers received a report that a male &quot;displayed a firearm inside Washington Square Park, and fired a shot towards the 29 year-old male victim. The victim was struck by a concrete fragment that was sent into the air when the round struck the pavement.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim was not injured and refused medical attention, according to the police.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015013/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/fight-woman-leads-gunshots-greenwich-village-article-1.2774517">Daily News offers</a> a dramatic version of events, which suggests that the suspect and victim &quot;had been arguing for the last few days &#x2014; ever since the suspect had made a pass at the victim&#x2019;s girlfriend,&quot; with their clash culminating in the victim daring the suspect to shoot him, saying, &#x201C;Go ahead ... just tell my mother I love her.&quot; From the News&apos; sources:</p><blockquote>The gunman struck his victim twice in the head with the pistol, then pressed the muzzle against the man&#x2019;s chest, threatening to shoot. After the victim stared him down and told him to pull the trigger, the gunman pulled back and aimed the weapon at the man&#x2019;s legs, officials said.<p></p>

<p>He fired one round, which hit the sidewalk. The victim was hit with a concrete shard when the bullet impacted with the ground, cops said.</p></blockquote>The Post uses the shooting to revisit its past reports about the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015013/http://nypost.com/2016/08/04/crackheads-bums-and-hookers-have-taken-over-washington-square-park/">open-air drug market</a>&quot; in the park, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015013/http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/drug-dispute-leads-to-gunfire-in-washington-square-park/">offers a more lurid explanation</a>:<blockquote>The gunman approached his 29-year-old victim around 11:05 p.m., accusing the man of selling him fake narcotics the day before, police sources said. An argument ensued, and at one point, the assailant asked for oral sex from the dealer&#x2019;s girlfriend, who was also in the area, as retribution for the phony drugs, sources said.</blockquote>Police released images (below) of the suspect, describing him as about 5&apos;5&quot; and 25 years old. <p></p>
