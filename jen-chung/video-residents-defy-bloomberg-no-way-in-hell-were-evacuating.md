<p>Sure, Mayor Bloomberg says the city&apos;s Hurricane Irene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141354/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/nyc_starts_mandatory_evacuation_of.php">mandatory evacuation order</a> is serious and that residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141354/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/27/bloomberg_to_zone_a_residents_you_h.php">who live in the low-lying areas must get out now</a>.  But there are a few residents who think he&apos;s insane for forcing them to leave.  NBC New York&apos;s Andrew Siff visited one couple in Far Rockaways, who said, &quot;There is no way in hell we&apos;re moving out of our home!&quot;</p>

<p>A Brooklyn resident in Zone A added, &quot;I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m not gonna evacuate.  They&apos;re making a big thing over nothing.&quot;  But Siff did see some people leaving their homes, one of whom pointed out, &quot;You&apos;ve got to follow the order, because of what happened with Katrina.&quot;</p>
