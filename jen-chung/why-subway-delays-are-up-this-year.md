<p>For everyone who waited too long for a subway in April--NYC Transit revealed that <strong>train delays were up 44%</strong> in April, which is the latest month with available data.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071146/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06302008/news/regionalnews/dont_hold_the_door__subway_delays_up_44__117845.htm">Post lists the top reasons</a>:</p>

<p>1.  Track work (delaying 4,117 trains; in April 2007, there were about half the number of delays due to track work)<br>
2.  Riders holding doors (918; April 2007, 549)<br>
3.  Guard-light trouble (833; the guard-light indicates where a door is closed or not, and there were 325 in April 2007)<br>
4.  Unruly passengers (819; April 2007, 271)<br>
5.  Fire/smoke (695; April 2007, 292)<br>
6.  Signal trouble (600; April 2007, 941)<br>
7.  Sick riders (591; April 2007, 409) </p>

<p>The Post reports that one MTA board member blamed NYC Transit management, calling the poor figures a result of &quot;lack of supervision of what goes on underground,&quot; but NYCT President Howard Roberts said it wasn&apos;t the employees&apos; faults (conceivably aging trains and equipments are partly to blame as well).  Still, as ridership continues to grow, $8.9 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071146/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/24/mtas_latest_budget_forecast_means_f.php">will be spent to increase service</a> to the 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, B, M and W lines. And another interesting fact: For NYCT, a train is &quot;delayed&quot; it&apos;s more than 6 minutes late.</p>
