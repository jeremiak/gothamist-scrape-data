Sure, the Fire Department has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://twitter.com/#!/NYTMetro/status/107825907510673410">rescuing dozens of people</a> from homes flooded with five feet of water, but now that Irene is starting to veer away from the NYC region<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/28/hurricane_irene_downgraded_to_tropi.php"> as a Tropical Storm</a>, it&apos;s not too early for everyone to weigh in on whether the city&apos;s decision to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/nyc_starts_mandatory_evacuation_of.php"> evacuate residents in low-lying areas</a> as well as the state&apos;s decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/breaking_mta_shutting_down_saturday.php">shut down the MTA</a> were overreaction (heck, people have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/poll_is_nyc_overreacting_to_hurrica.php">debating that since Friday</a>).

And from the peanut/Twitter gallery:

<ul>
	<li>&quot;NYC on #HurricaneIrene = biggest overreaction to a storm ever. And I &apos;survived&apos; DC&apos;s Snowmaggedon.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://twitter.com/#!/emroyfromhs/status/107815297230188544">@emilyamerel</a></li>
	<li>&quot;Wow they evacuated NYC because of rain. Is there a way to charge weather forecasters for putting millions of people in panic #overreaction&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://twitter.com/#!/jeremychaput/status/107778333193936896">@jeremychaput</a></li>
<li>&quot;Woke up to find hurricane Irene is now a tropical storm. Way to overreact NYC. Bloody marys anyone?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/https://twitter.com/#!/nickperold/status/107819999321788417">@nickperold</a></li>
	<li>&quot;Epic #overreaction by the NYC government to #Irene. This was a medium thunderstorm at best.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://twitter.com/#!/eck34/status/107785336599486465">@eck34</a></li>
	<li>And from yesterday &quot;Trending (in 36 hours): Bloomberg overreaction #<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://twitter.com/#!/JohnAKeith/status/107319355527794688">MAIrene&quot; @johnakeith</a> </li>
</ul><br>Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s position has been that the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/27/bloomberg_everyone_should_stay_insi.php">had to prepare for the worst</a>. The MTA may have been motivated by the events of August 2007, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044152/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/08/wild_wednesday.php">when a tornado&apos;s rain caused flooding that shut down</a> the system during the morning rush hour.
