<p>Yesterday, the police released surveillance video of a man who stole a steamroller from a Bronx parking lot earlier this year. And as you can see, the suspect had a novel method for stealing it: he just acts like he owns the machine!</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, on April 17 at 11:25 a.m., the suspect walked into a parking lot at 1283 Easy Gun Hill Road, &quot;got into the steamroller that was parked there and drove off with it.&quot;<br>
