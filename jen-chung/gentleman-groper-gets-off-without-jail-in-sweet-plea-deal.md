<p>In April of last year, the NYPD was looking for a neatly dressed man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175712/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/video_photos_well-dressed_groper_on.php">who had groped numerous women in Manhattan</a>, grabbing their buttocks or genitals. After one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175712/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/groping_charges_dropped_against_par.php">mistaken identity arrest</a>, the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175712/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/03/gentleman_groper_reportedly_caught.php">finally arrested lawyer Paul Kraft</a>, 31, in December. Now it turns out that Kraft has pleaded guilty, but won&apos;t have to serve any time in jail.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175712/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/notorious_gentleman_groper_may_get_FT3mHLe7XTChc9Yzd7KNqI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Prosecutors had cited Kraft&apos;s lack of criminal history and that he had taken responsibility for his actions in agreeing to the plea deal and dismissing the top count of unlawful surveillance -- for his allegedly putting his cell phone under the skirt of the women who&apos;d been walking on Centre Street.&quot; Instead, by pleading guilty to the five misdemeanors, he&apos;ll just serve probation and need to take part in weekly program for a &quot; a sexual impulse therapy program&quot; over 18 months.</p>

<p>Friends of Kraft <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175712/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/03/woman_who_dined_with_alleged_gentle.php">noticed that he looked like the suspect</a> in images and videos the police distributed and went to authorities after the first suspect was released. A woman who had dated a colleague of Kraft&apos;s fiancee told us, &quot;Paul&apos;s girlfriend even teased him about looking like the guy in the photos, and he kind of freaked out. He got his eyebrows waxed and changed his hair color&#x2014;his eyebrows were a lot thinner afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p>She also said, &quot;Initially he seemed like a really cool guy, because he would sit around and talk to the girls, but then you kind of realized that he didn&apos;t engage the guys in any conversation. His overall demeanor was just kind of creepy. He showed a kind of insecurity&#x2014;my boyfriend and I would talk about it all the time because his fiancee was so sweet.&quot; Further, Kraft&apos;s fiancee had also apparently found violent pornography&#x2014;&quot;rape porn&quot;&#x2014;on his computer.</p>

<p>Kraft is a lawyer and the Post adds, &quot;Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Kevin McGrath agreed to sign a certificate of release from civil disabilities, which may allow [Kraft] to ultimately keep his law license.&quot;</p>
