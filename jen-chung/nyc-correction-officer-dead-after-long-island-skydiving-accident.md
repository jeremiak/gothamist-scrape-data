<p>A 25-year-old man was killed and his skydiving instructor was injured during a tandem jump yesterday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015231/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/cops-two-injured-in-calverton-skydiving-accident-1.8929056">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;The accident happened at 4:10 p.m. at Skydive Long Island, FAA investigators and Riverhead police said. Skydive Long Island is a Calverton-based business that caters to recreational skydivers and also operates a training school.&quot;</p>

<p>The skydiving student was identified as Gary Messina, a NYC Correction officer. Apparently Messina died during the landing; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015231/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/nyregion/skydiving-student-killed-in-long-island-jump-.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times spoke to Messina&apos;s father</a>, &quot;Mr. Messina said officials believed his son and the instructor were about 75 feet off the ground when a whirlwind of dust caused their parachute to collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>Messina, who had been working for the Correction department since 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015231/http://7online.com/news/correction-officer-killed-in-li-skydiving-accident;-instructor-critical/229015/">was dead when emergency workers arrived</a>. Norman Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association Inc., said, &quot;It&apos;s an unfortunate tragedy that we lose one of our brother officers the day before his [26th] birthday, a young man, a great officer with so much promise. Our hearts go out to his family and we will always be there for them.&quot;</p>

<p>The instructor is in critical condition at Stony Brook Hospital. Skydive Long Island owner Ray Maynard said, &quot;I&apos;m very sorry about the unfortunate skydiving accident that happened today. It resulted in one fatality and one person in critical condition. It&apos;s under investigation by the FAA and the police, and that&apos;s all I have to say.&quot;</p>
