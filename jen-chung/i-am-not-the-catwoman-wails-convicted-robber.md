<p>The woman accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140121052820/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/video_cat_mask-wearing_lady_robber.php">donning a cat mask and robbing stores</a> in Manhattan and Queens was convicted today.  However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140121052820/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/catwoman-bandit-shana-spalding-sentenced-10-years-judge-blasts-utterly-antisocial-behavior-article-1.1015324?localLinksEnabled=false">Shana Spalding yelled</a>, &quot;<strong>I&#x2019;m not the Catwoman</strong>,&quot; as she was led from court.</p>

<p>Last December, Spalding, 29, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140121052820/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-12-13/news/30513747_1_shanna-spalding-divine-infamy-cat-mask">was found guilty</a> of stealing from various stores in 2010.  Today, she was sentenced to 10 years, and prosecutors said Spalding armed herself with a toy gun and targeted stores with certain employees; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140121052820/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/qns_catwoman_caged_for_years_for_KtxgbGVKaHtOs8CwhV3d2L?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">ADA Craig Ortner  said</a>, &quot;She purposely preyed on young vulnerable women who were doing nothing more than working at the store, and she chose to hold them up,&quot; and added, &quot;She continues to manipulate and she continues to blame everyone but herself. In reality, she has no one to blame but herself.&quot; Further, Ortner revealed that Spalding was recorded making death threats from prison, &quot;She hopes the district attorney and the jury all die.&quot;</p>

<p>Spalding told the judge, &quot;Your honor, I&#x2019;m not a violent person...The toy gun was in my bag. I never took it out. I didn&#x2019;t even know it was in there,&quot; and her lawyer said, &quot;&#x201C;Her motivation has always remained the same, that the boyfriend of her friend forced her to do these things.&quot; But the judge said the thefts were &quot;malignant... Your utterly antisocial behavior cannot be tolerated.&quot; </p>

<p>When she was removed from the courtroom, she yelled at court officers, &quot;Get off me!&quot; and told photographers, &quot;Stop taking pictures, you bastards!&quot;</p>
