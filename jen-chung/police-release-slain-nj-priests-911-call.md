Hinds, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142916/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/25/janitor_arrested_in_nj_priests_murd.php">allegedly killed by the church&apos;s janitor</a> Jose Feliciano, called 911 from his cellphone; he managed to give his address, but the phone disconnected before the dispatcher could confirm the location.  So the dispatcher called back, and on the second attempt, Feliciano answered.  The dispatcher asked, &quot;Sir, this is the State Police. You called 911. Do you have an emergency?&quot; and Feliciano responded, &quot;No, we don&apos;t. Thank you&quot;&#x2014;but Hinds&apos; voice is &quot;barely be heard [in the background] saying, &apos;Yes we do [have an emergency].&apos;&apos;&apos;</p>
