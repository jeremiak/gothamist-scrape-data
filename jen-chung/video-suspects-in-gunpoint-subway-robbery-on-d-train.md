<p>This morning the NYPD asked for the public&apos;s help in regards to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064922/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/video_suspects_in_j_train_station_i.php">gunpoint iPhone robbery</a> at the Canal Street J train station. Now police say another person was the victim of a gunpoint robbery on a subway.</p>

<p>Investigators say that on Wednesday, April 3rd, at around 3:45 a.m., a 26-year-old man was on a downtown D train when two men approached him. They brandished a gun and took the victim&apos;s personal property before fleeing the train on foot at the West 4th Street Station. Here&apos;s a video of the suspects before the robbery:</p>
