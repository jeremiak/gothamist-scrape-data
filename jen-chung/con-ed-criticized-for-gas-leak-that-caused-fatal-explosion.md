Dindial Boodram, whose wife Ghanwatti died, told the Daily News, &quot;I want answers, I need answers&quot; about how Con Ed handled reports for a leak&#x2014;utility workers had been on the scene for 90 minutes and never evacuated residents in spite of high gas levels from a street manhole.</p>

<p>Con Ed spokesman Michael Clendenin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160925/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04262009/news/regionalnews/con_ed_slammed_over_killer_qns__gas_blas_166310.htm">explained to the NY Post</a> that the gas levels were not dangerous at the home of the people who called about the smell of gas, &quot;<strong>There was no protocol...Which house would you evacuate first?</strong>&quot; The News says that an indoor reading of 10% triggers a house evacuation; the reading under a nearby manhole was 80% (it should be zero in normal situations).  </p>

<p>The Post reports, &quot;The worker called in an emergency at 4:15 p.m. and continued to take readings, but no one was evacuated.  Additional crews pulled up 35 minutes later, just as Boodram&apos;s house burst into flames.&quot;  City Councilman Eric Gioia, a frequent critic of Con Ed, said, &quot;<strong>Of course, you should evacuate this street. It&apos;s common sense. They have to understand that they&apos;re rolling the dice with people&apos;s lives.</strong>&quot;  Back in 2007, a Queens grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160925/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/23/woman_burned_in.php">died from her burns in a gas leak</a>; both Con Ed and the FDNY could not find the cause of the gas smell in the neighborhood.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160925/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/nyregion/26explode.html?ref=nyregion">According to the NY Times</a>, Con Ed &quot;found a small hole in a two-inch gas main in front the house that appeared to have been the source of a leak&quot; as well as a &quot;damaged electrical cable near that hole.&quot;  However, Con Ed is &quot;still investigating what had caused the hole and what had touched off the explosion.&quot;  And one of Boodram&apos;s young sons, 10-year-old Ryan, said to the Times, &quot;Before she died, she had once left me a letter so she said I could always remember her, but it was in the house when it exploded.&quot;</p>
