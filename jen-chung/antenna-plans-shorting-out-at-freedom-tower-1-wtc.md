But now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105022/http://www.observer.com/2009/real-estate/signal-trouble-freedom-tower">Observer reports on &quot;signal trouble&quot;</a>: &quot;According to multiple people familiar with discussions, the Metropolitan Television Alliance, a consortium of local television stations, last month informed the Port Authority that it would not be proceeding with a deal for its members to broadcast from an antenna atop the 102-story tower at the World Trade Center site.&quot;  The MTVA were asked, back in 2003, to pay $20 million to build the antenna and pay $10 million/year rent, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105022/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04082009/news/regionalnews/a_tower_out_age_163415.htm">given the economy</a>&#x2014;and the facts that their signals are fine now and that there are other available, already-built antennas around town&#x2014;MTVA has been rethinking things.  The Port Authority, though, tells the Observer that the spire to hit 1,776-feet &quot;continues to be part of the design.&quot;</p>
