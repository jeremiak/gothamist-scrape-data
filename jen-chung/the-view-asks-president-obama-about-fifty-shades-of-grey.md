<p>President Obama is such a snob. During a pop culture pop quiz, the ladies of The View <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031549/http://theview.abc.go.com/">asked him if he knew the name</a> of the &#x201C;controversial sex book that&#x2019;s on millions of women&#x2019;s bedside tables&quot;? And he said no! Why does he not know about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031549/http://gothamist.com/tags/fiftyshadesofgrey">amazing trilogy by E.L. James</a> that is re-igniting couples&apos; sex lives (and helping sell out grey ties)&#x2014;is he busy with other stuff or does he just read his own memoirs over and over again?  </p>

<p>However, it is <em>possible </em>Mr. President was just being sly when he said, &quot;I&apos;ll ask Michelle when I get home.&quot;</p>

<p>We just don&apos;t get why Entertainment Weekly wants Obama to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031549/http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/05/15/obama-the-view-mitt-romney/">stop appearing on entertainment shows.</a></p>
