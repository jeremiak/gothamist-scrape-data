<p>Two days after a woman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015744/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/15/he_pushed_me_as_hard_as_he_could_wo.php">sexually assaulted and then shoved into the train tracks</a> at a Manhattan subway station, police have arrested a suspect. Kimani Stephenson, 24, was charged with attempted murder, assault and sexual abuse. </p>

<p>The attack occurred at the 14th Street F/M station at Sixth Avenue early Friday morning around 4:20 a.m.: Bonnie Currie, 22, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015744/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-arrested-in-subway-attack-on-woman-in-greenwich-village/1880014/">said in an interview</a> that she had just walked down the stairs to the platform when a man approached her from behind &quot;wrapped both of his arms around me, and then pulled me into his body, and he put one hand on my boob, and the other hand in my crotch. He basically pushed me.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect fled while some Good Samaritans helped Currie out of the tracks. By Friday night, police released surveillance footage of a person of interest. </p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman said that a tipster contacted the police, directing them to Stephenson. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015744/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/manhattan-man-arrested-nyc-subway-platform-attack-actress-article-1.3061281">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Cops took Kimani Stephenson into custody at his home in the Lillian Wald Houses in the East Village late Saturday, sources said. About 3 a.m. Sunday, they charged him with attempted murder, assault and sex abuse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They found the clothes he was wearing during the attack, police sources said,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015744/http://nypost.com/2017/04/16/man-accused-of-groping-actress-in-subway-station-arrested/">according to the Post</a>.</p>
