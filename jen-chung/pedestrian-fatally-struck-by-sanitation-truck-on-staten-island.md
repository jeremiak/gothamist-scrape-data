<p>The NYPD says that the victim was crossing east bound&#x2014;in the crosswalk&#x2014;on Clove Road at Delafield Avenue at 7:23 a.m. when she was hit by a the truck. The truck and driver stayed at the scene. The NYPD was unable to confirm reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015612/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/18/93-year-old-woman-struck-killed-by-sanitation-truck-in-staten-island/">she was with two other pedestrians</a>; the NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating.</p>

<p>A Department of Sanitation spokesperson<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015612/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2014/07/police_responding_to_accident.html#incart_m-rpt-1"> told the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;The accident is under full investigation by the New York City Police Department. The Department wishes to extend sincere condolences to the family of the deceased. The Department&apos;s highest priority is the safety of our employees and the New Yorkers we serve.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015612/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2014/07/police_responding_to_accident.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Another resident spoke to the Advance</a>, &quot;That is a very bad intersection. If you make a left turn from Delafield Avenue onto Clove Road, you can&apos;t see anybody in the crosswalk.&quot; While she &quot;didn&apos;t witness the accident... [she] speculated that the Sanitation driver never saw the victim crossing the street because of a blind spot. Clove Road also narrows from three lanes to two lanes near the intersection.&quot;</p>
