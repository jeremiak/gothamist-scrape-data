</div></div>					<p>Matilda Ledger, daughter of actress Michelle Williams and the late actor Heath Ledger, is <em>just like us</em>.  In that she shops at Fairway.  Ledger was spotted with Williams&apos; boyfriend, Jason Segel, walking in Red Hook (outside of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034252/http://www.hopeandanchorredhook.com/">Hope and Anchor</a> on Van Brunt it seems) after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034252/http://www.popsugar.com/Jason-Segel-Hangs-Out-Brooklyn-Matilda-Ledger-23992595">getting some food</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034252/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/17/fairway_comes_t.php">Fairway</a> (there is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034252/http://www.fairwaymarket.com/store-red-hook/">cafe!</a>). </p>

<p>Williams and Segel are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034252/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michelle-williams-and-jason-segel-are-totally-in-love-source-says-2012216">reportedly &quot;totally in love&quot;</a> and Segel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034252/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/jason-segel-spotted-holding-hands-girlfriend-michelle-williams-daughter-matilda-article-1.1113309?localLinksEnabled=false">supposedly wants to be a &quot;father figure&quot;</a> to Matilda. Even Suri&apos;s Burn Book approves Matilda being cared for by Jason Segel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425034252/http://surisburnbook.tumblr.com/post/27052349307/i-am-dying-it-unfortunately-appears-that-jason">saying about another photograph</a>, &quot;It unfortunately appears that Jason Segel has a large collection of horrible checkered shirts, but this picture is the most wonderful thing I&#x2019;ve seen since the Downton Abbey finale. Matilda Ledger, you win today. Even if you&#x2019;re wearing flip-flops. We&#x2019;ll talk.&quot;</p>
