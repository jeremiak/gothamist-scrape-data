<p>In a moment that&apos;s been replayed repeatedly in coverage of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014049/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php#photo-1">fatal Boston Marathon explosions</a>, a runner falls during one of the explosions, right before the finish line. It turns out the marathoner was a 78-year-old resident from Washington state. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014049/http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20130415/NEWS01/704159868">Bill Iffrig told the Herald</a>, &quot;It was only ... feet away from me. It was really loud.&quot;</p>

<p>Luckily, he only scraped his knee. He said, &quot;Just the shock from the blast was the only damage.&quot; According to the Herald, &quot;Iffrig briefly saw a remnant of what he believes was the bomb, a casing that looked like a coffee can.&quot; He recalled, &quot;Then all this smoke was coming from someplace, and I wasn&apos;t able to see too much.&quot;</p>

<p>Iffrig, a former mason worker, told CNN&apos;s Piers Morgan that he was &quot;feeling good&quot; and then, 15 feet from the finish line, the explosion occurred:</p>

<p>He also said to the Herald, &quot;I ended up second in my division. After you&apos;ve run 26 miles you&apos;re not going to stop there.&quot; His chip says he finished with a time of 4 hours, 3 minutes and 47 seconds. This was his third Boston Marathon.</p>
