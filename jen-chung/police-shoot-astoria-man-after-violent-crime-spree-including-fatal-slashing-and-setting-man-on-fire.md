<p>A 23-year-old man is in custody after a deadly series of alleged assaults in Queens, which including a slashing, a fatal stabbing, setting a homeless man on fire and spraying chemicals on police officers yesterday. NYPD Assistant Chief Diana Pizzuti said the massive manhunt for the suspect made for &quot;a very unusual day here in Astoria.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the first incident occurred at 11:20 a.m. on Sunday when a 39-year-old woman was slashed in the face and neck in front of 25-69 36th Street. The victim, Bertha Carpio, identified the suspect as her neighbor, James Patrick Dillon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801204112/http://nypost.com/2016/03/06/2-slashed-in-separate-incidents-in-queens/">According to Carpio&apos;s husband, Dillon yelled at her</a>, &quot;What are you looking at, bitch?&quot; while he was riding a bicycle, and then threw a brick at her and brandished a knife. The husband added, &quot;My wife tried to keep moving, but he assaulted her, grabbed her by a hoodie and repeatedly slashed and stabbed her.&quot; </p>

<p>Police started to canvass the area for Dillon, with no luck&#x2014;until 3:09 p.m. when officers received a call about an argument outside a liquor store at 38-18 Astoria Boulevard. There, Dillon allegedly got into an argument with a homeless man, 61, and store owner George Patouhas, 55, stepped in. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801204112/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/maniac-stabbed-man-set-homeless-person-fire-queens-article-1.2554814">Daily News reports</a> that Patouhas was &quot;mortally knifed in the neck&quot;; he was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital. </p>

He was taken to Weill Cornell-NY Presbyterian Hospital and is currently in stable condition. <p></p>

<p>Just after 5 p.m., the authorities received a 911 call about a burglary at 30-65 42nd Street, with the call saying that a man tried to break in and was on the fire escape. Cops from the Critical Response Command tracked Dillon to 25-38 36th Street at 5:40 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801204112/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/maniac-stabbed-man-set-homeless-person-fire-queens-article-1.2554814">A neighbor said</a>, &quot;The guy was just standing there with the lighter in his hand yelling, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t come near me, don&#x2019;t come near me.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Assistant Chief Pizzuti said, &quot;The officers demanded the suspect drop a knife and bottle of accelerant he was carrying. He refused. The suspect then sprayed the two officers in the face with the liquid, burning their hands. The officer then discharged their weapons, shooting the suspect.&quot; Dillon was taken to Elmhurst Hospital center with gunshot wounds to his leg, while the police officers were taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.</p>

<p>Dillon is reportedly bipolar; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801204112/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYPD-Searches-for-Suspect-Wanted-in-3-Separate-Attacks-371210951.html">NYPD Deputy Chief John Essig said</a>, &quot;We believe it was a psychological problem with the individual. He&apos;s been treated in the past and the family has indicated that he has not been taking medication recently.&quot;</p>

<p>Store owner Patouhas was a well-known figure in the neighborhood; one person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801204112/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/nyregion/man-stabs-2-people-and-burns-another-in-queens-police-say.html?_r=0">told the Times</a>, &quot;He was such a nice guy, and he would give all these guys favors. They&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Let me get a pint of vodka, and I&#x2019;ll pay you tomorrow.&#x2019;&quot; </p>

<p>The first victim, Bertha, Carpio was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she received stitches. She said to the Post, &quot;I&#x2019;m in so much pain. I&#x2019;m really lucky to be alive. He could have killed me... He needs to be removed from society &#x2014; far, far away from here.&quot;</p>
