Yesterday, a federal jury found Bewar Aksal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161738/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/07/guilty_verdicts_in_airline_sex_assault_trial_defendant_faces_life_in_prison.html#incart_m-rpt-1">guilty of criminal sexual contact and sexual abuse</a>.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161738/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/07/alleged_victim_of_sexual_abuse_on_newark-bound_flight_tells_court_she_was_humiliated.html">victim, 50, testified</a> that she had been sleeping next to the window when she woke to Aksal&apos;s hand in her shorts. The pain, she said, &quot;that&apos;s what woke me up.&quot; She alleged that he whispered to her, &quot;Kiss me,&quot; and said, &quot;I was completely humiliated. I was absolutely freaking out. I wanted to go hide somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Another passenger said that Aksal was spooning her and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161738/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/07/airplane_sex_assault_trial_aisle_passenger_says_he_saw_north_bergen_man_in_spooning_position_with_ac.html">thought they were a couple</a>. And a flight attendant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161738/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/07/airline_sex-assault_trial_defense_attorney_rests_summations_expected.html">told the court</a> the victim &quot;came to the back (of the airplane) almost panicking. She was in distress, shaking and crying.&quot;</p>

<p>Aksal, 49, was arrested when the plane landed and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161738/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/07/airplane_sex_assault_trial_north_bergen_man_says_accuser_was_coming_onto_him.html">allegedly told FBI investigators </a>that the victim came onto him. Yesterday, he cried after the verdict was announced. Aksal faces up to life in prison.</p>
