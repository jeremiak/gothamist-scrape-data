<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo&apos;s biggest passion&#x2014;after his family and running New York State, ofco&#x2014;seems to be cars.  While this may be troublesome <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031054715/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/30/mta_ceo_walder_leaving_because_cuom.php">for, say, mass transit advocates</a>, it&apos;s awesome for classic car events.  Yesterday, Cuomo headed to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031054715/http://www.cruisetotheshow.com/">Cruise to the Show</a>, the parade and car show in Nassau County, and suggested that he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031054715/http://levittown-ny.patch.com/articles/cuomo-mangano-show-off-vintage-corvettes-at-cruise-to-the-show#photo-7817868">going to promote the car show business in New York</a>:  &quot;Our state does not do as much as it could do [to help car shows]. There are car shows that attract thousands of people in this country, and people come and they stay for days.&quot;</p>

<p>The show was devised by Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano, who has responded to criticism about the $75,000 in police overtime needed, by, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031054715/http://www.newsday.com/classifieds/cars/auto-enthusiasts-cheer-mangano-car-show-1.3180865">Newsday reports</a>, saying &quot;that labor costs for the parade and the East Meadow car show are funded entirely by taxes collected from local hotels&apos; customers. Sponsorship fees, he added, would likely put the county out on top. He envisions growing the show into an attraction for the entire Northeast.&quot; Mangano also gave Cuomo a trophy for having the best gubernatorial Corvette (a 1975 model that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031054715/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-eagerly-attends-an-auto-show.html">apologized for being dirty and not a show car</a>). </p>

<p>Among the many cars Cuomo admired, one was a 1969 Corvette restored by a Long Island man, who told the Times, &quot;It&#x2019;d be cooler if he&#x2019;d lower my taxes, but, yeah, it&#x2019;s pretty cool.&quot;</p>
