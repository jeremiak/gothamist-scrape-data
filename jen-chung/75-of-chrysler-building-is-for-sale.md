<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152455/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06112008/business/chrysler_bldg__on_the_block_115016.htm">NY Post is reporting</a> that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council &quot;is negotiating an $800 million deal for a 75 percent stake&quot; of the Chrsyler Building.  Which would mean the entire Art Deco skyscraper, designed by William Van Alen (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152455/http://gothamist.com/2005/04/27/chrysler_building_turns_75_this_spring.php">was never paid</a>!), is valued at over $1 billion.</p>

<p>TMW, a German investment group, is apparently looking to sell its stake of the building, which it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152455/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E7DB133BF936A35750C0A9679C8B63">bought for $300 million in 2001</a>.  Tishman-Speyer owns the other 25% and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152455/http://www.tishmanspeyer.com/Properties/Property.aspx?id=43">operates the whole building</a>.  Also included in the deal would be the Trylons retail space.  If the deal is completed, this would be the second major real estate deals in recent weeks--Macklowe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152455/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/25/macklowe_sells.php">sold the GM building and some others for under $4 billion</a> to a group of investors.</p>

<p>What&apos;s interesting is that Cooper Union actually owns the property the Chrysler building sits on:  The school &quot;leased it in a long-term arrangement to others and uses the payments to support tuition for its students.&quot;  </p>
