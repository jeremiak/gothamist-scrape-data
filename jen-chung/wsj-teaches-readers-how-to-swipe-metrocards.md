<p>One of the more amusing articles from the Wall Street Journal&apos;s new &quot;Greater New York&quot; section is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011109/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303828304575181021840896564.html">one about Metrocard swiping</a>.  The launching point is how two Chinese mathematicians were arrested after they tried to enter a Queens subway station by &quot;doubling up&quot; (when two people enter on one swipe) because one of the men swiped his Metrocard so many times, got the &quot;Please Swipe Again At This Turnstile&quot; error and could not pass through the turnstile.  But, really, we were just reminded of the phrase, &quot;Metrotard,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011109/http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/new_york_new_york/guide_to_new_york_jargon.php#002180">coined by The Morning News</a> circa <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011109/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/24/bending_your_metrocard.php">2003</a>: &quot;A person in front of you at the subway turnstile who can&#x2019;t figure out how to swipe his or her subway pass. Also: A person who tries to use a Metrocard to withdraw money from an ATM.&quot;</p>

<p>The WSJ spoke to Pete Foley, a TWU Local 100 official who used to be an &quot;revenue equipment maintenance&quot; type with the MTA, and found: &quot;For starters, your MetroCard must hit four sensors before you gain admission to the twilight world of the New York City subway system. The first sensor verifies that you&apos;re indeed swiping a MetroCard rather than, say, your D&apos;Agostino&apos;s Rewards card. The second ascertains that the card is flush enough to afford the fare; the third deducts the fare; and the fourth opens the gate.&quot;  (Hey, now, there&apos;s a D&apos;Agostino&apos;s reference, though we think a Duane Reade rewards mention would have broader, though maybe less upscale appeal.)  Foley said &quot;If the card doesn&apos;t go completely through the sensor, it&apos;s not going to work. It&apos;s got to be level.&quot;</p>

<p>Another problem is dirty sensors (they supposedly are cleaned a few times a day), but  in the meantime, NYC Transit spokesman Paul Fleuranges helpfully says a swipe should be &quot;steady&quot; and swift, &quot;like a punch to the gut.&quot;  Five years ago, the Public Advocate&apos;s office found that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011109/http://gothamist.com/2005/06/22/one_failed_swipe_outta_four_is_pretty_bad.php">one out of every four swipes failed</a> (!)...and someday, we may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011109/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/22/mta_metrocards_will_be_replaced_by.php">getting Smartcards</a>.</p>
