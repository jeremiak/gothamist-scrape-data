He said in a press release, &quot;As a man of intense faith, I intend to fight and win the battle against this disease. I humbly seek your sincere prayers as I confront this challenge and respectfully ask that you honor my family&#x2019;s need and wish for privacy during this time.&quot;<p></p>

<p>His press office declined to specify what kind of cancer Thompson has been diagnosed with. </p>

<p>Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015235/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/new_brooklyn_da_ken_thompson.php">defeated longtime Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes</a> in 2013. Here&apos;s his full press release:</p><blockquote>As Brooklyn District Attorney, I&#x2019;ve dedicated myself and our Office&#x2019;s resources over the past three years to keeping the people of our great borough safe while strengthening our commitment to reform and improve our criminal justice system. Since 2014, we have become a model for prosecutors&#x2019; offices around the country - holding those who break the law accountable by setting one standard of justice for all and fighting for innocent people who were wrongfully imprisoned for crimes they did not commit.<p></p>

<p>And now I am prepared for another fight.</p>

<p>Recently, I was diagnosed with cancer. As a man of intense faith, I intend to fight and win the battle against this disease. I humbly seek your sincere prayers as I confront this challenge and respectfully ask that you honor my family&#x2019;s need and wish for privacy during this time.</p>

<p>During the absences occasioned by my treatment and recovery, the Kings County District Attorney&#x2019;s Office will be led by Chief Assistant Eric Gonzalez, alongside others on the executive team. I thank you in advance for your prayers and look forward to rejoining you on the battlefield for justice.</p></blockquote><p></p>
