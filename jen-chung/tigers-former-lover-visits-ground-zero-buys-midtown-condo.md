<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="2010_08_racheuh.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_08_racheuh.jpg" width="200" height="271"> <br> <i>Rachel Uchitel, Dr. Drew in Central Park (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://www.tmz.com/2010/09/01/rachel-uchitel-mourns-dead-fiance-dr-drew-pinksy-andy-ogrady-photos-celebrity-rehab/">TMZ</a>)</i></div> Tiger Woods&apos; former favorite (we think, given that he allegedly paid her $8-10 million to keep quiet about their affair) mistress Rachel Uchitel is moving to a Manhattan condo. And, responding to potential criticism about visiting Ground Zero (her fiance died at the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks) for the filming of <em>Celebrity Rehab</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/tiger_mistress_in_sept_tv_exploit_rzKK0pZG8ahGrsbTHUhoJJ">she wants the haters to know</a>, &quot;<strong>Nobody can f--k with me about 9/11</strong>.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Uchitel, who as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/01/tigers_alleged_mistress_denies_affa.php">NYC nightclub &quot;hostess&quot;</a> caught the eye of the golf superstar, was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/01/tigers_former_lover_was_in_central.php">spotted in Central Park</a> last week filming scenes for the VH1 reality show, apparently visiting a plaque in honor of her dead fiance.  And don&apos;t accuse her of exploiting his memory: She told the Post, &quot;Who the f--k are people to be talking about me? Until they go through what I went through, living with a guy and being engaged to him and having that person dead an hour after waking up next to him,&quot; and that she visited the site to &quot;get closure on some stuff I&apos;ve been dealing with... and I don&apos;t know why people would take that the wrong way. If people think I&apos;m milking something for the benefit of getting on TV or getting more well-known, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/05/alleged_tiger_mistress_is_unrecogni.php">I&apos;m already well-known.</a>&quot; </p>

<p>The 35-year-old just bought a $1.995 million three bedroom apartment on Park Avenue and East 39th Street&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://www.tmz.com/2010/09/02/rachel-uchitel-buys-2-million-pad-on-park-ave/">TMZ suggests</a> she didn&apos;t pay the asking price, since she supposedly scored a &quot;pretty sweet deal.&quot;  There was some suggestion that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/09/01/park_avenue_residents_condoblocking_tigers_mistress.php">building didn&apos;t want</a> the infamous &quot;other woman&quot; (she also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052149/http://www.popeater.com/2010/05/13/rachel-uchitels-texts-david-boreanaz/">allegedly had an affair with Angel</a>!) to move in, but TMZ claims, &quot;She never had an issue and the buying process was &apos;pretty easy.&apos; But one of the main reasons Rachel took the place, we&apos;re told, is because she thinks it would be the perfect place to start a family ... just as soon as she locks down a man.&quot;</p>
