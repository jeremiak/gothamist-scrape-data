<p>Lately, it seems like there have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329164616/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/21/swastikas_pro-trump_graffiti_found.php">more incidents of swastikas</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329164616/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/man_finds_swastika_drawn_on_b_train.php">being drawn on</a> subway train cars than there used to be. However, the latest swastika sighting came with a hopeful and inspiring story from one commuter who worked with fellow straphangers to get rid of the hate symbols.</p>

<p>Gregory Locke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329164616/http://abc7ny.com/society/new-yorkers-come-together-to-remove-swastikas-inside-subway-car/1738154/">was on a 1 train in Manhattan</a> when he saw numerous swastikas. He shared this story, and the photographs of this disgusting display as well as his fellow decent human beings, on his Facebook page:</p><blockquote>I got on the subway in Manhattan tonight and found a Swastika on every advertisement and every window. The train was silent as everyone stared at each other, uncomfortable and unsure what to do.<p></p>

<p>One guy got up and said, &quot;Hand sanitizer gets rid of Sharpie. We need alcohol.&quot; He found some tissues and got to work.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and Purel. Within about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone.</p>

<p>Nazi symbolism. On a public train. In New York City. In 2017.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess this is Trump&apos;s America,&quot; said one passenger. No sir, it&apos;s not. Not tonight and not ever. Not as long as stubborn New Yorkers have anything to say about it.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo&apos;s office issued a press release about swastika being seen drawn over an American flag on a B train: &quot;The swastika was then boxed out in a black marker and altered with the letters &apos;L-O-V-E.&apos; Due to the nature of the graffiti, this incident has been deemed possibly bias in nature and is being investigated as such.&quot;<br>

Cuomo&apos;s office added, &quot;As part of the 2017 New York Promise Agenda, the Governor will launch of a statewide Hate Crimes Task Force charged with investigating and deterring incidents of bias and discrimination. The Task Force includes members from New York State Police and the New York State Division of Human Rights, who will investigate hate crimes and conduct community outreach to educate New Yorkers of their rights.&quot;<p></p>
