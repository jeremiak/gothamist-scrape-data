 <br>
The NYPD had said that on Wednesday, May 1st, Samuel grabbed the buttocks of a seven-year-old girl sitting on her stoop (her 12-year-old sister yelled at him and he ran away) and, hours later, he found a seven-year-old girl in a driveway and &quot;performed a criminal sex act on her.&quot; The Queens DA elaborated on the details in a press release:<blockquote>District Attorney Brown said that, according to the charges in the first complaint, Samuel approached his young female victim from behind on the afternoon of May 1, 2013, as she was tying her shoe on the sidewalk and tapped her on the buttocks. Several hours later that same day and approximately two miles away, it is alleged in the second complaint that Samuel  pproached his second victim and asked if she wanted to play a game. Samuel told her to cover her eyes with her hands and stick out her tongue. When the girl opened her eyes, she saw that Samuel had exposed himself. Samuel then grabbed her by the waist and engaged in a sexual act with her.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717100338/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9087372">DA Richard Brown added</a>, &quot;I want to go very slowly with this because I don&apos;t want to expose these two 7-year-olds to line-up procedures. I want to keep them away from the individual who will ultimately be charged.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Samuel, who is described as homeless, was charged with first-degree criminal sexual act,  forcible touching and endangering the welfare of a child. A tipster&#x2014; apparently his friend&#x2014;called CrimeStoppers and said he was staying in Manhattan. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717100338/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cops_questioning_kid_sex_assault_6jpVgecS4FazzkokocP6zI">NY Post reports</a>, &quot;The 25-year-old mechanic told the friend he was in trouble in Queens and asked if he could stay in the friend&#x2019;s Washington Heights apartment on West 163rd Street, sources said. He stayed for three days until the friend recognized his face on the news and showed up to question him, sources said.&quot; It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717100338/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/07/police-release-new-video-of-queens-sex-assault-suspect/">unclear if the friend</a> will get the $12,000 reward.</p>

<p>The Post adds that Samuel &quot;was busted in February of 2005 for exposing himself to a child and touching himself inside a Barnes and Noble. In 2009, he was arrested for sex abuse of another 7-year-old in a Manhattan park.&quot;</p>
