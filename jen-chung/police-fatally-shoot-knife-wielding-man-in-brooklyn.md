<p>Last night, police shot and killed a man who they say was wielding a knife&#x2014;and had just stabbed his roommate in Carroll Gardens.  </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 8 p.m. they received a phone call about a stabbing at 541 Cour Street. When officers responded, they found a 53-year-old man with a stab wound in his shoulder who said his roommate had stabbed them after a fight in their second floor apartment.  From the NYPD:</p><blockquote>The Officers and the victim exited the location and observed the suspect approaching with a knife in his hand. The Officers ordered the suspect to &#x201C;Drop the weapon&#x201D;,  at which time the suspect did not comply and lunged at the officers. The Officers discharged their firearms, striking the suspect in the torso.</blockquote>The suspect, a 28-year-old man, was pronounced DOA at Lutheran Hospital. The victim was treated for his wound while the officers were treated for tinnitus.  <br>
