<p>A horse used by the NYPD&apos;s Mounted Unit got spooked by a noise in Times Square last night and knocked off the cop who was riding it. The horse then galloped through the crowded Midtown streets, hitting a few cars along the way.</p>

<p>Gunny the horse and his officer were on 48th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues when a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803044212/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/nyregion/spooked-police-horse-throws-officer-and-runs-loose-in-midtown-manhattan.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">&quot;sudden sound from a truck that was being unloaded nearby&quot;</a> startled him. According to the NY Times, &quot;The officer, still connected to the horse through his stirrup, was dragged on the ground before managing to get himself loose, the police said.&quot;</p>

<p>Gunny galloped down 48th Street and took a right onto Sixth Avenue. Cab driver Kareem Khalil&apos;s side mirror was knocked off by the horse, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803044212/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYPD-Horse-Escapes-Runs-Times-Square-370874291.html">Khalil said to NBC New York</a>, &quot;It looked like some mad horse. Some people were screaming, but thank God nobody got hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>Gunny then headed onto 47th Street and ended up stopped at a haven of sorts: The parking garage where the Mounted Unit takes breaks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803044212/http://abc7ny.com/pets/horse-gallops-away-from-nypd-officer-in-times-square/1228684/">A witness told WABC 7</a>, &quot;He went right up to another horse, it was weird.&quot; </p>

<p><br>Both Gunny and the officer have minor injuries.</p>

<p>The Mounted Unit horses are known as &quot;10-foot cops,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803044212/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/18/law_order_mount.php">former Police Commissioner Ray Kelly explained</a> that they are extremely effective, &quot;You can see them from blocks away, they&apos;re great at crowd control and they&apos;re probably the most photographed piece of equipment we have.&quot;  Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is trying to get carriage horses limited, if not completely banned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803044212/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/photo_spooked_horse_knocks_his_carr.php">because they have been spooked</a> by traffic, has said that NYPD horses are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803044212/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/22/de_blasio_carriage_horses_are_total.php">&quot;completely different&quot; from carriage horses</a>. <br>
