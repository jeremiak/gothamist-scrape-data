Now officials are investigating whether Daniel St. Hubert, who the Chief of Detectives said had a &quot;violent nature,&quot; is the perpetrator of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160836/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/04/man_stabbed_repeatedly_at_west_18th.php">yesterday&apos;s stabbing</a> at the West 18th Street subway station in Manhattan. </p>

<p>Initially police said that a 53-year-old who was on the southbound 1 platform had been in a dispute with three other males. The victim was stabbed repeatedly in the torso around 5:30 a.m.; he was taken to the hospital in critical condition and is expected to survive. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160836/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/nyregion/brooklyn-stabbing-arrest-boulevard-houses.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The police said they were examining surveillance that had led them to link the attack to Mr. St. Hubert. No weapon was recovered.&quot; NYPD spokesman Stephen Davis said, &quot;He&#x2019;s definitely a suspect in that as well.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160836/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/02/one_dead_after_two_children_brutall.php">On Sunday just before 6 p.m.</a>, police say St. Hubert, 27, stabbed Prince Joshua &quot;P.J.&quot; Avitto, 6, and Mikayla Capers, 7, in a building elevator at the Boulevard Houses on Schenk Avenue. Both children, who were headed to get ices, were stabbed repeatedly. P.J. died at the hospital while Mikayala survived&#x2014;she is unable to speak, but she is responsive.</p>

<p>St. Hubert was arrested last night in South Ozone Park, Queens. Police had identified him after his DNA was taken from a knife found at the scene. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160836/http://online.wsj.com/articles/nypd-identifies-suspect-in-fatal-brooklyn-stabbing-of-prince-joshua-avitto-1401926692">The Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;The city Office of the Medical Examiner received the knife Sunday and spent about 36 hours processing the DNA&#x2014;considered to be a fast turnaround, a second law-enforcement official said. The DNA lifted from the knife was uploaded into a state offender registry, the official said. A match was found on Wednesday and turned over to the NYPD.&quot;</p>

<p>After getting St. Hubert&apos;s name, the police were pinging his cellphone during the press conference where the NYPD and Mayor de Blasio implored the public to help find St. Hubert. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160836/http://nypost.com/2014/06/04/maniac-identified-in-fatal-child-stabbing/">From the Post</a>:</p><blockquote>St. Hubert&#x2019;s sister told police that he had shaved his beard, and a tipster had provided them with his cellphone number, sources said.<p></p>

<p>St. Hubert had a knife on him when he was found walking near 145 Street and 133rd Avenue in Jamaica, sources said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I was coming home from work when I heard tires screeching,&#x201D; said Happy Singh, a witness to the bust. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so happy they caught him. I have two children myself. And I feel like my kids are safe now.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160836/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/69-000-offered-man-killed-boy-6-article-1.1816856">The Daily News says</a> the police had pinged the cellphone within a hundred feet: A source told the tabloid, &quot;When they tracked him down, everybody ran out of the different commands to go and capture this guy.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Police also suspect St. Hubert, who has nine prior arrests and is currently out on parole after choking his mother, in the killing of 18-year-old Tanaya Grant Copeland in East New York on Friday night. The teen had been returning from marching band practice.</p>

<p>A relative of St. Hubert told the Post, &quot;I know he has a history of mental illness, but I don&#x2019;t think he would do anything like this. I believe they have the wrong guy.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Mikayla Capers&apos;s great-grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160836/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/nyregion/suspect-arrested-in-brooklyn-child-stabbing-case.html?_r=0">said to the Times</a>, &quot;I want to see this bastard&#x2019;s face. He&#x2019;s not a crazy person; he&#x2019;s just an animal who does not belong on the face of the earth. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s going to be a happy camper in incarceration this time around; people in prison have children, too.&quot;</p>
