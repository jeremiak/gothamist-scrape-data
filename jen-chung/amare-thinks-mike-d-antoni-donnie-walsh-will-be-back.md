<p>The Knicks still haven&apos;t won a playoff game in ten seasons after being<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173256/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/25/last_nights_action_knicks_start_the.php"> swept out of the post-season</a> yesterday by the Boston Celtics.  But it hasn&apos;t stopped .  <br>
Amar&apos;e Stoudemire, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173256/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/06/stoudemire_says_yes_to_knicks_997_m.php">nearly $100 million man</a>, from being positive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173256/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704489604576283423693398248.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLETopStories">about attracting more talent</a>, &quot;Players are looking at the Knicks like, &apos;I want to play for that team,&apos; so it shouldn&apos;t be as hard as it was at the start of the year.&quot;  Stoudemire even thinks that coach Mike D&apos;Antoni will be back!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173256/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/2011/04/25/2011-04-25_amare_stoudemire_wants_mike_dantoni_back_carmelo_anthony_less_forceful_in_praise.html">Stoudemire praised D&apos;Antoni</a>, &quot;I did think coach D&apos;Antoni put more emphasis on the defensive end this season. And it&apos;s up to us to really come up with a game plan and a strategy on how we want to play and what better fits our team.... He&apos;s been great in New York so far this year. I have high confidence in his coaching style and what he can bring to a team.&quot;  However, Carmelo Anthony, was more meh, &quot;If we can keep everybody here that&apos;d be great, something that we can build on with the guys that we have here. I support whatever decision that they make. If Mike is here I got his back 100%. If (team president) Donnie (Walsh) is here, I&apos;ve got his back 100%. I support all their decisions.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Walsh, the rumor is that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173256/http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/rumors/post/Knicks-extending-Donnie-Walsh-?urn=nba-347665">will be given a two-year extension</a>. Walsh was against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173256/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/22/knicks_get_carmelo_anthony_bye_gali.php#photo-1">trading young Knicks players</a>&#x2014;Danilo Galinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, and Timofey Mozgov, plus their 2014 first round draft pick, and two second-round draft picks&#x2014;in order to land Anthony.</p>

<p>Sports Illustrated&apos; Jack McCallum called the Knicks a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173256/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/jack_mccallum/04/25/knicks/">&quot;partially, half-made, incomplete fairy tale,&quot; waxing</a>:</p><blockquote>Ah, now this is how it&apos;s supposed to be. Madison Square Garden is rocking. The Knicks, chasing their first postseason win in a decade, are storming back against the powerful Boston Celtics. Spike Lee, an Easter vision in Knicks-orange porkpie hat and matching scarf, is exhorting the crowd. From another courtside seat, famously inscrutable (not to mention nearly invisible) owner James Dolan is excited ... well, maybe, more like interested ... well, maybe more like ... look, he appears to have a pulse, OK?<p></p>

<p>And out on the court, new franchise cornerstones Amar&apos;e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony are leading the comeback, aided by a formidable trio of ... of ...<br>
Anthony Carter, Roger Mason Jr. and Shawne Williams?ote&gt;The 50% increase in Knicks&apos; season ticket prices should be really fun.<br>
