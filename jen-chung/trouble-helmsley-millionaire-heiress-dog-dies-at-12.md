This is but one of many odd facets of Trouble&apos;s life, which included being given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152556/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/29/leona_helmsley.php">$12 million in Helmsley&apos;s 2007 will</a>.</p>

<p>Trouble was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152556/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/27/trouble_in_trou.php">target of death threats,</a> and then Helmsley&apos;s human heirs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152556/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/16/helmsleys_dog_stripped_of_million_d.php">stripped $10 million from the bitch&apos;s bounty</a>. She had been living in Florida at the time of her death.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152556/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/09/2011-06-09_leona_helmsleys_pampered_maltese_trouble_one_of_the_worlds_richest_dogs_dies_at_.html">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Carl Lekic, the general manager of the Helmsley Sandcastle hotel in Sarasota, cared for her... Trouble, one of the world&apos;s richest dogs, died in December, following a series of health setbacks that left her blind and infirm, sources said... [After the fee was knocked down], Lekic said he could manage on $100,000 a year: $8,000 for grooming, $1,200 for food and the rest for his fee and a full-time security guard.&quot;  A spokeswoman said, &quot;Trouble was cremated, and her remains are being privately retained. The funds held in trust for her care have reverted to The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust for charitable purposes.&quot; The trust had been battling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152556/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/11/animal_welfare_groups_vs_helmsley_t.php">with animal rights groups</a>, because Helmsley left her billions to animal welfare (which some human trustees didn&apos;t like so much!).</p>
