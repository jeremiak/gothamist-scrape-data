<p>There are many reasons why one buys a lottery ticket, but this might be the cutest: An 80-year-old attributed his $1 million winning Black Diamond scratch ticket to a Hollywood legend. Retired Manhattan carpenter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731234854/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/lotto_love_to_give_V0pUKbvccHjdcznTvPWefP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Eric Wane told the Post</a>, &quot;I bought it strictly because I had admired Liz Taylor and I like diamonds. She has white diamonds. Maybe me, I&#x2019;ll take the black diamonds.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the other local winners, a 22-year-old unemployed &quot;geeky guy&quot; from the Bronx won scored with a $5.3 million&#x2014;he&apos;s been playing the same numbers for a year&#x2014;and a 53-year-old Brooklynite whose Maximum Millions scratch ticket was worth $5 million (he&apos;s been playing them for 25 years).<br>
