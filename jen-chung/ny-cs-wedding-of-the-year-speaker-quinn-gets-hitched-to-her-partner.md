</div></div><p>Yesterday, the city&apos;s second most powerful public official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520185139/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/christine_quinn_is_getting_married.php">got married</a>&#x2014;and it was a historic wedding.  City Council Speaker Christine Quinn married her partner, lawyer Kim Catullo, in what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520185139/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/nyregion/christine-quinn-new-york-city-council-speaker-marries-partner.html?ref=weddings">NY Times calls</a>, &quot;one of the most prominent same-sex weddings of a public official to date.&quot;</p>

<p>With Quinn eyeing a mayoral run next year (hey, Mayor Bloomberg thinks she&apos;d be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520185139/http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/political_news/161367/bloomberg-says-quinn--would-be-a-very-good-mayor-">&quot;very good mayor&quot;</a>), the guest list was a who&apos;s who of New York politics: Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand attended, as did Governor Andrew Cuomo; Attorney General Eric Schneiderman; Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, Congressional members Charles Rangel, Joseph Crowley, Carolyn Maloney, Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Vel&#xE1;zquez; and yes, Mayor Bloomberg.  </p>

<p>Quinn wore a dress by Carolina Herrera while Catullo wore a suit by Ralph Lauren.  The Post reports, &quot;Both women, whose moms died of cancer when they were teens, were escorted down the aisle by their tough-as-nails, blue-collar dads, both World War II veterans, Lawrence Quinn, 85, and Anthony Catullo, 86.&quot;  (Quinn had previously pleaded the case for same-sex marriage to Cuomo by noting that she and Catullo wanted to marry while their fathers were still alive.)</p>

<p>The Times notes, &quot;The wedding, coming a year after the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York State and a year before the mayoral election, has been the buzz of New York political circles in recent weeks and has brought Ms. Quinn the kind of celebrity-style coverage rarely enjoyed by a local candidate for office. As she has talked about the fun of trying on dresses and the stress of writing her wedding vows, it has also provided her an opportunity to soften her sometimes tough image and to remind New Yorkers that she would be both the first female and the first openly gay New York City mayor.&quot;</p>

<p>Other details: Bruce Springsteen&apos;s &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; was played when Catullo entered, while Quinn had Beyonc&#xE9;&#x2019;s version of &quot;Ave Maria.&quot; Tony-winning actress Audra McDonald sang George Gershwin&apos;s &quot;He Loves and She Loves&quot; (which was changed to &quot;She Loves and She Loves&quot;).  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120520185139/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/16/doug_quint_big_gay_ice_cream_truck.php">Big Gay Ice Cream Truck</a> served treats outside!</p>
