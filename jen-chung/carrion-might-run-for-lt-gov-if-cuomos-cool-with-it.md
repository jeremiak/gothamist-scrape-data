<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_04_cuocar.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414161522im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_cuocar.jpg" width="240" height="208" class="image-left"> </span>Former Bronx Borough President and current director of the White House Office of Urban Affairs Adolfo Carrion Jr. has been flirting with the idea of coming back to New York.  The Daily News and City Hall News both report that he&apos;s been thinking about running for Lieutenant Governor; in fact, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414161522/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/04/19/2010-04-19_just_gotta_ask_andy_sources_say_exbronx_beep_will_run_for_lt_gov_but_cuomo_has_t.html">News says</a> Carrion &quot;is bored working for the Obama administration,&quot; but &quot;Here&apos;s the catch: Carri&#xF3;n wants to be asked to run, sources said, not the other way around. So far, there has been no response from the Cuomo camp.&quot;</p>

<p>Carrion has denied interest in Albany, telling reporters last week, &quot;I haven&apos;t reached out to anybody.  I&#x2019;m thrilled that you mentioned that people are talking about it, though.&quot;  But another person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414161522/http://www.cityhallnews.com/newyork/article-1227-carrioacuten-mum-on-quiet-outreach-to-cuomo.html">tells City Hall News</a>, &quot;I think he&#x2019;s giving it really serious consideration. He&#x2019;s made calls to people close to Andrew.&quot; Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf said of a Cuomo-Carrion ticket, &quot;<strong>It would certainly add ethnic balance to the ticket and it would get Adolfo Carri&#xF3;n right back in the thick of things</strong>. You can&#x2019;t run for mayor from Washington.&quot;  But Carrion better watch out: An &quot;insider&quot; tells the News, &quot;If he gets out too far in front of the Cuomos, he&apos;s dead. They want to be in control of everything. They don&apos;t want other people telling them what to do.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Cuomo himself, the Post suggests that he could finally announce he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414161522/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/andy_could_toss_hat_in_the_ring_1UbYimJhkqEPgzFt57mUxM">running for governor next week</a> at a $1,000/ticket fundraiser at the Waldorf. A Democratic activist said his announcement &quot;willbe grim but also hopeful, with a pledge not to raise taxes and a vow to slash runaway spending and borrowing. He&apos;s going to say, &apos;Yes, we&apos;re in the sh - - - er, but dysfunction is not OK. It must be brought to an end. We can do much better.&quot;</p>
