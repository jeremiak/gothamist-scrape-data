title: Almost 40,000 Verizon Workers Go On Strike After Failed Contract Talks
---

	
										<p>Tens of thousands of Verizon workers on the East Coast have gone off the job today to protest their expired contract. Their unions, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, had been negotiating with the telecommunications giant since August, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/http://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-misses-deadline-for-union-contract-but-no-strike-for-now-1438489405">when the contract expired</a>. Last night, the CWA issued a statement announcing today&apos;s 6 a.m. strike, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/http://www.cwa-union.org/news/releases/verizon-strike-update">adding</a>, &quot;All day today, CWA and IBEW bargaining teams have been available to meet, ready, able and willing to bargain. Where&#x2019;s Verizon?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/http://abc7ny.com/business/verizon-workers-walk-out-/1288886/">According to the AP</a>, the workers &quot;represent installers, customer service employees, repairmen and other service workers in Connecticut, Delaware, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., for Verizon&apos;s wireline business, which provides fixed-line phone services and FiOS Internet service.&quot; However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/business/verizon-workers-strike.html">NY Times points out</a>, &quot;The presence of a small group of Verizon Wireless workers among the strikers gives their union, the Communications Workers of America, the right to picket Verizon Wireless stores as well.&quot; </p>

<p>Bob Master, of the CWA, told the Times, &quot;There will be a huge program of picketing of Verizon Wireless stores.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Verizon-Workers-Prepare-to-Strike-Amid-Contract-Dispute-375506531.html">two sides are fighting over pensions</a> (the unions say Verizon wants to freeze them), job security (the unions claim Verizon wants to shift to more contract workers, not to mention pave the way for more layoffs) and health care (Verizon says it&apos;s gotten really expensive). <br>
 <br>
CWA summed of its issues with these bullets: &quot;Company failing to meet pledges to expand FiOS broadband to millions of customers, but wants to continue shedding workers that install service&quot;; &quot;Verizon has already moved 5,000 jobs overseas, pressing to send even more jobs to Mexico, Philippines, elsewhere&quot;; and &quot;Despite $39 billion profit in last three years, Verizon pushing to outsource work to low-wage contractors, force family-busting transfers.&quot; </p>

<p>Verizon claims that federal mediators asked them if they would be open to extending the strike deadline, saying the company agreed. The unions scoffed; from CWA&apos;s strike statement: &quot;Historically, federal mediators only get involved in collective bargaining situations with the agreement of both parties.  CWA did not authorize anyone at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to approach Verizon about extending the strike date. Either the FMCS acted without authorization or Verizon executive vice president Marc Reed is lying.&quot;</p>

<p>Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was in Buffalo on Monday and went into a union hall to support the workers; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/12/sanders-hitches-campaign-to-fights-against-ge-and-verizon/">he said</a>, &quot;I know that going on strike is not something that&#x2019;s easily done. I know there&#x2019;s going to be a lot of pain involved. I want to thank you for standing up to the outrageous greed of Verizon and corporate America. When you do that, you&#x2019;re not just standing up for your own members &#x2014; you&#x2019;re standing up for working people all over this country.&quot;</p>

<p>He also said the corporation &quot;sure as hell should not be sending call-center jobs to the Philippines.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellow Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton issued a statement at 1 a.m., blasting Verizon&apos;s desire to outsource more jobs, &quot;Verizon should come back to the bargaining table with a fair offer for their workers.  To preserve and grow America&apos;s middle class, we need to protect good wages and benefits, including retirement security.  And we should be doing all we can to keep good-paying jobs with real job security in New York. We rely on these men and women as part of the communications infrastructure that keeps businesses and our economy moving.  Verizon should do the right thing and return to negotiations.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/technology/verizon-service.html?_r=0">The Times has an explainer</a> on how the strike might affect consumers. Bob Mudge, head of Verizon&apos;s wireline services, told the AP that replacement workers have been trained: &quot;Let&apos;s make it clear, we are ready for a strike.&quot; </p>

<p>The unions&apos; last strike was in 2011; it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917174244/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/20/verizon_employees_end_strike_on_goo.php">ended after two weeks</a>.</p>
