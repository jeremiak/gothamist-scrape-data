<p>The police have nominated a suspect for the title of worst roommate ever: Antonio Cordova was arrested for allegedly setting up his roommate to be attacked and robbed last month. Police are seeking two suspects who are still at large.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident happened at around 4:17 a.m. in Queens on October 3: &quot;The suspects, armed with a firearm ,a taser and knives, forced their way into an apartment on Elm Avenue and, once inside, tasered and slashed the victim, a 30-year-old male, about the body as he tried to fend them off. The suspects then removed an undetermined amount of money from a safe inside the apartment, as well as two watches, and fled the scene.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim took himself to Flushing Hospital and police say he realized, after watching surveillance video, that his &quot;roommate assisted the two suspects by showing them the apartment.&quot; Here&apos;s video of the suspects:<br>
