<p>A woman died in a fire in an East Village building early this morning. </p>

<p>According to the police, they responded to fire located at 31 East 1st Street at 3:16 a.m. After the fire was extinguished by the FDNY, a woman was found in the basement apartment, unconscious and unresponsive. She was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>

<p>The cause of the fire is being investigated.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: A tenant in the building tells us, &quot;There were NO working smoke detectors in 31 East 1st Street&#x2019;s main stairwell, or any pubic spaces in the building. My unit&#x2019;s was not functioning, and the police conducting the investigation said multiple tenants mentioned the same thing... only through tenants banging on each others doors were we able to mobilize, contact the fire department and escape.&quot;</p>

<p>The tenant added, &quot;The management company, Big Apple Management, has taken a very hostile approach to requests for smoke detector installation this morning. I genuinely believe that if working alarms were in the building, a life could have been saved.&quot;</p>

<p>We have called and emailed Big Apple Management for comment.</p>
