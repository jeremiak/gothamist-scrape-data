Suffolk County officials announced that they had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226072243/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/intel-semifinalist-samantha-garvey-gets-bay-shore-home-1.3449717">found a three-bedroom home</a> for Samantha Garvey and her family while an anonymous donor stepped up to save the Garvey&apos;s dog from being euthanized at a pound. She said, &quot;It is absolutely amazing and incredible.&quot;</p>

<p>Garvey and her father said that they had been homeless on and off for years; more recently, the family of five (Garvey has a brother and asister) had been living in a home but were evicted when the parents fell behind on payments after a car accident.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226072243/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/intel-semifinalist-samantha-garvey-gets-bay-shore-home-1.3449717">According to Newsday</a>, Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone &quot;said the house will be available in about 10 days -- and said no other families were bumped off a housing waiting list. He said the house recently was vacated and the Department of Public Works is working to ready it for use.... Amazing, too, is that the family has been guaranteed permanent fixed rental housing rates that they can afford. And that Bellone also said he has offered Garvey an internship with Suffolk County to work on marine and fisheries issues.&quot; Garvey&apos;s Intel project looks at how striped mussels change in the presence of predators.</p>

<p>In the Newsday feature, Garvey expressed concern about the family&apos;s dog, who was at a pound and would likely be euthanized.  But someone is now covering the dog&apos;s kenneling and vaccinations.  The family&apos;s new home in Bellone does accept pets, so the family may be reunited with the dog and their cat and turtle (now with family and friends).  She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226072243/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Homeless-Teen-House-Intel-Long-Island-Brentwood-137275198.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;My dad has always said, &apos;Pick your head up and keep on going.&apos; That&apos;s the mentality.&quot;</p>

I  live for them.  Signed one very very very proud dad.&quot;  And if you want to contact the Garvey family, you can reach them at  leog1951@optonline.net </p>
