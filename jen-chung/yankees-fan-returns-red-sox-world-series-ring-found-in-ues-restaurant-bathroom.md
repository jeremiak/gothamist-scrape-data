<p>Last week, a Manhattan restaurant owner found something very valuable in the men&apos;s room: A 2013 Red Sox World Series ring. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015324/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/28/yankees-fan-returns-red-sox-title-ring-found-in-bathroom/">Luigi Militello told the AP</a>, &quot;I was like, geez, it&#x2019;s big. Who would leave this here? I&#x2019;m a big Yankee fan. What are the chances of this happening?&quot; Still, he didn&apos;t let a rivalry get in the way: He returned the ring to the owner, who happens to own a Red Sox minor league team.</p>

<p>It turns out Drew Weber had been eating at Militello&apos;s Luke&apos;s Bar and Grill on the Upper East Side on Thursday and took it off while washing his hands. Weber, a NYC businessman and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015324/http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t558">owner of the Lowell Spinners</a>, said, &quot;I went looking around my apartment and started having palpitations. Sweat was pouring off my forehead. I&#x2019;m looking at my finger and it&#x2019;s not there.&quot; Weber called the restaurant to see if they had the ring&#x2014;and they did. Militello admitted, &quot;This being Yankees-Red Sox, I started razzing him. I told him he wasn&#x2019;t getting it so easily. I was playing with him, a lot.&quot; </p>

<p>Militello has been invited to Fenway Park on September 28th for Derek Jeter&apos;s final game. Weber said that Militello &quot;asked if he could wear his Yankees paraphernalia. I couldn&#x2019;t answer him.&quot;</p>
