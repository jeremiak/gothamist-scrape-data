</div></div>					<p>The last Friday of August was a sultry, steamy, and sticky day. Which was just the appropriate weather to find the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231328/http://coedtoplesspulpfiction.wordpress.com/">Outdoor Co-ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society</a> enjoying the day with some popsicles and, yes, pulp fiction on the High Line.</p>

<p>The group has been meeting for the past few years. Way back in 2011, the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231328/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/11/topless_women_make_nypd_momentarily.php">asked them to put their tops</a> back on, not realizing baring breasts is totally legal. (Don&apos;t worry: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231328/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/cops_told_not_to_arrest_topless_wom.php">Cops understand this now</a>, most of the time.) When I noticed the mostly female group&#x2014;there was one man, with his shirt unbuttoned&#x2014;standing around, there was a large number of other Labor Day weekend High Line visitors, doing double takes or staring and whispering, debating whether to take their pictures. </p>

<p>One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, described what the group does as a combination of &quot;performance and activism.&quot; Another, who only gave her first name, Tiana, said it was &quot;important&quot; for them to take this stand for their right to be topless, &quot;Nothing is going to change [society&apos;s attitude] unless someone tries to change it.&quot; </p>

<p>Tiana also added that there were some men who just didn&apos;t get that it was incredibly invasive and rude to walk up to her and her fellow topless pulp fiction fans and take their photos. After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231328/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/25/nsfw_topless_women_marching_to_time.php">National Go Topless Day</a>, one member of the group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231328/http://coedtoplesspulpfiction.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/hey-creepy-guy/">wrote about their encounters with some overly enthusiastic men</a> who do things like &quot;sit just a little too close... lurk in nearby bushes (that has to be uncomfortable, dude)&quot; and &quot;snap incessant pictures even when asked to stop.</p><blockquote>Too enthusiastic is doing shit you&#x2019;d never in a million years do if we had shirts on, and that you would never in a billion years do to a guy you don&#x2019;t know, whether or not he had his shirt off.  It&#x2019;s stuff that violates the universally comprehended rules of common courtesy and personal space. Yes, we&#x2019;re out in public, and yes, we&#x2019;re doing something you don&#x2019;t see every day, so sure, you might feel like snapping a picture to remember it by or to show your friends. That&#x2019;s fine. </blockquote>Last weekend, though, Outdoor Co-ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society happily reported there was &quot;nary a hostile nor a creepy stare to be found.&quot;<p></p>
