<p>Earlier this week, the new owners behind the rebooted Tavern on the Green <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410081015/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/01/tavern_on_the_green_is_opening_on_a.php#photo-1">announced that they&apos;ll start serving diners on April 24</a>. And it won&apos;t be your mother&apos;s&#x2014;or grandmother&apos;s&#x2014;Tavern on the Green.</p>

<p>For many, the old Tavern was a gaudy tourist trap with terrible food at outrageous prices&#x2014;a small price to pay to dine while surrounded by the lush greenery of Central Park. However, new co-owner Jim Caiola <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410081015/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/tavern-green-open-april-24-dinner-article-1.1743113">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;There&apos;s zero garish about this version, and much more Old New York.&quot; The restaurant has more of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410081015/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/01/tavern_on_the_green_is_opening_on_a.php#photo-2">an elegant rustic feel</a>, with an open kitchen, and Caiola added, &quot;It&apos;s also very bucolic - we tried to make you feel one with the park.&quot; So it won&apos;t be dripping with crystals and fairy lights?</p>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s debut brunch&#x2014;for Mother&apos;s Day, no less&#x2014;on May 11 booked all of its 600 reservations &quot;almost immediately,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410081015/http://pagesix.com/2014/04/05/tavern-on-the-green-debut-brunch-sells-out/">according to Page Six</a>. </p>

<p>The new menu will be from chef Katy Sparks. No word on whether diners will be so entranced that they won&apos;t notice when a demon terror dog (Vinz Clortho, probably) is chasing a nebbishy accountant in Central Park.</p>
