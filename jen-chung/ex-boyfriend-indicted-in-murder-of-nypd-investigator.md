Last month, the body Lee, an NYPD criminalist, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305171952/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/28/stab_city.php">found in her Sunnyside apartment</a>; she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305171952/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/29/cops_continue_investigation_of_nypd.php">strangled, stabbed in the throat, and burned</a> with an iron. </p>

Investigators don&apos;t believe Lee was the first to fall for McGurk&apos;s con job. McGurk was a &apos;professional student&apos; who bilked unsuspecting young women to bankroll &quot;his life in the U.S., they said.&quot; It&apos;s possible that the money was an issue Lee moved out of her parents&apos; house into her own place, though it&apos;s &quot;unclear if the violence came to a head because the money was drying up and she asked to be repaid, or because she learned the illness was a hoax and grew tired of his games.&quot;  </p>

<p>The News adds that on a website, McGurk said of himself, &quot;<strong>[I am] my own person and I do not intend to change for anyone. ... I&apos;m capable of switching accents at will. ... I&apos;m an a--hole, no regrets.</strong>&quot;</p>
