<p>A 17-year-old boy crossing a Queens street was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver last night. The victim, Ovidio Jaramillo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095952/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/12/9/teen-killed-in-hit-and-run-crash-in-queens--driver-sought.html">had reportedly just left a funeral</a>.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, police responded to a 911 call at 10:50 p.m. about a pedestrian struck at Northern Boulevard and Junction Boulevard in Flushing and &quot;determined that a black Toyota Camry traveling westbound on Northern Boulevard struck a 17-year-old male who was attempting to cross at the intersection of Junction Boulevard, from the southeast corner to the northeast corner.&quot;</p>

<p>After running over Jaramillo, the driver continued westbound on Northern Boulevard. </p>

<p>Jaramillo, who lived a few blocks away, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095952/http://abc7ny.com/news/teen-struck-and-killed-in-queens-hit-and-run/1115393/">attended St. John High School</a>. </p>

<p>The boy&apos;s grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095952/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/09/teen-killed-queens-hit-run/">told WCBS 2</a> that the &quot;driver [should] turn himself or herself in and explain how this happened. She said Ovidio was her only grandson and that she loved him very much.&quot; A neighbor said, &quot;He was a really nice kid, very polite and I can&#x2019;t believe that he&#x2019;s gone.&quot;</p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095952/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Fatal-Hit-and-Run-Queens-Jackson-Heights-Police-Teen-Funeral-361200661.html">NBC New York reports</a> that police searching for the Camry&apos;s driver and the car, which &quot;may have some front-end damage.&quot; </p>
