<p>Con Ed is asking residents in some parts of Brooklyn to stop using &quot;non-essential appliances&quot; (including air-conditioning) because of power line issues.  The issues have left around 2,000 customers--and keep in mind a customer can be an entire apartment building--without power in Sunset Park, Bay Ridge, Borough Park, and Park Slope.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120843/http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7022054&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1">MyFoxNY</a>, the &quot;affected area includes approximately 89,000 customers, and is bounded by 3rd and 4th Streets on the north, the Gowanus Canal on the west, and south and Fort Hamilton Parkway on the east.&quot;  Other non-essential appliances include washers, dryers, etc.  </p>

<p>Somehow, Con Ed wants customers to tell them about power or service issues online at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120843/http://www.ConEd.com/">www.ConEd.com</a> but customers can also call 1-800-75-CON ED (1-800-752-6633). Also, if you have your account number, that&apos;d be handy for ConEd, too.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  About <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120843/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=83964">1,000 customers are still affected</a> by the outages. NY 1 reports Con Ed is handing out dry ice at 41st Street and 10th Avenue in Borough Park and 3rd Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets in Sunset Park.</p>
