Also, Federal Judge Jed &quot;Rakoff, regarded as a brilliant but unpredictable jurist, alone will question the jury pool. He is a Yankees fan and a partial season-ticket holder.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Sandomir continues, &quot;His neutrality is assured and seems unlikely to be affected by his rooting interests.&quot;  In a 2004 speech about &quot;Corporate Ethics in the Age of Steroids,&quot; Rakoff stated (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152946/http://www.nycbar.org/pdf/report/CORPORATE_ETHICS.pdf">PDF</a>), &quot;All I can say in my defense is that at least I&#x2019;m a Yankees fan&#x2014;although, as a matter of professional courtesy, I always root for the umpires.&quot;  As for being brilliant, well, what else can you say about a judge who refers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152946/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/23/eckos_graffiti_party_is_on.php">Hamlet and Oedipus Rex in a judgement allowing a NYC graffiti party to go on</a> and quotes Oscar Wilde when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152946/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/14/judge_quotes_oscar_wilde_while_reje.php">rejecting the SEC&apos;s Merrill Lynch settlement</a>?</p>

<p>Back to the trial&apos;s jury: According to the Times, &quot;According to several lawyers and a jury consultant, the trustee will want jurors who resent millionaires. But Wilpon and Katz&#x2019;s team, they said, probably want less class-conscious people who might be more inclined to feel the trustee&#x2019;s pursuit of the Mets&#x2019; owners was overzealous and unfair. The trustee has accused the owners of ignoring warning signs about Madoff&#x2019;s operation as they benefited from steady returns during their many years of investing with him.&quot;</p>
