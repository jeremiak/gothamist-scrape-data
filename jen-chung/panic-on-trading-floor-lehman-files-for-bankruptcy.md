<p>The financial industry&apos;s worst weekend ended on these notes:  Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, after being unable to find a buyer; Bank of America, previously interested in Lehman Brothers (but didn&apos;t want to buy it without government protection) decided to buy Merrill Lynch for $50 billion; and there&apos;s concern AIG and Washington Mutual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221010/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html?hp">will fall next</a>. The financial markets are expected to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221010/http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2008-09-15-markets-monday_N.htm">be in tumultuous territory</a>, and a banking analyst told USA Today,  &quot;<strong>We are in a hysteria.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Despite filing for Chapter 11 protection, Lehman has still hopes to sell its broker-dealer operations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221010/http://www.cnbc.com/id/26708143">according to CNBC</a>.  Some important figures: Lehman has $613 billion in debt, which, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221010/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a0iuIemBxDPY&amp;refer=home">per Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;<strong>surpasses Drexel Burnham Lambert&apos;s failure in 1990</strong>.&quot;  It also lost 94% of its stock value over the past year.  </p>

<p>A trading session was opened between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221010/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122145492097035549.html?mod=special_coverage">The Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;to ease fears...The idea was to allow firms to try to unwind their derivatives transactions with Lehman by finding other parties to step into Lehman&apos;s shoes.&quot;  However, one trader said, &quot;<strong>People were screaming at each other over the phone, asking: How can this work?</strong>&quot; </p>
