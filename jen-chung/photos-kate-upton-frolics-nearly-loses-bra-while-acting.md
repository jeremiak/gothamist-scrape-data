</div></div>					<p>Kate Upton has gone from doing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140959/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMpQgDbqz6U">Dougie at a Clippers game</a> to being on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140959/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/kate_upton_lands_cover_of_sports_il.php">cover of two Sports</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140959/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/09/celebrate_kate_uptons_2nd_swimsuit.php">Illustrated Swimsuit editions</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140959/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/photos_vogue_puts_kate_upton_on_jun.php">cover of Vogue</a>. She&apos;s also trying to be more than a model, so she&apos;s been acting more&#x2014;and now Upton is filming a movie with Cameron Diaz, launching numerous boob puns.</p>

<p>In a scene that apparently involves drinking and dancing, Upton was spotted in the Hamptons, barely contained by her yellow bra. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140959/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/photos-kate-upton-breast-intentions-set-woman-article-1.1365885">The Daily News&apos; headline</a> is &quot;Kate Upton has breast intentions on New York set of &#x2018;The Other Woman&#x2019;&quot; while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140959/http://www.eonline.com/news/427403/kate-upton-s-cleavage-is-out-of-control-on-set-of-the-other-woman">E!Online&apos;s is</a>, &quot;Kate Upton&apos;s Cleavage Is Out of Control on Set of The Other Woman&quot; and adds, &quot;Forget about The Other Woman. Check out Kate Upton&apos;s girls!&quot;</p>

<p>This brings us memories of her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140959/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/01/watch_kate_upton_do_cat_daddy_dance.php">doing the Cat Daddy for Terry Richardson</a>. The Other Woman stars Cameron Diaz who realizes that her boyfriend is actually married&#x2014;she plans revenge. Let&apos;s hope Diaz, Leslie Mann and Upton are dancing and singing to &quot;Put The Lime In The Coconut&quot;:</p>
