According to the Daily News, the 29-year-old woman &quot;had shown up with her boyfriend... shortly after 10:30 p.m.&quot;  But then, the diner&apos;s manager, who looked at surveillance footage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120320181938/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/off-duty-city-correction-officer-shot-text-message-sparks-argument-article-1.1047399">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;She got a text on her phone. She checks it, then she starts rubbing her hands together &#x2014; she&#x2019;s very nervous.&quot; </p>

<p>The couple left, with the woman telling a waitress, &quot;We&#x2019;re not staying anymore.&quot; The waitress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120320181938/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/jail_guard_shot_Iy44U9VN0uQ90RTeP9djfO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">told the Post</a>, &quot;I said, &#x2018;Ok, no problem honey.&#x2019; It seemed just like they changed their minds, not that they were running.&quot;  When outside, the pair allegedly got into an argument.  Then witnesses heard shots. The victim, who was inside her red Ford Expedition, &quot;called for help and she drove herself to the middle of the street in front of the diner, so they could see her,&#x201D; according to the diner manager Tony Smalls.  The victim reportedly said, &quot;It was my ex, he&#x2019;s in a white BMW,&quot; and was able to give the police his name and address.</p>

<p>The victim underwent underwent surgery after the 10:50 p.m. shooting. And Smalls said, <br>
&quot;This is nothing new. We&apos;re open 24 hours, so you know we catch hell over here.&quot;</p>
