<p>WABC 7 has details on the shootings: Just after midnight, a 21-year-old man was shot in the ankle at 41st Street and 7th Avenue, outside the New York Sports Club.  Then, around 1 a.m., a woman was shot in the face by a BB gun at 51st and 7th Avenue.  After 2 a.m., two women were shot&#x2014;one in the elbow, another in the thigh&#x2014;at 34th Street and 7th Avenue, in front of Macy&apos;s.  None of the victims&apos; injuries appear to be life-threatening.</p>

<p>By 2 a.m., apparently 45 adults and nine juveniles were taken into custody&#x2014;about 20 were nabbed near 34th and 7th Avenue&#x2014;as police closed streets and swarmed the area on foot, horseback and scooters.  A Times Square restaurant manager told the Post, &quot;There&apos;s a lot of young kids outside in groups of 15 to 20 people, and police are running to catch them. Kids come in cursing at employees and we ask them to leave.&quot;  Some establishments close for fears of Easter night gang initiation; in 2006, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214630/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/11/gangs_may_be_hunting_for_more_than.php">3 stabbings</a> after hundreds of gang members converged.</p>
