<p>Just in case you were wondering what former mayor Rudy Giuliani thought of Republican gubernatorial Carl Paladino&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605082723/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/10/paladino_homosexuality_not_an_equal.php">remarks criticizing gay marriage, gay lifestyle</a>, and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605082723/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/paladino_hates_gay_pride_parade_has.php"> gay pride parades</a>&#x2014;all while maintaining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605082723/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/paladino_denies_dyfunctional_homose.php">he has no problem with gays</a>&#x2014;the lifetime mayor of 9/11 said, &quot;At a time when the state and nation are facing massive deficits, irresponsible overspending, job-killing taxes and an ongoing war of terrorism against us, all candidates should be focused on solutions to our problems and not the personal lives of our fellow citizens. <strong>He should recognize his remarks were highly offensive and he should apologize for them</strong>.&quot;  </p>

A few hours ago, state GOP chairman Ed Cox basically demurred, saying Paladino is able to speak for himself.&quot; Paladino&apos;s campaign manager Michael Caputo responded to Giuliani&apos;s remarks by saying, &quot;While we appreciate the advice and counsel of experienced leaders outside our campaign, we prefer to receive it via telephone.&quot;</p>
