</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, hundreds of people gathered by the Chinese Consulate on the West Side Highway to protest the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/04/detained_chinese_artists_nyc_projec.php">arrest and detainment of artist Ai Weiwei</a> as part of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=163478807041517">worldwide protest against China</a>.  The protesters reenacted Ai&apos;s <em>Fairytale: 1,001 Qing Dynasty Wooden Chairs</em>, an installation of 1,001 late Ming and Qing Dynasty wooden chairs at Documenta 12 in 2007 in Kassel, Germany.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2011/apr/18/protesters-call-release-chinese-artist-ai-weiwei/">Creative Time&apos;s Anne Pasternak explained</a>, &quot;The whole project started when I posted a simple question on Facebook: what can we as an arts community, about the situation with Ai Weiwei,&quot; and curator Steven Holmes suggested that everyone bring chairs to a protest.</p>

<p>Ai, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://shanghaiist.com/2011/03/14/ai_weiwei_talks_revolution_shanghai.php">active in speaking out against the government</a>, was arrested on April 3, and the charges against him include &quot;economic crimes&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/04/ai-weiwei-distributing-pornography/">pornography</a>, but Ai&apos;s mother said, &quot;Economic crimes! They say one thing now and another later. It&#x2019;s ridiculous... They must tell the family why and where they are holding my son. They have no right to keep us guessing. Where is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_People&apos;s_Republic_of_China">Constitution</a>? Where is the law?&quot;  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/18/2011-04-18_new_yorkers_display_outrage_over_chinas_imprisonment_of_artist_ai_weiwei.html#ixzz1Juj2sh2o">one New Yorker at yesterday&apos;s protest said</a>, &quot;I hope this protest opens more eyes to what is really going on in China. People see China as a superpower nation, but in reality there is no rule of law.&quot; </p>

<p>NYC will be featuring a public installation of Ai&apos;s work next month: His <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083927/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/ai_weiweis_circle_of_animalszodiac.php">Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads</a></em> will be at the plaza in the south east corner of Central Park (Fifth Avenue and 60th Street).  </p>
