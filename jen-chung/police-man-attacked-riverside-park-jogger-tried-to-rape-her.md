According to police, the 24-year-old woman was on a wooded path inside the park around 6 p.m., between West 125th and 122nd Streets, when a man approached her from behind.  </p>

Police say that suspect then threw the victim to the ground and tried to rape her, but was interrupted by a park-goer, who then got the attention of a motorist. The victim was taken to the hospital for minor injuries.  </p>
