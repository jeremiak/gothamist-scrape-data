<p>Copyranter, the grumpy advertising blogger (his bio proclaims he&apos;s the &quot;Best Fucking Ad Blogger in the World&quot;),<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303061927/http://copyranter.blogspot.com/2012/02/most-tasteless-chip-shop-awards-ad.html"> noted this fake advertisement submitted</a> to a British advertising creative contest, declaring, &quot;Tasteless is bad enough. Unfunny and tasteless, no excuse.&quot;   The fake ad, for Sapporo beer, says, &quot;A beer so good it&apos;s hard to believe we made it with our eyes three-quarters closed.&quot;  Asian eye jokes&#x2014;that&apos;s so c<strong>r</strong>assy!</p>

<p>The contest, The Chip Shop Awards, accepts fake ads from advertising professionals and says it&apos;s &quot;about fostering and recognising creativity with no boundaries and no rules. It&apos;s an international creative awards, open to anyone with great ideas. Since its launch in 2002, these awards have produced some of the cleverest, funniest, worst taste advertising and design ever seen.&quot;  </p>

<p>When asked for further comment about why this ad is so horrible, Copyranter fumed, &quot;It perpetuates a horribly derogatory description of Japanese/Asian people. (American GIs called the NVA and North Koreans &apos;slants&apos; and &apos;Zipperheads&apos;) Made in jest or not, this is horrible. The Chip Shop Awards are about what ads Creatives would make if they had no barriers. These New Jersey idiots are thus saying this is an ad they would LOVE to produce.&quot;  </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the agency, The CBK Group, that submitted the ad.  In the meantime, check out Copyranter&apos;s, er, rant about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303061927/http://copyranter.blogspot.com/2011/06/two-most-tasteless-ads-from-2011-chip.html">2011 Chip Shop Award submissions</a>. And our vote for worst fake ad of all time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303061927/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/01/wwf_never_forget_the_tsunami.php">still goes to this mess</a>.</p>
