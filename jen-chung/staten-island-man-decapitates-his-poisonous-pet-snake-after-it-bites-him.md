<p>A man cleaning his poisonous snake&apos;s tank was bitten by the pet, so he &quot;chopped the serpent&apos;s head off with a fishing knife,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313194218/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/graniteville_man_bit_by_posion.html">according to the Staten Island Advance</a>. </p>

<p>The incident occurred in the 27-year-old Graniteville man&apos;s home around 10:30 p.m. last night. After decapitating the Sub-Saharan Gaboon viper, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313194218/http://nypost.com/2017/03/11/man-rushed-to-hospital-after-being-bit-by-poisonous-pet-snake/">the Post reports</a>, the man called 911 and was taken to Jacobi Medical Center&apos;s poison control unit. Doctors found no poison in his system and he was listed in stable condition.</p>

<p>Police also found a boa constrictor in the home. </p>

<p>The victim received a summons for the viper.
