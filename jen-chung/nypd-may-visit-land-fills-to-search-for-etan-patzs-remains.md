<p>Last week marked the first time anyone had been arrested for the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/etan_patzs_1979_disappearance_in_so.php"> 1979 murder</a> of six-year-old Etan Patz, with the authorities charging Pedro Hernandez with second-degree murder.  Even though the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/nypd_commissioner_pedro_hernandez_a.php">police say that Hernandez confessed</a> to killing the boy in a Soho bodega, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/27/doubts_raised_about_etan_patzs_alle.php">doubts remain</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/etan_body_hidden_in_fridge_UtKCVlOdG93RlWA9fxMSwI">According to the NY Post</a>, even the Manhattan DA&apos;s office was reluctant to charge Hernandez and &quot;wanted more proof before charging Hernandez with murder, said several law-enforcement sources.&quot;</p>

<p>A source explained, &quot;After the last headache with DSK, you don&#x2019;t want another black eye... You only have one guy making a confession; you don&#x2019;t have corroborating evidence. That&#x2019;s never a way to do any case, never mind a high-profile case like this. The DA was not happy to rush to make this arrest. They wanted more things done.&quot;</p>

<p>However, it&apos;s suggested that Hernandez, a 51-year-old NJ resident who had worked as a stock clerk at a bodega on West Broadway and Prince (now an eyeglasses store), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/killer_knew_etan_secret_ug3keSiZtxNplgwwWUVDsM">offered details about Etan</a> that were never released.  Etan disappeared when walking from his parents&apos; loft on Prince Street near Greene Street to the school bus stop at West Broadway and Prince. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/26/suspect_in_1979_etan_patz_murder_ha.php#photo-1">Hernandez claims he lured Etan</a> to the bodega&apos;s basement with the promise of a soda, strangled him, and then disposed of his body in a bag, leaving it outside 113 Thompson Street.  </p>

<p>Hernandez kept the boy&apos;s body in the bodega and threw it out at night, according to the POst&apos;s sources.  The Department of Sanitation says that the NYPD will look at &quot;scour sanitation, landfill and incinerator log books from that time before determining whether to launch a search for the remains.&quot; Garbage would have been dumped &quot;at Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island or the Fountain Avenue landfill in Brooklyn,&quot; or &quot;brought to the Gansevoort incinerator on West 12th Street,&quot; says the Post.</p>

<p>This comes as relatives of Hernandez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/pedro-hernandez-confessed-jersey-prayer-group-decades-killed-etan-patz-reported-authorities-article-1.1085512">continue to struggle with his confession</a> (his wife and daughter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/wife_is_done_with_sicko_aKDauxztHnaaHN3iY17UqJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">were supposedly devastated</a>).  Hernandez&apos;s lawyer has pointed out that his client is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/26/suspect_in_1979_etan_patz_murder_ha.php#photo-1">schizophrenic, bipolar and has hallucinations</a>.  But a member of a prayer group as well as Hernandez&apos;s sister says that Hernandez did confess to killing a boy (putting his body in a Dumpster) in New York City a few years after Etan&apos;s death.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233735/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/nyregion/worshiper-recalls-admission-by-patz-suspect-decades-ago.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">Tomas Rivera told the NY Times</a> he didn&apos;t come forward &quot;because he did not confess to me [individually]... He confessed to the group.&quot;  Rivera confirmed he had spoken to the NYPD, &quot;The detectives told me not to say anything. I am keeping my mouth shut.&quot;</p>
