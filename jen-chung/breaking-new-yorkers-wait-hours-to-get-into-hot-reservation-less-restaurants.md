<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506053754/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/how_to_wait_on_line.php">Waiting on line</a> is part of being a New Yorker&#x2014;and waiting for a table at a restaurant (have you seen the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506053754/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2010/08/the_brunch_bunch.php">lines outside</a> of some brunch places on Sundays?) is a rite of passage. But now the Daily News examines the phenomenon of diners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506053754/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/reservations-brooklyn-hottest-restaurants-article-1.1378223">getting antsy over being made to wait at <em>Brooklyn</em> restaurants.</a></p>

<p>Noting, &quot;At Roberta&#x2019;s, an of-the-moment Bushwick pizza joint off the Morgan Ave. stop of the L train, the dinnertime wait on the weekends averages two hours,&quot; the Daily News finds the Murray Hill resident who succumbed to &quot;peer pressure&quot; and was waiting outside the pizza place famed for hosting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506053754/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/22/photos_bill_hillary_clinton_went_to.php">Hillary Clinton&apos;s birthday</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506053754/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/08/robertas_naked_waitress_shrouded_in.php">occasional naked waitress</a>. Matt Devereaux said, &quot;<strong>This meal had better change my life. If this doesn&#x2019;t change my life, if this isn&#x2019;t something I can&#x2019;t get in the borough of Manhattan, this is wholly irrelevant.</strong>&quot; But the insanity is not just at Roberta&apos;s:</p><blockquote>Over in Park Slope, Alyssa Venere and her boyfriend were in the middle of a two-hour wait for Asian-fusion restaurant Talde. &#x201C;It drives me freaking nuts!&#x201D; she said of the no-rezzie policy. The couple had gone to the Columbia Street Thai spot Pok Pok NY the weekend before and found the long line equally frustrating: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s good, but not good enough to wait two hours,&#x201D; she said.<p></p>

<p>Other couples stuck in line for Talde took the drastic steps of finding activities to kill time elsewhere &#x2014; or even pre-eating offsite while waiting for their table. &#x201C;We left our name, we think we&#x2019;re going to try and wait it out, drink somewhere else, maybe get an appetizer,&#x201D; said Cari Frisch of Brooklyn Heights.</p></blockquote>Why don&apos;t these restaurants have reservations? Dale Talde claims, &quot;We decided not to take reservations because it was really important to us to make the restaurant a true neighborhood spot, a place where the locals could always pop in and grab a bite to eat. It&#x2019;s been successful so far,&quot; and other restaurateurs agree, saying they want to encourage walk-ins and not &quot;freeze up&quot; their rooms. Keep that in mind while you&apos;re drinking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506053754/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/calling_bullshit_on_pokpoks_beer_sl.php">the fake beer slushie</a> during your wait!<p></p>
