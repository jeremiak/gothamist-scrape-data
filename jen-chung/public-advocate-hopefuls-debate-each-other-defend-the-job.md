                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_08_pubadv.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070710im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_08_pubadv.jpg" width="290" height="224" class="image-left"> </span>Last night, the Democratic candidates for NYC Public Advocates squared off for a WABC 7-televised debate, and it got good fast:  Within 10 minutes, City Councilman Bill de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070710/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/nyregion/29debate.html?ref=nyregion">attacked frontrunner and former Public Advocate Mark Green</a>, &quot;I have to say, with all due respect to Mark Green, he has a little amnesia. <strong>He did not stand up to Rudy Giuliani when it mattered most, when Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070710/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/24/nyregion/24RUDY.html">wanted to stay on for 90 days</a> at the end of 2001.</strong> Mark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070710/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/nyregion/giuliani-s-quest-for-a-term-extension-hits-a-wall-in-albany.html?scp=3&amp;sq=2001%20giuliani%20mark%20green%2090%20days&amp;st=cse">caved in to him for political reasons</a>.&#x201D; Green retorted, &quot;There was not any public official in the eight years of Rudy Giuliani who stood up to him more often and more successfully.&quot;  Green <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070710/http://www.politickerny.com/5072/green-says-hes-not-interested-running-mayor-de-blasio-attacks">also told moderator Diane Williams</a>, &quot;<strong>Diane, let Bill attack me one more time because he needs it emotionally.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, a big question that loomed over the debate is whether there needs to be a Public Advocate at all (City Councilman Simcha Felder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070710/http://www.politickerny.com/4693/felders-argument-eliminating-public-advocate">released a report on why the city should do away</a> with the position, which is second highest elected position in the city).  Civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel said, &quot;You need a public advocate to go and fight. When there is a slush fund in the City Council, you need someone from the outside like me to take on the insiders,&quot; while Green said, &quot;I was the public advocate. I don&apos;t remember this question being asked very often, if ever, when I was there.&quot;  </p>

<p>The fourth Democratic candidate, City Councilman Eric Gioia, said, &quot;Politicians bickering back and forth is what gets in the way of results and I tell you, I wish we would end it.&quot; PolitickerNY reports, &quot;Gioia&apos;s good-guy routine prompted one rival aide to suggest out loud that Gioia was simply running to boost his name recognition for a more serious race for another office next year.&quot; (Gioia leads with campaign money but was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070710/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1302.xml?ReleaseID=1354">last in a July 28 Quinnipiac poll</a>.)</p>
