</div></div>					<p>Jimmy Fallon brought his <em>Tonight Show</em> approach to his old stomping ground of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, as he hosted the show&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/16/melissa_mccarthy_the_rock_jimmy_fal.php">first-ever nationally live broadcast</a>. Instead of a traditional monologue, Fallon held a dance party while singing David Bowie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Dance_(David_Bowie_album)">&quot;Let&apos;s Dance&quot; </a>with the legendary Nile Rodgers, who produced the song with Bowie, playing guitar. </p>

<p>The show opened with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> returning once again as President Trump. After a chat with Vice President Pence (Beck Bennett), Trump held an America&apos;s Next Top Model-esque deliberation about who would remain in the Oval Office as a trusted adviser: Steve Bannon, seen as a Grim Reaper, or Trump son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played by Fallon in a blazer and flak jacket (his intro music was EMF&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R63gYHIgaB0">&quot;Unbelievable&quot;</a>). Spoiler: The result hews closely to this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/15/us/politics/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-white-house.html">Times article</a>.</p>

<p>Pence also got a shout-out in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/16/melissa_mccarthy_sean_spicer_easter_bunny_snl.php">Melissa McCarthy&apos;s reprisal of Sean Spicer</a>, angrily repentant about his Syria-Holocaust mess as well as in Weekend Update, where Colin Jost remarked on the &quot;mother of all bombs&quot; dropped on Afghanistan. Noting that the bomb cost $16 million and apparently killed 94 members of ISIS, he said &quot;That doesn&apos;t sound efficient, but remember, Fox News spent $13 million to get rid of five women.&quot; Weekend Update also saw visits from stand-up Kyle Mooney&apos;s hapless standup comic Bruce Chandling and Vanessa Bayer&apos;s perpetual Bar Mitzvah Boy Jacob.</p>

<p>Eager to prove he&apos;s more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/08/videos_paul_rudd_gets_snl_assist_fr.php#photo-1">than a boy band</a>, musical guest Harry Styles appeared multiple times, from the monologue to a Civil War bit that involved singing and instrumentation that sounded a lot of classroom instruments and a &quot;Family Feud&quot; 1970s stars-vs.-current day stars sketch playing vintage Mick Jagger. In &quot;Family Feud,&quot; Fallon played both <em>Saturday Night Fever</em>-era and <em>American Story: O.J.</em>-era John Travolta while Kate McKinnon was a pitch-perfect Kristen Stewart. </p>

<p>The show&apos;s best moment was Rachel Dratch appearing as Denise (or &quot;Zazoo!&quot;) with Fallon&apos;s Sully. The Boston loudmouths&apos; daughter, &quot;Little Denise&quot; (McKinnon), was accepted to Harvard and the family was touring the institution&#x2014;&quot;She&apos;s like Good Will Hunting!&quot; The sketch was just a string of one-note jokes, but Dratch was a welcome presence.</p>

<p><em>SNL</em> is off until May 6, when Chris Pine will host with musical guest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013105/http://gothamist.com/tags/lcdsoundsystem">LCD Soundsystem</a>.</p>
