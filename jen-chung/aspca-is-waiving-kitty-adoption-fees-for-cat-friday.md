					<p>Before you make your Black Friday game plan, consider this foolproof way to avoid the capitalist insanity: Get a cat or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152206/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/11/kittens_graduate_cute_academy.php">kitten</a> from the ASPCA, which is waiving all adoption fees for Cat Friday! Gail Buchwald, senior vice president of the ASPCA Adoption Center said, &quot;There are tons of discounts being touted on Black Friday, but the ASPCA knows that the best deal of all has four paws and a tail.&quot;</p>

<p>Tomorrow, on November 27th, the ASPCA will celebrate its 5th Annual Cat Friday Event with waived adoption fees. The group says, &quot;On the unofficial kickoff to the holiday season, the ASPCA is encouraging New Yorkers to adopt, not shop, on Black Friday and give a pet a loving home for the holidays. As an added door-buster deal, all cats older than one year will go home with a free hard carrier, and all cat adopters for the day will be eligible to win a free in-home photo session with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152206/http://felinesofnewyork.com/">Felines of New York</a>, or an autographed copy of the Felines of New York book.&quot;</p>

<p>And let&apos;s face it, cats are cool: <br>

 <br>
The event starts at 11 a.m., at the ASPCA&apos;s Adoption Center, located at 424 E 92nd Street in Manhattan, and ends at 7 p.m. The ASPCA shared some photos and details of some of the cats looking for a furrever home.</p>
