McCollum&apos;s 25 previous arrests were for impersonating a NYC Transit employee--most famously for taking the E train for a 6-stop ride when he was 15 years old.  More recently, the 43-year-old has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426105232/http://gothamist.com/2004/06/14/subway_stealing_legend_arrested_again.php">tried to steal a train</a> at the Long Island Rail Road yard in 2004 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426105232/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/14/avid_subway_enthusiast_arrested_aga.php">tried to enter a restricted area at Columbus Circle</a> wearing a transit worker-like uniform in June.  It&apos;s believed the 43-year-old suffers from Asperger&apos;s; his &quot;weary-sounding&quot; mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426105232/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/10/06/2008-10-06_railroad_buff_derailed_again_26th_bust_f.html">told the Daily News</a> that she wasn&apos;t surprised he was arrested again.  McCollum now lives in North Carolina with her, but he traveled to NYC in spite of her warnings, &quot;<strong>He&apos;s a lover of New York and can&apos;t get over it.</strong>&quot; </p>
