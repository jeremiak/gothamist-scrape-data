<p>An SUV slammed into a barber shop in the Bronx last night, injuring a young boy. </p>

<p>Just after 7 p.m., the Toyota Highlander flew into Hustler&apos;s Barber Shop at 1075 White Plains Road, near Watson Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164056/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/livery-cab-driver-plows-suv-bronx-barber-shop-injures-child-article-1.1787897">According to the Daily News</a>, the driver was a livery cab driver: &quot;The SUV veered onto the sidewalk...clipping the child before slamming into the building.&quot; A witness told the News, &quot;I heard a couple of booms, crashes (and then) a loud noise. The next thing I know I see the nose of that truck coming through the front door.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver wasn&apos;t injured but a 12-year-old boy was hit and suffered a minor injury. An NYPD spokesperson had no information about the incident.</p>
