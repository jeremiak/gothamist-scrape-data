<p>Tonight, when you go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173355/http://www.barackobama.com/">barackobama.com</a>, the Obama campaign heralds its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173355/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/14/john_edwards_to.php">endorsement from John Edwards</a>.  But if you head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173355/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/">hillaryclinton.com</a>, you&apos;ll be reminded that she won West Virginia last night.</p>

<p>Pundits noted how the Edwards endorsement didn&apos;t even give Clinton 24 hours to revel in her huge win. Good thing Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173355/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/13/clinton_more_de.php">is very determined</a>.</p>
