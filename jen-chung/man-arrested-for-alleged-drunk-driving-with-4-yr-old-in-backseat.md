When a Port Authority police officer intercepted him near Outerbridge Crossing, Stuart Stott allegedly admitted to having five or six drinks at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081341/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/30/rutgers_heads_to_yankee_stadium_for.php">Pinstripe Bowl</a>.  And the police officer also found Stott&apos;s four-year-old son in the backseat. Fortunately, no one was injured.<p></p>

<p>Stott blew a 0.20, more than double the 0.08 legal limit for blood alcohol, and the child was given to Stott&apos;s wife, who told police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081341/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/drunk-jersey-dad-busted-behind-wheel-4-year-old-son-backseat-article-1.999256">she had been trying to reach him</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081341/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/man-accused-of-driving-drunk-with-son-in-back-seat/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to CityRoom</a>, &quot;Mr. Stott, who said he had been at Yankee Stadium on Friday for the Pinstripe Bowl between Rutgers and Iowa State, told the police that he had consumed five or six beers at the game, Mr. Della Fave said. He said he had programmed his home address into his vehicle&#x2019;s navigation system, Mr. Della Fave said, and then followed its directions even after he realized that it had taken him off course.&quot;  The Post, though, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081341/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nj_driver_nabbed_drunk_with_son_MKww6gOUuCSBYY6CEH1RGN">suggests that Stott entered the <em>wrong</em> address</a>.  Either way, not good!</p>

<p>It&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081341/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/one_more_dwi_loophole_closing_today.php">felony to drive drunk</a> with a person under 16 in the car.
