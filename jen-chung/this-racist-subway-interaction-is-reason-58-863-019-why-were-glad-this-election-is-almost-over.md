<p>Everyone&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/04/trump_scream.php">ready for this hellish election cycle to be over</a> months ago. Even Merriam-Webster has gone a bit dark:</p>

<p>On Facebook, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/12/save_punjabi_deli_film.php">filmmaker</a> and actor Adeel Ahmed, 28, shared a recent subway encounter that sums up why we need it to be Wednesday, November 9 already&#x2014;and even after that it&apos;s clear America still has a lot of dark forces to reckon with. He expanded on his initial story for us:</p><blockquote>This morning I ran out of my apartment to make it to a 9:30am meeting downtown. I grabbed my chai filled thermos, threw on my coat, pet my dog, kissed my wife goodbye and made my way out. <p></p>

<p>I ran down 6-7 blocks to the 125th Street subway in the hopes of grabbing the A train. I refilled my weekly MetroCard and swiped through the turnstiles and ran down the stairs to luckily catch the downtown A as it came in. To my surprise, it was scarce, with some seats available. I decided to stand. </p>

<p>I popped in my headphones and listened to CASHMERE by SwetShop Boys for some inspiration for my album I&#x2019;ve been recording. Like any New Yorker on the subway, I submersed myself into my own world. And then I felt a hard push on my back. Not quite a clean push, more of a shove. </p>

<p>I turned back and saw a man, staring right at me. I gave him your classic &#x2018;what the f-ck&#x2019; stink eye look and then turned back around. </p>

<p>And then, another push. I again, turned, gave another look and turned back around. </p>

<p>And then I was shoved a third time. This time, I turned and took my headphones out. I asked him, &quot;You good?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but after tomorrow I will be,&quot; he replied. </p>

<p>I was confused, but said, &quot;Okay.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Because once Trump wins,&quot; he continued, &quot;you&apos;re not gonna be riding on this train anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>A younger version of myself would probably argue with the man or try to knock some sense into him or even escalate the situation. But this time, I looked around to see the other people on the train. </p>

<p>A young Asian girl bumping to her music, a brown brother reading his book, a black woman finishing a crossword puzzle, an older white woman emailing on her phone. I thought, <em>&quot;Man, this is New York, this is America, what the hell is going on?!&quot; </em></p>

<p>I looked back at the man, smiled and said, &quot;Insha&apos;Allah [God-willing] you&apos;re wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>I was surprised at my actions and my inner monologue. This isn&#x2019;t the first time I&#x2019;ve dealt with racism. This isn&#x2019;t even the first time I&#x2019;ve been physically attacked because of the color of my skin. But this is the first time, in at least four Presidential election cycles, that a Presidential nominee&#x2019;s name has been thrown at me as part of someone&#x2019;s racism. </p>

<p>He stared at me after my response and didn&apos;t say anything else. I put my headphones back on. We stared at each other for the next 3 stops. I zeroed in on his eyes - tired, filled with anger. Then, I exited at my station. </p>

<p>I know people are upset. I know it&#x2019;s easy to scapegoat. But I don&#x2019;t know what kind of leader incites this behavior. </p>

<p>I want to be clear: This post isn&apos;t about Hillary. This post isn&apos;t about telling you to go vote tomorrow. This post is to tell you that we already live in Trump&apos;s America. That these supporters aren&apos;t going to dissipate into thin air after Hillary is our President-elect. </p>

<p>We have a serious problem and we need to start a real conversation. Wednesday morning is going to be scary, whoever wins. I fear for my 19 year old younger brother who goes to school in the city, my hijab wearing sister and her husband, my accent heavy Amma and Papa, my little innocent nephews and nieces, my white wife when we go out together and all my brown homies and non-homies. These are scary times. What will happen? Do we have to continually look over our shoulder? Do I have to sit my younger brother down to tell him how to handle situations like this? Do I have to advise my friends to carry pepper spray or to be ready for hateful spews and attacks? Right now, the answer is yes.  </p>

<p>Insha&apos;Allah, I&apos;m wrong.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/07/election_hotline.php">Vote tomorrow</a>. <br>
