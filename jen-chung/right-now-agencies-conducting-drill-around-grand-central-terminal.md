<p>FYI, if you&apos;re wondering why there are street closures around Grand Central Terminal, it&apos;s because the FDNY, Con Edison and MTA are conducting a &quot;full-scale exercise&quot; between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m. today.  Notify NYC says, &quot;The exercise will simulate a steam release in Grand Central Terminal.&quot;</p>

<p>These streets are closed:: Vanderbilt Ave from East 42nd to East 46th and East 44th and East 46th streets between Madison Ave and Vanderbilt. Notify NYC reiterates, &quot;There will be emergency personnel and equipment operating in the area. This is only an exercise.&quot; The public will not see the drill, as it&apos;s taking place in a closed area.  And Metro-North riders will be reminded it&apos;s only a drill with the following announcement, &quot;May I Have Your Attention Please. There is No Emergency in Grand Central Terminal. Metro-North Railroad is Conducting a Drill with New York City Emergency Service Agencies. Thank You.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2007, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160113132707/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/18/explosion_in_vi.php">steam pipe exploded near Grand Central</a>, causing injuries and damage to buildings.  A woman died from a heart condition while a young man whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160113132707/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/18/one_year_anniversary_of_midtown_ste.php">truck was on top of the site of the explosion was seriously burned</a>.  Mayor Bloomberg called it a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160113132707/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/19/midtown_steam_p.php">failure of the city&apos;s infrastructure</a>.</p>
