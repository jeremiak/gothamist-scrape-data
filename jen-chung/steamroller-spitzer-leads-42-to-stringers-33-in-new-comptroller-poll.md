<p>Yesterday, a new poll found that voters are more likely to vote for Eliot Spitzer than Scott Stringer in this fall&apos;s Democratic NYC Comptroller primary. Spitzer leads in the poll by nine points. The former Governor got 42% to the Manhattan Borough President&apos;s 33% in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815033412/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Eliot-Spitzer-Poll-Scott-Stringer-Comptroller-Marist-Voters-Democrats-214947361.html">Wall Street Journal-NBC New York-Marist poll</a>. </p>

<p>Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815033412/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/ho_yes_client_no_9_is_back_eliot_sp.php">suddenly jumped into the sleepy Comptroller race</a> (Stringer was the only Democrat running) on Sunday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815033412/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/spitzer_heckled_at_first_petitionin.php">sparking a media frenzy</a> and political upheaval. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815033412/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324425204578598123916897596.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal notes</a>, &quot;Nearly a quarter of voters were undecided, but two-thirds of Democrats, or 67%, said they believe Mr. Spitzer, who resigned as governor five years ago after he was caught patronizing prostitutes, should be given a second chance.&quot;</p>

<p>After the poll&apos;s numbers were released, Spitzer issued a statement: &quot;I didn&apos;t take a poll to enter this race, and my policies and approach to this election will not be determined by polls. I am, however, gratified by these numbers, and look forward to continuing a conversation with the voters about the issues that matter most to them.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Spitzer needs to actually get on the primary ballot&#x2014;and that requires 3,750 valid signatures of registered Democrats in NYC by today&apos;s filing deadline. </p>

He also discussed the poll numbers, &quot;I&apos;m never confident. In politics, you have to ask every day for the public&apos;s support, for their understanding of what you&apos;re trying to do.&quot;</p>
