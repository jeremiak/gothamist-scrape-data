Last night, the Fenway Park standard, Neil Diamond&apos;s &quot;Sweet Caroline,&quot; was played at the Yankees&apos; home game against the Arizona Diamondbacks:</p>

<p>Brooklyn native (and Brooklyn Dodgers fan) Neil Diamond thanked the Yankees:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Thank you NY Yankees for playing &apos;Sweet Caroline&apos; for the people of Boston. You scored a home run in my heart. With respect, Neil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150819/https://twitter.com/search/%23OneBoston">#OneBoston</a></p>&#x2014; Neil Diamond (@NeilDiamond) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150819/https://twitter.com/NeilDiamond/status/324318926932697088">April 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>His song has become synonymous with the Boston Red Sox ever since Amy Tobey, who worked at the production company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150819/http://boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/05/29/another_mystery_of_the_diamond_explained_at_last/">planned the music</a> that plays at Fenway Park. In a 2005 interview, she said when new management took over in 2002, they requested the song to be played during the eighth inning, &apos;&apos;They liked it and they just loved the crowd reaction with it and stuff.&quot; And fans love it, explaining, &quot;It&apos;s just in every bar you go to, it&apos;s one of those songs. It&apos;s Boston&apos;s theme song,&quot; and &quot;&apos;It&apos;s just a catchy tune, the words are easy . . . it gets the whole field in one rhythm. You don&apos;t sing &apos;Sweet Caroline&apos; . . . you didn&apos;t go to a game.&quot;  </p>

<p>Here&apos;s Neil singing the tune at Fenway Park a few years ago:</p>
