Obama said, &quot;<strong>Sasha and Malia aren&apos;t here tonight because they&apos;re grounded. You can&apos;t just take Air Force One on a joyride to Manhattan.</strong>&quot; He started off his remarks by telling the journalists, &quot;Most of you covered me. All of you voted for me,&quot; told RNC chairman Michael Steele that the GOP doesn&apos;t qualify for a bailout (though Rush Limbaugh may be a &quot;troubled asset&quot;) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814060844/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/09/AR2009050902802.html?hpid=topnews">said of Hillary Clinton</a>, &quot;The minute she got back from Mexico, she pulled me into a hug and said I should go down there myself.&quot; Another crowd pleaser: &quot;I&apos;ve cut the tension by bringing a new friend to the White House. He&apos;s warm, he&apos;s cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic. You just have to keep him on a tight leash. Every once in a while, he goes charging off in the wrong direction and gets himself into trouble. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814060844/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/30/amtrak_joe_biden_says_avoid_planes.php">enough about Joe Biden</a>.&quot; The night was hosted by Wanda Sykes, who told Obama, &quot;It&apos;s funny to me that [photographers] have never caught you smoking, but they always catch you with your shirt off. <strong>I know you&apos;re into this transparency thing, but I don&apos;t need to see your nipples.</strong>&quot; Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814060844/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0GwZFAV1Lw&amp;feature=player_embedded">video of Obama&apos;s remarks</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814060844/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmyRog2w4DI">one of Sykes</a>.</p>
