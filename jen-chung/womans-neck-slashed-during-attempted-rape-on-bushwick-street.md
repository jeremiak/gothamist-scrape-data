<p>Police are looking for a man who slashed a woman&apos;s neck while trying to rape her on a Bushwick street on Sunday morning. The assault happened at approximately 5 a.m. near Wyckoff Avenue and Starr Street, next to the Jefferson Street L train stop. </p>

<p>Police say the suspect approached the 25 year-old woman from behind, placed a sharp object to her throat and told her to bend over. The woman screamed for help and, after a brief struggle, was able to break away from the man, but not before he slashed her neck. She ran and sought shelter in a nearby store.  </p>

<p>The woman suffered a four-inch laceration on her neck and was taken to Wyckoff Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>Police released video of the suspect, describing him as 20-30 years old, 5&apos;6&quot; to 5&apos;9&quot; and 170-190 pounds; he was last seen wearing a black and red baseball cap, a black long sleeve shirt and dark colored pants.</p>
