<p>As French people continue to question the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214611/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/imf_heads_perp_walk_horrifies_the_f.php">American justice system</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214611/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/02/bernard_henri-levy_calls_nycs_treat.php">American media</a> and our apparently prudish attitude about men in power and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214611/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/dsk_had_sex_with_mother_of_journali.php">their relationships with women</a>, why don&apos;t we see what&apos;s making them uncomfortable?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214611/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/business/global/heir-apparent-at-eads-appears-in-internet-video.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the NY Times</a>, apparently it&apos;s not so fun when you see a billionaire set to lead a European aerospace group in a YouTube video &quot;posing and cuddling with his young, supermodel girlfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>Arnaud Lagard&#xE8;re, 50, and his girlfriend Jade Foret were interviewed for a Belgian magazine cover story, and the magazine posted video of the photo shoot online.  And it has French and German media in a tizzy!  The Times reports, &quot;The German business daily Handelsblatt and the French newspaper Le Monde described it as &apos;embarrassing&apos; and &apos;disturbing,&apos; while Lib&#xE9;ration, another French daily, likened the video to a Brazilian soap-opera. Challenges, a French newsweekly, found it &apos;stupefying.&apos;&quot;  Let&apos;s watch it!</p>

<p>Lagard&#xE8;re is supposed to lead <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EADS">EADS</a> (Wiki description: &quot;a global pan-European aerospace and defence corporation and a leading defence and military contractor worldwide&quot;) so we guess it&apos;d be weird if there was video of, say, the head of Boeing adjusting the corset-like ties on his way younger girlfriend&apos;s bursting cleavage.  C&apos;est la vie!</p>
