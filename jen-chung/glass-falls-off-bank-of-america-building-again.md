We&apos;ll repeat what a reader told us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117114008/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/12/glass_just_does_not_like_staying_on.php">last time around</a>: &quot;<strong>Stuff falls from that building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117114008/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/18/falling_debris.php">all the time</a>, it&apos;s insane. I am never walking under it again.</strong>&quot;</p>
