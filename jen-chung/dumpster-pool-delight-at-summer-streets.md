But here are a few we found on Twitter&#x2014;looks like people were really enjoying the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420021934/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/02/photos_first_dip_in_summer_streets.php"> dumpster pools</a>!</p>

<p>The next Summer Streets is next Saturday, August 14, and then August 21 will be the final day.  Between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., 6.9 miles of city streets&#x2014;along Park Avenue and other connecting streets from the Brooklyn Bridge to Central Park&#x2014;are closed to vehicular traffic.  </p>
