Miriam Starobin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110150751/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/spongebob_hero_2BRjc83sAiydgatlOgmMYP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;It was like a flash right in my eyes. <strong>I saw in my head Squidward with his clarinet lodged in his throat and then SpongeBob does the Heimlich maneuver and the clarinet comes flying out of his mouth</strong>.&quot;  FWIW, that&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110150751/http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Squidtastic_Voyage">Squidtastic Voyage episode</a>.</p>

<p>Miriam and Allyson Golden were in music class at Long Beach Middle School.  The teacher made a joke, which sent the girls into peals of laughter, but Allyson, who was chewing gum, started to choke.  Allyson couldn&apos;t speak and was turning red and flailing, so Miriam <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110150751/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/spongebob-show-helps-12-year-old-save-choking-pal-1.1875612">told Newsday</a> that she &quot;got her up ... I think I took my left hand and covered it with my right and pushed into her stomach three or four times.&quot;  Miriam <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110150751/http://wcbstv.com/watercooler/spongebob.heimlich.heimlich.2.1650991.html">said to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;And I go whoa did I just do that?&quot; while Allyson chimed in, &quot;And I go whoa did she just do that?&quot;  Allyson added, &quot;She&apos;s, like, my hero.&quot;</p>

<p>A Nickelodeon spokeperson said, &quot;We think it&apos;s smart thinking on Miriam&apos;s part, and we are happy that SpongeBob could be such a positive help.&quot; Newsday also reports that Miriam is a fan of Grey&apos;s Anatomy and suggests she could have picked up some knowledge from the soapy medical drama.</p>
