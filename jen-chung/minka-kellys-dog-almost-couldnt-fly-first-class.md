										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_09_minka.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704093136im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_09_minka.jpg" width="200" height="279" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704093136/http://gawker.com/5632121/minka-kellys-airplane-freak+out-happening-right-now?skyline=true&amp;s=i">tipster told Gawker</a> that actress Minka Kelly had &quot;caused such a fucking scene about her dog not being able to be on seat w/ her that the pilot had to come out before we even left the gate&quot; at JFK Airport, while heading to Los Angeles on a Delta flight. And the tipster claimed the <em>Friday Night Lights</em> starlet called her boyfriend, Derek Jeter, to talk to pilot! Luckily Kelly&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704093136/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/09/08/2010-09-08_friday_night_lights_star_minka_kelly_denies_hissy_fit_on_flight.html">Marty Singer was able to set the story straight</a>, &quot;I know that the story that was reported in Gawker is a complete lie. If someone threw a fit on a plane, they&apos;d be thrown off the plane in 30 seconds.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the Delta crew told Kelly that her cockapoonamed Chewie couldn&apos;t be stowed under the chair in front of her (because the seats in first class don&apos;t have that kind of space) during takeoff and landing. Kelly herself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704093136/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jeter_gal_has_very_ruff_flight_EoMBISVi6eqP3Co2STgwPK">told the Post,</a> &quot;I asked to speak to a supervisor, please.  I called my manager&apos;s assistant to make sure she arranged everything and went through certain steps to make sure the dog can fly... I didn&apos;t think there&apos;d be a problem.&quot;  </p>

<p>Luckily, a fellow first-class passenger&apos;s father, who was sitting in coach, offered to let Kelly sit in coach during takeoff and landing.  How&apos;s that for a Hollywood ending?  However, Kelly didn&apos;t comment on this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704093136/http://gawker.com/5419795/ultimate-gawker-stalkers-derek-jeters-starbucks-and-the-minka-kelly-problem">older Gawker tip about her</a>.</p>
