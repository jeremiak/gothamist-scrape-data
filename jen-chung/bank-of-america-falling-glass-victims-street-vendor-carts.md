It turns out the glass panel fell from the <i>50th</i> floor, not the 16th.  And while no one, fortunately, was hurt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115644/http://www.1010wins.com/PICS-AUDIO--Glass-Panel-Falls-From-Midtown-Tower/2984778">1010 WINS spoke to two street vendors</a>: One said pieces of glass &quot;hit him on the head&quot; while &quot;another vendor said he had to push his cart down the street after shards of glass fell into his food.&quot;  Nice.  Tishman Construction claims no work was being done where the glass panel fell, which is so not reassuring.  </p>
