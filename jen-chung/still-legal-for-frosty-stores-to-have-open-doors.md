title: Still Legal for Frosty Stores to Have Open Doors

One downtown resident was told by a Soho clothing store that the open door was &quot;company policy,&quot; so the outraged resident called the store&apos;s main office, where someone &quot;said they had a &#x2018;green team&#x2019; forming.&quot;</p>

<p>Haberman points out that he wrote about this issue two years ago, when oil was at $70/barrel.  It&apos;s now at $140/barrel and he counted, on a recent walk during 90-degree weather, a number of stores with open-door policies:</p><blockquote>Along 34th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, 15 stores flooded the sidewalk with their air-conditioning. On a three-block stretch of Broadway in SoHo, from Houston Street to Broome Street, the number was 29. Among the energy wasters were major retailers like Steve Madden, H &amp; M, Foot Locker, Aerosoles, Lane Bryant, Ann Taylor Loft, Arden B., Aldo, Uniqlo, Esprit and Zara.</blockquote>Last year, City Councilwoman Gale Brewer proposed a bill that would have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029033525/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/26/that_open_windo.php">fined establishments $200 per open door/window</a> in air conditioned spaces.  But the bill was never passed, because, Haberman writes, &quot;because it lacks support from the Bloomberg administration, which despite its own ample &apos;green&apos; talk has shown scant interest in telling businesses what to do.&quot;  Snap!  And one person suggests closing doors in stores yourself.<p></p>

<p>Some stores don&apos;t seem to care that the stress on Con Ed might <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029033525/http://www.ny1news.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=8&amp;aid=82539">prompt a blackout</a>, though Con Ed recommends air-conditioning be turned to 78 degrees.  And during the cold winter, sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029033525/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/26/west_village_re_2.php">store doors are open when the stores are warm and cozy</a>.</p>
