<p>With the Rangers headed to the Stanley Cup finals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606173715/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/30/rangers_win.php">for the first time in 20 years</a>, New Yorkers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606173715/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/03/rangers_bars_stanley_cup.php">getting ready for Game One tonight</a>. And Mayor Bill de Blasio has his first big sports bet of his administration. It involves national television.</p>

<p>Since the Rangers are facing off against the Los Angeles Kings, de Blasio made this bet with L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti: &quot;If the New York Rangers win, Mayor Garcetti will help perform a rendition of Frank Sinatra&#x2019;s &apos;New York, New York&apos; on Jimmy Kimmel Live! If the Los Angeles Kings win, Mayor de Blasio will help perform a rendition of Randy Newman&#x2019;s &apos;I Love LA&apos; on Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; Also: &quot;The losing Mayor would also provide hot dogs for Kimmel&#x2019;s audience&#x2014;Mayor Garcetti would provide Pink&apos;s Hot Dogs, while Mayor de Blasio would provide hot dogs from Gray&#x2019;s Papaya.&quot;</p>

<p>And the mayors offered their corny quotes from their poor communications teams: De Blasio&#x2014;&quot;Start spreading the news, it&#x2019;s been over 20 years since the Stanley Cup has found its home in New York City, and we look forward to it making its way here. Let&#x2019;s go Rangers&quot;;  Garcetti&#x2014;&quot;Looks like another perfect day&#x2014;for the Kings to take home the Stanley Cup. From the west side to the east side, the Kings will reign. Go Kings Go!&quot;</p>

<p>This leaves us with a quandary: Do we wish the Rangers blow this so we can see de Blasio humiliate himself on live TV? Or do we want the Rangers to bring the Cup back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606173715/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/23/video_snow_lateness_dantes_afro_de.php">so we can avoid more of his singing</a>?</p>

<p>The press release included the lyrics to the songs&#x2014;de Blasio&apos;s office claims that &quot;New York, New York&quot; is written by Frank Sinatra, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606173715/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kander_and_Ebb">but it was actually written by Kander and Ebb</a>:</p><blockquote>New York, New York by Frank Sinatra [<em>sic</em>]<p></p>

<p> </p>

<p>These little town blues, are melting away</p>

<p>I&apos;m gonna make a brand new start of it, in old New York</p>

<p>If I can make it there, I&apos;ll make it anywhere</p>

<p>It&apos;s up to you, New York, New York</p>

<p> </p>

<p>New York, New York</p>

<p>I want to wake up in a city, that never sleeps</p>

<p>To find I&apos;m a number one, head of the list,</p>

<p>Cream of the crop at the top of the heap.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These little town blues, are melting away</p>

<p>I&apos;m gonna make a brand new start of it, in old New York</p>

<p>If I can make it there, I&apos;m gonna make it anywhere</p>

<p>It&apos;s up to you, New York, New York</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I Love LA by Randy Newman</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Roll down the window put down the top</p>

<p>Crank up the Beach Boys baby</p>

<p>Don&apos;t let the music stop</p>

<p>We&apos;re gonna ride it till we just can&apos;t ride it no more</p>

<p> </p>

<p>From the South Bay to the Valley</p>

<p>From the West Side to the East Side</p>

<p>Everybody&apos;s very happy</p>

<p>&apos;Cause the sun is shining all the time</p>

<p>Looks like another perfect day</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I love L.A. (We love it)</p>

<p>I love L.A. (We love it)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Century Boulevard (We love it)</p>

<p>Victory Boulevard (We love it)</p>

<p>Santa Monica Boulevard (We love it)</p>

<p>Sixth Street (We love it, we love it)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I love L.A.</p>

<p>I love L.A.</p>

<p>(We love it)</p></blockquote><p></p>
