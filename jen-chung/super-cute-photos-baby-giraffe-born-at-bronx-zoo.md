</div></div>					<p>Mazel tov!  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328070952/http://www.wcs.org/">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> announced the birth of a baby Baringo giraffe at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328070952/http://www.bronxzoo.com/">Bronx Zoo</a>.  The female calf was about 6 feet tall and over 100 pounds at birth, and when she&apos;s all grown up, she could be around 16 feet tall and weigh 2,600 pounds!</p>

<p>According to the WCS, &quot;The calf will be making its debut in the zoo&#x2019;s African Plains in about one week. The calf has not been named as of now. The Bronx Zoo names all of its giraffes in memory of Mr. and Mrs. James Carter, benefactors for the Carter Giraffe Building.&quot; Also: &quot;Giraffes are native to grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands in central, east, and southern Africa. The Baringo, or Rothschild&#x2019;s, giraffe is found in western Kenya and eastern Uganda. While giraffe populations are robust in many places, overall the population is decreasing. The Wildlife Conservation Society works across the globe and within the giraffe&#x2019;s African range to save wildlife and wild places. WCS is working to protect giraffes in key African landscapes like Zakouma, Chad, Murchison Falls, Uganda, and in the Sahel of South Sudan.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328070952/http://www.bronxzoo.com/plan-your-trip/hours-and-rates.aspx">details about visiting the Bronx Zoo</a>. And last September, giraffe James Marjani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328070952/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/09/video_adorable_baby_giraffe_at_the.php">was born into the giraffe family there</a>.  </p>
