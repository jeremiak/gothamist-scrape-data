---

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_daveh/nixzmary_3.jpg" class="left">Jurors were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/09/15/2008-09-15_going_to_be_emotional_nixzmary_jury_pool.html">warned by prosecutors</a> that the trial would be &quot;emotional&quot; as jury selection began in for a second trial related to 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown&apos;s death.  This time, the child&apos;s mother Nixzaliz Santiago faces murder charges.</p>

<p>Nixzmary was killed in January 2006, after being beaten by her stepfather Cesar Rodriguez for apparently taking some yogurt (or pudding) without permission.  She spent her final hours <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/13/tragic_life_and.php">beaten and having her head hit against the bathtub faucet</a> and held under water, after a life where she was repeatedly beaten, tied to a chair, starved, and made to use a litter box.  Rodriguez was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/18/still_no_verdic.php">convicted of manslaughter</a>, and now the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office will say that Santiago&apos;s lack of action stopping Rodriguez contributed to her daughter&apos;s death.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Ama Dwimoh referred to the brutal life and death of Nixzmary, telling the pool, &quot;It&apos;s sad, it&apos;s emotional, it&apos;s terrible,&quot; and potential jurors gasped when the charges were read.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/nyregion/16nixzmary.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times noticed</a> that some gasped when prosecutors pointed out that Santiago was Nixzmary&apos;s &quot;natural mother.&quot;  During Rodriguez&apos;s trial, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/02/jurors_weep_dur.php">jurors gasped and cried at evidence</a> showing Nixzmary&apos;s battered body.  </p>

<p>Santiago&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/85868/jury-selection-underway-in-nixzaliz-santiago-trail/Default.aspx">lawyer said</a>, &quot;We&apos;re going to tell her side of the story. By the end of this case, people are going to find out what happened in that household was not murder,&quot; suggesting their client was not mentally stable and suffered abuse under Rodriguez as well.  The defense also<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122345/http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/monday/news/ny-nynixz155844349sep15,0,1324415.story"> wants to limit the presence of spectators</a> who support the memory of Nixzmary Brown during the trial.  </p>
