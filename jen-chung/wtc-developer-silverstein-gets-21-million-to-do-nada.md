The Port Authority says it&apos;s siply abiding by the contract, while Silverstein&apos;s spokesman told the paper, &quot;We believe our expertise in office tower construction would be of tremendous value in getting the 1 World Trade Center project back on schedule, and our team remains at the Port&apos;s disposal.&quot;</p>
