The history-making potential of her candidacy has been a key part of her public profile. Her official biography says she &quot;is proud to have been elected to the New York State Assembly on the same historic day as President Barack Obama.&quot;</p>

<p>On Friday, Meng <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118154958/http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=806956678&amp;sk=wall">posted on her Facebook page</a>, &quot;Long before it was popular or easier to have meaningful relationships in the Asian-American community, Congressman Ackerman was hard at work making himself helpful there. This new congressional district is heavily Asian, and I will be sitting down with our Queens Democratic Organization Chairman, Congressman Joseph Crowley, our community leaders and activists to discuss how the coming months may shape out,&quot; and on Saturday, &quot;Did you know only 16% of Congress are women?&quot; with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118154958/http://queens.ny1.com/content/top_stories/157761/queens-democrats-begin-to-eye-congressman-ackerman-s-seat">link to this NY1 story</a>. Someone commented, &quot;Maybe you can make it 17.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118154958/http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Rory-I-Lancman">Lancman</a> himself Tweeted, &quot;Congrats to my friend Grace, looking forward to a spirited campaign on the issues.&quot;</p>
