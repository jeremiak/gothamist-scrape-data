<p>Earlier today, Vice President Joe Biden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234214/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2012/04/26/vice-president-biden-spoke-at-the-law-school-today/">spoke at NYU Law School</a> to ramp up Obama/Biden 2012 and to attack Romeny/Someone 2012.  Of course, all that anyone remembers is how Biden recalled the Theodore Roosevelt line, &quot;speak softly, and carry a big stick,&quot; by saying, &quot;I promise you, the President has a big stick. I promise you.&quot;</p>

<p>And here are some other things that Biden said:</p>

<ul>	<li>&quot;If you are looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how President Obama has handled what we inherited, it&apos;s pretty simple: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.&quot; (<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234214/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2012/04/biden-we-cant-say-for-certain-what-gov-romney-would-have-done-about-osama-bin-">Daily Politics</a></em>)</li>	<li>After saying how Romney&apos;s policy are &quot;dangerously divorced from today&#x2019;s realities&quot; and how the Republican is &quot;mired in a Cold War mind-set,&quot; Biden explained, &quot;Governor Romney is counting on our collective amnesia. But Americans know that we cannot afford to go back to the future.&quot; (<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234214/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vice-president-biden-takes-aim-at-romney-on-foreign-policy/2012/04/26/gIQAMNoNjT_story.html">Washington Post</a></em>)</li>	<li>&quot;Back to a foreign policy that would have America go it alone, shout to the world you&apos;re either with us or against us, lash out first and ask the hard questions later, if at all.&quot; (<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234214/http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2012/04/26/joe_biden_speech_at_nyu_knocks_romney_s_foreign_policy.html">Slate</a></em>)</li>	<li>Obama &quot;saved our economy from collapse with some very unpopular, but bold decisions&quot; (<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234214/https://twitter.com/?tw_e=details&amp;tw_i=195528808005238785&amp;tw_p=tweetembed#!/KatrinaTrinko/statuses/195528808005238785">Katrina Trinko</a></em>)</li><li>Obama is awesome: &quot;This guy&apos;s got a backbone like a ramrod.
