Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;Oh, we look for house parties all the time.&quot;<p></p>

<p>He further explained, &#x201C;We look at social networking. We&#x2019;re very much focused on weekend parties, the type of parties that happened last weekend, and we visit them ahead of time. But not every one of these parties happen at a place we can readily identify... Our gang division, our borough personnel look at party advertisements. A lot of these things are at peoples&#x2019; apartments.&quot;  Kelly also pointed out that many ads <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710071349/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/06/24/ray-kelly-nypd-monitoring-facebook-twitter-to-crack-down-on-house-parties/">say no ID is needed</a>.</p>

<p>NY1 spoke to some people who had a range of emotions about the NYPD checking out residents&apos; social media profiles: One said, &quot;If it is going to help cut down on the homicides, then I guess I&#x2019;m for it,&quot; while another opined, &quot;I really do think it is an invasion of privacy.&quot;</p>
