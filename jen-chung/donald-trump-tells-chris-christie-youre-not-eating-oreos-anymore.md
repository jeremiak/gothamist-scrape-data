<p>Last night, Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702183625/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Trump-Helps-Chris-Christie-Pay-Off-Campaign-Debt-380204321.html">held fundraiser to help pay off</a> hype man Chris Christie&apos;s campaign debts. And in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702183625/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/dead-eyed_christie_drumpf.php">true submissive fashion</a>, Christie said, &quot;We never ever make a mistake by standing with your friend. And Donald Trump is my friend.&quot; Well, as Dirk Calloway said, &quot;With friends like you, who needs friends?&quot;</p>

<p>During the event in Lawrenceville, NJ, Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702183625/http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/280639-trump-mocks-chris-christies-weight-while-headlining-the-governors-event">mocked Christie&apos;s weight</a>, telling him, &quot;I&#x2019;m not eating Oreos anymore, you know that &#x2014; but neither is Chris. You&#x2019;re not eating Oreos anymore. No more Oreos. For either of us, Chris. Don&#x2019;t feel bad.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, this is Trump&apos;s way to referencing how he&apos;s boycotting Nabisco because they are moving jobs from Chicago to Mexico (though, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702183625/http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/about-trumps-oreo-boycott/">FactCheck points out</a>, there will just be a smaller operation in Chicago and &quot;there will still be three plants in the U.S. making Oreos.&quot;). But when you talk about food and Christie, people aren&apos;t going to pay attention to the grandstanding about jobs part:</p>
