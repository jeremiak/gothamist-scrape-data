<p>After Ed Koch said he was supporting Barack Obama for president because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113800/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/09/scared_of_palin_ed_koch_backs_obama.php">Sarah Palin scares him</a>, Koch has been hearing from some of the folks who  subscribe to his commentary via e-mail.  The former mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113800/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/nyregion/14koch.html?ref=nyregion">shared some of the missives he received</a>--plus replies he&apos;s sending--with the NY Times(which incidentally is one of Koch&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113800/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/12/koch_to_cnn_the_ny_times_is_better.php">most trusted news sources</a>!).  </p>

<p>While most of the 400-some e-mails were positive, but the ones who disagreed with Koch&apos;s position were really...intense.  Koch explained, &quot;I was surprised primarily by those who criticized me with the invective they used, but I know those who praised me, had I come out the other way, would have used the same invective.&#x201D; Per the Times, here are some excerpts of e-mails and, in italics, Koch&apos;s replies.<br>
</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Though I could not disagree with you more on your backing of George W. Bush, I congratulate you on your choice this time around.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p><i>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it possible that both my choices were and are correct? History will make that judgment.&#x201D;</i></p>

<p>&#x201C;No one believes you are really endorsing Obama out of a sincere belief that he is the better candidate after you endorsed Bush in &#x2019;04.&#x201D;</p>

<p><em>&#x201C;How foolish of you. ... The fact that I exercised independence of my party then is surely relevant and establishes that I vote my conscience.&#x201D;<br>
</em><br>
&#x201C;If you feel Obama is the right man, with zero experience, anti-American stands, I no longer wish to receive your insights.&#x201D;</p>

<p><em>&#x201C;Removed from e-mail with pleasure and alacrity.&#x201D;<br>
</em><br>
&#x201C;You are kinder to Sarah Palin than I would be &#x2014; I&#x2019;ve never thought that disemboweling a moose was a strong qualification for a would-be president.&#x201D;</p>

<p><i>&#x201C;I have no problem with Palin being an expert on skinning a moose and turning it into stew. I have a problem with her breaking tie votes in the Senate.&#x201D;</i></p></blockquote>Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113800/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/why_im_voting_for_obamabiden.html">Koch&apos;s explanation of why he&apos;s supporting Obama-Biden</a>. <p></p>
