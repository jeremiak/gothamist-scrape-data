<p>Officials believe that the man whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093150/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/06/subway_death_brooklyn.php">body was found between subway cars</a> at a downtown Brooklyn station this week was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093150/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaysurfing">subway surfing</a>. </p>

<p>At around 2:30 a.m. on Friday, police officers responded to a call about a man who was found unconscious at the Jay Street-MetroTech station. Apparently a person on the platform noticed the body of James Rubio, 24, between F train cars. Rubio was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093150/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-found-dead-between-subway-cars-may-have-been-subway-surfing/1326286/">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;Authorities believe [Rubio] may have been on top of the subway car and hit the roof of the tunnel before falling down in between the train cars. Police did find blood on the roof of one of those cars.&quot;</p>

<p>An autopsy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093150/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-24-dies-found-subway-cars-brooklyn-article-1.2627163">has been scheduled</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093150/http://web.mta.info/safety/">The MTA warns against this illegal behavior:</a> &quot;You risk serious injury if you ride on top of the train (surfing) or ride holding onto outside doors (skylarking). It&apos;s also against the law. Boarding between subway cars may seem like a time-saver, but it is highly dangerous. It&apos;s also dangerous to try to keep subway doors from closing when you are entering or exiting the train. They are not like elevator doors and will not reopen automatically. In addition, make sure that pocketbooks, knapsacks, clothing, packages, umbrellas, and other personal items are clear of the closing doors. When you&apos;re inside a moving train, never ride between cars or lean against doors. When you are standing, always hold on.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, many attempt it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093150/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/06/man_in_critical_condition_after_att_1.php">with terrible consequences</a>.</p>
