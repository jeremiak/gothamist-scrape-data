---

	
										<p>Yesterday morning, police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731233958/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04122009/news/regionalnews/bronx/cops_kill_dad_wielding_knifre_164129.htm">killed a Bronx man</a> who had been threatening to kill his family, allegedly saying, &quot;I have to kill the children and my wife and send them to heaven. I don&apos;t care about killing myself and going to hell.&quot;  Mauricio Jacques, 35, had been holding his wife with one hand while a 10-inch knife was in the other; their three children, ages 5 to 11, were also present.  Cops had tried to negotiate with him for an hour; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731233958/http://wcbstv.com/local/mauricio.jacques.killed.2.983236.html">WCBS 2 report</a>s that Jacques agreed to surrender but &quot; then lunged with a 10-inch knife at officers, who tried to subdue Jacques with a stun gun and rubber pellets. Undeterred, he stabbed an officer in the abdomen of his protective vest and slashed another&apos;s vest near the neck.&quot;  The cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731233958/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/nyregion/13shoot.html?ref=nyregion">used the Taser on him again</a>, but that didn&apos;t stop him, so one cop grabbed his wife while two others fired six shots at Jacques.  Last week, the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731233958/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/09/cops_unable_to_use_taser_in_fatal_s.php">fatally shot a woman who slashed a police officer</a>.  </p>
