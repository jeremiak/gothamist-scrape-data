<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_05_dsksunbah.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_05_dsksunbah.jpg" width="640" height="407"> <br> <i>Nothing like serving out your house arrest on the roof of a $14 million TriBeCa home</i></div> <p></p>

<p>If you (or your super-rich third wife) are shelling out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/dominique_strauss-kahn_moves_to_swa.php">$50,000/month for a TriBeCa townhouse</a> to live in during your house arrest, you probably want to take advantage of the roof terrace, right?  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/party_at_dsk_house_Ljmnkb9DBSE9R6NsPzH5mI">Post thinks there&apos;s a party happening</a> at 153 Franklin Street&#x2014;aka the current residence of accused sexual assaulter and leading French politician, Dominique Strauss-Kahn&#x2014;because &quot;Flunkies outside Strauss-Kahn&apos;s...townhouse were spotted removing boxes for outdoor-patio umbrellas. The umbrellas will be perfect to shield the onetime French presidential contender from the sun -- and prying eyes of the press -- when he steps out onto his townhouse&apos;s elaborate planted terrace.&quot;</p>

<p>A hotel maid at the Sofitel Times Square says that Strauss-Kahn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/imf_head_to_plead_not_guilty_to_sex.php">tried to rape her and forced her to perform oral sex</a> on him in his hotel suite on May 14.  Strauss-Kahn, 62, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/19/dominique_strauss-kahn_indicted_on.php">was indicted</a> and resigned from his role as the head of the International Monetary Fund.  However, he has claimed he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/23/dominique_strauss-kahn_tells_imf_i.php">will be exonerated</a> and has a celebrity defense team that says his accuser, an African immigrant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/27/dsks_lawyers_suggest_accuser_is_not.php">is not credible</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/30/2011-05-30_experts_le_pervs_past_may_haunt_him.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Readerhttp://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/party_at_dsk_house_Ljmnkb9DBSE9R6N">Daily News reports</a> that the Manhattan DA&apos;s office may try get others who have accused Strauss-Kahn of sexual attacks and misconduct to testify, which is what happened during Marv Albert&apos;s sex attack case: &quot;In the case of the frisky Frenchman, previous alleged indiscretions include a French TV reporter who charged that he behaved like a &quot;rutting chimpanzee&quot; during a 2002 sexual assault. There was also a former underling at the International Monetary Fund who accused Strauss-Kahn of pressuring her into sex three years ago.&quot;  Defense lawyer Ron Kuby says, &quot;<strong>The likelihood of getting that in front of the jury is slim to none. It doesn&apos;t mean the prosecution won&apos;t try</strong>,&quot; while lawyer Gerald Lefcourt adds, &quot;It&apos;s not admissible if it&apos;s offered because this guy is a bad guy. It has to be for a specific purpose, something that is what he does - sort of a modus operandi.&quot;</p>

<p>In the meantime, a French junior minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy resigned under allegations of sexual misconduct. Georges Tron, described as a foot fetishist, is, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601172855/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8544866/French-foot-fetishist-minister-resigns-after-sex-claims.html">per the Telegraph</a> &quot;renowned for his passion for reflexology that has reportedly earned him the nickname &quot;the foot fetishist&quot; and the &quot;Chinese masseur&quot; of the National Assembly. A minister said that he must have massaged &quot;a thousand feet&quot; - almost exclusively those of women... Two former employees of the Paris suburb of Draveil, where Mr Tron is mayor, claimed in recent days to have been subjected to &quot;therapeutic foot massages&quot; between 2007 and 2010 that turned into &quot;very real sexual attacks&quot;.&quot; </p>
