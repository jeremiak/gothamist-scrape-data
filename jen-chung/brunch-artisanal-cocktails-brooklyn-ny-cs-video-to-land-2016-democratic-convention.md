</div></div>					<p>Mayor de Blasio would like Brooklyn and the Barclays Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140628072942/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/06/de_blasio_proposes_brooklyns_barcla.php">to host the 2016 Democratic National Convention</a>, noting, &quot;The progressive spirit of New York City has never been stronger or more vibrant than it is today. The values of the Democratic Party&#x2014;inclusion, diversity, compassion&#x2014;are part of our city&apos;s spirit.&quot; Finally, there&apos;s a video to go along with that pitch:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20140628072942if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/bWIyYXKAh2E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Citi Bike. The New York Botanical Garden. World&apos;s Fair Ground. The Cyclone. Tattooed mixologist. Outer-borough green taxi. Brownstones. Ethnic enclaves. The Staten Island Ferry. The High Line. The 9/11 Memorial. Lady Liberty&#x2014;if we were playing a NYC drinking game, we&apos;d be totally wasted. </p>

<p>The video was shown in a meeting between NYC officials and Democratic officials yesterday; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140628072942/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/nyregion/new-york-video-pitch-democratic-national-convention.html?partner=socialflow&amp;smid=tw-nytmetro">the NY Times reports</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;A city of neighborhoods, a place to call home, a destination worth the trip,&#x201D; an off-screen narrator says. As scenes of a Yankees parade and a Nets game flash by, the narrator says: &#x201C;This is a city where history is made in the Bronx, while dinner is served in Queens and memories are made in Brooklyn.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Dinner, presumably, is also being made in the other four boroughs, although those meals go unmentioned.</p></blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140628072942/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/six-cities-bid-host-democratic-national-convention-2016">other cities interested in hosting</a> the 2016 DNC are Birmingham, Alabama; Cleveland, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Phoenix, Arizona. But let&apos;s face it&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140628072942/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/10/i_stood_in_line_for_five_hours_for.php">Hillary should have her homecoming here</a>, right?<p></p>
