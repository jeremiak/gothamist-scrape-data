<p>The grieving mother of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232812/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/21-year-old_killed_by_hit-and-run_d.php">21-year-old woman killed by a hit-and-run truck driver last week</a> is speaking out.  Roxana Sorina Buta was crossing Broadway at East 14th Street when a dump truck hit her (a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232812/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/nypd-hunts-driver-dump-truck-crushed-woman-death-fled-scene-article-1.1083784#ixzz1vnI0rQHF">said Buta had the light</a>) crushing her.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232812/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hit_run_actress_mom_makes_plea_to_bsfohwT0jkkjr6ylQkxHuO">Cristina Oprea said</a>, &quot;All I want is justice for my daughter. He hit my daughter and he just kept on driving. Who does something like that? He should give himself up.&quot;</p>

<p>Buta, who was also studying at Hunter College, had recently performed in the off-Broadway play, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232812/http://www.himtheplay.com/thecast.html">Him</a>.  The writer-director, Clifford Streit, told the News, &quot;A lot of people who came to the play thought she had tremendous potential... She was great-looking, very talented, funny. She absolutely had a career ahead of her.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, a group of her friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232812/http://suzannahbtroy.blogspot.com/2012/05/roxie-sorina-memory-honored-union.html">mourned her death at the scene of the incident</a>.  The police are apparently still investigating the crime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232812/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/heres_why_drivers_get_away_with_mur.php">which happens more often when the victim dies</a>.</p>
