The soft drink bottler has announced it&apos;s bringing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927144818/http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/10/12/daily45.html?ana=from_rss">mini 7.5-ounce Coke cans to NYC</a> and Washington DC this December.

The mini cans will roll out to the rest of the country in March.
