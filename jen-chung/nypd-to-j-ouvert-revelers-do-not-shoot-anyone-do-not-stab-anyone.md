<p>In the countdown to the huge West Indian-American Day Parade festivities, the NYPD is continuing its efforts to make J&apos;Ouvert, the pre-parade all-night party, safe. This time, they&apos;re appealing to participants with flyers asking them not to shoot or stab anyone.</p>

<p>Last year, two people were killed during the festivities, including an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309232643/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/07/report_gov_cuomos_deputy_counsel_sh.php">aide to Governor Cuomo</a>. The police announced earlier this summer that they would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309232643/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/26/nypd_will_double_number_of_cops_lig.php">doubling the number of officers</a>. On Thursday night, the 71st Precinct Tweeted:</p>

<p>An organizer has pointed out that there have been many cops at the J&apos;Ouvert parade; at a press conference addressing the 2015 violence, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309232643/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/11/jouvert_organizer_the_media_doesnt.php">Kwasi Wahtuse said</a>, &quot;I think the media has made no distinction between the actual J&apos;Ouvert celebration, and the violence that occurs before, during, and after it. The actual parade itself is always secure, with a strong police presence. The stuff that happens on the peripheries is what they talk about. The media is making no move to describe violence as a perennial problem.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309232643/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160826/prospect-lefferts-gardens/do-not-shoot-anyone-police-warn-brooklyn-residents-ahead-of-jouvert">According to DNAinfo</a>, residents in a &quot;closed Facebook neighborhood group&quot; were upset at the flyers, with one calling it &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;condescending... Why are they lumping hundreds of thousands of peaceful J&#x2019;Ouvert celebrants with gang bangers from Ebbets Field? It&#x2019;s completely outrageous and the opposite of what the NYPD says they are trying to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess this is the de Blasio crime prevention program,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309232643/http://nypost.com/2016/08/26/cops-urge-jouvert-revelers-to-refrain-from-violence/">a police source snarked to the Post</a>. &quot;I found this absolutely hysterical. It&#x2019;s just incredible. We&#x2019;ve come to the point now where we&#x2019;re asking people not to shoot one another. As if this doesn&#x2019;t come naturally? If they really want to reduce the crime here, they should be enforcing the law and restricting the permits... This will have zero impact, of course. What a waste of paper, though I don&#x2019;t want to put the graphic artist out of business.&quot;</p>
