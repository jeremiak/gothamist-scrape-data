<p>Police are looking for the driver of a black Mercedes Benz sedan in connection with the hit-and-run death of a four-year-old on Staten Island. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070212/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/10/nypd-hit-and-run-driver-kills-4-year-old-boy-injures-woman-young-girl/">A witness told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The Mercedes stopped. Everybody was yelling at him. He knew what he did. He pulled out of the parking lot of the deli where I am standing right now and he ran the child over. He has no regard for life if he could leave a little child laying in the street after he ran him over and just drove away. He has no conscience.&quot;</p>

The unidentified woman said her sister-in-law and the two children were headed back to their car, which the mother had parked across the street. &apos;They were crossing the street to pick up their car from the other side and the car hit all three of them,&apos; she said.&quot;</p>
