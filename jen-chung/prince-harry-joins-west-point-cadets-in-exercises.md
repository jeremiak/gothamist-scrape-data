</div></div><p>Yesterday, Prince Harry arrived in New York for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082633/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/25/harry_is_here.php">his weekend visit</a>.  The prince, who is third in line to the British throne, first headed to West Point Military Academy, where he joined cadets in different training drills and exercises.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082633/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/26/2010-06-26_untitled__2harry26m.html">According to the Daily News</a>, he &quot;fired an M4 rifle alongside cadets at popup, silhouette targets as far as 300 meters away.&quot;</p>

<p>A West Point instructor said, &quot;He clearly knows what he&apos;s doing. He clearly knows how to shoot. He clearly knows how to move.&quot;  Well, Prince Harry did attend Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst&#x2014;plus he&apos;s a lieutenant in the British Army and he served, briefly, in Afghanistan.  He also chatted with cadets; one said, &quot;He seems like a really down-to-earth guy.&quot;  Then he headed to the USS Intrepid to honor the relationship between U.S. and U.K. and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082633/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/prince_making_point_xXa3CgSk31uAtl7V7C0ydM">praised America&apos;s</a> &quot;pioneering work of care in prosthetics and rehabilitation.&quot;</p>
