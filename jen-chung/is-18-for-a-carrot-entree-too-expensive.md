title: Is $18 For A Carrot Entree Too Expensive?

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220050/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/carrot_gold_BY6pFQ8VO6pmrEUtAcVsPP">Post has an outraged article</a> about a vegetarian dish at East Village restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220050/http://www.northernspyfoodco.com/menus/dinner/">Northern Spy Co.</a>: &quot;This is what New York dining has come to &#x2014; $18 for an entree of three roasted carrots... [this] all-veggie dish comprises three skinny roasted carrots, wild spinach and freekeh (a green grain), and almonds.&quot; </p>

<p>Chef Haley Schmitt tells the Post the entree, which involves pan-roasting the carrots, is worth it, &quot;It generally comes down to, &#x2018;Wow, these carrots taste really good! What can we do with them?&apos;&quot; And to counter criticism that carrots are pretty cheap so what gives about the price, co-owner Chris Ronis says, &quot;There&#x2019;s always the question why one restaurant might have a $6 burger and another restaurant has one for $25. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a lot more that goes into a plate. In our case, the prices come down to the ingredients we use &#x2014; far more than you would find in another carrot dish &#x2014; and that includes putting a lot of technique into it, labor time and staff. We would never overcharge. The price is fair.&quot; Right&#x2014;like why are some bartenders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220050/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/28/le_poisson_rouge_charges_3_extra_fo.php">charging for drinks with ice</a>? And further, why go out at all&#x2014;it&apos;s cheaper to complain about food being expensive when you&apos;re at home!</p>

<p>Anyway, Time columnist and meat lover Josh Ozersky complains, &quot;Such is the perversity of vegetarians &#x2014; you can&#x2019;t tell whether it&#x2019;s a gift or an insult. My favorite meat is lamb fat. My philosophy is that the fat is the meat and the meat is the vegetable.&quot;  Of course, Ozersky was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220050/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/the-feed-blog/disturbing-but-true-josh-ozersky-gets-the-gout">diagnosed with gout</a> three years ago, so take his thoughts with a grain of metaphorical salt.  </p>
