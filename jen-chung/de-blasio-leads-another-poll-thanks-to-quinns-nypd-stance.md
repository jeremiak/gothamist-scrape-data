<p>A new poll from the NY Times and Siena College casts Public Advocate Bill de Blasio firmly as the frontrunner in the Democratic mayoral field. </p>

<p>While his numbers aren&apos;t as near-runoff-proof <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161027/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/de_blasio_has_15-point_lead_over_qu.php">as Quinnipiac&apos;s earlier this week</a>, de Blasio should feel good. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161027/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/nyregion/leading-democrats-de-blasio-has-broad-support-as-primary-nears.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;With 11 days remaining until the primary, the new survey shows a drastically reshaped race as a broad cross-section of voters embraces Mr. de Blasio&#x2019;s candidacy. It found that 32 percent of likely Democratic voters supported Mr. de Blasio, who is the city&#x2019;s elected public advocate, compared with 18 percent for William C. Thompson Jr., the former comptroller, and 17 percent for Ms. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, the poll found, according to the Times, that &quot;de Blasio&#x2019;s campaign, fueled by a relentless focus on economic disparity and a searing critique of the Bloomberg administration, has transcended the city&#x2019;s traditional demographic divisions: he is drawing higher levels of support from men and women, older and younger, than any of his rivals. He has won the backing of those who think the city is headed in the right direction and those convinced it is on the wrong track.&quot; (Numbers people, here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161027/http://www.siena.edu/uploadedfiles/home/parents_and_community/community_page/sri/sny_poll/NYC0813%20Crosstabs.pdf">PDF of the crosstabs</a>.)</p>

Twenty percent said Christine Quinn, 19 percent chose Bill Thompson, and 18 percent were undecided.&quot;</p>

<p>One respondent, a 61-year-old in the Bronx, told the NY Times he previously supported Quinn but &quot;but grew wary of what he saw as her emphasis on Manhattan and her failure to &apos;make a strong stand&apos; on police stops.&quot; Steven McCain said, &quot;<strong>Most people are tired of Bloomberg &#x2014; sick and tired of him.
