You know the pigeon drop: It&apos;s when someone claims there&apos;s a wallet/bag/something full of money and another person suggests you all put deposits down to prove you&apos;re all (you and the other scammers) are committed to sharing the money.   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131030092513/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/04/15/2010-04-15_senior_foils_scam_qns_woman_78_trips_up_empty_wallet_grifters_by_going_to_cops.html">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Looking for marks on Queens Blvd., the grifters left a wallet that appeared to be stuffed with cash on the sidewalk last month. [A 78-year-old] senior was walking to a bookstore when she saw the wallet - and was accosted by two men who opened it and claimed it held $300,000.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the wallet also had a note that said, &quot;We hit it big in the third race. Give mom five or ten thousand. I&apos;m going to Iraq.&quot; The woman was worried&#x2014;she told the News, &quot;There appeared to be a lot of cash in there and a note that led me to believe it had something to do with terrorism&quot;&#x2014;and wanted to take the wallet to the police.  But one of the men claimed to be a lawyer and convinced her to go to an office, where they said she could get her cut if she offered a &quot;good faith&quot; deposit.  The woman opted to go to the police, who later found the two men, Hiram Whitener, 69, of Spartanburg, S.C., and Charlet Merrit, 56, trying to scam another elderly woman.</p>
