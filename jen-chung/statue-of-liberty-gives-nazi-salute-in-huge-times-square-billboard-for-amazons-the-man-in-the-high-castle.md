<p>Last year, some subway riders were startled when they stepped into 42nd Street shuttle trains which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706080551/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/nazi_mta_subway_castle.php">were plastered in Nazi imagery to promote Amazon&apos;s drama series</a>, <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, based on Philip K. Dick&apos;s novel that imagines a world where the Axis powers were victorious after World War II. The ads were removed (Governor Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706080551/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/25/cuomo_saves_nyc_from_nazis.php">asked the MTA&apos;s chairman to yank &apos;em</a>), but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706080551/http://deadline.com/2015/12/the-man-in-the-high-castle-renewed-season-2-amazon-1201669352/">show was renewed</a> for another season, which meant that more advertising would come... which it has.</p>

<p>Uri Katz spotted this huge block-long billboard on Broadway, between 51st and 52nd Street, on his way to work this morning. &quot;Because of traffic, the first thing I saw was Lady Liberty and the Nazi salute and my heart missed a beat,&quot; he told us. </p>

<p>&quot;I know the show, and watched the first season myself, but I can think of a million better ways to promote this show, and I can&apos;t even imagine how a Holocaust survivor who lives in the city would feel if they saw that,&quot; Katz continued. &quot;This is tactless in so many ways.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Amazon for comment. Last year, the company didn&apos;t directly comment on the subway ads, but issued a statement saying, &quot;Amazon Studios creates high-quality, provocative programming that spurs conversation. <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, based on an acclaimed novel, explores the impact to our freedoms if we had lost World War II. Like <em>Transparent</em> and the movie <em>Chi-Raq</em>, stories that society cares about often touch on important, thought-provoking topics. We will continue to bring this kind of storytelling to our customers.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_12_amman3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706080551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_12_amman3.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Photograph: Uri Katz)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>As Evan Bernstein, the Anti-Defamation League&#x2019;s New York regional director, said of last year&apos;s subway ads, &quot;On the television program, which explains this is the notion of an America controlled by Hitler, you get that context.&quot; The train&apos;s ads were &quot;viscerally offensive, because there is no context as to what it means.&quot;</p>

<p>The massive billboard, depicting America&apos;s famous symbol of liberty succumbing to fascism, comes as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706080551/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/nypd_hate_crime_stats.php">hate crimes are on the rise</a> and white nationalists celebrate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706080551/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/richard-spencer-speech-npi/508379/">the President-elect with Nazi salutes</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m originally from Israel, my grandparents are Holocaust survivors and for someone who grew up having this as a part of his life I find this very disturbing,&quot; Katz said. &quot;My friends from Israel are furious and happy they don&apos;t have Amazon Prime there.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Amazon Studios released this statement, &quot;Season two of <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, based on Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s acclaimed novel, continues the journey into an imaginary, fictional world that explores the &#x201C;what ifs&#x201D; of an alternate history in which America lost World War II. Season two debuts December 16 and if you&apos;re interested to see what an alternate world could look like if history had gone another way, you should watch the show.&quot;<br>
