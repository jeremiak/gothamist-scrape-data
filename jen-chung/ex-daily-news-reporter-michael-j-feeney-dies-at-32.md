Feeney, a talented young journalist who was about to start a new job died yesterday at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, NJ. He was 32.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630070758/http://www.northjersey.com/news/teaneck-native-michael-feeney-former-record-reporter-dies-at-32-1.1503163">According to the NJ Record</a>, Feeney &quot;had been in the hospital since Tuesday and suffered kidney failure, the result of a staph infection, his mother, Reba Willis, said. He checked into the hospital with stomach pains and had delayed the start of a new job as an entertainment writer with CNN.com in Atlanta.&quot;</p>

<p>Feeney, a Teaneck native and Delaware State graduate, had been a reporter at the Bergen Record in NJ and at the NY Daily News until last year. The Record&apos;s entertainment editor Christina Joseph Robinson said, &quot;Mike was such a dynamic young man who loved journalism and people. Even as a young reporter, he understood what it meant to build meaningful relationships. Not only did he want to grow and become a better journalist, but he spent most of his free time mentoring the next generation of reporters.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630070758/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-newser-michael-feeney-dead-32-article-1.2515660">And from the Daily News</a>:</p><blockquote>At New York&#x2019;s Hometown Paper, Feeney initially worked the night shift and later moved to the paper&#x2019;s borough section, where he covered Harlem and other Uptown neighborhoods.<p></p>

<p>&quot;Mike gave me a long directory of contacts and a crash course about covering upper Manhattan and its diverse communities,&#x201D; said Bruce Diamond, one of Feeney&#x2019;s editors. &#x201C;In the more than two years I worked with him, I never stopped learning.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;He looked out for me big-time when I got to the Daily News,&#x201D; said former News reporter Jan Ransom. &#x201C;Every source I met raved about him &#x2014; and naturally, by association, that meant I was in their good graces, too.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630070758/http://www.nabj.org/news/272169/-NABJ-Mourns-the-Loss-of-Member-Michael-J.-Feeney.htm">Feeney had mentored</a> rising journalists as president of New York Association of Black Journalists. He also received the National Association of Black Journalists&apos; Emerging Journalist of the Year award. <p></p>

<p>His mother told the Record, &quot;Once you met Mike, you wanted to be in his circle. He had thousands of friends on Facebook. Everybody who was involved with him admired him and looked up to him. I looked up to him, and not just because he was taller than me. He was my hero.&quot;</p>
