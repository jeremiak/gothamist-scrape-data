<p>A reader sent us these photo and this video saying, &quot;Here&apos;s a man knocked out cold on the F train on St. Patrick&apos;s Day.  He was snoring for the duration of my 40 minute train ride. He was taking up 3 seats... meanwhile, people are getting fined for putting their bags on seats!&quot; Or they are getting tickets for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/cops_ticket_woman_for_resting_injur.php">resting their legs against seats</a>.  But sleeping is fine&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/06/cop_on_a-train_lets_sleeping_man_li.php#photo-1">cops are fine with letting that pass</a>.</p>

<p>And, look, not even the conductor&apos;s announcement can knock him out of his sweet sleep!</p>

<p>Well, at least he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/subway_etiquette_101_please_dont_hu.php">wasn&apos;t hugging the pole</a>.</p>
