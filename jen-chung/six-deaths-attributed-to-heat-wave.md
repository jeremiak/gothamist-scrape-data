The victims all died of hyperthermia (aka heat stroke)-- 57-year-old man, 74-year-old woman, and 84-year-old man in Brooklyn; a 70-year-old woman, an 84-year-old woman, and an 89-year-old man in Queens--and five of them died on Tuesday, the hottest day, in their homes.  (Back in 2006, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063249/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/06/heat_wave_death.php">20-23 heat wave-related deaths</a>.)</p>

<p>The American Geriatrics Society explained to the NY Times that elderly people are &quot;more susceptible to heatstroke because the thirst sensation dulls with age, and the ability to perspire decreases,&quot; not to mention other factors like medications being taken, income and isolation.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063249/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/06/11/2008-06-11_citys_heat_wave_leaves_6_dead.html">ME&apos;s office also said</a>, &quot;We are investigating other deaths to determine if they were heat-related.&quot;  </p>

<p>NJ utilities report that only (!) 20,000 homes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063249/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/06/20000_still_in_the _dark.html">are still without power</a> (there are about 150 Con Ed customers without power). Overall, the weather was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063249/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/nyregion/12heat.html?ref=nyregion">much more bearable yesterday</a> as temperatures were in the mid-80s and the humidity was in the 50% range; today&apos;s weather will be similar: high of 85, humidity at 64%.</p>
