<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106115812/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/10/10/teen-falls-down-elevator-shaft/">Residents told 1010 WINS</a> that kids were known to hang out at the building, &quot;The kids are in here all the time; they hang out, they party and everything in there. They need security here 24 hours, not just one guy.&quot;</p>

Originally named the Samuel R. Smith Infirmary, it was later renamed Staten Island Hospital and expanded with additional structures. When the hospital moved to Seaview Avenue in Ocean Breeze in the 1970s, the 17-acre property fell into disrepair... According to Advance records, there&apos;s a pending judgment of foreclosure on the property, which has accumulated millions of dollars in liens. Once those are foreclosed, the property will be sold.&quot;</p>
