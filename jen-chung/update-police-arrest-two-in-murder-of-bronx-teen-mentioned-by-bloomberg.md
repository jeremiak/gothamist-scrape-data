The NYPD&apos;s press office didn&apos;t have any further detail about the suspects arrested in Bryant&apos;s death, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspects-arrested-shooting-bronx-teen-article-1.1335318?localLinksEnabled=false">News says</a> that a tipster told cops that the pair were in Rhode Island.<p></p>

<p>Bryant&apos;s death was particularly senseless, and not just because police believe that he wasn&apos;t the intended target of the shooting. He had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/nyregion/alphonza-bryant-17-couldnt-escape-same-fate-as-slain-father.html">planned on being the first</a> in his family to attend college when he entered community college this fall. Bryant&apos;s father was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/slain-bronx-teen-alphonza-bryant-father-killed-nabe-article-1.1332803">killed just blocks</a> away nearly 14 years earlier.  But the slain teenager became a focal point in the city-wide debate on public safety when his name was invoked by Mayor Bloomberg in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/30/bloomberg_dont_mess_with_nypd_becau.php">a fiery speech</a> that defended the NYPD and assailed civil liberties organizations and the media.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 22, at around 8:15 p.m., Bryant and friends were outside a bodega at 1159 Fox Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cops-closer-alphonza-bryant-killer-article-1.1333940">According to the Daily News</a>, they were &quot;hanging out... when the two suspects casually walked past the group. The duo returned a few minutes later and sprayed nine bullets at Alphonza and his friends, striking the aspiring architect in the chest. Police sources said the gunmen were not aiming at Alphonza when they opened fire. Investigators think the shooters were targeting a Latin Kings member who was either standing near Bryant or had just left.&quot;</p>

<p>Bryant died at Bronx Lebanon Hospital that night. On April 30, Bloomberg slammed a bill that would prohibit the NYPD from stopping people based on their ethnicity and said critics should stop calling for an Inspector General to oversee the NYPD. The mayor then brought up Bryant:</p>

<blockquote>When police stop and ask a 17-year-old a question based on reasonable suspicion of a crime, there is outrage... Yet when a 17-year-old is standing on the corner near his home at 8:15 in the evening and gets shot and killed, there is silence.... After [Bryant&apos;s] murder, there was no outrage from the Center for Constitutional Rights or the NYCLU. There was not even a mention of his murder in our paper of record, the New York Times. All the news that&#x2019;s fit to print did not include the murder of 17-year-old Alphonso Bryant. Do you think that if a white 17-year-old prep student from Manhattan had been murdered, the Times would have ignored it? Me neither.</blockquote>

<p>The murder was briefly mentioned by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/the-gun-report-april-25-2013/">columnist Joe Nocera in a blog post</a>; the Times called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130502/longwood/mayor-calls-mother-of-murdered-teen-alphonza-bryant-cited-speech">Bloomberg&apos;s remarks  &#x201C;disingenuous.&#x201D;</a></p>

<p>Bryant&apos;s mother, Jenaii Van Doten, had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130501/longwood/mayors-unexpected-tribute-welcomed-by-mom-of-slain-bronx-teen?utm_source=feedly">welcomed the mayor&apos;s mention of her son&apos;s death</a>, &quot;We just thank him for putting it out there. That he was a good kid.&quot; She supports stop-and-frisk, but think it should be modified. </p>

<p>She has noted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509045753/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/mother-bronx-teen-killed-gunfire-supports-stop-and-frisk-article-1.1332752">her son had been stopped by police before:</a> &quot;I was on the phone with him. He said, &apos;There&#x2019;s four unmarked cars and they want us to come outside.&apos; I told him to get out his ID. They were telling him to get off the phone. I told him to tell the cops he was talking to his mother. I heard a cop tell him, &apos;I don&#x2019;t care, get the f--- off the phone.&apos; They told them to come out of the store and get up against the wall. They searched them and then they left. The cops never said what it was for.&quot; </p>

<p>Van Doten also wrote in the Daily News:</p><blockquote>Stop-and-frisks are random. Does it apply to every child that wears a hoodie? It should be modified &#x2014; it&#x2019;s not working the way they intended. Out of so many stop-and-frisks, how many people stopped have handguns? <p></p>

<p>Some people are saying stop-and-frisks are terrorizing our kids. Some kids need to be terrorized. Maybe my son wouldn&#x2019;t have been shot if the right kids were terrorized.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> According to an NYPD release, the two suspects are ages 21 and 23, and are being held on outstanding warrants in Cumberland, Rhode Island. Police say the 21-year-old has made &quot;statements implicating himself in the homicide&quot; while the 23-year-old has not. The release states that both men are residents of the Bronx and are members of the Latin Kings. </p>

<p>Detectives believe that Bryant was killed in a gang dispute, &quot;However, by the time the shooting occurred the intended targets were gone from the street corner and shots were fired at a different group of youths&#xA0;including Alphonza Bryant who happened to be there.&quot;</p>

<p>The two suspects will be transported to the Bronx tomorrow for a lineup by members of the Bronx Warrants Squad. </p>
