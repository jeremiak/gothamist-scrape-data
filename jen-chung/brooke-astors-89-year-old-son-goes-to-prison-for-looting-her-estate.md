<p>Nearly four years after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/brooke_astors_son_found_guilty_of_g.php">found guilty of grand larceny</a>, the elderly heir of one of NYC&apos;s most storied families was sent to prison. Anthony Marshall, the 89-year-old son of the late philanthropist Brooke Astor, was ordered to begin his one-to-three year prison term today. State Supreme Court Justice A. Kirke Bartley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/anthony_marshall_surrenders_sent_KWMFREobNwOfPdnXZSV74I?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">told Marshall</a>, who was escorted into court in a wheelchair, &quot;I take no pleasure in following my duties.&quot;</p>

<p>Marshall was convicted of manipulating his mother&apos;s finances to furnish himself and his wife with an extravagant lifestyle while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://gothamist.com/2006/09/07/son_may_have_mi.php">shorting Astor on her living situation</a>, leaving her in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/26/astors_scary_pl.php">torn nightgowns and dog urine-soaked couches</a> and making her think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/30/astor_trial_apartment_model_of_horr.php">she couldn&apos;t afford things</a>. His lawyer was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/28/brooke_astors_8.php">also convicted in forging Astor&apos;s will</a> to help benefit Marshall. What&apos;s more, the accusation of the elder abuse and estate mismanagement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/20/sons_astor_testimony_drives_anthony.php">came from Marshall&apos;s son Philip</a>. </p>

<p>After years of trying to unsuccessfully appeal the verdict (with one juror insisting she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/22/threats_against_juror_may_form_asto.php">was pressured into voting to convict</a>), Marshall was taken into custody.  The NY Times reports, &quot;Prosecutors said in court this week that correctional officials anticipated sending Mr. Marshall, who has Parkinson&#x2019;s disease and heart problems, to one of the state prison system&#x2019;s five regional medical units, which are similar to skilled nursing facilities on prison grounds. Before the allegations upended his life, Mr. Marshall worked in philanthropy and as a Broadway producer. He and his third wife, Charlene, divided their time between homes on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Northeast Harbor, Maine.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025805/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nyc-heir-89-may-go-prison-fri-theft-case">AP adds</a>:</p><blockquote>Marshall arrived in the courtroom in a wheelchair with his wife, Charlene, crying and caressing his shoulder. He declined to speak during the brief proceeding, looking downward but showing little reaction.<p></p>

<p>His wife, portrayed during the trial as a greedy social climber whose husband was preoccupied with providing for her, left court clutching a minister&apos;s arm.</p>

<p>&quot;My heart has been ripped out of my body,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote>Money that Marshall diverted from his mother was intended for charities. Manhattan DA Cy Vance said, &quot;I believe that the legacy of this prosecution will be that it raised public awareness of the silent epidemic of elder abuse.&quot;<p></p>
