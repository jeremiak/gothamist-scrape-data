According to WPIX:<blockquote>Hikind interrupted an interview Phelps-Roper was doing with PIX 11 News to slap the posters, saying &quot;Come on!&quot; Phelps-Roper shouted, &quot;Don&apos;t touch me! Don&apos;t touch me!&quot; while police supervisors grabbed the Assemblyman by the waist. &quot;How dare you have those signs!&quot; Hikind yelled. He then warned the Kansas group, &quot;Just be careful the rest of your day in Brooklyn.&quot;</blockquote><br>
Hikind also called Phelps-Roper a &quot;whore&quot; (you can see video below).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713030013/http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/72102/VIDEO-%26-PHOTOS%3A-Full-Report-On-Hate-Filled-Protest-By-Westboro-Baptist-Church-Outside-Brooklyn-Yeshivas%3B-Hikind-Rushes-Police-Lines-To-Grab-Signs.html">Yeshiva World News reports</a> that the Westboro protesters&apos; minivan&apos;s tires were slashed: &quot;They were seen a short while later getting their flat fixed at a local tire-repair shop. &apos;The only thing I&#x2019;m sad about, is that all four of their tires weren&#x2019;t slashed&apos;, Dov Hikind told YWN.&quot;<p></p>

<p>When the protesters arrived in Manhattan, one of the counterprotest signs they were were confronted with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713030013/http://nyunews.com/news/2010/10/11/12protest/">was &quot;God Hates Signs.&quot;</a></p>
