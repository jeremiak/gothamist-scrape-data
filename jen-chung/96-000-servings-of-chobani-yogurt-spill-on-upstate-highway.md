<p>You can&apos;t cry over spilled milk, but can you cry over spilled Greek Yogurt? Last night, a truck carrying 18 tons (36,000 pounds, 576,000 ounces, or 96,000 servings) of Chobani yogurt spilled onto Interstate 88 in Chenango when the driver &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516090046/http://www.wbng.com/news/local/Tractor-Trailer-Crashes-Along-I-88-151484495.html">got on the ramp to Interstate 81 too fast</a>. When it rounded a curve, the trailer slid over the embankment and spilled 36,000 pounds of yogurt on the shoulder and down the hillside,&quot; according to WBNG.  </p>

<p>The driver was cited for failure to reduce speed, improper lane use, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516090046/https://twitter.com/#!/coreykilgannon/status/202505501760688128">causing too many reckless puns</a>.</p>
