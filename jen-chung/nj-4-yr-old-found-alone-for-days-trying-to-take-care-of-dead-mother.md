	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_03_njtoddler.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104912im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_03_njtoddler.jpg" width="365" height="298"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Via PIX 11</i></div> Yesterday, police in Union Township made a startling discovery: A woman had died at least four days earlier&#x2014;leaving her four-year-old to fend for himself. And the child tried to care for her.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104912/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/03/union_township_boy_4_was_besid.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Star-Ledger reports</a>,  &quot;She was still in her bed, in the upstairs garden apartment with a brick facade and the dry lawn out front. He rubbed lotion on her fragile skin. The boy, all of 4-and-a-half years old, likely called on her to get up, feed and dress him.&quot; </p>

<p>Police think the victim, who was apparently in her 30s, died of natural causes. The cops had been called because maintenance crews at the apartment complex noticed a &quot;foul odor&quot; coming from the home. </p>

<p>The child seemed malnourished and dehydrated, but police described him a &quot;spunky.&quot; The boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104912/http://pix11.com/2013/03/26/malnourished-4-year-old-boy-found-alone-at-home-with-mothers-corpse/">told them that his fingers hurt</a>&#x2014;he made a police statement saying, &quot;There&#x2019;s plenty of food in the refrigerator, but I just can&#x2019;t open it.&quot;</p>

<p>The apartment may have belonged to the child&apos;s grandmother&#x2014;the Star-Ledger suggests the mother and boy came from New York to care for the grandmother, but when the grandmother broke her hip, she moved into another facility. A neighbor said the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104912/http://pix11.com/2013/03/26/malnourished-4-year-old-boy-found-alone-at-home-with-mothers-corpse">mother didn&apos;t seem well,</a> &quot;I know she was sick. I haven&#x2019;t seen the lady since January.&quot; </p>

<p>Police are trying to locate the grandmother and another relative in Brooklyn. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104912/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/26/police-little-boy-living-with-dead-mother-for-days-found-emaciated/">neighbor told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Very sorry for this boy and this lady &#x2014; very, very sorry.  For this boy, that&#x2019;s a tragedy.&quot;</p>
