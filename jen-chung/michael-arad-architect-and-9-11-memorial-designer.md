His design featured two pools in the footprints of the WTC&apos;s towers, with waterfalls cascading down their sides, and in January 2004, the design, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160916210019/http://www.wtcsitememorial.org/fin7.html">revised with landscape designer Peter Walker</a>, was chosen as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160916210019/http://gothamist.com/2004/01/07/wtc_memorial_design_selected.php">winning design</a>. Today, the Port Authority says the Memorial is slated to open on September 11, 2011, in time for the tenth anniversary.  We spoke to Arad, now a partner at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160916210019/http://www.handelarchitects.com/main.html">Handel Architects</a>, for a few minutes yesterday and asked about the long road the project has taken.  </em></p>

<p><strong>How are you spending [today, the 8th anniversary of the September 11th attacks]</strong>?  I&apos;ll be at the memorial ceremony at Zuccotti Park and then across the street to the memorial.  </p>

<p><strong>How does it feel with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160916210019/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/10/progress_at_world_trade_center_depe.php">80% of the steel installed at the memorial site</a>? </strong> It&apos;s fantastic, it&apos;s really great, as far as seeing construction take place on the site. There have been a lot of processes to get everything in place to move forward, but we&apos;ve really made huge progress in the last year and you really start to see the finish line.  We still have a ways to go before we open, but we have a firm deadline and we&apos;re going to meet it.</p>

<p><strong>I think that will be a relief to the survivors and victims&apos; families, but I also think there&apos;s a lot of public frustration with the lack of progress at the site overall&#x2014;especially with the dispute over the development of the rest of Ground Zero.  Just seeing that something is happening with the Memorial and Museum site, it&apos;s like a bright spot</strong>.  It definitely is.  Half of the original site is dedicated to the Memorial; I think when it will be complete, it&apos;ll change the equation and make the site feel much further along &#x2014;and the individual parcels yet to be developed, they won&apos;t be this collection of unfinished projects, but rather specific projects that&apos;ll move forward on their schedules.</p>
