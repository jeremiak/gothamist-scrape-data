<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/adorable_grey_seal_spotted_by_graci.php">adorable harbor seal spotted on East River rocks</a> near Gracie Mansion may have left, but the cute creature will forever occupy a place in our hearts.  One woman who was walking her dog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/mayoral_seal_for_real_WJKsFTnbjDvkul0CqcPQ2L">told the Post</a>, &#x201C;I saw him and for the first 30 seconds, I was just kind of frozen, thinking how cute he is.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, after hearing a report about a seal sighting behind Gracie Mansion, we asked the Mayor&apos;s office&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://twitter.com/#!/Gothamist/status/137545335819087873">via Twitter</a>&#x2014;if they could send us a picture, if in fact there was a seal.  The Mayor&apos;s office complied, tweeting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://twitter.com/#!/NYCMayorsOffice/status/137622144556347392">picture of the sunbathing seal</a>.  Rocker Ted Leo got into the act, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://twitter.com/#!/tedleo/status/137649268960919552">suggesting</a>, &quot;Brutally evict it! // RT @NYCMayorsOffice: Meet the new City seal! MT @Gothamist seal on rocks behind gracie mansion&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_11_gracie.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_gracie.jpg" width="640" height="406"> <br> <i>Via NY1</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The Riverhead Foundation said the seal seemed healthy and the estimated the one-year-old left after two hours.  While seals are familiar sights on the Hudson River (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/04/seal.php#photo-1">example 1</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/04/seal.php#photo-1">example 2</a>), a park ranger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/151046/harbor-seal-makes-rare-swim-up-east-river">told NY1</a> he hasn&apos;t seen one in the East River before, &quot;It looks healthy and you know, just out exploring, enjoying the sun today.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, and if you were wondering why the seal surfaced at the East River, the seal answered that question <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103103311/https://twitter.com/#!/eastriverseal">on Twitter (handle &quot;Not A Floater&quot;)</a>: &quot;Why the East River? C&apos;mon! It&apos;s easy schlepping to Russ &amp; Daughters and Acme Smoked fish. Have you seen me get around on land?&quot;</p>
