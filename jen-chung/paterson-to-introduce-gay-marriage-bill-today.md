										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_paterg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517120402im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_paterg.jpg" width="135" height="146" class="image-right"> </span>Governor David Paterson is expected to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517120402/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/new_yorks_gov_paterson_to_intr.html">introduce same-sex marriage legislation today</a>.  On Tuesday, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517120402/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/14/paterson_to_introduce_gay_marriage.php">word leaked of his plans</a>, he said, &#x201C;The timing was always right. It&#x2019;s just who is willing to take that step. And I am.&#x201D; (Of course, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517120402/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/nyregion/15marriage.html?em">NY Times</a> notes that the &quot;move allows him to lead on an issue that could prove defining in his governorship, which has so far been marked by political missteps and the crumbling economy.&quot;)  But don&apos;t expect Albany to do anything about the bill anytime soon&#x2014;though the Assembly has previously passed same-sex marriage legislation, it will probably be stalled in the State Senate.  State Senator Ruben Diaz (D-Bronx) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517120402/http://www.1010wins.com/pages/4210314.php">convening a meeting</a> to block the bill.  Diaz also thinks it&apos;s &quot;disrespectful&quot; to introduce such legislation when Archbishop Dolan is being installed this week.</p>
