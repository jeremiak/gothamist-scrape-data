</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/">Saturday Night Live</a> is opening its 36th season with alum Amy Poehler and too-hot-for-Sesame Street Katy Perry.  But for us, as much as we love Poehler (Knope is dope!), the real reason to watch is because Governor Paterson will be appearing on a show that has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/14/governor_paterson_on_snls_weekend_u.php">relentlessly mocked his apparent incompetence</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/25/video_governor_paterson.php">his drug use</a>, his extramarital flings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/10/video_snl_brings_in_love_gov_to_fle.php">his blindness</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/28/video_the_return_of_snl_governor_pa.php">problems in his administration</a> and much, much more. During his first appearance as Paterson, Fred Armisen said, &quot;<strong>I&apos;m a blind man who loves cocaine who was suddenly appointed governor of New York. My life is an actual plot from a Richard Pryor movie.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/15/gov_paterson_annoyed_by_snl_skit.php">was upset</a> when the first spoof of him aired in December 2008, because it depicted him stumbling around and walked into the cameras&#x2014;but only upset on behalf of other disabled people, &quot;I can take a joke. But only 37% of disabled people are working and I&apos;m afraid that that kind of third-grade humor certainly adds to this atmosphere... Let&apos;s just say I don&apos;t think it helped.&quot; His office issued a statement slamming the show as well (&quot;This particular Saturday&apos; Night Live&apos; skit unfortunately chose to ridicule people with physical disabilities and imply that disabled people are incapable of having jobs with serious responsibilities. The governor is sure that Saturday&apos; Night Live,&apos; with all of its talent, can find a way to be funny without being offensive&quot;).  Last year, Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/governor_paterson_offered_his_comed.php">offered to go on SNL</a>...when his approval rating was 20%. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210549/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/paterson-returns-to-saturday-night-live/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Arts Beat says</a>, &quot;No word on whether Mr. Paterson will go head-to-head with his &#x201C;SNL&#x201D; doppelg&#xE4;nger, Fred Armisen, or crack any jokes about New Jersey, a running theme of Mr. Armisen&#x2019;s skits (though not of Mr. Paterson&#x2019;s actual tenure in office).&quot; Also, Paterson&apos;s spokesperson wouldn&apos;t confirm the appearance, but wouldn&apos;t deny it either.  We figure Paterson wants a chance to go on the show before he leaves office.</p>
