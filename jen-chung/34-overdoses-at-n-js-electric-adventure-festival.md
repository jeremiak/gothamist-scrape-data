</div></div>					<p>This past week was the first time that the Electric Adventure music festival was held in Seaside Heights. It might also be the last, after it marked its Jersey Shore debut with numerous overdoses and over 40 arrests.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014957/http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/08/04/electric-adventure/13577085/">According to the Asbury Park Press, no one died</a> from the ODs. &quot;In addition, there were 42 adults and juveniles arrested on the beach at Grant Avenue. Twenty adults were charged with drug-related offenses and the remaining 15 on disorderly persons charges, said Detective Steve Korman, a spokesman for the borough police department. Three of the juvenile arrests were for drug related-charges and the remaining four were disorderly persons charges, he said.&quot;</p>

<p>Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014957/http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2014/08/police_42_arrests_24_overdoses_at_electronic_music_festival_in_seaside_heights.html">said</a>, &quot;This was the first time this concert was held in Seaside Heights and the prosecutor is not happy with the way this event went down and we don&apos;t know whether we want it back there. Law enforcement was advised of this event on Wednesday, three days before the show and we did not receive intelligence reports or any kind of pre-notice about the types of issues they usually have at these concerts.&quot;</p>

<p>Organizers of the Electric Zoo in NYC are planning on making attendees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014957/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/05/electric_zoo_drug_psa.php">watch a two-minute anti-drug PSA before entering</a> after last year&apos;s event ended early <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014957/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/electric_zoos_last_day_cancelled_du.php">due to molly-related deaths</a>. </p>
