<p>Yesterday morning, around 11 a.m., there were reports of a motor vehicle accident involving an entrapment on 8th Avenue at 11th Street in Park Slope.  It turns out an out-of-control livery cab <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404191730/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/09/19/2010-09-19_4_hurt_as_cab_slams_pedestrians.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">jumped a curb and hit a total of four pedestrians</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404191730/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/breaking-does-anyone-know-how-to-drive-in-this-gd-neighborho.html">F***ed in Park Slope wearily asks</a>, &quot;DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE IN THIS GD NEIGHBORHOOD?&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily News reports that the cab first grazed 75-year-old Fred Guitterez who was trying to cross the street; he said, &quot;The driver came speeding down here like a demon. I could tell he lost control of his cab.&quot;  Then the cab went onto the sidewalk, hitting three other people. An older man was among the victims and Guitterez said, &quot;I could see the bone coming out his leg. He was just screaming in a pool of blood until help came.&quot; </p>

<p>While the News says that he and the other two pedestrians struck on the sidewalk were taken to Bellevue with non-life-threatening injuries, some commenters on FIPS suggested that the older man&apos;s leg was severed (perhaps due to how the injury looked?) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404191730/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/breaking-does-anyone-know-how-to-drive-in-this-gd-neighborho.html#comment-78954357">one described the incident</a>, &quot;The cabbie hit the back of the VW which was parked in front of that orange car at such a high rate of speed that the force of it spun the VW onto 180 degrees onto the sidewalk. A man was caught between the two cars and his leg was severed. A woman was hit by the front of the taxi and was seriously injured.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver was not charged.</p>
