<p>A 1 train rider was punched and stabbed in the back yesterday afternoon in Harlem. One account <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227222417/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/man-30-knifed-assailant-brawl-nyc-subway-station-article-1.2981705">suggests that the victim had been trying to calm</a> his attacker down, while other reports say the pair were fighting.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on a train that was pulling into the 145th Street station at Broadway. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227222417/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Stabbing-West-145-Street-Hamilton-Heights-Manhattan-414745963.html">According to NBC New York</a>, &quot;Two men reportedly clashed on the 1 train as it was approaching 145th Street and Broadway just before 5 p.m., and when the train pulled into the station, the fight carried over to the platform, where the 30-year-old victim was stabbed in the back, police said. &quot;</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman told us the victim said he was punched twice in the face and then stabbed in the back three times. </p>

Instead of taking it easy, the suspect whipped out a sharp object and stabbed the victim twice in the lower back around 4:30 p.m., authorities said.&quot; A source said, &quot;Nothing preceded it.&quot;</p>

<p>Police are investigating the incident. At this point, the suspect is described as being 6&apos;2&quot; and 180 pounds, wearing a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227222417/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Stabbing-West-145-Street-Hamilton-Heights-Manhattan-414745963.html">green jacket, hat and glasses.</a>&quot;</p>
