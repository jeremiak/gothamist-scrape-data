<p>Hours after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer promised that the House of Representatives would vote on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326163141/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/23/what_to_expect_from_todays_house_he.php">Republicans&apos; American Health Care Act</a>, the House Republicans ended up canceling their attempt to repeal Obamacare. House Speaker Paul Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326163141/http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/325690-house-expected-to-pull-obamacare-vote-from-schedule">said</a>, &quot;I spoke to the president a little while ago and I told him the best thing I think to do was to pull this bill and he agreed with that. I will not sugar coat this, this is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard.&quot;</p>

Ryan told reporters that his advice to Trump was to cancel the vote. But the reality is that Ryan and his leadership team had been bleeding votes all day and were not close to passing the American Health Care Act. The speaker went to the White House and told Trump as much just an hour earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously, it wasn&apos;t just Democrats who opposed to the bill&#x2014;too many Republicans were against it, for various reasons, for it to pass. For example:</p>

<p>Trump addressed the no-vote at the White House just now; from the pool report:</p><blockquote>&quot;We were very very close. It was a very tight margin. We had no Democratic support,&quot; the President said in his opening statement. &quot;I&apos;ve been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode. It&apos;s exploding right now.&quot;<p></p>

<p>He mentioned Arizona, Tennessee, and Kentucky specifically as states which are experiencing a rise in premiums.</p>

<p>&quot;We couldn&apos;t quite get there, we were a small number of votes short,&quot; Trump said. &quot;There are many people who don&apos;t realize how good our bill was.&quot; He said the people don&apos;t realize how good the bill was because they didn&apos;t realize there were two legislative phases to go. </p>

<p>&quot;If [Democrats] got together with us, and got us a real health care bill, I&apos;d be totally okay with that. The losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because they own Obamacare. They 100% own it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;They have Obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. </p></blockquote><p></p>
