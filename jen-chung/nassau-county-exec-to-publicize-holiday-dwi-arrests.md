										<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112914im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_05_licrash.jpg" class="left">Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi is going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112914/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-podwi0524,0,1555614.story">release information about everyone arrested for a DWI or DUI</a> over this holiday weekend.  Names, addresses, and mug shot photographs will be sent to local newspapers, with the request the papers print the information--all in an effort to shame people into not drinking and driving.</p>

<p>Suozzi has been very upset by the incident where a Nassau County police officer suffered grave injuries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112914/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/19/long_island_cop.php">after a drunk driver plowed into his cruiser</a>, right after he had pulled over a different drunk driver, on the Long Island Expressway last weekend.  Officer Kenneth Baribault, 30, is in critical condition and had undergone many surgeries.  The drunk driver who hit him had a NY suspended license, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112914/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/19/long_island_cop.php">somehow still managed to get a license in NJ</a>.  </p>

<p>A Hofstra Law professor told Newsday it is constitutional, &quot;<strong>We want to use the criminal law to deter others from committing crimes. Shaming individuals -- which Suozzi is attempting -- serves the same function</strong>.&quot;  Suozzi, who also announced more police patrols this weekend, said he and other officials will review how this public release of DWI arrestees works before deciding whether to continue it.  </p>

<p>And the owners of Triple Crown hopeful Big Brown, Michael Iavarone and Richard Schiavo, held a press conference to say they will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112914/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-lidwi0524,0,4050573.story">donate a portion of the horse&apos;s potential Belmont Stakes earnings</a> to Baribault&apos;s family to ensure the future of his 6-year-old son.  </p>
