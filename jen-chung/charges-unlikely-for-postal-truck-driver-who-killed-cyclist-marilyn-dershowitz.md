The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605182959/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/no_charges_likely_in_deadly_postal_eDIuvmsRofCIiTzr8VLlMK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">NYPD&apos;s sources tell the Post</a> &quot;they did not anticipate charges being brought against driver Ian Clement.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>Dershowitz, a lawyer and a retired court-appointed referee,  and her husband, Nathan Dershowitz, brother of famous lawyer Alan Dershowitz, were biking to the West Side bike path on West 29th Street near Ninth Avenue when the 7-ton truck hit her&#x2014;and the truck kept going.  Nathan Dershowitz, who had been biking ahead of his wife, was outraged, telling the Post, &quot;You cannot crash into a person on a bike and keep going.&quot;  He also spoke to the Daily News, &quot;If they did the work and spoke to the people I spoke to, it is inconceivable from what they told me that he did not see her... What I was told (at the scene) was that two vehicles, neither one was willing to yield to another, so they both went through too narrow of a space to get through She was ahead of both vehicles. The driver just ran her over.&quot;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605182959/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110704/chelsea-hells-kitchen/marilyn-dershowitz-funeral-scheduled-for-tuesday">DNAinfo reports</a> that police say she was biking <strike>against</strike> with traffic (the NYPD updated its information to say that she was in fact biking with traffic). <br>
