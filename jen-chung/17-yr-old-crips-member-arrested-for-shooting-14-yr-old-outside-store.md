The NYPD says two plainclothes police officers, part of the Queens Gang Unit, were driving by when they saw Christopher Chinloy fire. <p></p>

The quick thinking officer swung the unmarked car around and Chinloy, a known Crips member, started charging at the vehicle with the gun still in his hand, police said. Chinloy dropped the weapon and surrendered after the officers identified themselves, authorities said.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy was taken to Jamaica Hospital and was in stable condition.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503050916/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crips-gang-member-17-busted-teen-shooting-police-article-1.1027226?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News</a>, Chinloy, who has four prior arrests for gun possession, &quot;was charged with attempted murder, criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment and unlawful possession of marijuana.&quot; </p>
