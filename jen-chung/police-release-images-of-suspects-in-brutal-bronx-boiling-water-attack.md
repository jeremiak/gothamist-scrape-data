<p>Investigators are searching for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702235945/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/22/man_beaten_scalded_with_boiling_wat.php">three suspects accused of beating a man</a> on a Bronx sidewalk, and then apparently throwing scalding water on him.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 8:45 p.m., on Sunday, February 21st: A 50-year-old man was walking east on West Kingsbridge Road when, police say, &quot;two individuals walking beside him began a conversation with him. When the male approached the corner of Davidson Avenue the two individuals, alongside a third individual, began to attack the male. The three individuals repeatedly punched and kicked the male victim and also threw what appeared to be hot water on his face.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim, who may be a panhandler, was taken to Jacobi Hospital to be treated for second-degree burns. A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702235945/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/exclusive-bronx-man-beating-investigated-hate-crime-article-1.2539896">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;He&#x2019;s burned, really burned... He&#x2019;s pretty messed up. It&#x2019;s hard to believe that&#x2019;s just water,&quot; while a sidewalk vendor described, &quot;He was walking down the street. His face was white. All his skin was gone. He was yelling for someone to call him an ambulance.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released surveillance footage (below) and an image (above) of two suspects:</p>
