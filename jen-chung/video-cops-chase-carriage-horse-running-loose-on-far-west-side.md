<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> A group that wants Mayor de Blasio to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012542/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/12/de_blasio_promises_to_ban_nyc_carri.php">make good on his promise</a> to ban NYC carriage horses just released a video of a carriage horse on the loose near the Javits Center. According to NYCLASS, the horse &quot;ran away from a handler [and] bolted up 11th Avenue as police cars chased it, while shocked pedestrians and motorists looked on.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012542/http://nypost.com/2014/10/20/carriage-horse-runs-wild-through-nyc-streets">Post reports</a>, &quot;Witnesses told activists that the animal was being bathed when it dashed away from a handler and [NYCLASS Executive Director Allie] Feldman said Sunday morning&#x2019;s chilly temperatures were way too cold to be spraying water on the horses.&quot; </p>

<p>She also issued a statement saying, &quot;This is the latest example of why horse drawn carriages are not just inhumane but entirely unsafe in a city congested with cars, trucks and buses. It&apos;s time for the City Council to act and get the carriage horses off the streets of New York City.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Stephen Malone, a spokesman for the carriage driver industry, issued a statement saying, &quot;The horse is fine and back at work today. We thank the NYPD for its assistance in corralling the horse.&quot; A Teamsters spokesperson adds that the horse was not being bathed at the time it broke loose from its halter.<br>
