                            <p>Former Congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151127/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> has been keeping a low profile after his no-sex sex scandal&#x2014;he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151127/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/26/weiner_dines_with_wife_in_manhattan.php">maybe left a bad tip</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151127/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/24/weiner_nycs_worst_political_husband.php">buys crappy flowers</a>&#x2014;but he has one less thing to worry about: He sold the two-bedroom Forest Hills apartment he shares with his wife, State Department staffer Huma Abedin.  Of course, this is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151127/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/the_queens_apartment_where_weiner_s.php">apartment where he posed for a few self-portraits</a> so whoever buys it next will probably have to burn bushels of sage for cleansing.</p>

<p>The Forest Hills apartment had been on the market for $449,000. Page Six adds, &quot;The randy former politician and his wife are hunting for a l<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729151127/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/anthony_weiners_wife_huma_abedin_is.php">arger space for their growing family</a>. Abedin and Weiner have been spotted strolling the streets of Manhattan together, while he was recently spotted at a TriBeCa building.&quot;</p>
