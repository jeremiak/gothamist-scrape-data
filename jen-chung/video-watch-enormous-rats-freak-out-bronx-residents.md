A concerned resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131104010919/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/rat-problem-at-morris-houses-in-the-bronx-20120117">contacted MyFoxNY about the situation</a>. The news crew spotted many, many rats&#x2014; &quot;Big ones... little ones... even babies&quot;&#x2014;as well as many burrows.<p></p>

<p>The resident, Rosa McBride,  called it an &quot;outbreak&quot; and an &quot;epidemic,&quot; explaining that while rats are familiar, this is the worst it&apos;s been, &quot;I do not come out at night alone. Someone has to escort me.&quot;  And McBride ran back into the building when she spotted rats.</p>

<p>Another resident said that the rats &quot;bit my kittens&quot; and one said that even though he&apos;s a grown man, seeing the rats makes him feel like a girl.  The Morris Houses are operated by  the New York City Housing Authority, which told MyFoxNY that they are trying to deal with the &quot;enormous challenge of exterminating the rats.&quot; But MyFoxNY &quot;did not see any rat bait traps or signs warning of poison on the ground.&quot;</p>
