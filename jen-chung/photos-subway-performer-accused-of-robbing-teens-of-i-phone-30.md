<p>Nearly a week after announcing that a group of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104757/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/f_train_attack_subway_dance_show_pe.php">subway dance show performers beat a F train rider</a>, the NYPD now says a subway dancer robbed two teens at the Union Square station.</p>

<p>According to the police, last Friday, at about 3:50 p.m., two 14-year-old boys were watching a street dance performer at the station. After he finished, the suspect lured the boys &quot;to an abandoned side of the &apos;L&apos; line platform&quot; and made them give him an iPhone and $30. Then he told the victims to get on a L train and leave. </p>

<p>The suspect is described as being 17-19 years old, about 5&apos;8&quot; in height and 170 pounds, with medium length black hair. He was last seen wearing a black hoodie jacket with white lettering and dark colored sweat pants.
