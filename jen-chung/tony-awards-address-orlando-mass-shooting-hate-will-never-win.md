<p>This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111823/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/photos_lin-manuel_miranda_danai_gur.php">evening&apos;s Tony Awards</a> is being dedicated to the victims of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111823/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tonys-awards-ceremony-be-dedicated-901879">Orlando mass shooting</a>, with the organizers saying, &quot;Our hearts are heavy for the unimaginable tragedy that happened last night in Orlando. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those affected. The Tony Awards dedicate tonight&apos;s ceremony to them.&quot; And at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111823/http://www.today.com/popculture/james-corden-gives-somber-orlando-shooting-tribute-tonys-hate-will-t97841">beginning of the show,</a> host James Corden said, &quot;On behalf of the whole theater community and every person in this room, our hearts go out to all of those affected by this atrocity. All we can say is you are not on your own right now. Your tragedy is our tragedy.</p>

<p>&quot;Theater is a place where every race, creed, sexuality and gender is equal, is embraced and is loved. Hate will never win,&quot; Corden said. &quot;Together, we have to make sure of that. Tonight&apos;s show stands as a symbol and a celebration of that principle.&quot;</p>

<p>When <em>Hamilton</em> creator Lin-Manuel Miranda accepted the Tony for Best Score, he read a sonnet:</p><blockquote>My wife&#x2019;s the reason anything gets done;<br>
She nudges me towards promise by degrees.<br>
She is a perfect symphony of one;<br>
Our son is her most beautiful reprise.<br>
We chase the melodies that seem to find us,<br>
Until they&#x2019;re finished songs and start to play.<br>
When senseless acts of tragedy remind us<br>
That nothing here is promised, not one day.<br>
This show is proof that history remembers,<br>
We live through times when heat and fear seem stronger.<br>
We rise and fall and light from dying embers<br>
Remembrances that hope and love lasts longer.<br>
And love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love<br>
Cannot be killed or swept aside.<br>
I sing Vanessa&#x2019;s symphony; Eliza tells her story.<br>
Now fill the world with music, love and pride.</blockquote><center><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111823/https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel">@Lin_Manuel</a> gave the best acceptance speech.
