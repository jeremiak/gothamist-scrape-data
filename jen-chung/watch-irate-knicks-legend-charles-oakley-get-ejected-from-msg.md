<p>Beloved former New York Knick Charles Oakley was arrested after an incident during Wednesday night&apos;s Knicks game against the L.A. Clippers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404201835/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/charles-oakley-removed-stands-msg-fighting-article-1.2967794">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Oakley was said to be yelling at James Dolan and was warned to stop, according to a source. He continued and was then asked to leave.&quot; An NYPD spokesman told Gothamist that Oakley assaulted three security guards in the process. </p>

<p>The incident occurred at 8:30 p.m. during the first quarter at Madison Square Garden. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404201835/http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18648763/former-new-york-knick-charles-oakley-arrested-being-escorted-madison-square-garden">ESPN reports</a>, &quot;Oakley, 53, appeared to shove security guards before they pulled him away from his seat behind the baseline. Fans chanted &apos;Oakley! Oakley!&apos; in support of the popular power forward.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404201835/http://nypost.com/2017/02/08/security-drags-charles-oakley-out-of-knicks-game-in-unreal-scene/">And from the Post</a>: Oakley &quot;appeared to get in a fight with a security guard. He pushed the guard and slapped his hand down, according to The Post&#x2019;s Fred Kerber. Footage shows Oakley, 53, yelling at security officials as a group of them pulled him by his jacket sleeves and out of the arena. As he was dragged out, Oakley was shouting, &apos;I didn&#x2019;t do anything!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The Knicks&apos; PR department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404201835/https://twitter.com/NY_KnicksPR/status/829503872628563970">Tweeted a statement,</a> &quot;Charles Oakley came to the game tonight and behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. He has been ejected and is currently being arrested by the New York City Police Department. He was a great Knick and we hope he gets some help soon.&quot;</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman said that officers responded to a call about a 54-year-old male causing a disturbance. Oakley was apparently asked to leave, but he punched three male security guards while he was being removed. The guards suffered minor injuries and Oakley is currently in custody at the Midtown South Precinct and charges are pending. </p>

<p>A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404201835/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/sports/basketball/charles-oakley-new-york-knicks.html?_r=0">told the NY Times </a> that it &quot;appeared that Oakley would be charged with third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, and that he likely would be issued a desk appearance ticket, which meant he would probably be released pending a court date.&quot;</p>

<p>The Times added that Oakley had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404201835/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/sports/basketball/charles-oakley-knicks-cleveland.html?smid=tw-nytsports&amp;smtyp=cur">previously noted his difficult relationship</a> with Dolan:</p><blockquote>He has, at different times, criticized the team&#x2019;s front office, coaches and resident stars. In 2010, he advised [LeBron] James to avoid signing with the Knicks in free agency, which hardly endeared him to the organization. He has also called James L. Dolan, the owner, a bunch of bad names.<p></p>

<p>Former teammates have encouraged Oakley to be more polite in his dealings with the team, but without much success.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The boss don&#x2019;t like me,&#x201D; Oakley said last week. &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t mind having a sit-down dinner with Dolan. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind cooking him dinner.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Might put something in it, though!&#x201D;</p>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I mean, I had at least 15 people try to set up a meeting. He won&#x2019;t meet. I want to sit down to talk to him. I want me and him in a room. And lock the door. Lock that door!&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I mean, he can have the police outside the door.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Last year, in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404201835/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/charles-oakley-calls-knicks-owner-james-dolan-bad-guy-article-1.2111428">interview with the Daily News</a>, Oakley called Dolan a &quot;bad guy&quot; and a &quot;motherf---er&quot;: &quot;Oakley said Knicks fans are the ones hurting these days, because Dolan&#x2019;s product stinks and fans are &apos;paying their money to watch&apos; terrible basketball.&quot;<p></p>
