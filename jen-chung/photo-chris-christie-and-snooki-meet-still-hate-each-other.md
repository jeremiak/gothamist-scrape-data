<p>NJ Governor Chris Christie has never made a secret of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094112/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/jersey_gov_still_trying_to_evict_je.php">his disdain for MTV reality hit</a> Jersey Shore, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094112/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/30/6_schoolyard_names_chris_christie_h.php">stars he&apos;s called &quot;losers&quot;</a> (he also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094112/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/christie_may_veto_420000_snooki_sub.php">blocked a subsidy</a> for the show&apos;s filming). However, yesterday the Today Show had Christie and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094112/http://www.today.com/entertainment/jersey-shore-cast-return-real-shore-its-amazing-6C10062277">Jersey Shore gang</a> on for different segment celebrating the re-opening of Hurricane Sandy-battered beaches&#x2014;and it was awkward backstage!  </p>

<p>It appears that Snooki was confronting Christie about his remarks, and he leans in towards her and is saying something like &quot;...somebody asked you my opinion?&quot; Then Deena Cortese tells &quot;I&#x2019;m from Jersey,&quot; and Christie replies, &quot;I know you are. I was talking about her.&quot; Cortese thanks him for his job with hurricane response, and he tells her that he appreciates that.</p>

<p>Then Snooki says to him, &quot;I just wanted to meet you, and just, hope you start to like us.&quot; She later Instagram a photographed and wrote, &quot;Getting told why we are bad for jersey. Amazing&quot;</p>

<p>Snooki&apos;s rep told E!, &quot;Nicole simply wanted to know once and for all why Gov. Christie dislikes the cast of Jersey Shore. The show brought the beloved summer destination a significant amount of revenue during its 6 seasons on MTV. Nicole loves, respects and admires her adopted state of NJ which she now resides in with her family.&quot;</p>
