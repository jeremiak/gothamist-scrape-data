<p>The man suspected of killing four people at a Long Island pharmacy&#x2014;and then stealing over 10,000 prescription drug pills&#x2014;has written a letter to Suffolk County Commissioner of Jurors Michael O&apos;Donohue, giving a perfectly reasonable explanation of why he wasn&apos;t able to serve his jury duty: &quot;I have recently (as of 23 Jun) been arrested, and am currently detained at Riverhead Correctional Facility on some very serious felony charges. I simply wished to relay this to you, so that I do not get into any further legal troubles.&quot;</p>

<p>The letter was dated June 29 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811083513/http://www.newsday.com/news/breaking/david-laffer-i-can-t-serve-jury-duty-1.3009035">Newsday reports that O&apos;Donohue received it yesterday</a>, &quot;O&apos;Donohoe confirmed that Laffer had been called to serve on jury duty, beginning June 28. He said his office would honor his request.&quot; O&apos;Donohue further explained that if Laffer had been out on bail&#x2014;he was denied bail&#x2014;he could have served; only those convicted of a felony are ineligible for jury duty.</p>

<p>The sister of one of his victims, Jennifer Mejia, an 18-year-old who set to graduate in the week after the killing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811083513/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/07/07/2011-07-07_i_dont_want_us_to_be_filled_with_hate.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">told the Daily News</a> that she didn&apos;t wash her sister&apos;s rosary, &quot;It still has some of her blood on it. This way she will always be with me. I wear it in her honor.&quot;</p>
