<p>Sabrina Malone, 27, had left her mother&apos;s house on Columbia Street on that Saturday night and was later spotted on surveillance footage at a Citibank in Brooklyn Heights. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102633/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9095773">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;After withdrawing some money, she texted her roommate to tell her she planned to take the bus back to their Bedford Avenue apartment. But she never arrived home and didn&apos;t show up for work Sunday at the Ikea in Red Hook.&quot;</p>

<p>Malone was in contact with her roommate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102633/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/51825582/ns/local_news-new_york_ny/#.UYweMZVQlbw">because they only had one key</a>. According to NBC New York, &quot;Police searched rooftops and elevator shafts in the neighborhood where Malone disappeared, but have found nothing. Calls to her cell phone go directly to voicemail.&quot;</p>

<p>Her parents and friends are worried, saying that this kind of behavior is not like her. Her mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102633/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/181785/police-search-for-missing-brooklyn-woman">told NY1</a>, &quot;We&apos;re trying to be strong. You may see a brave front right now, but inside, we&apos;re concerned, we&apos;re worried. We&apos;re parents. We don&apos;t know where our daughter is. We don&apos;t know if she&apos;s out there crying for help. We don&apos;t know if she&apos;s being held against their will. We don&apos;t know anything. As parents, we just want our daughter home safely.&quot;</p>

<p>Malone is described as being about 5&apos;3&apos; tall, 155 pounds, with brown eyes, long curly black hair and a tattoo on her hand. She was last seen wearing blue sneaker, a grey sweatshirt and grey jeans. Anyone with information in regards to this missing is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto Crime Stoppers&apos; website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102633/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to CRIMES (274637), then enter TIP577.<br>
