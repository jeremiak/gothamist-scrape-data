The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803123811/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/giuliani_daughter_arrested_for_shoplifting_44C4nogxRXxF55cJONBPUL"> Post reports</a> that the Harvard student &quot;was taken to Manhattan&#x2019;s 19th Precinct stationhouse for processing&quot; while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803123811/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/08/04/2010-08-04_caroline_giuliani_daughter_of_former_nyc_mayor_rudy_giuliani_busted_in_alleged_s.html">Daily News says</a> the 20-year-old &quot;was caught at Sephora about 3:30 p.m., sources said. Surveillance video is being reviewed by police.&quot;  A few years ago, it was reported that Caroline Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803123811/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/06/giulianis_daugh.php">was going by the name &quot;Caroline Hanover.&quot;</a></p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Will being a Giuliani pay off? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803123811/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/giuliani_daughter_arrested_for_shoplifting_44C4nogxRXxF55cJONBPUL">Post</a>&apos;s and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803123811/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/08/04/2010-08-04_caroline_giuliani_daughter_of_former_nyc_mayor_rudy_giuliani_busted_in_alleged_s.html">Daily News</a>&apos; sources say that Giuliani was caught shoplifting over $100 worth of items by store security and a salesperson.  The cops were called, but by the time they arrived, the store employees found out the lowly shoplifter was daughter of &quot;America&apos;s Mayor&quot; and, according to the Post, they &quot;apparently had a change of heart and declined to press charges. But by then it was too late, and the daughter of the man who built a reputation for being tough on crime was carted out in handcuffs.&quot; </p>

<p>A source said, &quot;It was captured on camera. At some point the store indicated they knew who she was and that they were not going to press charges. The DA will decide whether to decline prosecution or not.&quot; A witness in the store told the Daily News, &quot;She was a pretty girl with blond hair. She got carted off in cuffs by four cops, two were holding her really tight.&quot; (We bet if she needed her insulin shot, the cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803123811/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/03/diabetic_man_almost_dies_during_sub.php">would have let her have it</a>.) Hanover went to the 19th Precinct&#x2014; but Rudy Giuliani was not spotted&#x2014;and Caroline Giuliani was given a desk appearance ticket for &quot;petit larceny.&quot;</p>
