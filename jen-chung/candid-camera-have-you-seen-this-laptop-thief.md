<p>It&apos;s one thing to steal someone&apos;s laptop.  It&apos;s another to sign onto the laptop owner&apos;s social network and have the real owner&apos;s friend take a Webcam picture of you!  Suffolk County Crime Stoppers and East Hampton Town police released this image of a man&#x2014;plus an image of his bedroom&#x2014;who allegedly stole a laptop from a home over the summer.  </p>

<p>Over $30,000 of items, including laptops and jewelry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141020164548/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/police-east-hampton-burglary-suspect-photographed-by-webcam-1.2306284">were taken from a home</a> in East Hampton on July 29.  Then one of the victim&apos;s friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141020164548/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/09/21/2010-09-21_cops_hunt_laptop_thief_who_posted_photos_of_himself_online_using_the_computers_w.html">chatted him up and took these photos</a>.  Detective Christopher Anderson said, &quot;At this point, it is unclear if one or more persons committed the burglary,&quot; but added, &quot;At this point, we have every reason to believe he is in one form or another involved in the crime.&quot;<br>
