<p>The police released a distressing video showing a woman being viciously attacked at a F train station in Borough Park last month.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, on Saturday, March 9, 2013, at around 2:40 a.m., a 56-year-old woman who exited the southbound F at the 18th Avenue subway station was assaulted by a man. The video shows him grabbing her and eventually slamming her against a wall, preventing her from leaving. He then throws her to the ground, kicking and stomping on her, grabbing her purse. </p>

<p>The suspect fled with the victim&apos;s personal items. The victim suffered bruises and cuts.  </p>

<p>The suspect is described as a white or Hispanic male in his 20s and about 150 pounds. He was wearing a black hoodie with &quot;Alpha Phi Delta&quot; on the front and &quot;Stugotz and the number 27 on the back with black jeans, and black shoes.</p>

<p>Other people who use the station were shocked at the extreme violence, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161629/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/02/caught-on-video-man-beats-robs-woman-in-brooklyn-subway-station/">telling WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Just grab the bag and go. That&#x2019;s how I see it. You know, there&#x2019;s no need for punching and kicking. That&#x2019;s uncalled for.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto Crime Stoppers&apos; website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161629/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">www.nypdcrimestoppers.com</a> or by texting their tips to CRIMES (274637), then enter TIP577.</p>
