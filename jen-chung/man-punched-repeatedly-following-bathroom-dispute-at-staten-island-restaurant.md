<p>A restaurant patron who became enraged that someone else wanted to use the restroom he was occupying allegedly assaulted a fellow diner on Staten Island earlier this month. </p>

<p>The attack occurred on February 11th, around 11 p.m., according to the NYPD, who say that the 60-year-old male victim was &quot;punched... in his body and face while inside Max&apos;s ES-CA Restaurant, located at 1559 Richmond Road&quot; by two unidentified men.</p>

However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723061449/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/s-man-beaten-restaurant-bathroom-dispute-men-article-1.2977162">Daily News reports</a> that he &quot;jiggled a bathroom door to try to get [the person inside] to hurry up.&quot;</p>

<p>When the bathroom occupant emerged, he and another man allegedly started to attack Pucciarelli. Pucciarelli was treated for lacerations and bruising to his face at a nearby hospital.</p>

<p>Police released surveillance images of the suspects, who are described as being in their 30s or 40s.</p>

<p>A manager told the News, &quot;I&#x2019;m not even really sure what to say because it was a little bit crazy, and a little unorthodox. This isn&#x2019;t a place where there typically are fights. We don&#x2019;t have bouncers and security because this isn&#x2019;t that type of place.&quot; It&apos;s unclear whether Pucciarelli knew either of the men, according to the Post.<br>
