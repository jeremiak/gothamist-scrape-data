The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910085246/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07272008/news/regionalnews/nyu_laws_classless_wapfest_121824.htm">Post says that the cash-for-certain classes</a> marketplace was hot and heavy on the school&apos;s forums, with emails like &quot;WANT: Entertainment Law, Will Pay Cash&quot; and &quot;I really want this class. I don&apos;t have any classes to trade, so I&apos;ll rely on the old capitalist standby, cash.&quot;.  But Vice Dean Liam Murphy sent an email reminding students &quot;that trading class spots for money or goods, or offering to do so, is a violation of law school rules,&quot; but apparently it&apos;s been in practice for years.  One recent graduate explained, &quot;We believe in the free market, and we think that we should be able buy things that are valuable to us.  Our job is to find our way around rules.&quot;  Just think what the kids in joint JD-MBA programs are doing!</p>
