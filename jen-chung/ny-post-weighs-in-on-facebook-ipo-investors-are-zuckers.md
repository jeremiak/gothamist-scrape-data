<p>Yesterday, Facebook&apos;s much-ballyhooed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528001117/http://sfist.com/2012/05/18/whoops_facebooks_underwriters_had_t.php">initial public offered sputtered</a>, closing at $38.23, just 23 cents above it&apos;s offering price.  Which was red meat to the New York Post!</p>

<p>The investment banks underwriting the IPO were instrumental in propping up the price to avoid embarrassment.  As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528001117/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303448404577411903118364314.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;Morgan Stanley, which led the platoon of 11 Wall Street banks that arranged the listing, had to dip into an emergency reserve of around 63 million Facebook shares&#x2014;worth more than $2.3 billion at the offer price&#x2014;to boost the price and create a floor around $38 a share, according to people close to the situation. In successful IPOs, the reserve, known as the &quot;overallotment&quot; or &quot;green shoe,&quot; is used by underwriters to meet soaring demand but in this case, it was used to prop up Facebook&apos;s ailing share price.&quot;</p>

<p>But there&apos;s a silver lining: &quot;Still, at a market capitalization of nearly $105 billion by day&apos;s end, Facebook took its place among the nation&apos;s corporate giants. Its stock market capitalization makes Facebook bigger than computer firm Hewlett-Packard Co., and puts it in the same league as PepsiCo Inc.&quot;</p>
