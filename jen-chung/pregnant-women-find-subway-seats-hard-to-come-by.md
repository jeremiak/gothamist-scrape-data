She writes that while people are very nice to offer her seats when she&apos;s taking the subway with her now-born children, she wonders, &quot;<strong>Where were you people when I was pregnant? Oh, right. You were sitting comfortably in your seats. While I stood. In August.</strong>&quot;<blockquote>If anyone did give up a seat &#x2014; which, O.K., did happen, on days when there was a partial eclipse, a unicorn sighting and alternate-side parking suspended, or when I finally started asking for one &#x2014; the donors appeared in this order of likelihood: (1) older woman, (2) younger woman, (3) minority man.<p></p>

<p>A white man? Not on the list. Didn&#x2019;t happen. Not once. Oh wait, once. That guy with a Playbill from &#x201C;Jersey Boys.&#x201D; Not a local.</p></blockquote><br>
Of course, besides empathetic remarks from other women who have experienced similar behaviors, the comments range from &quot;i&#x2019;ve always given my seat to preggos. im white as they come: irish american&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106124016/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/complaint-box-subway-squatters/#comment-510433">link</a>) to &quot;<strong>You don&#x2019;t like rude men? Excuse me, darling, but then what are you doing here in New York, and taking the subway, no less? Next time, do yourself a favor and shell out the extra $$ for cab fare.</strong>&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106124016/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/complaint-box-subway-squatters/?apage=3#comment-510717">link</a>)&#x2014;and there&apos;s a share of &quot;<strong>In this country, it&#x2019;s still a choice to have a child. And if you choose that, you gotta take the bad with the good and not complain</strong>&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106124016/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/complaint-box-subway-squatters/#comment-510527">link</a>) and &quot;<strong>If you want to experience Mid-Western manners, come live in the Mid-West-you&#x2019;re welcome!</strong>&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106124016/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/complaint-box-subway-squatters/?apage=3#comment-510689">link</a>).  Some riders aren&apos;t sure if some women are pregnant&#x2014;while others say they are honestly too worn out from the day to necessarily notice who&apos;s standing around them, so please ask!<p></p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal&apos;s Jennifer Merritt<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106124016/http://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2009/03/23/pregnant-and-standing-on-the-subway/"> tackled the same issue</a>&#x2014;&quot;I just had the fourth day in a row where I stood much of the way on my 40-minute subway ride. I&#x2019;m 6.5 months pregnant-and it&#x2019;s obvious-and not a single person offered me a seat&quot; &#x2014; on a WSJ blog. The comments are <em>very</em> similar&#x2014;&quot;<strong>I&#x2019;ve seen pregnant (and not pregnant but apparently just fat) women tell off people who offer them seats, saying I&#x2019;m not disabled. You can&#x2019;t win.</strong>&quot;  The MTA says it&apos;ll fine people $50 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106124016/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/17/offer_up_your_seat_or_else.php">for not giving up seats to the disabled</a> (and pregnant women apparently qualify as short-term disabled), but how is that even enforced?</p>
