<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong> Excerpts from the presser below] After a NY State judge halted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604122939/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/judge_stops_bloombergs_soda_ban.php">NYC&apos;s effort to ban sugary drinks over 16 ounces</a>, Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s office announced that he would speak about the decision at 5:30 p.m. His remarks will be streamed on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604122939/http://NYC.gov/">NYC.gov</a>&#x2014;or you can watch it below (it&apos;s not live yet, but it will be!)</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> The press conference just wrapped up, with both Mayor Bloomberg and Corporation Counsel Michael Cardozo stating repeatedly that they are confident that the judge&apos;s ruling will be overturned. &quot;We knew...special interests would sue. That&apos;s America,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;We believe that the judge&apos;s decision was clearly in error.&quot; </p>

<p>One reporter pointed out the amount of political capital that Bloomberg needed to expend to pass the ban, but the mayor framed the discussion in terms of his role as a protector of the people. &quot;I didn&apos;t spend political capital...This is not a political capital thing this is one human being to another. I&apos;m trying to take on everything I can. My job is to do the best I can for New Yorkers...I&apos;ve got to defend my children and you, and do what&apos;s right to save lives. Obesity kills.&quot;</p>

<p>The mayor also dismissed the idea that a soda ban would hurt the bottom lines of soda slingers: &quot;We&apos;re talking about lives versus profits.&quot;</p>

<p>He continued, &quot;We all have an obligation to do what we can to help each other. Look in the mirror to say, what have I done to protect my family?&quot;</p>
