										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_04_taleyax2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000842im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_taleyax2.jpg" width="220" height="177" class="image-left"> </span>The family of a homeless man who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000842/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/24/people_ignored_homeless_man_dying_o.php">ignored by dozens of passers-by</a> as he was dying on a Jamaica, Queens street expressed their grief over his death and New Yorkers&apos; callousness. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000842/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hugo_wouldn_have_done_that_family_FKNTR0IUj3tsYhB5uSzfEL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Edwin Tacam told the Post</a> &quot;That shouldn&#x2019;t have happened,&quot; and said his cousin Hugo Alfredo Tale-Yax &quot;wouldn&apos;t have done that.<strong> It&#x2019;s not important who it is, if we see someone hurt, we should help, at least call an ambulance. Lend a hand</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that Tale-Yax was fatally stabbed around 5:40 a.m. after apparently intervening in an incident where a woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000842/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/19/homeless_man_fatally_stabbed_while.php">was threatened by a knife-wielding man</a>.  While Tale-Yax&apos;s confrontation with the attacker is not captured on surveillance video, video does show Tale-Yax stumbling down the street and falling&#x2014;and then pedestrians glancing at him and taking cellphone pictures of him for over an hour before firefighters arrived on the scene. The incident has prompted references to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000842/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Genovese">Kitty Genovese incident</a>&#x2014;where a woman was fatally stabbed in Kew Gardens and her neighbors ignored her cries for help&#x2014;and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000842/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">bystander effect</a>.</p>

<p>The Post reports that Tale-Yax was a &quot;Guatemalan immigrant [who] eked out a living working odd jobs, but he was recently out of work and lost his home in Queens.&quot; His body is being sent back to Guatemala where his parents live.  Tacam said, &quot;He lost his life trying to help someone else &#x2014; that&#x2019;s brave. I guess you could say he was a hero.&quot;</p>

<p>Police are looking for a suspect in the stabbing, a man around 5&apos;6&quot; with a medium build who was wearing a green shirt, dark pants and green hat.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000842/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/nyregion/25stab.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;The police were not sure if the woman knew what happened to Mr. Tale-Yax, but they said it was possible she knew the suspect. The police expressed hope that news coverage of the killing will prompt her to realize and identify the suspect.&quot;</p>
