<p>The police are hoping the public can help them identify a man accused of a public lewd act in a Bronx subway station. And there&apos;s video of him outside.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, last month, on August 21 at the East 183rd Street and Jerome Avenue subway station (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424141720/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/183rd_Street_(IRT_Jerome_Avenue_Line)">which has the 4 train</a>), a man approached a 17-year-old girl waiting for a train and exposed himself. The victim boarded the train and the suspect fled.</p>
