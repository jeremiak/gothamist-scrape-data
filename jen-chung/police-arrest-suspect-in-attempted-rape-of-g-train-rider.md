<p>According to the NYPD, a 21-year-old woman had exited a train at the Bedford and Nostrand stop at 9:30 p.m. last Thursday, March 14. A man offered to help her with her bag, and she accepted his help, and they walked up the subway&apos;s stairs to the street. The police say, &quot;While the two ascended the stairwell the suspect attempted to rape the victim. The victim screamed and the suspect fled.&quot; The police did have a video of the suspect from the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station.</p>
