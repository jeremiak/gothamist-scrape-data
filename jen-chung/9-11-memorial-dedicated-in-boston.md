<p>Dignitaries and families of September 11 victims gathered for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111013135730/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/09/logan_sept_11_m.html">dedication a 9/11 memorial</a> in Boston yesterday.  Before you wonder why a memorial is by a thruway, the memorial sits on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111013135730/http://www.massport.com/LOGAN/about_911Memorial_overview.html">property of Logan Airport</a>, where two of the hijacked planes started their flights--United 175 and United 11--before crashing into the World Trade Center.  </p>

<p>One woman whose husband died aboard UA Flight 175 told the Boston Globe, &quot;I didn&apos;t expect it to be as heart-wrenching as it was. <strong>We&apos;ve been to so many services and memorials, but this makes me realize that my memories are not buried as deep in my heart as I thought they were.</strong>&quot; The memorial, made of glass and steel, is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and was designed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111013135730/http://www.moskowarchitects.com/911.htm">Moskow Linn</a>.  It has the names of 175 victims inscribed in glass panels and the winding paths to the memorial are supposed to &quot;mirror the twisting flight paths.&quot;  The words &quot;Remember this day&quot; are also inscribed on a terrace.  </p>

<p>A man whose wife, a flight attendant, died on American Flight 11 said, &quot;There&apos;s some comfort here, but unfortunately it brings up the tragic events of Sept. 11.&quot;</p>
