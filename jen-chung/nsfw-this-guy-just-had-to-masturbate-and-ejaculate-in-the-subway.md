<p>Fine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629020001/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/etiquette.php">lady with the banana peel</a>, we forgive you. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629020001/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/photo_dont_take_up_subway_seats_wit.php">Lady moving her distressed table</a>? You&apos;re okay, too. Because those transgressions of subway etiquette are totally awesome next to this horrible demonstration of mankind: The jerk in an Eagles hat who masturbates TO COMPLETION on the train. City Councilman Peter Vallone&#x2014;your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629020001/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/councilman_lets_put_sex_offenders_f.php">Subway Pervert Wall of Shame</a> is sounding better and better!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629020001/http://www.GoingWithEddie.com/">Eddie Going</a> sent us this photograph, taken by Robert S.&#x2014;who also photographer the horrible next moment (<strong>extremely graphic and disturbing NSFW <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629020001/http://imgur.com/8AItrWQ">photo here</a></strong>). The subject did not seem homeless&#x2014;he apparently just needed a release right then and there... and then he wiped it on himself.</p>

<p>Finally, we dedicate this photograph to every one who has ever been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629020001/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/07/cops_r_train_pervert_used_fed_ex_en.php#comment-821967167">skeptical of subway pervert reports</a>&#x2014;you are very lucky to have never witnessed or been victimized by a subway pervert in action. And if you do witness or experience groping, grinding or indecent exposure, <strong>report it to a police officer or MTA worker</strong>... even if NY State&apos;s highest court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629020001/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/19/subway_pervert_grinding_ejaculating.php">doesn&apos;t think grinding or ejaculating</a> on a victim is a felony.</p>
