<p>The NYPD is trying to find the suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091522/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/30/burglar_exposed_himself_tried_to_ra.php">tried to rape a woman in her Brooklyn apartment</a> on Saturday, and released a video of him running down the street.</p>

<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091522/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-hunt-brooklyn-home-invader-release-video-suspect-article-1.3014731">told reporters</a>, &quot;We have video of him leaving. It&#x2019;s not the greatest, but we think if anybody knows him they&#x2019;ll be able to ID him.&quot; </p>

<p>Boyce also said, &quot;We&#x2019;re trying to get a sketch of him now.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident took place at 6:45 a.m. on March 25th, when the male suspect allegedly entered a 30-year-old woman&apos;s bedroom at an apartment building on Greene Avenue in Bushwick. Police say that he climbed through an open window via the fire escape, stood over the woman and exposed himself, then tried to climb into bed with her.   </p>

<p>The victim resisted, and the man fled through the apartment door, according to the NYPD. The victim&apos;s roommate also ran into her room when he heard her screams. </p>

<p>The suspect is described as being 18-22 years old, 5&apos;7&quot;-5&apos;9 tall and 120-140 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing dark jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt.<br>

<p>Apparently a beer bottle was found on the fire escape, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091522/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-hunt-brooklyn-home-invader-release-video-suspect-article-1.3014731">NYPD is reportedly going to check the DNA</a> against their database.<br>
