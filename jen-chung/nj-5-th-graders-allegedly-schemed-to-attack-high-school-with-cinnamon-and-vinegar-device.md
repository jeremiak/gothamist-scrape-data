<p>Five fifth-graders at a NJ elementary school were detained for apparently plotting to set off a non-explosive device during a field trip to the local high school. A spokesman for the Clifton Police Department, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155253/http://www.northjersey.com/news/police-plot-by-clifton-5th-graders-no-prank-but-device-found-was-non-explosive-1.1466084">Detective Sgt. Robert Bracken, said</a>, &quot;They didn&#x2019;t have the right equipment, but the intent was there. This is very disturbing.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155253/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/02/mtv_and_gen_z_can_go_2_hell.php">Founders</a>, amirite?</p>

<p>Apparently someone at Clifton Elementary School discovered the students&apos; written plans yesterday morning and contacted the police. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155253/http://www.northjersey.com/news/police-plot-by-clifton-5th-graders-no-prank-but-device-found-was-non-explosive-1.1466084">The Record reports</a>, &quot;The students from the Merselis Avenue elementary school were to attend an event at the high school, which was canceled following the discovery. Police discovered a device, which was not explosive and included a mixture of cinnamon and vinegar, Bracken said. This was definitely not a prank, the sergeant said, adding the children&#x2019;s intention was to carry out the plan.&quot;</p>

<p>Investigators believe they had &quot;outside help and got their ideas from other events,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155253/http://pix11.com/2015/12/02/five-5th-graders-arrested-after-teachers-discover-alleged-plan-to-cause-damage-to-new-jersey-school/">PIX 11 reports</a>.</p>

<p>The students, who are all 10 or 11 years old and included boys and at least one girl, were released to their parents. The Bergen County prosecutor&apos;s office is reviewing whether they will be charged.</p>
