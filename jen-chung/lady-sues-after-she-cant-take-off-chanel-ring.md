One Brooklyn woman is now suing Chanel because a ring she tried on got stuck on her finger.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130222034255/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/lawsuit_has_painful_ring_to_it_zvutpsWzYFNHMrm1Xwj5JK">According to the Post</a>, Rosy Mizrachi Gindi  &quot;claims a day of ring shopping at the swanky Chanel store on East 57th Street went from dazzling to horrifying when a sparkling diamond stunner got stuck on her finger. [She] had to be taken to the emergency room after staff at the store couldn&apos;t slip the ring off her hand.&quot; What, no tub of butter on hand?  Her lawyer Michael David says she was at the hospital for hours, &quot;where medical staff managed to get the ring off without cutting it.&quot; David adds the ring is worth &quot;at least $10,000. It could have been a lot more.&quot;  </p>

<p>Gindi is seeking unspecified damages.</p>
