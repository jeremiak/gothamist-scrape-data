										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_08_itzler.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160953im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_08_itzler.jpg" width="260" height="223" class="image-left"> </span>Jason Itzler has called himself the &quot;King of all Pimps,&quot; a nod to running a pricey escort ring (he even employed Ashley Dupre, who would later go onto to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160953/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/21/1_hooker_talks_about_client_9s_hook.php">&quot;escort&quot; Governor Spitzer</a>).  But he pleaded not guilty to selling cocaine, promoting prostitution and laundering money in court yesterday. And to top things off, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160953/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/09/09/2011-09-09_emancipated_member_jailed_pimp_of_spitzer_hooker_loses_pants_in_courtroom_at_arr.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Court officials were inquiring about the availability of a court-appointed lawyer as Itzler was being escorted to a side room, his hands cuffed behind his back. His jeans - which he was wearing sans belt for security reasons - suddenly slipped down to his ankles - forcing him to duck-walk off stage.&quot;  </p>

<p>Itzler&apos;s newest operation is allegedly &quot;Rockstar Models &amp; Partygirls&quot;&#x2014;and besides organizing a three-day, um, appointment at $19,500 at the Trump International Hotel for an unnamed john, Itzler is accused of selling $4,700 of coke to him. <br>
 <br>
Oh, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160953/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/king_appearance_all_pimps_drops_YUAdkPqQB9ilQIX1L9I5nL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME">Itzler cried and said</a>, &quot;I saved Billy Ray Cyrus&apos; life, that&apos;s what this is about.&quot;  The Post adds that on Thursday, Itzler was &quot;busted on West 14th Street -- wearing a fedora and carrying a trumpet he can&apos;t play, according to a law enforcement source.&quot; </p>

<p>Itzler, who  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160953/http://nymag.com/news/features/45119/">once told New York magazine</a> that Dupre had &quot;the most beautiful vagina in New York,&quot; previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160953/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/08/super_expensive_hooker_pleads_guilt.php">served time for money laundering and promoting prostitution</a>.</p>
