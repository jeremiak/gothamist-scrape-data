										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_lesbiansoci.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330081134im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_lesbiansoci.jpg" width="240" height="256" class="image-left"> </span>Finally, proof that Park Slope lesbians have all the fun, or at least some of the discounts: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330081134/http://www.brokelyn.com/only-in-the-slope-store-offers-lesbians-10-percent-off/">Brokelyn reveals</a> that maternity store Boing Boing has been offering a 10% discount to lesbian mothers.  Owner Karen Paperno &quot;says she has about one taker a day. She also fields occasional complaints,&quot; explaining, &#x201C;The lesbians love it and the gay males get upset. But their disposable income is so much higher than women&#x2019;s. Men just make more than women.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Paperno, who married to a man, doesn&apos;t think she&apos;s breaking any laws and says that she brought back the discount, which was first offered in the 1990s, &quot;as part of her push to be more personally involved with the store after its customer service took a drubbing on Yelp.&quot; (Here&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330081134/http://www.yelp.com/biz/boing-boing-brooklyn#hrid:1gjoQ7w218RWpwc6kys_eg">example review</a>.)  She told Brokelyn that she opened the store 15 years ago, &quot;My first day here I saw a big pin on the sidewalk for the Lesbian Herstory Archives and I thought, &#x2018;what a cool neighborhood,&apos;&quot; and she doesn&apos;t even demand that lesbian mothers offered proof that they are in fact lesbian mothers!</p>

<p>She adds, &quot;People have gotten upset but it&#x2019;s my store and I have the right to do it. I offer hardship discounts of all kinds, all the time. This is just one that I advertise.&quot; Just don&apos;t get Colin Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330081134/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/colin_quinn.php">started on this</a>.<br>
