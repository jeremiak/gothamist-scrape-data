<p>A 30-year-old man has been arrested after police officers found the remains of his 85-year-old grandmother in plastic bags in the bedroom of her Queens home.</p>

<p>The daughter of Erika Kraus-Breslin hadn&apos;t heard from her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012812/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/06/queens-elderly-woman-body-plastic-bags/">in five months</a> (the daughter lives out-of-state), so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012812/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Body-85-Year-Old-Grandmother-in-Bags-Grandson-in-Custody-396119091.html">she asked police officer</a>s to conduct a wellness check. The NYPD says that when officers arrived to the home at 67-08 65th Street in Ridgewood, they &quot;were met by a 30-year-old male who directed them to a bedroom, where they discovered the 85-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive inside of plastic bags.&quot; </p>

<p>EMS declared Kraus-Breslin dead at the scene. Christopher Fuhrer, 30, was charged with not reporting a death to a health officer, burial/body removal without permit, and improper burial. </p>

<p>The body appeared to be decomposing, but it&apos;s unclear how long the corpse was in the home. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012812/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-woman-85-found-dead-wrapped-plastic-bags-bedroom-article-1.2819745">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Fuhrer wrapped his grandmother&apos;s body in plastic after she died, then later covered her in a second plastic bag to cover the odor, police sources said. He later started using air fresheners to try to cover the stench.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Fuhrer may not have reported the death because he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012812/http://bigstory.ap.org/412fc91962cd496b8f9403f2ec094c89?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">worried about becoming homeless</a>. </p>

<p>Neighbors said that Fuhrer was supposed to be taking care of Kraus-Breslin; one said, &quot;She&apos;s lived there for like a thousand years.&quot;</p>

<p>The Medical Examiner&apos;s office is investigating the cause of death.<br>
