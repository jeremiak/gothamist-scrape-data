<p>A 63-year-old man was apparently carjacked and then killed when the thief drove into him earlier this morning in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The incident began near the intersection of 4th Avenue and 22nd Street around 9 a.m., when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203749/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/04/brooklyn-construction-vehicle-stolen-hit-run/">according to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The 63-year-old victim was loading something into his commercial vehicle when the suspect came up to him. The two got into a struggle and the suspect jumped into the vehicle, which was running, and took off.&quot; The victim reportedly owns A&amp;D; Iron Works on 24th Street between 4th and 5th Avenues in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The victim then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203749/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-dies-thief-steals-truck-runs-article-1.2587873">got into his own car</a> to chase the carjacker.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203749/http://nypost.com/2016/04/04/man-run-over-by-his-own-car-in-fatal-carjacking/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;The thief got a few streets away before getting stuck in traffic at 22nd Street and Fourth Avenue around 9 a.m. and the victim caught up with him, sources said. The victim ran up to the truck and was trying to pull the perp out of it when he was pushed to the ground, sources said.&quot; </p>

<p>Then the thief, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203749/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160404/sunset-park/man-fatally-struck-by-his-own-truck-while-chasing-carjackers-police-say">was apparently with an accomplice</a>, struck him with the truck. A witness told DNAinfo, &quot;The victim flipped up in the air about 8 feet. He hit the ground hard. The [driver] took off. He took the truck up 22nd Street the wrong way. People were diving out of the way.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect reportedly abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
