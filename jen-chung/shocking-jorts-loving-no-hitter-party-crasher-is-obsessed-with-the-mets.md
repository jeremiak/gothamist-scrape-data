<p>The ecstatic fan wearing denim jean shorts and a Gary Carter &quot;8&quot; jersey who rushed to the field to join <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150428/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/amazin_johan_santana_pitches_first.php#photo-1">pitcher Johan Santana&apos;s no-hitter celebration</a> is now officially infamous: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150428/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/02/video_mets_fan_in_jorts_carter_jers.php#photo-1">Jorts Guy</a> made it to the FRONT PAGE of the NY Post today!  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150428/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/met_fan_no_no_kdFMHC9HVbrfXAzdD7A2BL">The Post says Jorts Guy is Rafael Diaz</a>: &quot;A front-row seat at Citi Field: $315. Getting arrested for storming the pitcher&#x2019;s mound: a possible $1,000 fine and a year in jail.

<p>His sister told the Post, &quot;He&#x2019;s obsessed with the Mets. He goes to games all the time,&quot; while a neighbor said, &quot;I&#x2019;ve played Wiffle ball with him a few times in the yard. He plays pretty seriously.&quot; Also serious: Possibly being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150428/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/citi_field_streaker_so_sad_hell_nev.php">banned from CitiField FOR LIFE</a>.</p>

<p>As for Santana, he said he didn&apos;t realize there was a non-Met hugging him and other players until he saw the highlights.  </p>
