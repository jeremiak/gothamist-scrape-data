<p>Waiting to go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095448/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/tsa_lines_eternal_damnation.php">through the airport security checkpoint</a> is one of the most dreaded parts of taking a trip, right up there with everyone lining up to board the plane in Group 1. But though the Transportation Security Administration admits it needs to hire more staffers to handle the influx of travelers, the agency also wants to remind everyone that they are part of the problem&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095448/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/09/helpful_reminder_do_not_pack_throwi.php">guy with the throwing stars</a>, we&apos;re looking at you.

<p>Yesterday, the TSA held a demonstration showing how quickly &quot;prepared&quot; travelers can pass through security checks compared with those who forget they packed their large water bottle or scissors. As you can see in this video, you could zip through in less than two minutes... or wait much, much longer if you&apos;ve got a gun.</p>

<p>According to the TSA, a few things are making security lines unbearable, such as a steady decrease of budgeted TSA staffers over the years; more robust screenings thanks to laxness on the part of the agency; and the spike in airlines charging for checked bags, prompting more travelers to bring carry-on luggage and testing the &quot;one carry-on, one personal item&quot; rule. </p>

<p>To address these issues, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that the number of TSA officers and canine teams would be increased, plus the agency would expand outreach to enroll more people in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095448/https://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck">TSA PreCheck</a>; work with airports and airlines to make lines more efficient (like having bins returned to the front) and ensure passenger carry-ons are limited; and get Congressional sign-off to accelerate hiring and increase overtime.</p>

<p>However, traveler advocacy group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095448/http://www.globalgatewayalliance.org/">Global Gateway Alliance</a> thinks Homeland Security and the TSA aren&apos;t taking enough responsibility. GGA chairman Joe Sitt (the head of real estate development firm Thor Equities) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095448/http://nypost.com/2016/05/12/its-your-fault-airport-security-takes-forever/">told the Post</a>, &quot;Blaming passengers won&#x2019;t solve the problem of unconscionably long security lines at our airports.&quot;</p>

<p>The TSA&apos;s demo about prepared vs. unprepared passengers comes days after the Port Authority demanded the agency add more staff, offering these all-too familiar statistics about how long the wait times have become: At JFK Airport, for people flying out between March 15 and April 15, 2015, the average wait time was 11.5 minutes, but it jumped to 20.9 minutes for the same period this year; the maximum wait time was 30 minutes last year and 55 minutes this year! </p>

<p>Until more staff is hired, the TSA is reminding travelers to follow the 3-1-1 liquids rule; to have your ID and boarding pass ready; give yourself two hours before your domestic flight and three hours before an international flight; and check the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095448/http://apps.tsa.dhs.gov/mytsa/cib_home.aspx">TSA&apos;s website</a> to see if you can bring that ceramic knife (spoiler: no).</p>
