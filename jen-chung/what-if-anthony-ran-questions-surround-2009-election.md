Anthony Weiner had run against Bloomberg instead.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131613/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1109/Bloombergs_rebuke.html">Politico reports</a> that when Weiner said last night that maybe President Obama should have stumped for Thompson, &#x201C;Maybe one of those Corzine trips could have been better spent in New York. Who knows?&quot; a White House official fired back, &quot;<strong>Maybe Anthony Weiner should have manned-up and run against Michael Bloomberg</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner decided in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131613/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/26/no_mayor_weiner_for_nyc_congressman.php">May not to run</a> for the job, explaining in a Times op-ed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131613/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/27/weiner_blames_mayoral_drop-out_on_b.php">Bloomberg&apos;s obscene wealth</a> had something to do with his decision.  Today, he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131613/http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2009/11/04/do-you-think-anthony-weiner-feels-bad-about-not-running-for-mayor">being called a coward</a>, though the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131613/http://www.observer.com/2009/politics/four-conclusions-come-about-closeness-mayors-race">Observer&apos;s Steve Kornacki offers up</a> some thinking about what could have happened if Weiner ran&#x2014;maybe he could have won, but it&apos;s &quot;not as automatic&quot; as one would think, because, among other reasons, with his campaigning, &quot;he also might have turned off more voters than Thompson ever did.&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131613/http://www.observer.com/2009/politics/bill-thompsons-moment">said last night</a>, &quot;Look, to some degree, Democrats need to look in the mirror. There are a lot of Democrats who voted to overturn term limits. There are a lot of Democrats who went and worked for and supported Republicans. I do think the Democratic Party in New York City--we have to do a better job, and I&apos;d like to be involved in helping to get that party back together.&quot; And about not running this year, &quot;I said when I dropped out that I did it for a couple reasons, and I think all of them have been redeemed.&quot;</p>
