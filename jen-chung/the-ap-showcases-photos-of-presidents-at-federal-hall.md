<p>This year, we have a presidential election, which makes it the perfect time for the Associated Press to share its photographs of presidents at Federal Hall. In its exhibit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120512000846/http://www.ap.org/Content/Press-Release/2012/AP-exhibit-The-American-President-due-at-Federal-Hall-in-Manhattan">The American President</a>, the AP is featuring over 80 photographs showing presidents from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Former President George H.W. Bush wrote an introduction for the exhibit, &quot;The men and women who have covered the White House for the AP dating back to the middle part of the 19th Century have truly had a &#x2018;front-row seat to history.&#x2019; Through their lenses, succeeding generations of AP &#x2018;photodogs&#x2019; have captured both the ecstasy and agony of the American Presidency, and contributed in important ways to the historical record of each administration.&quot;  </p>
