<p>The two explosions near the end of the Boston Marathon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217130016/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php#photo-1">killed three and injured over 130 people</a>. One of the most gruesome injuries photographed was that of a man whose legs were blown off.</p>

<p>Many of the distressing and graphic images have been posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217130016/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1cf8f3/another_angle_from_the_boston_cowboy_literally/c9fwwbl">here on Reddit</a>&#x2014;WARNING, they are EXTREMELY GRAPHIC. The man wearing a cowboy hat who helped and tried to stop the bleeding is Carlos Arredondo, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217130016/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/nyregion/01father.html">has protested against the war</a> after his 20-year-old son died during his second tour as a marine in Iraq.  He can be seen at around 1:50 of this video from the Boston Globe, trying to pull wreckage off people:</p>

Carlos Arredondo had been passing flags to a National Guardsman who finished the race when the bombs went off.  Soon, Arredondo would be using a flag to stop the bleeding, as seen in the AP photograph at right. He said he told the runner, &quot;Stay with me, stay with me.&quot;</p>

This is the latest update I have on him. Google Person Finder says he is alive but for all I know someone saw this and reported him as alive. Carlos Arredondo should never have to buy a drink in this town again.<p></p>

<p>EDIT: I didn&apos;t realize I could dive into the Google People Finder results. He was in the Boston Medical Center ER as of 23:20 UTC. Here is a photo of him from his facebook for verification: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217130016/http://imgur.com/iL68E0w">http://imgur.com/iL68E0w</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: Received word via facebook that he is in stable condition. Thanks all for sending him thoughts and well wishes.</p></blockquote>Arredondo also described the blast to reporters, saying that he rushed over and started bringing people to the medical tents (see video below and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217130016/http://www.necn.com/04/15/13/Activist-helps-those-injured-by-Boston-b/landing.html?blockID=837849&amp;feedID=11106">this video from NECN</a>):<p></p>

<p>His wife Melida notes how her husband is still shaking from the event and asked the question on everyone&apos;s mind, &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>Some history about Arredondo: He was so upset when the Marines informed him of his son Alexander&apos;s death in 2004, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217130016/http://www.leatherneck.com/forums/showthread.php?38388-Father-who-burned-self-after-son-s-death-becomes-citizen&amp;p=209140&amp;viewfull=1">doused the Marines&apos; van with gasoline</a> and also happened to (apparently) accidentally light it on fire with himself in it. Badly burned, he wasn&apos;t charged and went to his son&apos;s funeral on a stretcher. Arredondo, a Costa Rican emigrant, became a U.S. citizen in 2006.</p>

<p>In 2007, he erected a memorial to his son, including a coffin, in Times Square, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217130016/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/nyregion/01father.html">telling the NY Times</a>, &quot;Every day we have G.I.&#x2019;s being killed, and people don&#x2019;t really care enough or do enough to protest about how the war is going. Some people say I&#x2019;m dishonoring my son by doing this, but this is my pain, my loss.&#x201D;&quot;</p>
