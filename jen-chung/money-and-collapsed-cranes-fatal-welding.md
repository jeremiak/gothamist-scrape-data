Two people were killed and it turned out the crane had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150608/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/08/questions_about_4.php">damaged from a 2007 lightning strike</a> (the New York Crane Company had it fixed with welding). Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150608/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/31/2009-05-31_new_york_crane_was_warned_on_weld_a_year_before_collapse.html">the Daily News reports</a> that the Chinese company that did the welding wasn&apos;t confident of its abilities &quot;<strong>but relented after New York Crane coughed up more money.</strong>&quot;  RTR Bearings told New York Crane its welding technique &quot;is not good&quot; and a testing firm found (a month before the crane collapse) that RTR&apos;s work on another piece of New York Crane equipment was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; The News also found memos showing an Ohio firm saying it could weld the crane in 28 weeks for $120,000, while &quot;RTR said it could do the work in 80 to 90 days for just $21,710.&quot;  RTR ultimately &quot;repaired&quot; the crane and New York Crane apparently didn&apos;t re-inspect it, simply put it to work at the UES site.</p>
