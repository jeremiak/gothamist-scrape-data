<p>Marina and Kevin Krim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035044/https://www.facebook.com/lululeofund/posts/527025490716766">posted on Facebook</a>, &quot;We are very excited to share with you that Felix Harrison Krim, all 8 pounds, 10 ounces, and 21.5 inches of him, arrived today. Marina, Felix and all of us are healthy and happy. Thank you all so much for your support!&quot; </p>

<p>On October 25, 2012, Marina Krim had returned to her home with 3-year-old daughter Nessie, because nanny Yoselyn Ortega didn&apos;t bring Krim&apos;s other children, 6-year-old Lulu and 2-year-old Leo, to a class. Krim entered her darkened apartment and found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035044/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/uws_nightmare_mom_discovered_childr.php#photo-1">Lulu and Leo stabbed in the bathtub</a>, with Ortega apparently trying to stab herself. The children both died while Ortega survived her wounds and was charged with murder. Ortega has pleaded not guilty and claims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035044/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/killer_nanny_i_didnt_do_it.php">&quot;someone else&quot; killed the children</a>.</p>

<p>September 30 would have been Leo Krim&apos;s third birthday; the family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035044/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=522037834548865&amp;set=a.376410852444898.92056.376332855786031&amp;type=1">posted a photograph of Leo on his second birthday</a>, noting, &quot;Celebrating Leo&apos;s second birthday seems like it was yesterday. We spent it last year doing some of our favorite fall activities: picking apples and pumpkins in the Hudson Valley and picnicking on a rustic picnic table and eating cider donuts. That day, we said that we would celebrate his birthday this same way each year. So today, September 30th, we kept up this beautiful birthday tradition. The echo of Leo&apos;s little voice saying &quot;picking apples&quot; and the memory of his little brown hands grasping those apples will always remain with us. Happy third birthday, Lito!!!&quot;</p>
