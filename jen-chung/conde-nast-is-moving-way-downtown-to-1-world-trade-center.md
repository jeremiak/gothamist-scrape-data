<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013335/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/a_vogue_idea_conde_nast_considers_m.php">rumored/speculated</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013335/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/nyregion/04conde.html?hp">NY Times reports</a> that Cond&#xE9; Nast signed a tentative deal to moves its magazines to <strike>Freedom Tower</strike> One World Trade Center: &quot;The 1,776-foot-tall skyscraper will be the tallest building in New York when it is completed in 2013. If the deal goes through, employees of Cond&#xE9; Nast &#x2014; publisher of Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Vogue and 15 other magazines &#x2014; would move in 2014 from their current home in Times Square.&quot;  </p>

<p>Currently, 1WTC is at 32 floors&#x2014;there will be 69 floors of office space total&#x2014;and it&apos;s just one piece of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013335/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/world_trade_center_site_progress_vi.php">massive development</a>.  Apparently Cond&#xE9; Nast told its employees in a memo that it was working on the deal &quot;but a final decision was several months away.&quot; A few months ago, the Observer spoke to some insiders at Cond&#xE9; Nast magazines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013335/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/why_conde_nast_might_move_to_creepy.php">who were not excited about moving </a>to Ground Zero:  &quot;The place is a cemetery. It&apos;s creepy,&quot; and &quot;There&apos;s not one person from editors on down who wants to move down there. Even people who could walk there don&apos;t want to move there.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Carl Weisbrod, who was the founding president of the Alliance for Downtown New York and is currently the President of Trinity (Church) Real Estate, tells the Times, &quot;<strong>It would provide sorely needed diversity to Lower Manhattan&#x2019;s economy and would be the vanguard of a broader shift of creative companies from Midtown to the south</strong>.&quot;  Hey, remember when Vanity Fair (a Cond&#xE9; Nast magazine) editor Graydon Carter declared that &quot;Irony is dead&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013335/http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-27-2001/irony-is-dead">video</a>) after the September 11, 2001 attacks? </p>
