<p>As North Korea continues to mourn its late leader Kim Jong-Il, it seems that his young son will not be as powerful as his father:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161539/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/21/us-korea-north-exclusive-idUSTRE7BK0FX20111221">Reuters reports</a>, &quot; North Korea will shift to collective rule from a strongman dictatorship after last week&apos;s death of Kim Jong-il, although his untested young son will be at the head of the ruling coterie, a source with close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing said.&quot;</p>

<p>Reuters says the source, who &quot;has correctly predicted events in the past, telling Reuters about the North&apos;s first nuclear test in 2006 before it took place,&quot; says the military &quot;has pledged allegiance to the untested Kim Jong-un, who takes over the family dynasty that has ruled North Korea since it was founded after World War Two,&quot; and that a coup seemed unlikely. </p>

<p>U.S. intelligence officials, which has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161539/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/kim_jong-ils_body_lies_in_state_as.php">worrying about the unstable situation in North Korea</a>, have reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161539/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/world/asia/cautious-approach-to-north-korea-by-us-and-south-korea.html?_r=1&amp;hp">reached out to North Korea </a>.  And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161539/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-boosts-internal-security-has-troops-on-alert-south-korean-intelligence-suggests/2011/12/21/gIQAiXTY8O_story.html?hpid=z4">Washington Post reports</a>, &quot;Seoul&#x2019;s National Intelligence Service believes the North is now focused on consolidating Kim Jong Un&#x2019;s power and has placed its troops on alert, according to South Korean parliament member Kwon Young-se.&quot;</p>

<p>North Korean media <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161539/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16282021">claims that 5 million</a> came out to mourn Kim Jong-il&apos;s death.</p>
