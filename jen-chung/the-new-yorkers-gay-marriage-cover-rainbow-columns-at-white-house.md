<p>Artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114359/http://www.bobstaake.com/">Bob Staake</a> said, &quot;I am honored to be doing this cover. It&#x2019;s a celebratory moment for our country, and that&#x2019;s what I tried to capture. (I don&#x2019;t especially like those rainbow colors, but they are what they are&#x2014;I had to use them.) I wanted to celebrate the bravery of the President&#x2019;s statement&#x2014;a statement long overdue&#x2014;but all the more appreciated in this political year. We are on the right side of history.&quot;  </p>

<p>On the wrong side of history: North Carolina, whose voters just passed an amendment to define <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114359/http://sfist.com/2012/05/09/north_carolina_moves_backwards_with.php">marriage as between a man and a woman</a> and where a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114359/http://sfist.com/2012/05/11/lesbian_arrested_after_seeking_marr.php">lesbian seeking a marriage license was just arrested</a>.</p>
