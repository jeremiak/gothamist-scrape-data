<p>This weekend, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://sfist.com/2017/06/02/wonder_woman_soars_under_the_weight.php">critically acclaimed <em>Wonder Woman</em> movie adaptation</a> is breaking barriers and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-wonder-woman-soars-11m-thursday-night-1009743">a few box office records</a>. But some men are alleging that the balls-barred, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/25/alamo_drafthouse_wonder_woman.php">women-only screenings</a> of the film are breaking the law.</p>

<p>Last week, the Alamo Drafthouse announced women-only <em>Wonder Woman</em> screenings at its original location in Austin, Texas. Their popularity led Alamo to bring similar screenings for women and those who identify as women to other markets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/25/alamo_drafthouse_wonder_woman.php">including Brooklyn which sold out three screenings</a> that will benefit Planned Parenthood. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/27/watch_alamo_drafthouses_new_nyc-spe.php">famously lively movie theater chain</a> tweaked whiners who complained on social media that the screenings were discriminatory&#x2014;and that attracted the attention of Albany Law School professor Stephen Clark. </p>

<p>&quot;There was a vibrant argument happening on Facebook. But when the theater responded to complaints, they were pretty snide about it and willing to mock anyone who had a complaint and that really struck me,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/01/why-a-gay-law-professor-is-trying-to-shut-down-women-only-wonder-woman-screenings/?utm_term=.e42f5b53b565">he told the Washington Post</a>. And after looking at Austin&apos;s city code, he filed a complaint with a city agency. </p><blockquote>He alleged that the Drafthouse&#x2019;s women-only event &#x2014; as it was described in the theater&#x2019;s advertising &#x2014; discriminated against male customers based on their gender. Citing the theater&#x2019;s promise to staff only women at the events, Clark also alleged that the Drafthouse was illegally engaging in employment discrimination.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the principle of the thing,&#x201D; he told The Post. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a gay man, and I&#x2019;ve studied and taught gay rights for years. Our gay bars have long said that you do not exclude people because they&#x2019;re gay or straight or transgender &#x2014; you just can&#x2019;t do that for any reason.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;We have to deal with the bachelorette parties that come to the gay bar,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re terribly disruptive, but if you forbid women from coming to a gay bar, you&#x2019;re starting down a slippery slope. It&#x2019;s discrimination.&#x201D;</p></blockquote> Stacy Hawkins, a Rutgers University law professor, told the WaPo that &quot;the entire controversy could have been avoided with a simple tweak in the theater&#x2019;s advertising. &apos;Just eliminate &#x2018;no men welcome&#x2019; language,&apos; she said. &apos;You try to make sure you demonstrate this is an event for and about women and, most likely, men aren&#x2019;t going to show up.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>In addition to Clark&apos;s Austin complaint, right-wing personality Jack Posobiec filed his own civil rights complaint in New York City earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/869967787216842753">against Alamo Drafthouse and Carson Daly</a>. A spokesperson for the NYC Human Rights Chair and Commissioner Carmelyn P. Malalis told Gothamist, &quot;The NYC Commission on Human Rights does not comment on open or potential investigations.&#x201D; However, the Commission does detail <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/in-public-spaces.page">the NYC Human Rights Law on its website</a>, which does say &quot;It is against the City Human Rights Law for a public accommodation to withhold or refuse to provide full and equal enjoyment of those goods or services based&quot; on protected classes including age, gender, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. </p>

<p>On May 30, Alamo Drafthouse issued a statement, &quot;Obviously, Alamo Drafthouse recognizes &apos;Wonder Woman&apos; is a film for all audiences, but our special women-only screenings may have created confusion - we want everybody to see this film.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/05/26/a_theater_chain_was_criticized_for_its_all_female_wonder_woman_screening.html">Marissa Martinelli put it well on Slate</a>: </p><blockquote> It is, of course, very heartening to see so many men joining the fight for gender equality because a theater chain announced a handful of screenings dedicated to women&apos;s empowerment. I for one am confident that they will voice similar outrage when they learn that women only accounted for only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-Its-a-Mans-Celluloid-World-Report.pdf">29 percent of movie protagonists</a> in 2016, and I can&#x2019;t wait to hear how they plan to protest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071735/http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/10/19/jennifer_lawrence_bradley_cooper_and_compensation_why_aren_t_we_more_open.html">the disproportionately wide gender pay gap</a> that exists in Hollywood! Keep up the good fight, lads!</blockquote>No matter which <em>Wonder Woman</em> Alamo screening you go to, remember&#x2014;there&apos;s a special pre-show.<p></p>
