<p>On Tuesday, a police officer responding to a call about an emotionally disturbed man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130319/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/17/cop_stabbed_in_head_neck_in_east_ha.php">was stabbed in the head by the man</a>.  The knife, with a 3.5&quot; blade, penetrated Officer Eder Loor&apos;s skull and his brain.  Yesterday, Loor&apos;s neurosurgeon described him as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130319/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/nyregion/new-york-officer-stabbed-in-head-is-called-luckiest-unlucky-man.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">probably the luckiest unlucky man you could ever have.</a>&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:254px; "> <img alt="2012_04_loor.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130319im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_loor.jpg" width="254" height="338"> <br> <i>Officer Loor</i></div> According to Dr. Joshua B. Bederson, the knife went into Loor&apos;s temporal lobe.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130319/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/knife-rammed-nypd-officer-eder-loor-brain-sliver-leaving-blind-voiceless-paralyzed-dead-surgeon-article-1.1063995?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;If his middle cerebral artery was sliced open &#x2014; and the knife just nicked it &#x2014; the officer would have bled to death. The blade stopped just an inch from a section of the temporal lobe that controls speech, and another half-inch from the area that handles motor function. Doctors removed a blood clot and cleared pressure on the brain from welling blood.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>When Loor was stabbed, he took the knife out of his head.  His pregnant wife Dina said, &quot;Since he&#x2019;s an EMT, he managed to hold the pressure, and somebody on the street, I believe, handed him a towel.&quot;  Bederson wasn&apos;t thrilled that Loor took the knife out, &quot;I would have preferred to see the knife still in there&quot;&#x2014;according to CityRoom, &quot;because the blade might have been holding a lot of the damage in place, and because pulling it out performed a second slicing action.&quot;  Bederson added, &quot;Remember that famous adventurer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130319/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060905-irwin.html">who got stabbed in the heart by a stingray</a>? He died because he pulled it out himself.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect, Terrance Hale, 26, was charged with Attempted Aggravated Murder, Assault and Criminal Possession of a Weapon.  Police Commissioner Kelly had said that when Loor and his partner arrived at a building on Third Avenue and 107th Street, Hale was in the lobby. HIs mother&#x2014;who had called 911 because Hale is bipolar and wasn&apos;t taking his meds&#x2014; said he needed to go the hospital and Hale said he would go to the hospital by himself. Suddenly, he pulled a knife out and stabbed Loor.</p>

<p>Hale&apos;s mother was angry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130319/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/nyregion/new-york-officer-stabbed-in-head-is-called-luckiest-unlucky-man.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">when the Times spoke to her</a>, claiming &quot;she had called for an ambulance to help him, and not for the police. She also accused the police of mishandling the situation and displaying a lack of training for a sensitive domestic encounter, and said she planned to contact a lawyer.  &apos;They did not get backup, and they did not do their job right,&apos; Ms. Hale, 51, said. &apos;My son was not feeling well; he was sick and said he wanted to go to the hospital.&apos;&quot;  <br>
