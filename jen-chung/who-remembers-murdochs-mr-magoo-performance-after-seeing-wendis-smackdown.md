<p>Sure, Rupert Murdoch may have seemed out of it and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://gawker.com/5822752/rupert-murdoch-has-left-the-building">doddering</a> during his testimony about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://gothamist.com/tags/newscorp">phone-hacking scandal</a> that threatens his British (and possibly American) media empire, but maybe that&apos;s the point.  His biographer Michael Wolff made the point last night on Countdown With Keith Olbermann that Murdoch looked frail and one couldn&apos;t help but feel some sympathy for this 80-year-old billionaire media mogul whose, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/opinion/19nocera.html?ref=joenocera">as one critic complained</a>, &quot;Bill O&#x2019;Reilly-ed, Glenn Beck-ed Fox News has done a great deal to coarsen the political discourse.&quot;  </p>

<p>While shareholders found the testimony &quot;painful to watch&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303795304576456404294221010.html?mod=WSJ_hps_sections_management">because Murdoch seemed so old</a>, stock analysts were pleased with his and his son James&apos; performances, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/business/media/murdochs-caught-a-break-with-testimony-analysts-say.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">telling the NY Times</a>, &quot;This was the best day these guys have had in a really long time. No shoe dropped, no smoking gun was found, it all sort of sounded kind of contained.&quot; Internally, News Corp. executives were somewhat relieved, with saying, &quot;No one is despondent, no one thinks this went poorly... I wouldn&#x2019;t bet against those two.&quot;  And some are suggesting that Rupert Murdoch&apos;s playing dumb gambit was echoing legendary mobster Vincent &quot;The Chin&quot; Gigante, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/tina-brown-likens-rupert-murduch-to-gangster-who-pretended-to-be-nuts/">who faked mental illness</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/19/rupert-james-murdoch-gloss-defence">Guardian has a closer look at the pair&apos;s testimony</a>, which seemed very choreographed, what with Rupert&apos;s statement about this being the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/rupert_murdoch_this_is_the_most_hum.php">&quot;most humble day&quot; of his life</a>: &quot;Only once did Murdoch Sr stray from the pacific script, when he snarled against &apos;all our competitors trying to build up this hysteria&apos;. But he soon compensated with two extra PR gambits. He recalled his father as a heroic journalist, who had exposed the truth about Gallipoli (though cynics say Sir Keith fixed the evidence), and then he made a brilliant grab for the friendship of the committee by recommending Singapore&apos;s approach to clean politics, which would involve paying MPs $1m a year. They laughed. He smiled. That&apos;s PR.&quot;</p>

<p>And then there was the shaving cream pie-and-ensuing slap seen&#x2014;in slow-motion, on loop&#x2014;around the world, when a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/someone_tried_to_accost_rupert_murd.php">prankster hit Murdoch with a pie</a> and his much-younger wife Wendi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/rupert_murdochs_wife_also_shoved_sh.php">leaped to his defense</a>.  As New York&apos;s Gabriel Sherman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144232/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/gabriel_sherman_on_today_wendi.html">said on the Today Show</a>, it was great PR, &quot;It changed the entire narrative of the hearing.&quot;</p>
