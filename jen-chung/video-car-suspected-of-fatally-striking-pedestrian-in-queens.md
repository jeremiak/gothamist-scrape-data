<p>The police are hoping the public can give them information about a car that may have fatally struck a man in Queens. </p>

<p>On Thursday, at 5:10 a.m., police found a Jose Padilla-Argueta, 35, at 230 Place and Lancing Avenue. The unconscious man had multiple injuries and was bleeding heavily and EMS pronounced him dead at the scene. </p>

<p>His injuries suggested that he was hit by a car (although it&apos;s unclear where) and the NYPD says, &quot;A canvass of the area for video surveillance uncovered video of a light colored Volkswagen GTI, two door sedan, that was traveling east on Lansing Avenue to south on Conduit Avenue with substantial damage to the passenger side bumper, an unlit headlight, a caved in windshield and partial roof damage. The vehicle was last seen heading east on Sunrise Highway.&quot; The NYPD has video from South Conduit Avenue.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824091035/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/nypd-seeks-leads-hit-and-run-volkswagen-article-1.1416543">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Cops are working on several theories regarding the puzzling hit-and-run &#x2014; including the possibility that the driver hit Pedilla-Argueta in one location, dragged him into the car and then dumped him out of the vehicle on 230th Pl, the sources said. It is also possible, the sources added, that Pedilla-Argueta staggered from the point where he was hit to the spot where he fell, and was unable to continue on due to his injuries.&quot;</p>
