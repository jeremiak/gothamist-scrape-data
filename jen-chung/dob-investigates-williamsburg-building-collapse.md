<p>Yesterday afternoon, a three-story<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141044/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/29/building_collapses_on_conselyea_str.php"> building at 34 Conselyea Street in Williamsburg collapsed</a>, injuring four people&#x2014;three construction workers and a passer-by who went to the scene to help.  A neighbor, Jeff Wilser, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141044/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/29/2010-03-29_3_construction_workers_and_a_passerby_hurt_in_williamsburg_building_collapse.html">said of one worker who was trapped for 20 minutes</a>, &quot;He was in the there up to his neck. I saw his head sticking out of the rubble. We tried to dig him out until [paramedics] showed up.&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily News reports that the worker was taken to Bellevue Hospital in critical but stable condition; the others had minor injuries. Wilser also remarked that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141044/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/nyregion/30collapse.html?ref=nyregion">heard a boom</a>, &#x201C;We thought it was a planned demolition.&quot; But it wasn&apos;t: The workers, from China Perfect Construction, were apparently adding a fourth floor and Department of Buildings commissioner Robert LiMandri told the NY Times, &quot;Structural members must have been compromised for the structure to collapse in this manner.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The DOB said they would speak to China Perfect as well as the site&apos;s engineer, &quot;Contractors must be held responsible for their work... Violations with monetary penalties will be issued.&quot;</p>
