<p>Guess who has a case of the Mondays?  Everyone trying to travel to New Jersey via the Lincoln Tunnel&#x2014;things have slowed to a crawl because there&apos;s a tractor-trailer stuck in one of the NJ-bound lanes.  As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215202/https://twitter.com/#!/So_New_York/status/199508585179381760">one person Tweeted</a>, &quot;If thats yo truck stuck @ the Lincoln Tunnel yo ass need to start looking for a new job asap.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215202/https://twitter.com/#!/NotifyNYC/status/199502098772144128">city Tweeted</a>, &quot;Due to disabled tractor trailer, all NJ-bound traffic is temporarily suspended in the Lincoln Tunnel (MN/NJ), except for buses,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215202/https://twitter.com/#!/ChrisBlec/status/199501531970666497">one frustrated driver suggested</a>, &quot;Lincoln tunnel traffic.. Maybe it&apos;s time to think about filling the whole Hudson river in with concrete to make crossing easier!&quot; That&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215202/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/23/filling_the_hudson_river.php">not an original idea</a>!</p>

<p>FWIW, here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215202/http://www.panynj.gov/bridges-tunnels/lincoln-tunnel-traffic-restrictions.html">height restrictions for the tunnel</a>: 13 feet (and width limit is 8 feet, 6 inches).</p>
