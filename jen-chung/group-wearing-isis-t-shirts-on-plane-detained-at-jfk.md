<p>This is probably not a good time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013613/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/17/ny_man_isis_jihad.php">wear clothing with the letters &quot;ISIS&quot;</a> on it, but that&apos;s exactly what a group traveling on a plane to New York did today.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013613/http://7online.com/news/passengers-with-isis-t-shirts-detained-at-jfk/314528/">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;A group of about 10 travelers were briefly detained at Kennedy Airport because several of them were wearing shirts with &apos;ISIS&apos; written on them. And at least one of the passengers on Sun Country Airlines Flight 243 from Minneapolis to Kennedy Airport was carrying a bag with &apos;ISIS&apos; written on it.&quot;</p>

<p>After being questioned, they were released. WABC 7 adds, &quot;The ISIS shirts were apparently from an overseas travel agency.&quot;</p>
