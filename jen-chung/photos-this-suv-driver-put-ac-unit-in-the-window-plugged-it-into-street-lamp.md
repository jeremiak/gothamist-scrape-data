<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801143904/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/oppressively_hot_and_humid_today_co.php">oppressive heat wave</a> is basically over, but while we were in the thick of it, people got creative. A reader sent us these photos yesterday, noting, &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s so hot you just gotta install a window AC in your Explorer and hardwire it into a street pole.  For real.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, this appears to be an SUV on 17th Street and 10th Avenue in Manhattan (spy the Artichoke Basile Pizza on the corner and the IAC building in the distance) with North Carolina plates, a lot of chutzpah, a cooler, an orange traffic cone AND an Obama-Biden sticker. </p>

Because we&apos;d just want to make sure they can check ConEd&apos;s online tips for energy conservation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801143904/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/nyc_broke_all-time_peak_power_usage.php">like keeping the AC to 78 degrees</a>. </p>
