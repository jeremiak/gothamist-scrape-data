<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202219/https://twitter.com/Azi/status/468330510444662785/photo/1">NY Post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202219/https://twitter.com/Azi/status/468331218657091584/photo/1">Daily News</a> featured stories about NYC&apos;s First Lady Chirlane McCray on their front pages, focusing on her remarks to<em> New York </em>magazine, in which she discussed her struggle to balance a career and motherhood. Their crass repackaging of the interview now has Mayor Bill de Blasio demanding apologies from both tabloids, for his wife and other NYC moms. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202219/http://nymag.com/news/features/chirlane-mccray-2014-5/index3.html">McCray had told New York</a> about the birth of their first child, explaining, &quot;I was 40 years old. I had a life. Especially with Chiara&#x2014;will we feel guilt forever more? Of course, yes. But the truth is, I could not spend every day with her. I didn&#x2019;t want to do that. I looked for all kinds of reason not to do it. I love her. I have thousands of photos of her&#x2014;every 1-month birthday, 2-month birthday. But I&#x2019;ve been working since I was 14, and that part of me is me. It took a long time for me to get into &#x2018;I&#x2019;m taking care of kids,&#x2019; and what that means.&quot; Which the Daily News headlined, &quot;Didn&apos;t want to be a mom&quot; and the Post distorted into &quot;I Was A Bad Mom!&quot; for its cover.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202219/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/chirlane-mccray-discusses-personal-political-life-candid-interview-article-1.1797201">Daily News touches</a> upon other points from the interview, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202219/http://nypost.com/2014/05/18/chirlane-mccray-didnt-want-to-spend-every-day-with-baby-chiara/">Post&apos;s coverage proceeds straight to the bottom</a>: &quot;In a startlingly frank confession, Mayor Bill de Blasio&#x2019;s wife says she was unable to embrace motherhood and initially neglected Chiara, who last year dropped the bombshell that she was in treatment for abusing booze and pot... The disclosure &#x2014; bound to horrify most moms &#x2014; shatters the carefully crafted image of de Blasio&#x2019;s close-knit family, which helped vault him into office.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202219/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/nyregion/de-blasio-tells-tabloids-to-apologize-to-his-wife.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times notes</a> that de Blasio &quot;decided midday on Monday that he wanted to address the headlines, and ordered his aides to organize a question-and-answer session with reporters.&quot; He said, &quot;It suggests a tremendous misunderstanding of what it means to be a parent, what it means to be a mother... A lot of hardworking women in this city are offended. I think both The Post and The Daily News owe Chirlane an apology. I think they owe all of us an apology.&quot; It also suggests that the top editors at the Post and the Daily News have no clue what it takes to be a parent!</p>

<p>As Brooklyn Based&apos;s Nicole Davis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202219/http://brooklynbased.com/blog/2014/05/19/chirlane-mccrays-shocking-confession-shes-an-honest-mother/">wrote</a>, McCray&apos;s remarks are &quot;honest. Show me one mom who can spend every day with her child and not go insane. I don&#x2019;t know one. Little kids will drive you bonkers. I just got back from four days away from my kids and it was heaven. I haven&#x2019;t had a better trip in I don&#x2019;t know when, and I love my little buggers to death.&quot; </p>
