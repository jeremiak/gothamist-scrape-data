<p>A memo o<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141923/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/document-outlines-a-failed-senate-deal/">utlining a (now failed) power sharing deal</a>!

The State Senate Democrats are delivering an end-of-the-year bonanza of insanity for all of us good boys and girls!  Or maybe it&apos;s because we were bad?</p>

<p>Democratic leader Malcolm Smith, who announced earlier this week he was willing to cede control of the Senate to Republicans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141923/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/10/state_senate_leadership_up_in_the_a.php">instead of agreeing to the demands</a> of three dissident Senators (all Democrats), has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141923/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2008/12/no-coup-but-considerable-disco.html">not been overthrown</a> by other State Senate Democrats&#x2014;yet.  One senator told the Daily Politics&apos; Liz Benjamin, &quot;There is considerable discomfort. People are very upset,&quot; but Smith is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141923/http://www.politickerny.com/1034/smith-smiling-says-hell-have-32-votes">apparently confident Democrats</a> will still have the majority in the new year.  </p>
