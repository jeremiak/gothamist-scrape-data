<p>Whoa, Bill de Blasio better watch out&#x2014;Joe Lhota is closing the gap! Unfortunately for Lhota, he&apos;s still trailing by many, many points: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131014083939/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Mayoral-Poll-Bill-de-Blasio-Joe-Lhota-Marist--227261071.html">new NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll</a> shows that de Blaiso has 67% of voters&apos; support while Lhota has 23%. </p>

<p>Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said, &quot;This is a very lopsided contest. Joe Lhota hasn&#x2019;t gotten any traction to offset the Democratic registration advantage in the city.&quot; And forget about Adolfo Carrion, the Independent candidate&#x2014;he has 2% of the vote. Here are some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131014083939/http://maristpoll.marist.edu/1011-de-blasio-leads-lhota-by-44-percentage-points-in-nyc-mayors-race/">facts and figures from the Marist Poll</a>:</p><blockquote>- Two out of three &#x2014; 67% &#x2014; think de Blasio is better able to make the city more affordable for the average family.  19% have this view of Lhota, and 14% are unsure.
