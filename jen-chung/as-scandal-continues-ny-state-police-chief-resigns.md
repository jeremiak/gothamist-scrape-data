										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_02_harrycorbitt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_02_harrycorbitt.jpg" width="240" height="206" class="image-left"> </span>NY State Police Superintendent Harry Corbitt has stepped down from his position as the scandal surrounding the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/25/ny_times_gets_paterson_to_suspend_h.php">alleged abuse by a Paterson top aide</a> continues to grow. Governor Paterson and members of the State Police security detail assigned to protect him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/02/paterson_personally_directed.php">have been accused of pressuring</a> an alleged domestic violence victim into dropping her legal action against the aide, David Johnson. Of course, yesterday Corbitt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/23233/corbitts-out/">partly blamed the media glare</a> for his departure, &quot;It&#x2019;s very difficult, but when your character is being attacked every day and you really don&#x2019;t have a recourse to defend yourself. Any individual who is criticized constantly feels that pain. And in most cases there is some way to fight back. But in public service there is not. <strong>I&#x2019;m not an elected official, I&#x2019;m a public servant, I&#x2019;m a cop. A good cop.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>He added, &quot;So to continue to face that pressure, and even pressure from my family - the media showing up in my driveway - that&#x2019;s unacceptable. So for my own health and for my own sanity it&#x2019;s the right thing to do.&quot; And Corbitt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://www.ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/114539/state-police-head-to-retire-in-wake-of-paterson-scandal">said to NY1&apos;s sister station</a>, &quot;The real reason that I am retiring is two fold -- working as a superintendent in the office of superintendent there needs to be this public perception that the person serving in that position is trustworthy and forthright and has the best interests of the citizens of the State of New York in mind. This media firestorm has really destroyed my ability to function in that capacity.&quot;</p>

<p>Corbitt admitted to the NY Times that state troopers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/27/state_police_repeatedly_contacted_p.php">did contact </a>the girlfriend of Paterson aide David Johnson, after she called police to say Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/paterson_aides_ex_called_911_3_time.php">had assaulted her on Halloween</a> of last year.  Corbitt claimed that it was routine for  state troopers to be involved in a case that<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/nyregion/27day.html"> &quot;might attract media attention,&quot;</a> but others say that&apos;s untrue.  </p>

<p> Last week, Denise O&apos;Donnell, who oversaw the State Police,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413190610/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/25/ex-paterson_cabinet_official_state.php"> resigned claiming that Corbitt misled her</a> about the State Police&apos;s role in the incident, &quot;The fact that the Governor and members of the State Police have acknowledged direct contact with a woman who had filed for an order of protection against a senior member of the Governor&apos;s staff is a very serious matter. These actions are unacceptable regardless of their intent.&quot;</p>
