<p>Police hope the public can help identify a suspect wanted for a dastardly burglary at a Bronx church earlier this month. </p>

<p>According to police, at 2 a.m. on October 17th, a man entered the Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubi and Seraphim, at 1570 Walton Avenue, through a rear door. He then took &quot;an undetermined amount of money from the donation box along with jewelry (like a bishop&apos;s ring and chains) and crosses valued at over $35,000.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012314/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/burglar-steals-55k-worth-items-cash-bronx-church-article-1.1991029">Daily News reports</a> that the amount of money in the donation box was $20,000!</p>

<p>Police released surveillance video of the suspect:</p>

 <br>
The church&apos;s bishop, Tunde Aina, told the News the items were from many years of collecting: &quot;For you to come into a church and do such a thing, it&apos;s a sin. That is an abomination.&quot;</p>
