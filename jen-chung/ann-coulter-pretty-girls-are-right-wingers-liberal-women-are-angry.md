<p>Ann Coulter, the conservative pundit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://dcist.com/tags/cpac">spoke at CPAC today</a> and brought down the house by saying, &quot;<strong>I think all real females are right-wingers. And I can tell you that based on experience&#x2014;and my bodyguard will back me up on this&#x2014;all pretty girls are right-wingers.</strong> A pretty girl is walking toward your table, you know she&apos;s a fan.&quot;  And she had her theory about liberal ladies.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://gawker.com/5884090/ann-coulter-cpac-it-girl-all-pretty-girls-are-right+wingers">According to Gawker</a>, the provocative talking head explained that the &quot;feminist movement has set us back... <strong>The reason liberal women are liberal is because they have to date liberal men. As we&apos;ve seen&#x2014;from Bill Clinton and Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Anthony Weiner&#x2014;we see how liberal men treat women. If I were stuck with them, I&apos;d be angry too</strong>. And I&apos;ll take 69 cents on the dollar, or whatever the current feminist myth is about how much we make, just to never have to pay for dinner. That seems like a fair deal to me.&quot; Clearly, Coulter loves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/recession_tip_make_matchcom_suckers.ph">Jessica Sporty</a> and forgets Grade A Republicans like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/02/mark_sanford_spotted_on_2_train_to.php">Mark Sanford</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scandal">David Vitter</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ensign_scandal">John Ensign</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/09/rep_lee_resigns_after_leaked_craigs.php">Chris Lee</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://dcist.com/2012/01/gingrichs_ex-wife_newt_asked_for_op.php">Newt Gingrich</a>.</p>

Hip has nearly wrecked the country. Let&apos;s try square for a while.&quot; Um, didn&apos;t hip <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517052912/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1872229_1872230_1872231,00.html">come after stupid</a>? </p>
