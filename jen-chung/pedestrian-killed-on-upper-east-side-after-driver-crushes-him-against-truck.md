<p>An 85-year-old man was killed when a car pinned him against another vehicle in Manhattan yesterday morning.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the victim was crossing Third Avenue&#x2014;in the crosswalk&#x2014;at 71st Street from the east to west sides when a blue, four-door sedan &quot;was backing up on 3 Avenue and pinned the pedestrian against&quot; a parked, unoccupied box truck. Responding police officers found the victims with &quot;severe trauma to his legs&quot; and EMS took him to Cornell Medical Center, where he died.</p>

<p>The sedan driver remained on the scene and was also taken to Cornell for emotional trauma, police say. </p>

<p>There are no arrests at this time and the investigation is ongoing. Last month, a pedestrian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160511153655/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/02/pedestrian_killed_when_driver_backe.php">was killed on the Upper East Side</a> when a driver was backing into a parking space.</p>
