<p>According to the NYPD, just after midnight on Saturday, June 21, a 56-year-old man who was walking in front of 69-04 Roosevelt Avenue was punched in the face by an unknown man. The attacker fled.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Elmhurst Hospital where he is in critical condition. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626032326/http://7online.com/news/man-critical-after-random-attack-in-queens/133556/">WABC 7 reports</a> that he &quot;is in such bad condition that he is unable to speak, so police have been unable to interview him to get more details. They have been forced to rely on the friend.&quot;<br>
