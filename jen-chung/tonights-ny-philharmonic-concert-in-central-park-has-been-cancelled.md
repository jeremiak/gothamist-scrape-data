<p>Sigh: Due to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015730/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/14/heavy_rain_showers_and_thunderstorm.php">terrible weather expected today</a>, the NYC Parks Department&#x2014;consulting with the NYPD, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York Philharmonic&#x2014;has decided to cancel tonight&apos;s performance of the New York Philharmonic on the Great Lawn of Central Park.</p>

<p>The Parks Department said in a statement, &quot;The concert will not be rescheduled.  Public safety is our highest priority and the risk of significant weather requires the unfortunate cancellation of this outdoor event.&quot; The NY Phil already performed at the Great Lawn on Friday, as well as in Prospect Park on Wednesday, July 9 and Cunningham Park in Queens on Thursday, July 10. Tomorrow night&apos;s concert at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx is still on.</p>

<p>On the upside, at least you have to deal with the People With Enough Disposable Income To Ignore The Event They Didn&apos;t Paid For [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015730/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/10/do_shut_up_during_concerts.php">PWEDITITETDPF</a>]: </p>
