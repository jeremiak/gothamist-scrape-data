<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="010912amanda.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172402im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/010912amanda.jpg" width="365" height="285" class="image-left"> </span>After a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172402/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/03/si_teen_dies_after_stepping_in_fron.php">Staten Island teen died from injuries</a> sustained when she stepped in front of a bus, her relatives said that relentless bullying from classmates at New Dorp High School drove her to suicide.  But a source close to an investigation into Amanda Cummings&apos; death <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172402/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/suicide_bully_bogus_TxBAQtopgbYSuQCHWI0hPM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">tells the Post</a>, &quot;No one had any previous signs of her being bullied.&quot;</p>

<p>The police have been following up on the family&apos;s claims, but the teen had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172402/http://www.silive.com/eastshore/index.ssf/2012/01/classmates_return_to_school_af.html">holding a note</a>.  According to the Post, the police have been talking to numerous relatives and friends, &quot;A 15-year-old girl who had been friends with Cummings since the age of 3 told investigators that her friend fell hard for boys and took breakups very badly, sources said. She also said Cummings had recently been drinking and smoking heavily, the sources added... Another classmate, a 15-year-old boy, said Cummings had threatened to kill herself in the fall after a brief hookup ended, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post&apos;s sources also claim that Cummings had attempted suicide previously and, in her suicide note to a romantic interest who was involved with another girl, did not indicate she was being harassed.  </p>

<p>Still, Cummings&apos; family feels very strongly that she died because of other toxic teens.  Her mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172402/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/05/amanda_cummings_grieving_mother_to.php">wrote on Amanda&apos;s Facebook page</a>, &quot;This is to all you evil son of a bitches that picked on, talked about and threatened my baby. I HOPE YOU DIE and I HOPE YOU SUFFER.&quot;  State Senator Jeff Klein has also introduced legislation to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172402/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/new_cyberbullying_law_would_toughen.php">create stiffer penalties for cyberbullies</a>.</p>
