                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_04_cancermomfaker.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054747im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_cancermomfaker.jpg" width="300" height="208"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Susan Stillwaggon</i></div> A 35-year-old woman is in a psychiatric ward after her nefarious&#x2014;and depressing&#x2014;scheme was discovered: Susan Stillwaggon allegedly lied when she told told people (including her husband) that her nine-year-old son had stage 3 Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma and raised thousands of money from concerned friends. Her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054747/http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/04/25/camden-county-mother-facing-charges-in-cancer-scheme/">mother told a TV station</a>, &quot;I will just tell you that my daughter is sick, something snapped in her head, don&#x2019;t know what, that&#x2019;s why she is where she is so we can find out what&#x2019;s wrong,&quot;<p></p>

<p>The nine-year-old son, Nick, was apparently sick, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054747/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/20130426_Pennsauken_woman_charged_in_false_cancer_claim.html">Philly.com reports,</a> &quot;Police verified from medical records that the boy did not have the disease. Authorities said Stillwaggon pocketed at least $3,500 from the fund-raisers that friends and soccer parents in a township youth league held during the last two months. Duffy said police were trying to figure out the exact amount.&quot;</p>

<p>Stillwaggon, a resident of Pennsauken, NJ in Camden County and the mother of three other children, apparently convinced her family that the boy was ill. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054747/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mom_in_sick_scam_OvtkprPpBDO2XxYa1MgI1I?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">From the NY Post</a>: </p><blockquote>In February, Susan told [her husband Chuck] an exam found cancerous cells.<p></p>

<p>Chuck would come home from work and ask his wife about any developments, cops said.</p>

<p>She would list the doctor&#x2019;s appointments Nick had that day &#x2014; many of them lies, cops said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;d get his report when he came home, and mom would tell him of the doctor&#x2019;s appointments of the day and many of them were fabricated,&#x201D; Pennsauken Police Detective Sgt. Cheryl Duffy.</p></blockquote>And Nick supposedly wrote on Facebook, &quot;My stomach still hurts but I am trying to rest like mom says so I can go to my teams soccer games this weekend because they did something really special for me.&quot; However Nick&apos;s school contacted the authorities, because the boy didn&apos;t seem sick but his mother sent in a letter, allegedly from a hospital, about his condition.<p></p>

<p>Stillwaggon was charged with 3rd degree Theft by Deception, 3rd degree Forgery, 2nd degree Endangering the Welfare of a Child, 2nd degree Using a Juvenile to Commit a Criminal Offense.
