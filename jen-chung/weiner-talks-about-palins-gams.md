<p>The Observer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053308/http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/anthony-weiner-nice-legs">has video of Representative Anthony Weiner</a> trying to make a Sarah Palin joke.  But it&apos;s just terrible (and terribly sexist):  Referring to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053308/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/02/st_louis_showdown_biden_palin_debat.php">VP debate</a>, Weiner says, &quot;<strong>Undeniably, undeniably, we saw a vice presidential candidate who had nice legs. I won&#x2019;t dispute that.</strong>.. but we also saw a vice-presidential candidate who tried to explain her running mate&#x2019;s health care position.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Weiner&apos;s spokesman later emailed the Observer, &quot;It was a misguided attempt at humor and Anthony apologizes for it.&quot;  Other Weiner factoids: He dates the easy-on-the-eyes (and Hillary Clinton aide) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053308/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/28/huma_weiner.php">Huma Abedin</a> and wants to help <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053308/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/28/huma_weiner.php">international models get visas</a>.
