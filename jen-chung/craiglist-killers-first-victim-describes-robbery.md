										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_leffler.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160603211503im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_leffler.jpg" width="135" height="119" class="image-left"></span> The Las Vegas hooker who was robbed by a client procured via Craiglist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160603211503/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/25/48hours/main4968896.shtml">spoke to 48 Hours</a> about her harrowing experience. It turns out Tricia Leffler was attacked in a Boston hotel days before Julissa Brisman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160603211503/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/17/nyc_woman_killed_in_boston_hotel_cr.php">killed by her Craigslist massage client</a>, apparently the same man.  </p>

<p>Leffler said she met her client at the hotel elevator, &quot;When I first laid eyes on him, I was comfortable. Because it was, you know, just regular. Just a regular looking guy.&quot;  But once in the room, he pulled a gun and tied her up before taking her money and credit cards and erasing his number from her phone. Leffler said, &quot;He ended up taping my mouth... But I was noticing as he was doing it that he was not wearing gloves. So, I just let him put the tape on me.&quot; After the attacker left, she managed to twist out of the ties and call for help; the police took the tape as part of the evidence.  </p>

<p>Leffler also says, based on the surveillance pictures, that she&apos;s 100% sure the man suspected of Brisman&apos;s murder is her attacker, &quot;<strong>He was even dressed the same, wearing the same clothes.</strong>&quot; She added, &quot;<strong>I&apos;m not gonna be advertising on Craigslist anymore. Don&apos;t want to go through this again.</strong>&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160603211503/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/22/craigslist_killer_suspect_held_with.php">Suspect Philip Markoff</a> is being held without bail.  </p>
