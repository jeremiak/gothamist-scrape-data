And the suspect may be involved in a third incident from Thursday.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509024455/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/03/police-suspect-wanted-in-sex-assaults-of-girls-in-queens-linked-to-third-incident/">According WCBS 2</a>, a man in a tan van was following a 13-year-old girl for blocks after exposing himself. Police Commissioner Kelly said, &quot;The description is roughly the same&quot; as the description of the man in the Wednesday attacks.</p>

<p>In the first Wednesday incident, a man grabbed the buttocks of a girl sitting on her stoop; her 12-year-old sister yelled and the suspect ran away. A few hours later, he sexually assaulted a little girl in a driveway. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509024455/mailto:http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Sexually-Assault-Queens-Girls-7-Years-Old-Suspect-Surveillance-Police-205986021.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;The girl told police that while she was waiting for her friend to come back from retrieving a ball, the man came up to her and asked her if she wanted to play a game. He then forced her into the alley and told her to close her eyes and stick out her tongue before abusing her, law enforcement sources said.&quot; </p>

<p>One concerned resident told WCBS 2, &quot;I&#x2019;ve got two kids too, and I don&#x2019;t want the same thing that happened to the girl to happen to my kids.&quot; There is a $12,000 reward for the suspect&apos;s arrest and indictment. He is described as being in his 20s, about 6 feet tall, 160 pounds, with black hair, last seen wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt with white writing on the front, dark jeans and was carrying a purple back pack.</p>
