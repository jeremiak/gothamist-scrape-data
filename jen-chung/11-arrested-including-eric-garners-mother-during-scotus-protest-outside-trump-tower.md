<p>Police made eleven arrests last night as demonstrators blocked traffic outside Trump Tower to condemn President Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132039/http://dcist.com/2017/01/trump_gives_the_supreme_court_nomin.php">extremely conservative-leaning Supreme Court justice pick</a>. Among those arrested was Gwen Carr, the mother of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132039/http://gothamist.com/tags/ericgarner">Eric Garner</a> whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132039/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">death at the hands</a> of an NYPD officer sparked widespread outrage.</p>

<p>The protest had been planned before the nominee was announced by Trump at 8 p.m. on live television. Kirsten John Foy, Northeast Regional Director of the Rev. Al Sharpton&apos;s National Action Network, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132039/http://abc7ny.com/politics/11-arrested-in-midtown-after-protest-over-scotus-pick/1730960/" said<="" a="">, &quot;This is really about what America will look like for our children and our grandchildren. This fight for the Supreme Court is about America&apos;s future. We&apos;ve got fights about how America is going to look today, but this is about America&apos;s future, and that&apos;s why we&apos;ve drawn the line in the sand here.&quot;</a></p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132039/http://abc7ny.com/politics/11-arrested-in-midtown-after-protest-over-scotus-pick/1730960/" said<="" a="">

It&apos;s a public office for all of the people and he needs to represent all of the people.&quot;</p>

<p>Police moved in when the group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132039/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Mother-of-Eric-Garner-Among-11-Arrested-at-Trump-Tower-Protest-412378963.html">allegedly blocked traffic</a>. This news footage shows them in the street, fists raised:</p>

<p>Foy was also arrested, as was Sharpton&apos;s daughter Ashley. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132039/http://abc7ny.com/politics/11-arrested-in-midtown-after-protest-over-scotus-pick/1730960/">WABC 7 reports</a> that the arrestees were &quot;issued desk appearance tickets for disorderly conduct.&quot; </p>

<p>Sharpton&apos;s spokeswoman Rachel Noerdlinger said, &quot;In an act of civil disobedience and in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Eric Garner&#x2019;s mom and others were arrested tonight&#x2026;over President Trump&#x2019;s SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch.&quot;</p>
