<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023021113/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/u-s-considers-bethpage-building-to-house-undocumented-kids-1.8569385">Newsday reported</a> that the U.S. is &quot;assessing whether a former Grumman Corp. facility in Bethpage could be used to house some of the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who are streaming illegally into the United States across its border with Mexico.&quot; That news sent Long Island elected officials into a tizzy.</p>

<p>Rep. Steve Israel (D), Rep. Peter King (R) and Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano (R) expressed their opposition to the plan&#x2014;pointing out it&apos;s near a NY State Superfund site, the Bethpage Industrial Park (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023021113/http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/remediation_hudson_pdf/130003ou3rod.pdf">PDF</a>). Israel said, &quot;Unaccompanied children coming into our borders is a humanitarian crisis, but housing them in an industrial warehouse near a Superfund site is not a humanitarian solution,&quot; while King to the more Republican position:</p><blockquote>It is unacceptable for the Department of Health and Human Services to consider moving thousands of unaccompanied alien children from the southwest border to Long Island, especially to an industrial park in Bethpage.   The site itself is inappropriate to be used as a shelter, especially for children.  We are hearing that there could be as many as 99,000 children and minors brought illegally into the U.S. before the end of the year.  It is vital that the Administration find a solution to prevent the influx of these children, including sending a strong message that they will not be permitted to remain in the United States and that route into the country is extremely dangerous between the heat, terrain, and the criminal organizations controlling  the smuggling operations.  The Administration must look for solutions at the border and not transfer children across the United States.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023021113/http://news.yahoo.com/us-warns-undocumented-child-migrants-deported-211217475.html">According to the AFP</a>, &quot;US officials say they have detained more than 47,000 unaccompanied children trying to enter the country in the eight months ending in late May 2014 -- nearly twice the number detained in the 12-month period ending in late September 2013...[many] young migrants [are] fleeing gang violence and poverty in Central America, mostly Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson wrote in a Spanish-language editorial, &quot;&quot;To the parents of these children I have one simple message: Sending your child to travel illegally into the United States is not the solution... In the hands of smugglers, many children are traumatized and psychologically abused by their journey, or worse, beaten, starved, sexually assaulted or sold into the sex trade ... (and) there are no &apos;permisos,&apos; &apos;permits&apos; or free passes at the end. If your child is caught crossing the border illegally, he or she will be charged with violating United States immigration laws, and placed in deportation proceedings - a situation no one wants. The document issued to your child is not a &apos;permiso,&apos; but a &apos;Notice To Appear&apos; in a deportation proceeding before an immigration judge.&quot;</p>
