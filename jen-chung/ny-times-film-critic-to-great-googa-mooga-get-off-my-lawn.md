<p>A.O. Scott, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165808/http://movies.nytimes.com/movies/critics/A-O-Scott">NY Times&apos; film critic</a>, is generally a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165808/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRw4PAgUx2E">pretty even-tempered</a> guy, except when it comes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165808/http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/movies/thor-with-chris-hemsworth-review.html?ref=todayspaper">certain blockbusters</a>. But when it comes to huge, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165808/http://googamooga.com/">weekend-long food-and-music</a> festivals at Prospect Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165808/https://twitter.com/#!/aoscott/status/203880512698335233">Scott says this</a>: &quot;<strong>hey #GoogaMooga: EAT ME!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>You can read his Twitter for his GoogaMooga-related rants, but here&apos;s a sampling:</p>
