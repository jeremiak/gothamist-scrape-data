You basically have to be a member&#x2014;of a union, that is&#x2014;to gain access to the Subway sandwich shop that&apos;s opened up in the under-construction 1 World Trade Center (here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101843/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/world_trade_center_site_progress_vi.php?gallery0Pic=13#gallery">glimpse of it from a few months ago</a>).  It was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101843/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/23/subway_sandwich_shop_takes_to_the_s.php">lifted up last December</a> and will be elevated higher and higher as construction continues&#x2014;up until the 105th floor.<p></p>

<p>The unique on-site shop was opened because workers&apos; 30-minute lunch time actually run longer with workers waiting for construction elevators to ferry them up and down.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101843/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/nyregion/17subshop.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times visited and found</a> &quot;Richard Schragger, an accountant turned restaurant franchise owner, stood behind the cash register offering free cookies to his burly patrons on the first day of business.&quot; Shragger, who was &quot;visibly nervous in a structure seemingly hanging in midair,&quot; may later add lasagna, burgers and hot dogs to the menu, and maybe even Papa John&apos;s pizza.  </p>

<p>The contractor apparently looked at eight other companies as potential operators, but a local deli that &quot;won hands down based on taste&quot; wasn&apos;t able to work under the unique conditions: &quot;Subway won on the basis of its business and financial plan.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The Subway at the WTC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101843/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/27/world_trade_centers_sky-high_subway_1.php">closed in January of 2012</a>. Steel erector company DCM&apos;s Bill Grutta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101843/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20120127/REAL_ESTATE/120129899/1033">says the Subway in the sky was worth it</a>, &quot;It means we saved 90 rides on the hoist a day,&quot; but offered an opinion about the fare: &quot;The Subway food is fine. But these guys like something off the grill. They like a greasy steak sandwich or a greasy hamburger with fries.&quot;  Here&apos;s what it was like:</p>
