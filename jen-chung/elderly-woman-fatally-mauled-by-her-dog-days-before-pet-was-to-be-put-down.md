<p>A 75-year-old woman died after being attacked by her family&apos;s Great Dane-English mastiff mix in their Long Island City home. A neighbor said the woman&apos;s son, who was also injured, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217134428/http://www.amny.com/news/woman-mauled-to-death-in-her-long-island-city-home-by-english-mastiff-dog-she-adopted-nypd-says-1.13115056">came over for help</a> during the horrifying incident: &quot;He said, &#x2018;My mother was dying.&apos; It was really bad.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that officers responded to the home at  38-07 27th Street after midnight on Monday, February 13th, where EMS was treating Hermida, who was unconscious and unresponsive with &quot;trauma to her upper torso.&quot; She was taken to Weill-Cornell Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Rosa Ortiz, the neighbor who helped, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217134428/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170213/astoria/woman-killed-dog-mastiff-nypd">told DNAinfo</a> that when &quot;she entered Hermida&apos;s home, where she found the injured woman laying on the floor in the basement. She could hear the dog barking from another area of the house at the time, she added.&quot;</p>

<p>The dog was 160 pounds, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217134428/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/13/deadly-queens-dog-attack/">according to WCBS 880</a>, and neighbors said &quot;the family had already intended to put the dog down because it had killed a neighbor&#x2019;s dog two weeks ago... &apos;They switched the day, so they were going to take him this Wednesday to put him to sleep,&apos; neighbor David Lopez said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you put a large group of dogs together they have to be watched very carefully to make sure they aren&apos;t attacking one another and they really need to be under proper supervision,&quot; Jean Shafiroff, an animal advocate and ambassador with the American Humane Society, told WABC 7.</p>
