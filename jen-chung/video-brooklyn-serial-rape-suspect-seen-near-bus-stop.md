<p>Police released a video of a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151128003813/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/13/cops_seek_brooklyn_serial_rape_susp.php">suspected in three Brooklyn rapes earlier this month</a>. In each incident, the suspect chats up the victim before luring them to an isolated location where he rapes them. In this video, the suspect is seen approaching a B12 bus shelter near Albany Avenue and Rutland Road, apparently talking to someone.</p>

<p>Then, another man in light clothing goes and talks to the suspect&#x2014;the police want to speak to the second man in hopes of identifying the suspect. </p>

Investigators obtained video from cameras near the bus stop, and the woman and another victim identified the man in the camouflage clothing as the rapist.&quot;</p>

<p>The rapes occurred near Albany Avenue and Fenimore Street on April 4 and near Remsen Avenue and Farragut Road on the morning of April 11 and near Midwood Street and Schenectady Avenue on the evening of April 11. City Councilwoman Letitia James told the Times that &quot;women [should] take precautions to safeguard themselves, including carrying whistles and not walking alone, especially in dark or unlighted areas.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a black male in his 20s, about 5&apos;9&quot; and 160-180 pounds, wearing a green camouflaged jacket, pants, boots and baseball cap (possibly with a NY Knick or Yankees logo).</p>
