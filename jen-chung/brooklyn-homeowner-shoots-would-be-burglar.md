<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:230px; "> <img alt="2010_09_miblsk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150418im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_09_miblsk.jpg" width="230" height="175"> <br> <i>(WPIX)</i></div> Earlier this morning at  2 a.m., a homeowner in Brooklyn shot a man who was breaking into his house on East 64th Street in Mill Basin.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150418/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-home-invader-shot,0,6142036.story">According to WPIX</a>, the homeowner &quot;saw someone in his front yard&quot; and then &quot;went to retrieve his gun and by the time he returned, the suspect was already broke into his home. The man shot the suspect twice in the torso.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The homeowner, described as a retired schoolteacher, has a valid license to carry and possess the gun.  Cops do not suspect criminality because the homeowner was trying to defend himself. A neighbor told WPIX, &quot;If somebody were to break into my house and try to harm my family, there&apos;s very little that&apos;s gonna come between me and my family. <strong>I hope the perpertator is hurting [and] he learns his lesson so he can share his story with other people about breaking into other people&apos;s houses.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The would-be burglar is in critical condition at Brookdale Hospital.  WPIX adds, &quot;Residents [say] there have been a number of break-ins in the area recently. They also said just one block away, a family was held at gunpoint during another home invasion and the suspect made off with $50,000 in cash and jewelry.&quot;</p>
