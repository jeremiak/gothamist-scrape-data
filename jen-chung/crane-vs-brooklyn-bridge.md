It turns out a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150622/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=resources/traffic&amp;id=6424953">crane hit the bottom of the bridge</a>.  WABC 7 reports that a passing ship&apos;s crane was the culprit, hitting the 125-year-old structure around 7:30 a.m.: &quot;the crane left debris on the bottom of the bridge, but did not appear to cause any damage to the structure.&quot;  The Department of Transportation is checking the bridge to make sure--and we&apos;re curious if the ship was fine.  No one goes around hurting the Brooklyn Bridge!</p>
