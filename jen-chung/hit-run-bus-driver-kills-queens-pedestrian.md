<p>A woman was fatally struck by a private bus driver on Main Street in Flushing last night. </p>

<p>According to police, the incident occurred around 8:30 p.m., at Main Street and Kissena Boulevard: A female pedestrian was found with &quot;severe body trauma lying in the roadway.&quot; The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>The driver was operating a private bus, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306201135/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/05/flushing-queens-fatal-hit-and-run/">possibly a charter bus</a>, at the time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306201135/http://abc7ny.com/news/bus-stopped-in-conn-after-woman-fatally-hit-in-queens/1070896/">WABC 7 reports</a> that a Skyline bus, similar to one seen near the fatal crash, was later stopped in Madison, CT: &quot;A Skyline Bus manager confirmed that the bus was inspected by the New York Police Department. He said the bus was not involved in the fatality, but concedes it was in the vicinity of the crash at the time. Skyline is cooperating fully with the NYPD, said the manager.&quot;</p>

<p>A witness told WABC 7, &quot;I ran to the corner, and I grabbed boxes, I grabbed large cardboard boxes to block the body so that the cars would not keep trying to go over that body.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the eighth pedestrian fatality this week. On Thursday morning a 55-year-old Bronx woman was killed when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306201135/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mack-truck-driver-hits-kills-woman-crossing-bronx-street-article-1.2424482">the News reports</a>, &quot;a truck driver hit her and then threw his rig into reverse &#x2014; running the doomed woman over a second time.&quot;</p>
