title: Postal Service Proposes Hiking First Class Stamp To 46 Cents

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_07_homerstamp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225555im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_homerstamp.jpg" width="170" height="221" class="image-left"> </span>Facing dire financial issues, the United States Postal Service has proposed raising the cost of a first class stamp another 2 cents to 46 cents.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225555/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704862404575350990954784242.html?mod=WSJ_hps_MIDDLEThirdNews">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;If approved by regulators, the increase to 46 cents for a standard letter would go into effect Jan. 2 and be the seventh increase in a decade. As of Jan. 7, 2001, the cost of a stamp was 34 cents.&quot;</p>

<p>The USPS says that with &quot;plummeting mail volume traced to the recession and increased use of the Internet,&quot; a deficit of almost $7 billion is projected for the next fiscal year (which starts October 1).  Increases, which include also raising postcard prices from 28 cents to 30 cents, would &quot;raise about $2.3 billion for the first nine months of calendar 2011,&quot; the WSJ reports. And Postmaster General John Poter said, &quot;There is no one single solution to the dire financial situation that the Postal Service faces. These proposed rate adjustments are moderate and part of a fair and balanced approach to ensuring mail service for all Americans well into the future.&quot;</p>

<p>Another idea being kicked around is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225555/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/business/06postal.html">reducing mail service from six days to five days</a> a week, which would save $3 billion.  Netflix chief service officer Andrew Rendich is for reducing service because, &quot;Big rate increases will absolutely squash business and will absolutely slow growth for a company like Netflix,&quot; but the Postal Regulatory Commission chairwoman Ruth Goldway says they&apos;ll be taking a close look, &quot;The long-term future of the Postal Service may be limited by their interest in reducing service today.&quot;</p>
