<p>The police are investigating a slashing that occurred on a Manhattan subway train this morning.</p>

<p>At 7:13 a.m., the NYPD says officers responded a 71-year-old who was slashed on the left side of her face. She said she was sitting on a southbound 6 train when, as it approached the Bleecker Street station, a male suddenly slashed her with an unknown object.</p>

<p>Both the victim and suspect got out of the train, a police spokesman said, and the suspect fled on a D train (there&apos;s the transfer to the Broadway-Lafayette D stop at Bleecker). </p>

<p>The victim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154755/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/25/subway-slashing-bleecker-street/">who suffered a four-inch laceration</a>, was taken to Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>There appears to have been an increase in apparently random slashings in NYC recently: Last week, a man walking in the East Village <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154755/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/east_village_slashing_paralyze.php">needed 150 stitches</a> after being slashed by a stranger. Earlier this month, a woman walking in Chelsea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154755/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/chelsea_slashing_arrest.php">was randomly cut in the face</a>, and in December, a student was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154755/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/16/16-yr-old_girl_viciously_slashed_in.php">slashed while walking to school</a>. In November, writer David Henry Hwang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154755/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/05/fort_greene_stabbing_hwang.php">was slashed in the neck</a> in a seemingly random attack while walking in Fort Greene.</p>
