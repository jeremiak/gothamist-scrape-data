<p>A person was fatally struck by an uptown 2 train at the West 79th Street subway station in Manhattan. The victim may have been a teenager who was crossing the tracks. One subway passenger, who was on the stopped 2 train, said he overheard first responders saying they found body parts under the train.</p>

<p>According to the FDNY, they received a call about a DOA at 6:30 p.m. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150655/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/teen_killed_after_being_hit_by_no_1zooTLAGrbfAydnTItSgnJ">NY Post reports</a>, &quot;A teenager was struck and killed by a north-bound No. 2 train while trying to cross through the track tunnel at 79th street in Manhattan, police [sources] said... One witness said the teen was crossing from the north-bound No. 1 platform to the south-bound side.&quot; At the West 79th Street station, you can see the uptown and downtown local platforms, with the two express tracks running in the middle.</p>

<p>Passengers on 2 train said that the train stopped and they had to wait&#x2014;but they were not told why. One woman said that because the train got hot, the doors were opened, and then they overheard first responders talking about finding body parts. Another overheard a firefighter say they found a head. They were eventually taken off the 2 train when the MTA pulled a 1 train near their car. Passengers were told not to look and not to take videos or photos.</p>

<p>The incident has caused service disruptions between 42nd Street and 96th Street on the 1, 2, and 3 lines. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150655/http://www.mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html">MTA&apos;s website says</a>:</p><blockquote>Due to a police investigation at 79 St, the following service changes are in effect:<p></p>

<p>There are no 1, 2 and 3 trains between 42 St-Times Sq and 96 St in both directions.</p>

<p>2 trains are running on the 5 in both directions between Nevins St and 149 St-Grand Concourse.</p>

<p>Allow additional travel time.</p></blockquote><b>Update, 9:26 p.m.</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150655/http://www.mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html">Now the MTA says</a>, the investigation is still continuing but service is back for the 1, 2 and 3 trains&#x2014;the 1 is bypassing West 79th Street. <p></p>

<p>Apparently today was the victim&apos;s 18th birthday and he and friends were visiting from Long Island. The group was trying to get back to Penn Station; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150655/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Teenager-Struck-Killed-Subway-Train-West-79-Street-Broadway-Number-2-Train-200139891.html">according to NBC New York</a>, &quot;They apparently realized they were on the wrong platform and started to cross the train tracks to get to the opposite side.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150655/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/26/service-disruption-following-fatal-subway-strike/">WCBS 880 adds</a>, &quot;At least two jumped down and tried to cross &#x2014; one made it.&quot;</p>
