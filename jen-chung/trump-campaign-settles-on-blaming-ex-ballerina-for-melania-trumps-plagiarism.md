<p>Sure, the 2016 Republican National Convention was supposed to be about how Donald Trump (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/20/donald_trump_wont_condone_violent_s.php">this guy</a>!) is finally the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/20/america_jumps_shark_vom_fear_sweats.php#photo-1">Republican presidential candidate</a> America deserves. But now it&apos;s become &quot;How did the Trump campaign let Melania Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/19/melania_trump_michelle_obama.php">read a speech that plagiarized Michelle Obama</a> on primetime television?&quot; and &quot;How come the Trump campaign can&apos;t stick to a single narrative when trying to explain it?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/http://chicagoist.com/2016/07/19/video_rnc_my_little_pony_melania_trump.php">Like, <em>My Little Pony</em></a>&#x2014;really?!?</p>

<p>After it became very apparent that the model-turned-third Mrs. Trump used extremely similar phrases as Michelle Obama did at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, the Trump camp wavered between blaming writers (&quot;Melania&apos;s team of writers took notes on her life&#x2019;s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking&quot;) and Hillary Clinton (Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort: &quot;This is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she seeks out to demean her and take her down&quot;).</p>

<p>Then Trump water boy Chris Christie argued on the Today Show that it&apos;s &quot;not&quot; really plagiarism &quot;when 93% of the speech is completely different than Michelle Obama&#x2019;s speech.&quot; Seriously, everyone knows it&apos;s <em>only </em>plagiarism if you copy more than 62.7% of your material. And Manafort insisted there were only 50 similar words, &quot;And that includes &#x2018;ands&#x2019; and &#x2018;thes&#x2019; and things like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Late last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/us/politics/melania-trump-convention-speech.html?_r=0">the NY Times published a look</a> at what <em>allegedly</em> happened with Melania Trump&apos;s speech: Republican speechwriters Matthew Scully and John McConnell, who wrote George W. Bush&apos;s 9/11 speech, were hired by Ivanka Trump&apos;s husband Jared Kushner to write the speech. </p><blockquote>The speechwriters, Matthew Scully and John McConnell, sent Ms. Trump a draft last month, eager for her approval.<p></p>

<p>Weeks went by. They heard nothing.</p>

<p>Inside Trump Tower, it turned out, Ms. Trump had decided she was uncomfortable with the text, and began tearing it apart, leaving a small fraction of the original... Ms. Trump decided to revise it, and at one point she turned to a trusted hand: Meredith McIver, a New York City-based former ballet dancer and English major who has worked on some of Mr. Trump&#x2019;s books, including &#x201C;Think Like a Billionaire.&#x201D; It was not clear how much of a hand Ms. McIver had in the final product, and she did not respond to an email on Tuesday.</p></blockquote>Now McIver has taken the fall, announcing her resignation:<p></p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meredith McIver, an in-house staff writer from the Trump Organization, releases statement on Melania speech <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/https://t.co/mWuPKmjsbn">pic.twitter.com/mWuPKmjsbn</a></p>&#x2014; Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/755801917310308352">July 20, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016012920js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>The statement reads, &quot;In working with Melania on her recent first lady speech, we discussed many people who inspired her and messages she wanted to share with the American people,&quot; and shockingly reveals, &quot;A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama.&quot; </p>

<p>McIver claims that her boss&apos;s wife &quot;read me some passages from Mrs. Obama&#x2019;s speech as examples. I wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech. I did not check Mrs. Obama&#x2019;s speeches. This was my mistake and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps as well as to Mrs. Obama. No harm was meant.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So it&apos;s not plagiarism but the speechwriter still offered her resignation for it?</p>&#x2014; Kelsey L. Hayes (@kelseylh) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/https://twitter.com/kelseylh/status/755802628982972416">July 20, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016012920js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012920/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/melania-trump-speech-michelle-obama-225794">said yesterday</a>, &quot;I agree with Reince Priebus, whoever was the staff person who wrote this speech should be held accountable and should be fired. I know accountability. I know accountability in the Trump campaign and I know what it&#x2019;s like to be fired from the Trump campaign. There absolutely has to be accountability. There&#x2019;s accountability in everything we do. I&#x2019;ve had that accountability. Someone should be held to that same standard.&quot;</p>

<p>Standards, shmandards!</p>
