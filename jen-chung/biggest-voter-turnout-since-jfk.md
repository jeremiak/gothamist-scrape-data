<p>However, the excitement of high voter turnout and a thrilling presidential race is tempered by the long lines many faced.  NYC voters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152416/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/04/finally_election_day_2008_today.php">saw long lines, broken machines</a> and their names missing from the voter books even though they&apos;d been in the books in previous elections!  And even the famous had to wait: With 270 people ahead of him, Mayor Bloomberg waited in line to vote on the Upper East Side (he joked he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152416/http://www.politickerny.com/katharinejose/376/bloomberg-gets-line">couldn&apos;t cut</a> because the press was around).  </p>

<p>When NY Governor David Paterson voted in Harlem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152416/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/paterson-votes-with-help-from-wife/">he said</a>, &quot;<strong>I haven&#x2019;t seen lines like these even when the machines were broken.</strong>&quot;  Rep. Anthony Weiner was luckier--it took him 10 minutes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152416/http://dailygotham.com/blog/bouldin/weiner_campaigns">vote at P.S. 101 in Forest HIlls</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152416/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/nyregion/05turnout.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a> that the NYC Board of Elections &quot;acknowledged the complaints, which [were] attributed in part to &apos;an unprecedented number of voters at the polls.&apos; The city&#x2019;s 34,000 poll workers, who are paid $200 to $300 for a day&#x2019;s work, tried their best to help voters at 1,351 polling sites.&quot;  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152416/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/opinion/05wed4.html?ref=opinion">Times editorial suggests</a> that more stats offer early voting or allowing absentee ballots that don&apos;t require excuses.</p>
