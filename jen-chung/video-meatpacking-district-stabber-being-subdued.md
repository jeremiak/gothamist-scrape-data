Four civilians were stabbed and/or slashed and were three police officers suffering minor (non-stabbing) injuries; all are expected to survive their injuries.  </p>

<p>Rushane Brown, a 22-year-old Queens resident, is accused of stabbing the manager of the Solstice Sunglasses boutique on 9th Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets after an argument. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000827/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/chaos_in_chelsea_as_crazy_man_knifes_7hbzBdtrCIQKjN0pVnaSlM"> An employee said</a>, &quot;He came in mumbling and tried stabbing everyone in the store. This wasn&apos;t a robbery. He wanted to kill people.&quot; Then he allegedly chased another employee into a neighboring restaurant, where he threw a chair at the door, and finally headed to an outdoor plaza where people were gathered for a weekly salsa event.  Three men were slashed in the plaza as they tried to restrain Brown.  </p>

<p>Paulie Heenan took this video of some of the good Samaritans still restraining Brown until police officers take over.  One witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000827/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/07/08/2010-07-08_four_wounded_in_stabbing_spree_in_front_of_new_york_city_apple_store_thursday_po.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">had said</a>, &quot;This guy was throwing the cops off of him like The Hulk.&quot;</p>
