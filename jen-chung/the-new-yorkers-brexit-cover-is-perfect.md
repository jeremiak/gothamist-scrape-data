										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153521/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/24/uks_brexit_vote_to_leave_european_u.php">United Kingdom&apos;s vote to leave the European Union</a> has been perfectly parodied by The New Yorker&apos;s Barry Blitt, whose latest funny illustration, &quot;Silly Walk Off A Cliff,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153521/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-2016-07-04?mbid=social_twitter">will adorn the cover</a> of next week&apos;s magazine:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_06_sillywalk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153521im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_06_sillywalk.jpg" width="640" height="878" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153521/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-barry-blitts-silly-walk-off-a-cliff">Blitt said</a>, &quot;I was stunned when I heard the news this morning.&quot; Then he added, &quot;And really upset. I just sent money to my kid, who&#x2019;s travelling over there&#x2014;if I had just waited, I&#x2019;d have saved a bundle now that the pound has collapsed.&quot;</p>

<p>Less amusingly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153521/http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/brexit-should-be-a-warning-about-donald-trump">The New Yorker&apos;s Amy Davidson wrote</a>, &quot;The Brexit results are a strong warning for anyone complacent about Donald Trump. Brexit didn&#x2019;t happen because people in Europe listened to him; but he is a voice in a call-and-response chorus that is not going to simply dissipate.&quot;</p>
