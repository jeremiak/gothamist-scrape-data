										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2015_10_subcm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013607im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_subcm.jpg" width="300" height="296" class="image-right"> </span>Last year, the NYPD released video of a man accused of &quot;manipulating his penis outside of his pants&quot; on a Manhattan subway platform. It turned out the suspect was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013607/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/ex-cop_arrested_for_flashing_his_pe.php">retired police detective</a> Steven Esposito&#x2014;and now he&apos;s on trial.</p>

<p>According to the police report, on October 19th, 2015,  just before midnight, a 38-year-old woman was on the southbound platform of the Fifth Avenue N/R station when she &quot;heard a hissing noise beside her. When she looked to see what the noise was, she observed the suspect manipulating his penis outside of his pants.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim was so upset that she started crying, and a male good Samaritan helped her follow the suspect, who was leaving the station, and film him. Then the pervert allegedly took out a gun and threatened them, telling them to mind their own business.</p>

<p>After police released the video, saying that the suspect was wanted for criminal menacing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013607/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/ex-cop_arrested_for_flashing_his_pe.php">Esposito, a veteran cop, was arrested</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013607/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/woman-testifies-ex-cop-was-playing-with-his-penis-on-subway/">The Post reports</a> that the victim testified in court, telling jurors that she &quot;heard something to my right, making a hissing, kissing&#x2026;maybe a suction noise... He was playing with his penis, and I was scared.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was looking at my face, and smiling, and making sexual noises, like he was going to force me to give him a blow job or something,&quot; the victim added. And when Esposito allegedly took out his gun to threaten her and the Good Samaritan, &quot;We thought he was going to kill us, or try to intimidate us or something.&quot; </p>

<p>The tip that led to Esposito&apos;s arrest came from a fellow police officer, who recognized him on a wanted poster. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013607/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/woman-testifies-ex-cop-was-playing-with-his-penis-on-subway/">According to the Post</a>, Esposito&apos;s defense attorney is claiming his client was doing something entirely different: &quot;Gerald McMahon said during opening statement that his client wasn&#x2019;t making &apos;kissing sounds&#x201D; but was making &apos;hissing sounds &#x2026; consistent with urination... He either pees in his pants or pees in he subway station. And then this woman comes upon him and starts screaming hysterically.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on, etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013607/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. Don&apos;t let the perverts win.</p>
