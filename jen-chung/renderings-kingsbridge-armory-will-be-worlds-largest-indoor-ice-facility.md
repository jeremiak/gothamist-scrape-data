                            <p>Could it be? After years of thwarted plans, there&apos;s a deal in place for the beautiful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015138/http://gothamist.com/tags/kingsbridgearmory">Kingsbridge Armory</a> in the Bronx. Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s office added this to his schedule today: &quot;9:00 AM  Announces Plans to Transform Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx Into World&#x2019;s Largest Indoor Ice Facility.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015138/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/decision-imminent-fate-kingsbridge-armory-article-1.1322131">Daily News had reported</a> yesterday, &quot;several Bronx groups have signed a community benefits agreement with Kingsbridge National Ice Center (KNIC) partners.&quot; Further, &quot;KNIC has agreed to wall-to-wall living wage jobs for local workers; over 50,000 square feet of community space; guarantee that 51% of jobs would go to Bronx residents; provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses; and grant priority ice time for borough schools, among other provisions.&quot;</p>

<p>Concerns over living wage are what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015138/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/14/city_council_subcommittees_vote_dow.php">doomed a 2009 plan</a> that would have transformed the armory into a shopping mall. (Yes, Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015138/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/18/bloomberg_fights_living_wage_at_kin.php">opposed the living wage</a>.) There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015138/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/12/city_renews_push_to_develop_abandon.php">other attempts</a> (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015138/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/04/kingsbridge_armory_velodrome_reveal.php">one with a velodrome</a>) to get a plan attractive to all parties.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015138/http://www.nycedc.com/film-event-space/kingsbridge-armory">NYC Economic Development Corporation</a> has listed the armory on its list of film and event spaces, noting, &quot;Total Available Space: ~ 285,000 sf; Status: Vacant<br>
Main Drill Floor 180,000 sf; Subbasement 105,000 sf&quot; and:</p><blockquote>The Kingsbridge Armory (the &#x201C;Armory&#x201D;) is located at 29 West Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx. Reputedly the largest armory in the world, Kingsbridge Armory consists of a 180,000-square-foot drill floor spanned freely by pairs of vaulted steel trusses that rise 110 feet above the drill hall floor. The subbasement below stretches 105,000 square feet. The combined square footages and easy accessibility (parking, vehicle, and pedestrian entrances) provide extraordinary filming and event space in New York City.<p></p>

<p>Kingsbridge Amory has power and water but no heat or air conditioning. Bathrooms are available.</p></blockquote>The News reported, &quot;The proposed ice sports center would include nine hockey rinks, a 5,000-seat arena and a 50,000-square-foot community space that would be open to area groups and an education program for local youth.&quot;<p></p>
