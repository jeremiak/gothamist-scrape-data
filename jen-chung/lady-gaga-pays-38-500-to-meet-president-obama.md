<p>A 14-year-old Buffalo boy, Jamey Rodemeyer, who killed himself after being bullied <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035800/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/teen_who_recorded_it_gets_better_vi.php">was found dead last week</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035800/http://tinyurl.com/6e7n49s">one of his final messages</a> was to his hero Lady Gaga, &quot;Thank you Lady Gaga. For everything you have done for me. Paws up forever.&quot; Gaga responded with Tweets like, &quot;The past days I&apos;ve spent reflecting, crying, and yelling. I have so much anger. It is hard to feel love when cruelty takes someones life&quot; and &quot;Jamey Rodemeyer, 14 yrs old, took his life because of bullying. Bullying must become be illegal. It is a hate crime.&quot;</p>

She thanked Obama for hosting his anti-bullying conference with Michelle Obama, and then made a general plea to everyone in the room, including the president, to do what they can to prevent bullying.&quot; </p>
