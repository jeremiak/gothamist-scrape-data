<p>Obey spoke with her son&apos;s classmates and &quot;told them she joined the Army because she needed a good job and wanted to see the world, that her accommodations in Afghanistan are better than one might expect, and that our military personnel isn&#x2019;t just hunting for bad guys in that country. They&#x2019;re also building roads and helping the populace get needed medical attention. She said the Army is much like school &#x2014; a lot of rules and people telling you what to do &#x2014; but she likes it...<strong>They groaned only once &#x2014; when she said she had never handled an AK-47 rifle.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Obey is returning overseas in January.</p>
