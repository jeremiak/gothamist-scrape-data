<p>Last weekend, the Daily News&apos; Bill Madden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810014428/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2009/05/09/2009-05-09_madden_an_open_letter_to_boss__please_fix_your_stadium.html">published an open letter to George Steinbrenner</a>, asking that regular ticketholders&#x2014;the many ticketholders&#x2014;who don&apos;t have &quot;legend suite&quot; tickets be allowed to observe batting practice.  Because only those who paid $2,500 (or, now discounted $1,250) for the seats were allowed to hang out by the railing to see players up close and maybe get an autograph.  Now, the Yankees have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810014428/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2009/05/14/2009-05-14_news_gets_fans_closer_to_yankees_batting_practice.html">agreed to relax their rules</a>, allowing fans to descend to certain sections (the left field, right field and outfield) to watch batting practice.  Here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810014428/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/guide.jsp#b%3Ehttp://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/guide.jsp%23b">are the new rules</a>:</p><blockquote>Remember fans, on game days, arrive early. Yankee Stadium Gates on Babe Ruth Plaza and Gates 2 and 8, open three hours prior to the start of every home game. All fans are encouraged to arrive early to enjoy batting practice and infield workouts from select areas of the Field Level and the Bleachers; specifically, all fans may watch batting practice and infield workouts from Field Level Sections 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135 and 136 and from all Bleachers Sections. <p></p>

<p>Please note, on certain game days the Yankees may elect not to take batting practice, infield workouts or both. Those fans who take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy batting practice and infield workouts from the Field Level and/or the Bleachers may remain until the players leave the field following the conclusion of the Yankees batting practice or 1 hour and 45 minutes after the Gates open. At that time, all fans will be asked to return their respective seats.</p></blockquote>However, the fans cannot go into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810014428/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/premium_seating/legends_suite.jsp">legends suites</a> area, which are the twenty-five sections closest to the field extending from home plate down each baseline.&quot; Earlier this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810014428/http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/yankees/ny-spbp1512769902may14,0,6189184.story">Yankees COO Leon Trost</a> explained, &quot;If you purchase a suite, do you want somebody in your suite? You purchase a home, do you want somebody in your home?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Madden probably still considers the new Yankee Stadium &quot;a monument to the rich and is the epitome of wretched excess.&quot;  The Wall Street Journal has a feature about ballparks, focusing on the Yankees, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810014428/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124234030890821201.html">titled &quot;Yankee Stadium&apos;s Ugly Start.&quot;</a> Yankees President Randy Levine isn&apos;t worried about the bad press, &quot;The old Yankee Stadium, the cathedral of baseball, had 83 years of history. This stadium has been open a month. We believe this stadium will have its own great life and great memories.&quot;</p>
