So now they are offering a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214011629/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/06/cuomo_gets_death_threats_over_letti.php">new plan</a> to tax the rich: A 5.6% tax on those making $1 million or more a year, which would raise about the $447 billion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214011629/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/28/economists_obamas_447_billion_jobs.php">needed to fund Obama&apos;s American Jobs Act</a>.  <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214011629/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/1005/Why-Democrats-proposed-a-5-surtax-on-millionaires-that-won-t-pass">Schumer said yesterday</a>, &quot;It is hard to ask more of households that make $250,000 dollars or $300,000 a year. Many of [them] are not rich, and in large parts of the country, that kind of income does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that&#x2019;s associated with wealth in America.&quot;  Now, the bike-lane opponent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214011629/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/10/06/bloomberg_articlesLSNIQG6K510Y.DTL">said of the revised plan</a>, &quot;The addition of this proposal makes it very tough for Republicans to oppose the president&apos;s jobs package. Republicans will be hard-pressed to explain why they&apos;d allow teachers and firefighters to be laid off rather than have millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, House majority leader Rep. Eric Cantor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214011629/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/us/politics/democratic-leaders-propose-millionaires-tax-to-pay-for-jobs-plan.html">scoffed at the plan</a>, &quot;Here we go again, continued insistence in Washington &#x2014; raise taxes on job creators right now. That&#x2019;s not what we need. Most people in America think it&#x2019;s counterintuitive to raise taxes if you want economic growth.&quot;  Yeah, why can&apos;t the Koch Brothers and General Electric just hire all the people protesting downtown?!</p>

<p>For his part, Obama says he&apos;s &quot;comfortable&quot; with the 5.6% concept, &quot;I&apos;m fine with the approach they&apos;re taking... Our economy really needs a jolt right now.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear how much support there is for the proposal, though.  It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214011629/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203476804576614823138026068.html">unclear how much support there is in Congress</a> for the jobs act, but Obama has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214011629/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/obama-attempts-campaign-course-correction-after-tough-summer-.html">been raising the rhetoric</a>, &quot;If Congress does nothing, then it&#x2019;s not a matter of me running against them. I think the American people will run them out of town. I would love nothing more than to see Congress act so aggressively that I can&#x2019;t campaign against them as a do-nothing Congress.&#x201D;</p>
