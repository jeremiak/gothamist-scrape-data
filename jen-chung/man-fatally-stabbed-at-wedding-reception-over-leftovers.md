<p>A 58-year-old man was fatally stabbed in a church gymnasium last night in the Bronx, apparently because he tried to claim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204415/http://nypost.com/2014/06/02/man-fatally-stabbed-in-fight-over-wedding-leftovers/">some wedding leftovers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204415/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-fatally-stabs-cousin-bronx-wedding-reception-source-article-1.1814018">cans of Sterno</a>.</p>

It is early on in the investigation, but we feel confident that we have the right person.&quot;<br>
