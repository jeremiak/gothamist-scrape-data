<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144840/http://www.1010wins.com/Landlord-Charged-with-Trying-to-Kill-Brooklyn-Tena/2197310">According to prosecutors</a>, Tang wanted to evict tenant Israel Halberstam, who was $100,000 behind on rent on an electronics showroom space.  Tang planted a homemade bomb under Halberstam&apos;s minivan; when the tenant moved his vehicle, the bomb exploded and he lost a leg.  Initially, the incident worried people that it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144840/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E6DF153BF936A15750C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">might be terrorist-related</a>.</p>

<p>The Daily News reports that Tang was arrested last year, just within the five-year statute of limitations.  And after he was released, &quot;cops found him sleeping in his car in a Connecticut parking lot&quot; with &quot;a bag full of bomb-making material, silencers, a disguise and other items.&quot;  Tang pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said, &quot;<strong>We believe there is a lot more than meets the eye in this case. Stay tuned.</strong>&quot;</p>
