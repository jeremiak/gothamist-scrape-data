<p>The police announced they arrested the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524022834/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/video_brooklyn_serial_rapist_seen_n.php">man suspected of three rapes</a>&#x2014;including one involving a 15-year-old girl&#x2014;yesterday. Dexter Bell, 23, was hit with three counts of rape, plus numerous other charges, including robbery, assault and criminal sex act.</p>

<p>The rapes occurred near Albany Avenue and Fenimore Street on April 4 and near Remsen Avenue and Farragut Road on the morning of April 11 and near Midwood Street and Schenectady Avenue on the evening of April 11. Bell is accused of chatting up the victims before luring them to secluded places to attack them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524022834/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/short-article-1.1322646">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Bell would always approach his victims wearing camouflage clothing, chat them up and then ask if they knew a place where he could score some weed. He&#x2019;d flatter his victims, enroll them in his search for marijuana and then overpower and rape them when he got them alone, according to police sources.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently a tipster contacted the police about Bell, who has a previous conviction for attempted rape. He was found at his grandmother&apos;s house. </p>
