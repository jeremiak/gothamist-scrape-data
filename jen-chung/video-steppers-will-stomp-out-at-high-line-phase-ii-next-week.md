<p>Phase I (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301133602/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/08/ribbon_officially_cut_at_the_high_l.php#photo-1">which opened in 2009</a>) runs from Gansevoort to West 20th Street, Phase II is West 20th to West 30th and Phase III is between West 30th and West 34th Streets, wrapping around the Hudson Rail Yards. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301133602/http://thehighline.org/newsletters/060711.html#3">Friends of the High Line say</a>, &quot;Still overgrown with wildflowers and grasses, the final stretch is owned by CSX Transportation, Inc. We are working with Mayor Bloomberg, CSX, and all the stakeholders to open the High Line at the rail yards to the public as soon as possible,&quot; and today, &quot;Mayor Bloomberg announced that The Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation has stepped forward with a $5 million grant to launch the Rail Yards Challenge, a fundraising effort to drive the future transformation of the High Line at the Rail Yards. Inspired by the Foundation&apos;s vision and commitment to the High Line, two long-time supporters of the High Line, Donald Pels and Wendy Keys, have pledged an additional $5 million to double the fundraising challenge.&quot;  </p>

<p>The FHL also warn, &quot;Because crowding may occur in the opening weeks, please check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301133602/http://www.thehighline.org/">our Web site</a> for updates about park conditions before you visit.&quot;</p>
