<p>Multiple people were injured when the driver of a recycling truck plowed into a Brooklyn corner deli. </p>

The truck driver swerved to avoid the vehicle, but careened into the deli.&quot;</p>

There were two people inside working at the time, one behind the counter and the other was walking on the opposite side of the deli.&quot;</p>

<p>The truck was finally removed at 5 a.m., but the owners of the deli, who live above the store, are worried about the stability of the building. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175308/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/06/20/garbage-truck-crashes-through-deli-in-brooklyn/">One of the owner&apos;s sons told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s very painful. We&#x2019;re all in the street, me and my little brothers, everybody... He was driving too fast, he went inside the building. My cousins, three of them are in the hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, including the deli&apos;s workers and the drivers of the two vehicles.</p>
