                            <p>People, it&apos;s really, really coming: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike</a>, NYC&apos;s new bike share program, is scheduled to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/dot_bike_share_will_begin_on_memori.php">go live on Memorial Day, May 27</a> and a bicycle was spotted in Greenwich Village, at the 6th Avenue and Washington Place station. </p>

<p>It looks like a crew was getting the bicycle ready&#x2014;and this might be one of the only in-situ outside of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/30/citibike_is_real_first_citibike_bik.php"> Citi Bike is already being used</a> by Brooklyn Navy Yard employees (the bikes must stay there). </p>

<p>Thousands of memberships have been sold&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/citibike_sells_5000_annual_membersh.php">5,000 were sold</a> in the first two days of availability&#x2014;and nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/dot_releases_updated_citibike_map.php">300 stations are set up</a>, mostly in Manhattan below 62nd Street and downtown Brooklyn. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://citibikenyc.com/pricing">Pricing ranges</a> from a 24-Hour Pass at 9.95 (plus tax) and a 7-Day Pass at $25 (plus tax) to a $95 (plus tax) Annual membership, with overtime charges for longer rides.</p>

<p>While D.C. residents say that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/bike_share_tips_citibike.php">haters have come to love</a> their bike share program, some New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015148/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/i_dont_live_in_paris_i_live_in_new.php">are saying things like</a>, &quot;There are thousands of New York City taxpayers who dedicate several hours a week already to finding parking, and in West Village, we in the last 5 years, we&apos;ve probably already lost 25 to 50 percent of our parking.&quot;</p>
