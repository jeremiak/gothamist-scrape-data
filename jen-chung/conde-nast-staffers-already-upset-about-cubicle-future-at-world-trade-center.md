And for good reason. &apos;<strong>I think it will be horribly received in many parts of the building</strong>,&apos;&quot; because the office space design might include... cubicles.</p>

<p>The plans reportedly include open office space and not many offices with windows, which some view as a step down from 4 Times Square, where top editors have huge offices, sometimes with bathrooms with showers, (if you have Netflix Instant, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424135815/http://movies.netflix.com/Movie/The-September-Issue/70112749">watch The September Issue</a> for a glimpse inside Vogue&apos;s offices).  One &quot;Cond&#xE9; Nasty&quot; tells the Post&apos;s Keith Kelly, &quot;Newsrooms are all about speed and accuracy. The kind of writing we do is much more involved with style. You need quiet,&quot; and then Kelly outlines a fascinating hierarchy of office space:</p><blockquote>In the Cond&#xE9; Nast headquarters, there are five levels of office space, ranked from A, for top-level editors and publishers, which are corner offices with windows, to E level, where assistants and junior staffers are sitting in the open. But even the D level office space in the current headquarters have walls and doors -- although that level would be relegated to interior windowless space.</blockquote>Who knows, maybe Cond&#xE9; Nast will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424135815/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/05/conde_nast_cuts_more_mags.php">cut a few more magazines</a> and put the cubicle cowards out of their misery.<p></p>
