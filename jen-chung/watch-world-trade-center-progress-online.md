</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, the Port Authority officially announced that it would give the public updates of World Trade Center construction progress through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104944/http://www.youtube.com/wtcprogress">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104944/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wtcprogress/">Flickr</a> accounts.  The Port Authority&apos;s press release explains, &quot;While subscribers to the Port Authority&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104944/http://wtcprogress.com/">World Trade Center web site</a> already have access to up-to-the-minute updates, milestone reports, picture slideshows and videos, the new social networking hubs will allow even more picture and video content to be disseminated to a much broader audience. The new online initiatives support the Port Authority&apos;s mission to provide transparent, timely information about construction at the World Trade Center, and will make images and videos more accessible to constituents throughout the region and the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Above are some recent photographs plus ones of the transit hub designed by Santiago Calatrava.  And below is a video taken a few days ago from the fifth floor of the future <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104944/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/26/no_freedom_at_ground_zero_just_1_wt.php">One World Trade Center</a> (aka Freedom Tower).  </p>
