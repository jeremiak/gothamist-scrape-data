Hundreds of people are waiting&#x2014;some set up tents while others are just standing. One man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210919/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/job.queens.line.2.1655418.html">explained to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;We&apos;ve been here pretty much all weekend. They&apos;re supposedly one of the busiest unions in the city. It&apos;s too good of an opportunity to pass up.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210919/http://www.1010wins.com/Job-Seekers-Camp-Out-in-Queens/6886195">According to 1010 WINS</a>, &quot;Apprentices with the union earn $14 to $16 an hour and get training to become elevator mechanics. Full-fledged elevator mechanics can make up to $40 an hour.&quot;  Only 750 applications will be given out at 9 a.m. today and there are only 100 apprenticeship positions.  </p>

<p>In spite of the rain, the job seekers are still there.  One man t<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210919/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/04/26/2010-04-26_wont_rain_on_their_jobhunting_parade.html">old the Daily News</a>, &quot;It&apos;s been awful and soggy and wet, but I can&apos;t leave. I don&apos;t even think about leaving,&quot; while another man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210919/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7405585">said</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t care if I have to wait three days in snow, rain, I&apos;ll do anything for my family.&quot;</p>
