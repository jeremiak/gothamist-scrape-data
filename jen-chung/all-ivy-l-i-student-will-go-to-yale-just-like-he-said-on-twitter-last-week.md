<p>Earlier this month, a Long Island high school senior stunned everyone when his school announced that he had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504032805/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/01/li_student_accepted_to_all_8_ivy_le.php">accepted to all eight Ivy League schools</a>. Now, at a press conference, Kwasi Enin has announced he was going to Yale&#x2014;which is what he hinted at in a Tweet last week:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Yo! Yale! Yeaaaaaaah!
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504032805/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Yale2018&amp;src=hash">#Yale2018</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504032805/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tooepic&amp;src=hash">#tooepic</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504032805/http://t.co/4UVpr2WSe3">pic.twitter.com/4UVpr2WSe3</a></p>&#x2014; Kwasi Enin (@KwasiEnin) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504032805/https://twitter.com/KwasiEnin/statuses/459019980013850624">April 23, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Enin, who also got into three SUNY schools and Duke, had revisited the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton, but he liked Yale since the beginning for its biomedical engineering program (he wants to become a doctor). At today&apos;s press conference, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504032805/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/kwasi-enin-long-island-student-accepted-to-all-8-ivy-league-schools-chooses-yale-1.7873361">Enin said</a>, &quot;I&apos;m not intimidated by the school very much. There&apos;s always that shock factor for most college kids -- the world&apos;s bigger than I thought it was. There are a lot more smart kids than I thought there were, compared to me. But I&apos;m ready for that.&quot;</p>

<p>The 17-year-old credited his parents and teachers, &quot;Without their assistance, I would not be in this position. I would not have had the initial drive to strive for excellence.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504032805/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Long-Island-Teen-Kwasi-Enin-Ivy-League-Decision.html">His dad said to reporters</a>, &quot;I told him, &apos;Look, your worst grade in school should be a 95.&apos;&quot; Tiger dad for sure!</p>
