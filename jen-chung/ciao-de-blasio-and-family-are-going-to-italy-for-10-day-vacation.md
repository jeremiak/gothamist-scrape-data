<p>The Mayor will have ten days <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202200/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/honeymoons_over_de_blasio_spotted_e.php">to eat pizza with a fork and knife this month</a>&#x2014;he&apos;s going back to the mother land this summer.</p>

<p>The trip begins next Friday, July 18, and the mayor and his family will return on Sunday, July 27. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202200/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mayor-de-blasio-10-day-vacation-italy-article-1.1862824">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The trip &#x2014; the longest vacation by any Big Apple mayor in recent memory &#x2014; will include stops in Rome, Naples and Venice, sources said. The First Family also will visit Grassano and Sant&#x2019;Agata dei Goti, towns where the mayor&#x2019;s maternal grandmother and grandfather, respectively, were born.&quot; </p>

<p>Further, the News says de Blasio is paying for the trip himself, &quot;but he will be accompanied by his NYPD security detail, his press secretary and two other city aides who will oversee his visits with local officials.&quot; While de Blasio will have daily briefings and meet with Italian elected officials, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202200/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/04/bill_de_blasio_picks_senior_staff_f.php">First Deputy Mayor Anthony Shorris</a> will be running the show in NYC.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202200/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/nyregion/de-blasio-and-family-to-head-to-italy-for-10-day-vacation.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">The NY Times points out</a>, &quot;Unlike presidents, mayors of New York City do not usually take a traditional vacation. Mr. Bloomberg did not take a full week off during his 12-year tenure in City Hall. Mr. Giuliani also prided himself on his work ethic, rarely taking a single day off during his first three years in office.&quot; But Bloomberg had his Bermuda hideaway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202200/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/11/shocker_bloomberg_was_totally_in_be.php">perfect for Snowmageddons</a>, and Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202200/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/04/nyregion/giuliani-s-platform-doesn-t-include-a-vacation.html">ran on a &quot;no vacation&quot; platform</a>.</p>

<p>First Lady Chirlane McCray posted photographs from their past trips to Italy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202200/http://flonyc.tumblr.com/post/91379454784/returning-to-italy">on her website, FLONYC</a>, and wrote, &quot;Bill, Chiara, Dante and I are about to do something we&#x2019;ve hoped to do for years: return to Italy.&quot;</p><blockquote>Bill and I have always wanted Chiara and Dante to know where they come from. By traveling to the homelands of our family, we&#x2019;ve helped them understand why both their middle names are Quashie (from their ancestors in West Africa), and why both their first names are Italian (from their father&#x2019;s southern Italian roots). We loved bringing Chiara and Dante to visit these places, where they could personally experience their rich, complex and beautifully diverse heritage... <p></p>

<p>Over the course of the campaign, our family received lots of encouragement from Italy. Without pause, letters and emails of support flowed to us from across the waters. On election night, we watched in awe as the town of Sant&#x2019;Agata live-streamed Bill&#x2019;s victory in a small movie theater. We saw Italians&#x2014;people who had never even met us&#x2014;erupt in cheers when Bill won the final vote. The day after the election, we received photos of children, celebrating in piazzas in Sant&#x2019;Agata, as well as in Grassano, where Bill&#x2019;s maternal grandmother was raised. And on inauguration morning, we celebrated Bill&#x2019;s swearing in surrounded by our friends and family members&#x2014;many of whom had travelled all the way from Italy to enjoy that special moment with us.</p>

<p>Returning to Italy this summer will be a homecoming for our family. It will be a moment to humbly express our gratitude for the family members and local residents who supported us and cheered us on over those long months. And, as our first family trip together since we went to Niagara Falls in 2012, it will be a moment to enjoy some much-needed time with Chiara and Dante.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Cannot wait for the inevitable photographs of de Blasio eating gelato with chopsticks to surface!</p>
