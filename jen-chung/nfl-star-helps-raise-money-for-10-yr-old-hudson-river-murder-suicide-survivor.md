Only Lashaun survived.</i></div> The young boy who escaped a sinking minivan that his mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072718/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/mother_drives_minivan_into_hudson_k.php">drove into the Hudson River</a>, drowning herself and his three siblings, received a help hand from the  United Athletes Foundation, which held a fundraiser for 10-year-old Lashaun Armstrong.  Over $20,000 was raised for him, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072718/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/01/2011-05-01_tragic_boy_is_pulling_thru.html">the little boy said</a>, &quot;I&apos;m sad because I&apos;m going through a tough time right now. I&apos;m pulling through.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Baltimore Ravens star Ray Lewis and former cornerback  Reggie Howard were on hand to lend support, and Lewis, who contacted the boy after hearing about the tragedy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072718/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/grid_greats_are_tragic_kid_new_heroes_fZqHIeQHKaIqv4d1PpNRoJ">told the Post</a>, &quot;This is a hard situation and he is forever changed... We are not going to let him do it alone, we are going to be here for him forever.&quot;  On April 12, Lashanda Armstrong drove her car, which had Lashaun and 5-year-old Landen Pierre, 2-year-old Lance Pierre and 11-month-old Lanaina Pierre inside, into the Hudson near Newburgh, NY.  Lashaun was able to get out of the car and swim to shore, where a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072718/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/10-year-old_escaped_sinking_minivan.php">Good Samaritan drove him to a fire house</a>.  </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear why Lashanda Armstrong killed herself, but friends and family suggest trouble with boyfriend Jean Pierre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072718/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/hudson_river_murder-suicide_mothers.php">may have been part of the problem</a>.  Lashaun, who did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072718/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/26/tension_at_funeral_of_three_childre.php">not his siblings&apos; funeral</a>, also said, &quot;I like to thank the UAF for fund-raising this money for my family and I&apos;d like to thank Ray and Reggie for being there for meand taking care of me when I need help.&quot; The UAF is reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072718/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/01/2011-05-01_tragic_boy_is_pulling_thru.html">giving him a scholarship</a>.</p>
