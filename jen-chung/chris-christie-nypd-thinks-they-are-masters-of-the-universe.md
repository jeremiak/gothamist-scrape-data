<p>With the Associated Press&apos; reports about the NYPD&apos;s large-scale surveillance of Muslims in not just New York City but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416013710/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/secret_document_shows_nypd_targetin.php">across the Eastern seaboard</a> came the revelation that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416013710/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/nypd_spied_on_muslims_in_newark_per.php">NYPD has been spying on Muslims in Newark</a>.  That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416013710/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/23/mayor_cory_booker_investigating_nyp.php">upset Newark Mayor Cory Booker</a> as well as NJ Governor Chris Christie, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416013710/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/christie_slams_nypd_over_musli.html">spoke out against the NYPD last night</a>.</p>

<p>On his &quot;Ask the Governor&quot; program, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416013710/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/christie_slams_nypd_over_musli.html">Christie fumed</a>, &quot;I hope that almost 11 years past 9/11, we are not going to go back to those days because no one is omniscient... I don&#x2019;t know if this NYPD action was born out of arrogance, or out of paranoia, or out of both but we&#x2019;re taking a real good, strong hard look at it from a policy perspective at the governor&#x2019;s office level.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie, who was U.S. Attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416013710/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/nypd_got_permissi," christie="" said="" sarcastically.="" "_to_spy_on_nj_mu.php"="">when the spying began</a> in 2007, says he doesn&apos;t recall being briefed about the operation and was sarcastic, &quot;Well, because he&#x2019;s Ray Kelly, what are you going to do. He&#x2019;s all knowing, all seeing.&quot; He added, &quot;I had federal jurisdiction [as a U.S. Attorney], so we could go anywhere. This is the New York Police Department. I know they think their jurisdiction is the world. Their jurisdiction is New York City. <strong>My concern is this kind of obsession that the NYPD seems to have that they&#x2019;re the masters of the universe.</strong>&quot;</p>
