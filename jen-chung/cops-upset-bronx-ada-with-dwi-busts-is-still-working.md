title: Cops Upset Bronx ADA With DWI Busts Is Still Working

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="42911troiano.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045026im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/42911troiano.jpg" width="240" height="300"> <br> <i>Bronx ADA Jennifer Troiano</i></div> Last week, it was revealed that when a prosecutor in the Bronx DA&apos;s office facing a 2010 DWI charge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045026/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/29/did_bronx_ada_get_special_treatment.php">was actually also stopped in 2009 for possible drunk driving</a>. But Jennifer Troiano allegedly used her position to get out of the potential arrest.  Now it turns out that she&apos;s working on over 70 cases, which pisses off some cops; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045026/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/ada_case_loaded_in_bronx_wTfOeIkDvCnm5263vlUa0J">one told the Post</a>, &quot;We don&apos;t even have to be arrested to be put on administrative leave or modified duty. Anybody can make an allegation against us and they take away your gun and badge so fast you won&apos;t believe it.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Another problem is that a few of Troiano&apos;s cases involve cops in the mushrooming NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045026/http://gothamist.com/tags/ticketfixingscheme">ticket-fixing scandal</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045026/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/05/2011-05-05_dwi_prosecutors_caseload_a_ticking_bomb.html">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Some of Troiano&apos;s cases rely on testimony from officers implicated in the ticket-fixing probe, making her situation &apos;completely untenable,&apos; a law enforcement source said. &apos;You could have a tainted prosecutor calling tainted cops to the stand,&apos; the source speculated. &apos;Her caseload is a ticking time bomb.&apos;&quot;  One lawyer who is facing Troiano said, &quot;I have no qualms about using her issues if it helps my client and it becomes relevant.&quot;</p>

<p>When Troiano was arrested last summer for crashing her car on the Major Deegan, she allegedly slurred to the arresting officer, &quot;No foul, no foul&#x2014;I didn&apos;t do anything wrong. I&apos;m not even supposed to be driving.&quot; The cops found she smelled of alcohol and was wandering into traffic, &quot;stumbling and falling down and unable to keep her balance.&quot; </p>
