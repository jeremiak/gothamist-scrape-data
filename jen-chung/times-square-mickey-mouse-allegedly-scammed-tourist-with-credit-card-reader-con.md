<p>Once upon a time, when you got scammed in Times Square, it was from being taken in by three-card monte dealers. Now, crooks are using credit card readers!</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217172744/http://nypost.com/2017/02/13/mickey-mouse-busted-for-conning-times-square-tourist/">police announced that a NJ man</a> who dresses as Mickey Mouse in Times Square was arrested for overcharging a tourist from Tennessee for a photograph on Friday night. Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217172744/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/times-square-mickey-mouse-charged-stealing-tourist-article-1.2971452">tell the Daily News</a> that Lester Mengerson, 52, &quot;somehow convinced the tourist to pay $190 for a photo.&quot;</p>

<p>Only later, when the victim lost his credit card <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217172744/http://nypost.com/2017/02/13/mickey-mouse-busted-for-conning-times-square-tourist/">and checked his bank statements</a>, did he realize that he&apos;d been charged an outrageous $310 for a photo with Mickey Mouse, not the very reasonable $190 to which he had agreed.  </p>

<p>Mengerson was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217172744/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/crime/2017/02/14/police-clifton-man-stole-tourist-times-square/97895090/">charged with petty larceny</a>.  He was previously an Elmo, but changed to the Disney character, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217172744/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/after-times-square-arrest-costumed-performers-say-they-re-not-all-troublemakers-1.5033609">telling Newsday</a>, &quot;I heard someone say stay away from this Elmo [or] &#x2018;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217172744/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/unapologetic_anti-semitic_elmo_gets.php">Elmo, I heard you got out of jail</a>.&apos; Now, I bought this costume, I&#x2019;m not being affected at all.&quot; </p>
