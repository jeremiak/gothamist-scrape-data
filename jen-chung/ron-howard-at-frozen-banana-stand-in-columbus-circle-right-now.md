<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619224024/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment">Frozen Banana Stand</a> may be a marketing ploy to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619224024/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/taste_the_happy_watch_first_trailer.php">promote Arrested Development&apos;s new Netflix season</a>, but at least it&apos;s got RON HOWARD right now! The Banana Stand is at Columbus Circle right now&#x2014;look, Opie is eating a frozen banana!</p>
