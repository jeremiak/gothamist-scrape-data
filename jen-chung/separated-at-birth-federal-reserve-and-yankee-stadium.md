<p>With the opening day just moments away, it&apos;s time to look at the new Yankee Stadium&apos;s striking resemblance to another building.  Yes, the new House That Jeter (And Lots of Money, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802203109/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/16/city_approves_more_funding_for_new.php">Much In Tax-Free Bonds</a>) Built looks a lot like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802203109/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccles_Building">Federal Reserve&apos;s headquarters in D.C.</a>&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802203109/http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/virtualtour/architecture.cfm">Eccles building</a> was designed in 1935, by Paul Philippe Cret (it was considered a &quot;a daringly modernist interpretation of the Beaux-Arts style and has become a noted part of American architectural history,&quot; according to the Fed).</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, the NY Times&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802203109/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/arts/design/03stadia.html">architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff wrote</a> that the new Yankee Stadium &quot;is the kind of stoic, self-conscious monument to history that befits the most successful franchise in American sports&quot; and is &quot;straightforward, paint-by-numbers architecture.&quot;  Either way, George Steinbrenner will be there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802203109/http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/yankees/stadium/ny-spyadv1612656973apr15,0,6363933.story">according to Newsday</a>.  Jesse Jackson, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802203109/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/03/yankees_fans_get_a_look_at_the_new.php">saw the stadium earlier this month</a>, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s done in true George Steinbrenner style. It&apos;s first-class, over-the-top, no concern for expense and bust through the budget for comfort.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>MLB.com is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802203109/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nyy">offering free streaming video</a> of Yankee Stadium&apos;s unveiling.
