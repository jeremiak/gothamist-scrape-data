<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421143125/http://gothamist.com/tags/linsanity">Linsanity</a> was at fever pitch, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421143125/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/18/wtf_espn_offers_linsanely_racist_he.php">unfortunate headline appeared on ESPN&apos;s mobile site</a> to describe the Knicks&apos; February 17 loss to the Hornets: &quot;Chink in the Armor.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421143125/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/19/espn_fires_linsanely_racist_headlin.php">ESPN.com employee behind the headline was fired</a>.  Now, Lin has met the writer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421143125/http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/knicks/jeremy-lin-meets-with-ex-espn-headline-writer-1.3627544">according to Newsday</a>.</p>

<p>The writer, Anthony Federico, said it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421143125/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/linsanely_racist_headline_was_hones.php">was an &quot;honest mistake&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421143125/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/chink_in_the_armor_fallout_fired_es.php">wrote a long apology</a> that began, &quot;I wrote the headline in reference to the tone of the column and not to Jeremy Lin&#x2019;s race. It was a lapse in judgment and not a racist pun. It was an awful editorial omission and it cost me my job. I owe an apology to Jeremy Lin and all people offended. I am truly sorry. Actions speak louder than words. My words may have hurt people in that moment but my actions have always helped people. If those who vilify me would take a deeper look at my life they would see that I am the exact opposite of how some are portraying me.&quot;  (Federico described his Christian faith; Lin is also a devout Christian.)</p>

<p>According to Newsday, &quot;A Knicks spokesman said on Wednesday that Lin did not wish to publicly discuss the meeting,&quot; but apparently, &quot;A member of Lin&apos;s family reached out to Federico via e-mail more than a month ago, according to Federico. After several attempts to get Lin and Federico to meet were scuttled because of the Knicks point guard&apos;s busy schedule, the meeting finally took place at a Manhattan restaurant and left Federico thankful for Lin&apos;s graciousness.&quot;</p>

I&apos;m just so excited we had a chance to meet. We talked for an hour. I&apos;m just so thankful... The fact that he reached out to me. The fact that he took the time to meet with me in his insanely busy schedule... He&apos;s just a wonderful, humble person. He didn&apos;t have to do that, especially after everything had kind of died down for the most part. We talked more about matters of faith [and] reconciliation. We talked about our shared Christian values and what we&apos;re both trying do with this situation ... We didn&apos;t talk about the headline for more than three minutes.&quot;</p>
