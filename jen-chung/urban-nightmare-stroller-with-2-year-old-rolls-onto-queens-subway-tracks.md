<p>A woman and her two-year-old daughter were slightly injured&#x2014;but safe!&#x2014;after a terrifying incident: The stroller, with the toddler in it, rolled into the E subway tracks at the Archer Avenue station in Queens.</p>

<p>Apparently the mother had turned to throw something in the trash&#x2014;and the stroller started moving. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823102013/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/21/stroller-carrying-toddler-rolls-onto-subway-tracks-in-queens/">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Just as the woman jumped down onto the tracks after the stroller, a few Good Samaritans, the subway cleaner, came to their rescue and helped bring the mother and daughter onto the platform.&quot; The subway cleaner, Diane, said, &quot;<strong>The mother was throwing out a bottle in garbage, and she didn&#x2019;t put brakes on stroller, and carriage went back.</strong>.. She jumped onto the tracks to save her child.&quot;</p>

<p>Luckily, there wasn&apos;t a train approaching the station just yet. Other transit workers used their flashlights to warn an oncoming train. </p>

<p>The mother and daughter are at North Shore Long Island Jewish Medical Center&#x2014;the mother had a sprained ankle and the toddler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823102013/http://7online.com/news/baby-and-mother-injured-after-falling-on-subway-tracks/205339/">had cuts and bruises</a> to her face.</p>
