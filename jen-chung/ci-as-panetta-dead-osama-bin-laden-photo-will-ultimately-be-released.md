Obviously, I&apos;ve seen those photographs. We&apos;ve analyzed them. And there&apos;s no question that it&apos;s bin Laden.&quot;</p>

<p>Panetta was on the NBC Nightly News tonight, as discussions about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210132321/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/03/osama_bin_laden_corpse_photo_releas.php">whether to release a photograph</a> showing that the Al Qaeda leader is, in fact, dead are starting to dominate coverage (okay, dominate coverage next to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210132321/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/03/white_house_clarifies_killing_osama.php">how the raid was conducted</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210132321/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/world/asia/04binladen.html?hp">what, exactly, did Pakistan know</a>...and whether President Obama or President Bush <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210132321/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54160.html">deserve the most credit</a> for the successful manhunt).  There are reportedly photographs of Bin Laden&apos;s body at a hangar as well as right before a shroud was put on the body <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210132321/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/02/osamas_speedy_sea_burial.php">for the sea burial</a>.</p>

<p>Panetta told NBC News anchor, &quot;There&apos;s no question that there were concerns and there were questions that had to be debated about just exactly what kind of impact these photos have. But the bottom lie is that, you know, we got bin Laden and I think we have to reveal to the rest of the world the fact that we were able to get him and kill him.&quot;  See video from his interview below&#x2014;Williams asked Panetta if informants who gave up the crucial information about Bin Laden&apos;s couriers were waterboarded... Panetta dances around that one but kind of admits it. Kind of.</p>
