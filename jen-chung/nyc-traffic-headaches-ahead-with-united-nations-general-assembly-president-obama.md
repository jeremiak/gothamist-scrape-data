<p>If it&apos;s late September in New York, it must be United Nations General Assembly time! The UNGA meets for a week starting on the third week of September, and this year is the 68th session. President Obama will be in town, which means drivers are screwed with numerous street closures&#x2014;even CitiBike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163158/https://twitter.com/CitibikeNYC/status/382104961305559040">deactivated some stations</a>!</p>

<p>The session starts at 10 a.m. but some street closures have been in effect for days. Traffic expert and former traffic commissioner Sam Schwartz has the scoop:</p>

Mr. Obama will keep the street-closers busy as he shuttles from hotels to the United Nations though tomorrow afternoon. Streets will be frozen in his path &#x2014; not just for motor vehicles, but for pedestrians.&quot;</p>
