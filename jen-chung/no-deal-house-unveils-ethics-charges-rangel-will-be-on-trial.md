<p>Since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/29/will_rangel_make_a_deal_over_ethics.php">settlement talks</a> between the House Ethics Committee and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem) have either fizzled out or are too preliminary to be binding, the House rolled out the ethics charges against the long-serving Congressman.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40416.html">Politico reports</a>, &quot;The headliner allegations are that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/26/gop_wants_ethics_investigation_into.php">improperly solicited money</a> from corporate officials and lobbyists for the Charles B. Rangel Public Policy Center in New York, that he failed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/23/yet_more_taxreal_estate_issues_for.php">disclose hundreds of dollars of income and assets</a> on financial disclosure forms, that he maintained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/11/congressman_charles_rangel_and_his.php">multiple rent-stabilized apartments</a> in violation of New York City rules and failed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/05/rangels_75000.php">pay income taxes</a> on a Dominican island resort home.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/29/AR2010072904083.html?hpid=topnews">According to the Washington Post</a>, the settlement talks failed. Plus Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said before announcing the charge, &quot;Mr. Rangel... was given opportunities to negotiate a settlement under the investigation phase. We are now in the trial phase.&quot; But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163055/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703578104575397303987006546.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal says</a>, &quot;The settlement proposal is preliminary and could still be rejected by the 10-member ethics committee, which must approve or reject the agreement by a majority vote. That vote could take place Thursday afternoon.&quot;</p>
