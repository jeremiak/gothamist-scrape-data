                            <p>It feels like only yesterday that Amanda Bynes was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175257/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/amanda_bynes_arrested_in_midtown_fo.php">arrested for allegedly throwing a bong</a> out of her Midtown Manhattan window, letting it spiral downward faster than her career. But that incident was way back in May, and since Bynes has grasped for the public&apos;s attention by acting out about <em>a billion times</em> since then, let&apos;s refresh. </p>

<p>Following the alleged bong-dropping incident Bynes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175257/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/_view_more_videos_at.php">denied everything</a>, despite there being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175257/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/photo_did_tmz_find_amanda_bynes_sha.php">a shattered bong spotting</a> on the sidewalk below her window. She followed that up with an accusation that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175257/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/amanda_bynes_claims_nypd_officer_se.php">cops sexually assaulted her</a>. </p>

<p>Since then has gone on being Bynes: insulting everyone from Drake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175257/https://twitter.com/AmandaBynes/status/354251510286266368">to the Obamas</a>, letting everyone know about her love for plastic surgery and starving herself, and Tweeting other boring, outlandish, and sad things. </p>

<p>Today, the once-promising starlet headed back to Manhattan Criminal Court regarding that whole Bong Thing... and she did in an aqua blue wig, an Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre jersey, and a smile. How could anyone think someone like her could be mixed up in some sort of bong-related crime?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175257/http://www.tmz.com/2013/07/09/amanda-bynes-vagina-bong-court-appearance-hearing">According to TMZ</a>, &quot;Inside the courtroom today ... nothing really happened. Bynes was virtually silent&#x2014;and the judge continued the case to August 26th... though Bynes isn&apos;t ordered to appear until September 26th.&quot; </p>
