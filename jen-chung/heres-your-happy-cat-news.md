<p>As a bit of an antidote to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165541/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/13/aspca_finds_animal_cruelty_suspect.php">upsetting animal cruelty news</a>, we recommend you read this NY Times real estate section story about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165541/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/realestate/13habi.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Upper West Side apartment of cat rescuer Tammy Cross</a>.  Cross works with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165541/http://kittenlittlerescue.com/">Kitten Little Rescue</a>&#x2014;maybe you&apos;ve seen their set-up of cats available for adoption and fostering on the corner of West 72nd and Columbus Avenue&#x2014;and in her one-bedroom rent-stabilized apartment, &quot;<strong>some 6 to 18 baby kittens &#x2014; and once as many as 22 &#x2014; are bottle fed and nursed back to health</strong>.&quot; Awwww.</p>

<p>Kitten Little Rescue is one of many animal rescue organizations in the city that are made up of dedicated volunteers who take in animals that would otherwise be at risk&#x2014;some others we know are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165541/http://emptycagescollective.wordpress.com/">Empty Cages Collective</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165541/http://www.bideawee.org/">Bideawee</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165541/http://www.barcshelter.org/">Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition</a>&#x2014;hats off to all of them!
