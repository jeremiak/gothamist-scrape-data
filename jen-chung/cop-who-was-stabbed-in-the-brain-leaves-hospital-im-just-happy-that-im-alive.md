<p>Last month, a police officer was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504042442/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/17/cop_stabbed_in_head_neck_in_east_ha.php">stabbed in the head</a> by an emotionally disturbed man.  A knife with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504042442/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/cop_who_was_stabbed_in_the_brain_is.php">3.5&quot; blade was driven into Police Officer Eder Loor&apos;s head</a>, penetrating his skull and brain.
