Apparently this is a big story there.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529123117/http://www.bencarveronline.com/post/1249351318/its-been-a-rough-few-days-im-currently">Ben Carver offered an account of what happened</a>&#x2014;including how he fought back against his attackers in the bar bathroom after they allegedly said, &quot;We don&apos;t like gay bars, and we don&apos;t piss next to f---ts&quot;&#x2014;and added more recently:<blockquote>Violence for its own sake is never OK. I&#x2019;ve read a few of the comments posted on one of the news articles online, and I&#x2019;m disappointed by both gay and straight commenters who propose violence. We must not give in to this form of irrational thinking. We must be better than these bullies, and we must not give away our power to them by entertaining thoughts of fear and violence. While righteous anger is acceptable, we cannot let them take our peace.<p></p>

<p>I forgave these men immediately. The legal system will now decide on a punishment, and I will try to respect whatever decision it makes. What I hope is that at some point, the judgment will include (as a necessity) that these men are informed about the importance of stonewall, what it means to the L/G/B/T community, and that somehow they are given help to understand that all human life is precious and that violence is never acceptable. I would also like to give my condolences to their families, as I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s a difficult time for their mothers.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Carver&apos;s description of the attack is dizzying: </p>
