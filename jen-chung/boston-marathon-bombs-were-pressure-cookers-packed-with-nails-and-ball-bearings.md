<p>Several outlets are reporting that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000744/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php">bombs that killed three</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000744/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/boston_marathon_bombings_terrorism.php">injured over 176 others</a> at the Boston Maraton were made from pressure cookers. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000744/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57579766/fbi-seeks-images-in-boston-marathon-bomb-probe-new-details-emerge-on-explosives/">CBS News spoke</a> to a law enforcement official who said &quot;that one of the explosive devices appears to have been placed in a metal pressure cooker (a metal kitchen pot with a locked down top) which had been placed in a black nylon bag or backpack. Investigators also found pieces of an electronic circuit board possibly indicating a timer was used in the detonation of the bomb.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000744/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/16/boston-marathon-explosions/2086853/">The AP reports</a>, &quot;A person who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was still going on, tells the AP that the explosives were put in 6-liter pressure cookers, placed in black duffel bags and left on the ground. They were packed with shrapnel, the person said.&quot; Dr. George Velmahos, chief of trauma surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, had said victims had &quot;10, 20, 30, 40 pieces of shrapnel&quot;&#x2014;which were like small balls or nails stripped of their heads&#x2014;&quot;embedded in their bodies, mostly in their legs, but as high up as their necks.&quot; </p>

<p>Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000744/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/us/officials-investigate-boston-explosions.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;">says the ball-like shrapnel were ball bearings</a>, &quot;This is not a device like Oklahoma City. That was to bring the building down. The ball bearings are meant as antipersonnel munitions. They&#x2019;re trying to cause carnage here.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s still unclear what detonated the devices, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000744/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/04/16/marathon-bombs-likely-made-from-pressure-cookers-shrapnel-say-experts/">Fox News source said</a> &quot;the style of the device used closely resembles that commonly seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan... The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a pressure cooker was attached to a wooden board in at least one of the blasts,&quot; adding that the device, inside a &quot;black nylon backpack,&quot; was put into a garbage can. Notably, in 2010, Faisal Shahzad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000744/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/terror_suspect_shahzad_talking_waiv.php">placed a pressure cooker bomb in Times Square</a>; it failed.</p>

<p>Still, a FBI investigator told Fox News, &quot;I don&apos;t think the use of pressure cookers points to any particular group or individual who may be responsible.&quot;</p>
