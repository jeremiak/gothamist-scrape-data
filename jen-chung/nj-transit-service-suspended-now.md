---

<p>Poor NJ Transit commuters: Yesterday, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191452/http://gothamist.com/tags/njtransit">news of 10-25% fare hikes</a>, today it&apos;s this advisory, as of 5 p.m.: &quot;Rail service in/out of New York Penn Station is temporarily suspended due to Amtrak signal problems in New York. Midtown Direct trains are being diverted to Hoboken Terminal. PATH, Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and buses are cross-honoring rail tickets and passes.&quot;</p>
