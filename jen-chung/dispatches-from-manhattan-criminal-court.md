<p>A 16-year-old Bronx high school student was hit with multiple charges, including possession of a weapon and consumption of alcohol in a public place: &quot;It all started with a trip to McDonald&#x2019;s. Joseph and his friends were walking to get some food on Broadway near 157th Street in Washington Heights about 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Police officers observed him carrying an uncapped bottle of DonQ Cristal rum, according to court documents, and found two knives in his jacket.&quot;  Apparently one knife was the teen&apos;s&#x2014;he&apos;d been jumped before and wanted to be prepared next time&#x2014;and the other knife was his cousin&apos;s&#x2014;he was carrying it because the knife would have made the cousin&apos;s coat bulge.</p>

<p>And then there was a 29-year-old man who was arraigned for &quot;urinating in the West Fourth Street subway station about 3 a.m.&quot;  Hasani Powell told the Times, &quot;<strong>I had to go really bad. I tried to hold it.</strong>&quot;</p>
