<p>President Donald Trump hasn&apos;t been in New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426183644/https://apnews.com/285c02094b1e40b0983ce72ded0890a8">since January 19</a>, before his inauguration, but next month he will make his first visit as president. The White House announced last night that he will travel to NYC on May 4th to &quot;commemorate the 75th anniversary of the battle of the Coral Sea&quot; aboard the U.S.S. Intrepid. While there, he will also &quot;conduct a bilateral meeting&quot; with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.  </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the announcement:</p><blockquote>On May 4th, the President will speak aboard the USS INTREPID museum in New York City to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major World War II naval battle in which the United States joined with Australia to halt the advance of enemy forces.  That same day, at the museum, the President will also hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia.  The President looks forward to meeting the Prime Minister and to strengthening the enduring bonds, deep friendship, and close alliance between the United States and Australia.</blockquote>The Battle of the Coral Sea, in which United States naval and air forces fought along Australia against Japan, lasted for four days from May 4th to May 8th, 1942. The battle resulted in a strategic victory for the Allies.<p></p>

<p>In the early days of his presidency, Trump reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426183644/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/malcolm-turnbull-donald-trump-pena-nieto/">had a &quot;heated&quot; call</a> with Prime Minister Turnbull, and senior U.S. officials told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426183644/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-gday-mate-on-call-with-australian-pm-trump-badgers-and-brags/2017/02/01/88a3bfb0-e8bf-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html?utm_term=.0d59ee030c10">the Washington Post</a> that Trump informed the Prime Minister: &quot;this was the worst call by far.&quot; Turnbull later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426183644/http://abcnews.go.com/International/australian-pm-malcolm-turnbull-president-trump-frank-relationship/story?id=45279036">said the call &quot;frank and forthright.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>There is already a protest being organized to coincide with Trump&apos;s first presidential visit&#x2014;the Facebook group is called, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426183644/https://www.facebook.com/events/1198328846946489">Protest Trump&apos;s first presidential visit to NYC!</a>&#x2014;by Resist Here and Working Families Party.</p>
