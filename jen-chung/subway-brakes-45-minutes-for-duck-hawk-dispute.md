For instance, yesterday, there were 45 minutes on the N yesterday because of a duck and a hawk.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173522/https://twitter.com/#!/nyctsubwayscoop">NYCTSubwayScoop explained</a> all in a series of Tweets: &quot;If you were caught up in a Stillwell Ave-bound #N disruption this afternoon near 8th Ave apologies. We had animals on the roadbed..,&quot; &quot;Re #N delay: These was a duck being chased by a hawk on the roadbed. The Train Operator blew his horn to no avail. Delayed service 45 mins,&quot; and &quot;Finally the hawk flew away; no one knows what happened to the duck. A #Christmas &apos;only in NY&apos; subway tale (can&apos;t make this stuff up).&quot; </p>

<p>A poster on the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173522/http://www.nyctransitforums.com/forums/f22/duck-hawk-subway-33995.html"> NYC Transit Forum opined</a>, &quot;There might have had been some way to prevent the birds from entering the tracks in the first place, but they didn&apos;t thought of that did they now,&quot; but the know-it-all was quickly shot down by others, &quot;8th avenue is an open cut station. Just how exactly is  supposed to prevent them from going on the tracks?&quot;</p>

<p>In July, a Toronto rapid-transit line was delayed 15 minutes because a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173522/http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1010593--ttc-stops-train-service-for-ducks">family of ducklings was on the tracks</a>, &quot;The rail service was stopped as supervisors walked down to the track to usher the ducks along.&quot;</p>
