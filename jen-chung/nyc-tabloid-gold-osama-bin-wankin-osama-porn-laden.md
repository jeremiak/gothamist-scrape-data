<p>With the news that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305073034/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/13/breaking_news_osama_bin_ladens_secr.php">porn was found in Osama bin Laden&apos;s Abbottabad home</a>, the NY Post and Daily News had fun with their front pages.  Of course, in this instance, the Post wins, with the &quot;Osama Bin Wankin&quot; headline and &quot;It&apos;s Whora Bora&#x2014;porn found in Laden&apos;s foxhole,&quot; compared to the News&apos; &quot;Osama Porn Laden&quot; and &quot;X-rated stash found his hideout.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305073034/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/porno_sama_had_big_jihad_on_QSLrV2tQkxSRIROmP81naP">article also has a certain gusto</a>, &quot;It wasn&apos;t just plots to kill Americans that got a rise out of him. It turns out that terror titan Osama bin Laden had a stash of smut to liven up his lair.&quot;</p>

<p>Reuters reported that officials said the pornography was &quot;modern, electronically recorded video and is fairly extensive&quot; and it was unclear who was using it.  Pffft&#x2014;what else is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305073034/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/08/bin_ladens_viagra_found_when_did_de.php">herbal Viagra good for</a>?</p>
