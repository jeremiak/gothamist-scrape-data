<p>When the Linsanity stopped on Saturday, with the Knicks&apos; announcement that Jeremy Lin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180528/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/31/linterrupted_jeremy_lin_out_for_res.php">would be out for the rest of the season due to a knee injury</a>, it seemed obvious to some observers that there were issues with Lin&apos;s knee, but the Knicks just weren&apos;t talking about it.  Now, the Daily News suggests that the Knicks were holding back the Linfinitely disappointing news so they could sell playoff tickets to season ticket holders.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180528/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-hold-jeremy-lin-injury-announcement-nba-playoff-ticket-deadline-passes-article-1.1054303">According to the News&apos; Frank Isola</a>:</p><blockquote>The Knicks were eventually going to get around to revealing the troubling results of Jeremy Lin&#x2019;s MRI but certainly not before last Wednesday.<p></p>

<p>That was a crucial day inside the club&#x2019;s executive offices at Two Penn Plaza because March 28 represented the deadline for season- ticket holders to purchase all four rounds of the playoffs.</p>

<p>In fact, in the email sent to subscribers, there is a picture of Lin leaping in celebration. Yet, it was two days before the deadline when Lin and the Knicks&#x2019; medical staff learned that the second-year point guard/cash cow was suffering from a torn meniscus in his left knee and that he wouldn&#x2019;t be jumping for joy anytime soon.</p>

<p>Although Lin waited until Saturday before formally making the decision to have surgery, it certainly made business sense for the organization to withhold medical information about its marquee attraction. But that doesn&#x2019;t explain why the Knicks, who are 2&#xBD; games ahead of Milwaukee for the eighth and final playoff spot with 13 games left, weren&#x2019;t forthcoming about Lin&apos;s condition after Wednesday&#x2019;s postseason ticket deadline passed.</p></blockquote>Ah, more confirmation that the Knicks were betting on Lin as a cash cow!<p></p>

Do I think that played into it on some level? Absolutely, for probably the marketing department ticketing. Do I think Jeremy Lin is thinking like that? Absolutely not... What the Knicks will say is, &#x2018;Well, we don&#x2019;t want it out there that he&#x2019;s got a torn meniscus because if he does end up playing, we don&#x2019;t want other teams to know that.&#x2019; But I think the big brace that he&#x2019;s wearing on his knee during a game would probably give it away that his knee hurts.&#x201D;</p>
