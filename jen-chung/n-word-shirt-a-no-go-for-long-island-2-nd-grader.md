It&apos;s Time!&quot;, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423054939/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/ny-lishir0626,0,6367532.story">Newsday reports</a> she was sent to the principal&apos;s office and asked to change her shirt.  Now, her mother and school officials disagree about whether or not an 8-year-old and her shirt should be what prompts dialogue on race.</p>

<p>The ACLU says students should be allowed to wear whatever they want (like that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423054939/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/19/confederate_fla.php">Staten Island kid who wore a confederate flag shirt</a>), but the Amityville&apos;s district superintendent John Williams said, &quot;To send a little white girl wearing this shirt into a very diverse district that is almost 90 percent nonwhite was not the way to address this word. It&apos;s a lightning rod.&quot;</p>

<p>Jaiden herself said, &quot;My mom picked it out. She thought it would look nice on me. I don&apos;t know why they made me take it off.&quot; And her mother Karen Haber told Newsday, &quot;I never expected it to be blown up like this. <strong>But innocently enough, Jaiden&apos;s made an impact on society -- maybe even history.</strong>&quot; However, Jaiden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423054939/http://www.news12.com/LI/topstories/article?id=213515">has also said she doesn&apos;t know what the N-word is</a>, only that it&apos;s a bad word she shouldn&apos;t say (her mom says she wanted to keep Jaiden &quot;innocent.&quot;)</p>
