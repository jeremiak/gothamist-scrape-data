<p>Yikes: The Buffalo Police Department released this video of an 18-year-old man being struck by a hit-and-run driver, and it&apos;s pretty intense.  It shows Victor Jerez and two other men walking in the street; they see a car coming, so they rush to the sidewalk.  But the driver comes barreling onto the sidewalk, hitting Jerez and sending him flipping through the air.  </p>

<p>Luckily, witnesses called the police and they were able to arrest the (19-year-old) driver, Tornubari Gbaraba, five minutes after the May 3 incident, which was followed by a high-speed chase.</p>

<p>Amazingly, Jerez left the hospital shortly after being treated for his injuries.  And Gbaraba was charged with assault, reckless driving and fleeing from a police officer.</p>
