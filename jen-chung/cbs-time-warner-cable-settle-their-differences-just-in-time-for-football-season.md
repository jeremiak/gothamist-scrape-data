(CBS/Late Show With David Letterman)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After squabbling over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173237/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/02/cbs_goes_off_air_on_time_warner_cab.php">retransmission fees for a month</a>, and leaving Time Warner Cable customers without CBS or Showtime, CBS and Time Warner Cable came to an agreement that brought CBS programming back to TWC last night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173237/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324432404579051453041446982.html?mod=WSJ_business_whatsNews">While the terms weren&apos;t disclosed</a>, CBS CEO Les Moonves said, &quot;We are receiving fair compensation for CBS content.&quot;</p>

<p>The blackout affected millions of Time Warner Cable customers in major markets like NYC, LA and Dallas. When Time Warner Cable told customers to check out CBS programming online, CBS blocked Time Warner Cable broadband. The two parties were squabbling over the size of the retransmisison fee that TWC pays for CBS programming&#x2014;TWC wanted to pay $1, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173237/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/05/cbs_losing_400000_day_thanks_to_tim.php">while CBS wanted $2</a>.</p>

<p>Many had predicted the dispute would soon be resolved because of the pro football season, which starts this weekend. Time Warner Cable&apos;s CEO Glenn Britt said, &quot;While we certainly didn&apos;t get everything we wanted, ultimately we ended up in a much better place than when we started.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173237/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/business/media/cbs-and-time-warner-cable-end-contract-dispute.html?ref=business">The Times reports</a>:</p><blockquote>In his statement, Mr. Britt said Time Warner Cable ultimately &#x201C;ended up in a much better place than when we started,&#x201D; though he did not specify how. He also again pushed for some kind of change in the rule that granted networks the rights to compensation from cable companies for their programming<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;The rules are woefully out of date, are the primary reason cable bills are rising,&#x201D; Mr. Britt said. &#x201C;We sincerely hope that policy makers heed that call and take action to prevent these unfortunate blackouts soon.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Luckily, Time Warner Cable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173237/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/31/just_how_badly_is_time_warner_rippi.php">can gouge you in other ways</a>. Anyway, in case you missed Bill Murray&apos;s visit to the Late Show with David Letterman last week&#x2014;either because of TWC or you were busy pre-gaming for Labor Day&#x2014;it&apos;s pretty hilarious:<p></p>
