<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_blth.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123955im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_blth.jpg" width="230" height="175" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, mayoral candidates Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Comptroller Bill Thompson campaigned with just days away until the election.  And they made sure to encourage voters to get out the vote:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123955/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/108239/mayoral-candidates-stress-importance-of-voter-turnout">NY1 reports</a> that Bloomberg went to a &quot;get out of the vote&quot; rally in Queens while Thompson said, &quot;This is all about turnout and really a question of who comes out and votes. So I think he&apos;s concerned, not just because his votes may stay home, I think he&apos;s concerned about the change that people in New York City are indicating all across the city. They&apos;d like to see a new mayor, they&apos;d like to see change in City Hall.&quot;</p>

<p>In what could be a somewhat depressing article to Thompson and his campaign, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123955/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election_2009/2009/11/01/2009-11-01_bill_who_a_bad_sign_just_days_before_election_poll_shows_few_know_name_of_mayora.html?r=news">Daily News reports</a> that when shown a photograph of Thompson, various New Yorkers had responses like, &quot;I know he&apos;s running for mayor, but I don&apos;t know his name,&quot; &quot;He&apos;s the guy who&apos;s running for mayor. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m planning on voting. The only other time I&apos;ve voted was for Obama, because he was the first black President,&quot; and &quot;Isn&apos;t he running for mayor? I know Obama endorsed him. To be honest, I think I am voting for Bloomberg. He&apos;s done a good job so far, and he has money. Money matters.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123955/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/nyregion/01ads.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times looks at the negative tone</a> the most recent campaign ads from both candidates (though ads for Bloomberg, with his projected $100 million campaign, has really blanketed the airwaves).  The Thompson campaign says, &#x201C;Most campaigns stay within certain boundaries. The Bloomberg folks basically disregarded that completely,&quot; as Bloomberg&apos;s campaign counters, &quot;Instead of making any kind of positive case for himself in his ads, Mr. Thompson has chosen to attack the mayor and distort his record.&quot;</p>
