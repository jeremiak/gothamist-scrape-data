<p>The air at Coney Island is charged as the annual <a title="The Nathan&apos;s Famous Corporation" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013109/http://nathansfamous.com/">Nathan&apos;s Famous</a> Hot Dog Eating Contest will be underway in moments.  Contributor Billy Parker is on the scene and tells us the Nathan&apos;s &quot;Franksters&quot; (hot dog mascots) had a dance &quot;to the death&quot;: &quot;The old Frankster had serious moves, while a newer Frank was booed.&quot;  Tien Mao, hot dog enthusiast, and I will also be chiming in.</p>

<p>This year, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013109/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/10/nathans_hot_dog.php">contest will be for 10 minutes</a>, apparently a long forgotten rule.  Last year, Joey Chestnut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013109/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/04/liveblogging_th_4.php">brought the Mustard Belt back to the U.S.</a> by eating a record 66 hot dogs in 12 minutes, defeating six-time champ Takeru Kobayashi of Japan, who also ate a personal best 63 hot dogs.  All eyes are on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013109/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/03/nathans_hot_dog_eating_championship.php">Chestnut-Kobayashi showdown</a>, but ESPN is suggesting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013109/http://www.ifoce.com/eaters.php?action=detail&amp;sn=105">Patrick Bertoletti</a> might be a dark horse.  Bookmakers either have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013109/http://www.theonlinewire.com/articleView.aspx?ID=3853">Chestnut favored</a> or say Chestnut and Kobayashi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013109/http://www.gambling911.com/Nathan&apos;s-Hot-Dog-Eating-Contest-Odds-070408.html">are dead even</a>.</p>
