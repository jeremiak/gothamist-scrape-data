<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_04_beckapt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004504im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_beckapt.jpg" width="365" height="266"> <br> <i>Glenn Beck in his Manhattan abode, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004504/http://www.businessinsider.com/glenn-beck-new-york-apartment-2011-3?op=1">Business Insider</a></i></div> Earlier this month, Fox News confirmed that chalk addict <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004504/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/fox_news_confirms_it_is_dropping_gl.php">Glenn Beck was leaving the network</a> sometime this year.  Which is why it makes sense that he&apos;s leaving New York City, too.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004504/http://wireupdate.com/wires/16713/glenn-beck-makes-it-official-hes-leaving-new-york-city/">He told a crowd over the weekend</a>, &quot;We were each born with a purpose, born at this time for a reason. I don&#x2019;t care what your [situation] is, your job is. You were born here for a purpose and the first thing you&#x2019;ve got to do is&#x2026; have no fear. Have no fear...&quot; and, &quot;<strong>The last thing I will be doing, I will be leaving New York City.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>Beck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004504/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/finally_glenn_beck_might_start_his.php">may be starting his own network</a>&#x2014;he claims he&apos;s got a research department and he&apos;s developing a &quot;new way to communicate with each other&quot; (chalk-o-grams?).  But he doesn&apos;t want it to be in the media capital of the United States, &quot;As we build a new media I&#x2019;m not building it in New York.&quot; </p>

FWIW, his fellow conservative Rush Limbaugh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004504/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/11/limbaugh_finally_leaving_manhattan.php">sold his Manhattan apartment for over a $11 million</a>.  </p>
