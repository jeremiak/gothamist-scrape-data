</div></div>					<p>Sorry, tourists: If, after shopping at Century 21 and seeing Ground Zero, you were hoping to visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521025942/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/22/nycs_hot_new_tourist_attraction_71.php">71 Broadway</a> to tell your friends, &quot;Hey, I saw the building where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521025942/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiquestrausskahn">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a> has house arrest,&quot; you&apos;re out of luck.  The former head of the International Monetary Fund moved to a multi-million dollar townhouse at 153 Franklin Street yesterday.  However, this new location is very close to Chinatown and those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521025942/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/26/buying_a_counterfeit_bag_could_soon.php">counterfeit bags tourists seem to adore</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521025942/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/sides_agree_kahn_new_location_for_2LivNFoPUdd57uRWPlwpVK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">According to the Post</a>, &quot;The silver-haired Lothario, who only a week ago was rotting away on suicide watch in a tiny isolation cell at Rikers, will move into a three-story, 6,800 square-foot townhouse at 153 Franklin St., at $50,000 a month the most expensive rental in Tribeca, sources said yesterday.&quot; And there&apos;s &quot;a bar, home theater, gym and steam bath and spa&quot;&#x2014;not bad for a guy accused of trying to rape and forcing a hotel maid to perform oral sex on him. The Post says the luxurious property also attracted Alex Rodriguez&apos;s and Cameron Diaz&apos;s attention but &quot;Now, an accused sex monster will call it home, and with four bedrooms and five full baths there will be plenty of living space for the disgraced ex-IMF hotshot, his millionaire heiress wife - and the armed security guards on hand to prevent his escape.&quot;  </p>
