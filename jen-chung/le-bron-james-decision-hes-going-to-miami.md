</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140715025956/http://gothamist.com/tags/lebronjames">LeBron James</a> is about to announce where he&apos;ll be playing on ESPN.  Well, at least we hope he spills the beans immediately.  The intro for the ESPN special, &quot;The Decision,&quot; is ridiculous, calling him the &quot;most coveted&quot; free agent of all time.  ESPN&apos;s sources still claim he&apos;s going to Miami, but Chris Broussard said there are &quot;so many twists and turns&quot; that he could head to NY, Chicago or stay in Cleveland.  Sorry, NJ!</p>

<p>9:05 p.m.: It&apos;s still ESPN packages about how great LeBron is.  Time to check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140715025956/http://twitter.com/LeBronJamesEgo/status/18075675896">LeBron James&apos; Ego on Twitter</a>: &quot;GETTIN READY TO DO THE DAMN THING BUT SO MANY THINGS ARE ON MY MIND LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH LINDSAY LOHAN? GIRL IS LUNCHIN.&quot;</p>

<p>9:07 p.m.: Blah blah blah more ESPN stuff.  We get a shot of LeBron in the Boys and Girls Club gymnasium with Jim Gray; LeBron is wearing a gingham shirt. Jon Barry still thinks LeBron should go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140715025956/http://chicagoist.com/">Chicago</a>.  Broussard agrees that Chicago is a better fit with Derrick Rose, Carlos Boozer and Joakim Noah, but says &quot;you can&apos;t argue with Miami&quot; given that Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh.</p>

<p>9:18 p.m.: ESPN claims that LeBron will be talking after the next commercial pod.  We&apos;ll see.</p>

<p>9:22 p.m.: Jim Gray asks LeBron what&apos;s been going on this summer.  To note -- there&apos;s a huge Vitamin Water cooler in the back of the audience (VM is a sponsor).  King James says the process has been everything he&apos;s expected and more.  He claims not many know his decision.  </p>

<p>9:25 p.m.: Blah blah blah, Gray is asking how knows, when James has made up his mind, does the team know.  James: The last time he changed his mind was in his dreams; the team apparently just found out. </p>

<p>James says the major factor was for him to &quot;win now...Winning is a huge thing to me, Jim, you know that.&quot;  </p>

<p>9:27 p.m.: &quot;<strong>I&apos;m taking my talents to South Beach and joining the Miami Heat</strong>,&quot; because it&apos;s the best opportunity to win championships.  &quot;I never wanted to leave Cleveland. My heart will always be around that area.  But I also felt this is the greatest challenge for me, to move on... It&apos;s not like leaving Cleveland...it&apos;s about joining forces with the other guys...and winning for multiple years.  If this was a perfect world, I would stay.  I&apos;ve done so many great things for the team, they&apos;ve done so many great things for me.... This is a very emotional time for me.&quot;  </p>
