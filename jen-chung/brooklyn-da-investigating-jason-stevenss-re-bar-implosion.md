<p>Last Friday, DUMBO gastropub and popular wedding venue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504143029/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/09/dumbo_rebar_closed.php">reBar suddenly closed</a>, leaving employees without checks for the last three weeks of work and brides and grooms without receptions for which they&apos;d already paid. Now it seems that the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office is going to take a look.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="052314stevens.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504143029im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/052314stevens.jpg" width="325" height="263"> <br> <i style=" width:325px; ;display:block"> Where could all that money have possibly gone...</i></div> A spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office said they are looking at reBar&apos;s abrupt closure, which owner Jason Stevens claimed was due to bankruptcy in emails to staff. Stevens has apparently disappeared, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504143029/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/rebar_owner_owed_irs_millions_claim.php">some ex-employees say</a> that he made off with around $150,000 in wedding deposit checks and $27,000 in cash. Stevens had been audited by the IRS last year, and those former staffers suggest he owed $2.5-3 million in unpaid sales tax.<p></p>

<p>Weddings were booked into 2016; many couples tell us they paid up to $32,000 in cash and in full to Stevens. A law enforcement source tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504143029/http://nypost.com/2014/05/12/da-investigating-wedding-venue-owners-disappearance-with-couples-cash/">The Post that</a> &quot;authorities are also looking into multiple recent financial complaints against the business.&quot;</p>

<p>The former reBar events director, Tyler Lindsay, has been working with other now-jobless colleagues <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504143029/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/ex-rebar_employee_local_businesses.php">to help couples plan their weddings</a>. He told brides and grooms in an email on Sunday, &quot;A number of you have asked if I have access to your contracts, whether it be digital or physical. Unfortunately, I do not. The digital contracts are only accessible via a share drive that was on the reBar premises. Physical copes were kept in the events office or Jason&apos;s office, and no one has keys to those offices anymore.  Also, I&apos;m still getting questions about the deposits you&apos;ve all made and I&apos;m so sorry to say that I have no info on how the money you&apos;ve given Jason can be recovered. I&apos;m so sorry, you guys. &quot;</p>
