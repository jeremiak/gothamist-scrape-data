<p>Upper West Siders may soon have another destination for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025142536/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/crazy_lines_at_trader_joes_right_no.php">snow</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025142536/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/26/snowpocalypse_supermarket.php">natural disaster</a> panic shopping: Trader Joe&apos;s is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025142536/http://therealdeal.com/2016/03/14/trader-joes-close-to-finalizing-deal-for-new-uws-store/">reportedly close to signing a deal</a> for 20,000 square feet on Columbus Avenue between 92nd and 93rd Streets.</p>

<p>The Real Deal reports, &quot;Trader Joe&#x2019;s is in late-stage negotiations to open a new supermarket on the Upper West Side, at the base of a 30-story condominium tower [at  670 Columbus Avenue], sources told The Real Deal... A lease is expected to be signed in the next few weeks.&quot; Hopefully it&apos;ll be open by September, when we&apos;ll need to stockpile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025142536/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/01/pumpkin_trader_joes.php#photo-1">pumpkin spice items</a>.</p>

<p>The asking price-per-square foot on Columbus Avenue, according to the Real Deal, is $450(!!!).</p>

<p>There&apos;s already a Trader Joe&apos;s on Broadway at West 72nd Street; there&apos;s also a Fairway on Broadway and West 74th Street and another on 12th Avenue and West 132nd Street, plus Whole Foods locations at Columbus Circle and on Columbus Avenue and West 97th Street, in addition to other West Side Markets on Broadway at West 110th, at West 97th and at West 76th. Upper West Siders like to cook because, well, their neighborhood isn&apos;t exactly known for its variety of delicious, affordable restaurants. </p>
