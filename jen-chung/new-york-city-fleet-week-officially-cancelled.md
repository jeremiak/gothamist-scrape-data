</div></div>					<p>Thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051602/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/11/sequester-budget-cuts-likely-mean-the-end-of-new-york-citys-fleet-week/">sequestration</a>, NYC&apos;s Fleet Week festivities have been officially cancelled. </p>

<p>No sailors or ships will be sent to New York&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051602/http://www.fleetweeknewyork.com/fleetweeknewyork/">military&apos;s statement is</a>, &quot;Unfortunately, there will be no Navy ships in New York this year for Fleet Week and no additional Sailors or Marines. We look forward to the opportunity to participate in future Fleet Weeks and we greatly appreciate the city&apos;s patience and understanding during these unusual times. Thank you NYC for what you do for our service men and women each and every day. Hope to see you next year!&quot;</p>

<p>NY1 reports, &quot;A spokesperson says any Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard members who happen to be in the city will be allowed to take part in any local events that still take place.&quot;  Fleet Week usually generates $20 million for the city. The city government issued a statement, &quot;We understand the Navy&#x2019;s budgetary limitations and hope that the Fleet Week tradition can continue in 2014.&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry, aspiring Carrie Bradshaws&#x2014;finding a sailor (who looks like Daniel Sunjata&#x2014;hubba hubba) during Fleet Week will have to wait until next year, we hope.</p>
