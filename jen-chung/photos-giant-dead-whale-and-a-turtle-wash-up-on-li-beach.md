<p>According to Newsday, &quot;Allison DePerte, office administrator for the foundation, said the whale is believed to be a fin whale and the turtle is a leatherback.  Fin whales are considered the second-largest species of whale, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&quot;</p>
