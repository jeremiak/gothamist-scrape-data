<p>A man accused of sexually assaulting a woman on a Manhattan street&#x2014;and then robbing her&#x2014;apparently continued to look for the victim after she fled into a bodega. A store worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712013318/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-nice-day-robbery-fondling-victim-article-1.2524747">told the Daily News</a> that the suspect said, &quot;Have you seen my wife? Where&#x2019;s my wife?&quot;<br>
 <br>
According to the NYPD, at 5 a.m. on Friday, February 5th, a 36-year-old woman was walking on East 94th Street when a man &quot;grabbed her from behind and threw her to the ground after she crossed Second Avenue. The suspect then forced the victim to walk further down the block where he removed $40 and sexually assaulted her.&quot;</p>

<p>The News reports that the man had been outside a building and put the victim, who was on her way to work, into a chokehold, saying, &quot;Gimme your money. I&#x2019;m not gong to hurt you. Shut up.  People may be watching. Just walk with me.&quot; Near Third Avenue, he reportedly &quot;opened her jacket and unzipped her sweatshirt. He fondled her breasts, and her buttocks. Then, he told the victim, &apos;Have a nice day.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The victim then fled into a store on Second Avenue, where she asked the workers to call the police. The store worker, Luis Luna, explained to the News that the suspect asked where the victim was (she was in the back of the store), claiming he was her husband, but Luna said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, there&#x2019;s nobody, nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released video of the suspect at the store:</p>
