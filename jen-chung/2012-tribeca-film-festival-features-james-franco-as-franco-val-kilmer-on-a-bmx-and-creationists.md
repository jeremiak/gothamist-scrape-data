(USA) - North American Premiere, Narrative. James Franco stunned the film world when he committed to a regular gig on General Hospital, but the OscarÂ®-nominated actor had a clever trick up his sleeve. While shooting a key GH episode, Franco brought along a film crew. TFF award winner Ian Olds (Fixer, 2009) then repurposed Franco&#8217;s behind-the-scenes footage into an experimental psychological thriller set amid the spectacle of a celebrity&#8217;s escalating paranoia, creating a mind-bending exploration of identity.", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_1'] = photo;</script>
