<p>Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115733/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/15/donald_trump_responds_to_nyt.php">was not happy</a> about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115733/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0">NY Times&apos; deep-dive</a> into his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115733/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/14/donald_trump_is_a_disgusting_sexist.php">apparent sexism and desire to judge women</a> solely on their appearances. So today he applauded a Fox News segment that featured the first woman mentioned in the article, who appeared on Fox and Friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115733/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump">to dispute the Times&apos; account</a>. &quot;That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends,&quot; Trump tweeted, &quot;I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!&quot;</p>

<p>Rowanne Brewer Lane was 26 when she met Trump as a model in 1990. According to what she told the Times, &quot;Donald was having a pool party at Mar-a-Lago. There were about 50 models and 30 men. There were girls in the pools, splashing around. For some reason Donald seemed a little smitten with me. He just started talking to me and nobody else.&quot; He asked her if she had a bikini (she didn&apos;t), &quot;I hadn&#x2019;t intended to swim. He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a swimsuit.&quot; And when she came out of the bathroom, she says Trump said, &quot;Wow&quot; and then took her to the crowd, &quot;He brought me out to the pool and said, &quot;That is a stunning Trump girl, isn&#x2019;t it?&apos;&quot;</p>

Today, on Fox and Friends, Lane insists that her interaction with Trump was terrific and that the Times misrepresented themselves, &quot;They promised several times that they would do it accurately... They told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece. And my story would come across the way i was telling it and honestly, and it absolutely did not. They spun it... I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump.&quot;

<p>She also said, &quot;He never made me feel like I was demeaned. He never offended me in any way. He was very gracious. I saw him around all types of people, all types of women. He was very kind thoughtful, generous... he was a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, Trump also claims that another lamestream media outlet is wrong:</p>
