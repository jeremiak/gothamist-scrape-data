<p>New York City&apos;s best-known dermatologist, Dr. Jonathon Zizmor, is no longer selling rainbow-tinted dreams of blemish-free skin. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/dr-jonathan-zizmor-70-retires-closes-nyc-office-article-1.2484218">The Daily News reports</a> that he has retired and closed his Upper East Side office. His realtor said, &quot;The Zizmors love to travel and have many social interests, hobbies, and friends. At the end of the day, they are just like the rest of us.&quot;</p>

<p>Zizmor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/14/dr_zizmors_palace.php#photo-1">put his Fieldston palace for sale</a>, and it stayed on the market for years; currently, Streeteasy indicates that it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815/https://streeteasy.com/building/5021-iselin-avenue-bronx#tab_building_detail=1">&quot;in contract&quot; fro $3,075,000</a>, which is a far cry from the original $4.3 million asking price in 2012. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/08/dr_z.php">In a 2009 interview with us</a>, Dr. Zizmor and his wife Alexandra spoke about their revolutionary marketing idea to advertise on the NYC subway:</p><blockquote>Dr. Zizmor: There were none, there were no doctors ads. Why did I do it? In those days, dermatology was very exclusive, chic, chic. Most people, different ethnicity groups didn&apos;t even know there were dermatologists. I felt I wanted to open it up, treat people of all demographics and so on. And I really started doing that, from the very rich to the poor, black, white, whatever. So I was the only one on the subway for about 25 years. <p></p>

<p>Alexandra Zizmor: And people didn&apos;t like it. </p>

<p>Dr. Z:  I got a lot of heat. </p>

<p>AZ: Cause you think about doctors, it&apos;s like the academia. Doctors weren&apos;t even in the yellow pages. So here this guy comes along and he&apos;s like advertising on the subway. Meanwhile how many doctors do you now see? It&apos;s like crazy. He was the forefront guy. </p>

<p>Dr. Z: The only one, the only one. If I didn&apos;t have the background, I wouldn&apos;t have had the guts to do it. I would have gotten a lot more heat.</p></blockquote>He also said, &quot;I ride the subway all the time. And when I ride the subway, I never see my poster. Like, let&apos;s say when I want to show my wife the new poster and they say it&apos;s in one out of every five cars. And car after car after car, it&apos;s not there. I mean, I have people working who tell me it&apos;s there. I see them occasionally, but really just occasionally. When I see the posters, no one recognizes me. But I try not to sit under the poster.&quot; His wife pointed out, &quot;[Riders] would notice that&apos;s he&apos;s relatively older,&quot; which Zizmor explained, &quot;It&apos;s a 25-year-old picture. It&apos;s hard to do transparency, the color always comes out wrong. So that&apos;s why we use a 25-year-old picture.&quot;<p></p>

<p>This is what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/11/dr_zizmor.php">Dr. Zizmor looked like in 2014</a>, by the way:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_01_ziz2014.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_01_ziz2014.jpg" width="640" height="416"> <br> <i> Zizmor through the ages</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A family member told the News that the dermatologist &quot;now spends his time studying the Talmud.&quot; And Waibel said, &quot;Because they are very giving people, I am sure it is only a matter of time before they are involved in their next charitable project.&quot;</p>

<p>Zizmor&apos;s effect on pop culture will live on forever&#x2014;most notably with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OG8IT8cdiI">Nick Kroll&apos;s Dr. Armond</a>, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926041815/http://observer.com/2013/01/nick-kroll-on-dr-zizmor-parody-ads-padma-lakshmi-and-chris-kattan/">&quot;more than inspired&quot; by Zizmor</a>&#x2014;thanks to YouTube:</p>

<p>He also has a good sense of humor&#x2014;here&apos;s his appearance in a trailer for the New York Underground Film Festival:</p>

<p>Thank you, Dr. Zizmor!</p>
