Newsday reports 30-year-old police officer Kenneth Baribault &quot;suffered severe head trauma, as well as broken bones in both his upper and lower torso&quot; and underwent surgery for a blood clot.  </p>

<p>After pulling over a Kia SUV&apos;s for drunk driving, Baribault went back into his patrol car when a Mercedes CLK320 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112909/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6150486">rammed into the patrol car and pushed it into the SUV</a>.  From WABC 7:&quot;Witnesses say the back of the police car probably lifted six feet off the ground upon impact. <strong>The back of that patrol car almost meets where the driver was sitting.</strong> The rear wheel on the driver&apos;s side is touching the seat where the driver sits in that patrol car.&quot;</p>

<p>Off-duty FDNY firefighter Philip Scarfi was on the LIE when the accident occurred and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112909/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05192008/news/regionalnews/bravest_saves_cop_111489.htm">crossed six lanes of traffic, &quot;[hopped] over a four-foot concrete median&quot;</a> with his emergency kit.  Scarfi said Baribault was &quot;unconscious, wedged between the dashboard and front seat and not breathing ...His face was blue.&quot; Scarfi said the Mercedes&apos; driver, Rahiem Griffin, offered to help (but the firefighter picked someone else to help stabilize the cop).</p>

<p>Griffin, who was driving with a suspended license, was charged with DWI, as was the Kia&apos;s driver, Marcin Bykuc.</p>
