</div></div>					<p>Have you ever wanted to see Mayor Bloomberg go down a huge slide? Or do an assisted somersault?  Or &quot;joke&quot; about another term? Or read the mommy erotica sensation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321104302/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/26/mommy_erotica_book_50_shades_of_gre.php">Fifty Shades of Grey</a>? Then last night&apos;s Inner Circle Show was the place to be.  The show, put on by the city&apos;s political reporters with proceeds going to charity, featured various skits but the showstopper was the mayor&apos;s &quot;How To Succeed By Bloomberg&quot; bit with <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321104302/http://www.howtosucceedbroadway.com/">How to Succeed In Business</a></em>&apos;s actual stars Nick Jonas and Beau Bridges.  Watch a montage:</p>

<p>The mayor&apos;s segment paid accolades to his book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321104302/http://www.amazon.com/Bloomberg-Michael-R/dp/0471208884">Bloomberg by Bloomberg</a>; spoofed the nanny state (&quot;Starting Monday, no chewing gum&quot;); <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321104302/http://twitter.com/#!/SallyGold/status/186317287622590464">mentioned his fancy decor</a>; had Schools Chancellor Derek Walcott in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321104302/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/06/2011_ing_nyc_marathon_takes_over_bi_1.php">running clothes</a>; and included Stu Loeser groupies (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321104302/http://twitter.com/#!/SallyGold/status/186317287622590464">aka &quot;Stupies&quot;</a>). </p>
