	<p>Yes, a handful of members <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101504/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/26/fob_story_citi_bike_keys_still_miss.php">don&apos;t have their fobs yet</a>, but New York City&apos;s bike share, Citi Bike, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101504/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/dot_bike_share_will_begin_on_memori.php">is launching today</a>. And The New Yorker has devoted its newest cover to it:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101504/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_citinyers.jpg"> <img alt="2013_05_citinyers.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101504im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/05/2013_05_citinyers-thumb-900x1229-792241.jpg" width="640" height="873" class="image-none"> </a> </span></p>

<p>The cover was illustrated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101504/http://www.marcellushall.com/">Marcellus Hall</a>, who tells the magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101504/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/05/cover-story-urban-cycles-marcellus-hall.html#slide_ss_0=1">he&apos;s been cycling in the city</a> for 15 years, &quot;I&#x2019;ve only been &#x2018;doored&#x2019; twice. I&#x2019;m very careful. I look into the side mirrors of the parked cars to see if there&#x2019;s movement inside. I ride only on the left side of the street because there&#x2019;s less of chance of a passenger getting out than of a driver. Actually, I read it in some cyclist publication that, as a cyclist, you&#x2019;re allowed to take up a whole lane and sometimes, I even do that&#x2014;though it&#x2019;s a risky proposition. I&#x2019;m not one of those hard-core bike freaks; it&#x2019;s just a good way for me to get around in the city.&quot;</p>

<p>Citi Bike launches at 11 a.m. GET READY.</p>
