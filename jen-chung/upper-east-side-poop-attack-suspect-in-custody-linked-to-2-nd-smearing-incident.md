<p>The man suspected of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022935/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/30/ues_feces_attack.php">grabbing a woman and then stuffing a bag of feces down her shorts</a> on a Manhattan street is in custody. Police also believe he&apos;s behind another incident where he used poop to smear a woman. </p>

<p>Investigators released video showing the horrifying June 27th assault: A 27-year-old woman who was walking on East 74th Street, between York and First Avenues, is suddenly grabbed by a man who then shoved the bag of feces down her clothes. Then the man continues walking down the street, taking off gloves and tossing them on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told reporters yesterday that they believed the man struck earlier that afternoon: On 91st Street near Madison Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022935/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-accused-of-attacking-2-women-with-feces-on-ues-now-in-police-custody-/1409518/">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;the suspect threw feces and struck his 33-year-old female victim in face and torso. It is unclear if there was a bag used in that incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Boyce called them &quot;really disgusting attacks. We think its the same male...a completely deranged person from what we can tell.&quot;</p>
