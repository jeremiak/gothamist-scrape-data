<p>House Speaker Paul Ryan is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/05/08/paul-ryan-to-visit-success-academy-school-in-harlem-111879">expected to visit a Success Academy charter school</a> today&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170508/central-harlem/success-academy-charter-paul-ryan-visit">protesters will be there to greet him</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/paul-ryan-visit-charter-school-harlem-sources-article-1.3147821">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The NYPD referred a request for comment to the city Education Department, which didn&apos;t immediately respond. But staffers from a district-run school that shares the W. 118th St. building with Success Academy said that the NYPD visited the school on Monday to inform them of Ryan&apos;s plan.&quot; </p>

<p>A teacher in the building told the News, &quot;They said they&apos;re closing down the street and he&apos;s coming to visit Success Academy.&quot;</p>

<p>Ryan will reportedly stop by the school at 11:30 a.m., and a number of advocacy groups, including Alliance for Quality Education, Working Families Party, Make the Road NY and Metro NY Health Care for All, said they&apos;d be there, according to a joint press release issued by the groups: &quot;Speaker Ryan&#x2019;s policies, from healthcare, to immigration, to women&#x2019;s rights, to education all most negatively impact people of color and low-income and working class people. Groups protest this and Moskowitz&#x2019;s disregard for the issues affecting her school communities.&quot;</p>

<p>City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/http://observer.com/2017/05/council-speaker-mark-viverito-eva-moskowitz-paul-ryan-success-charter-school-harlem/">said on Monday,</a> &quot;[W]hen Speaker Ryan comes to New York City, we let him know what we think about his agenda, right? And we should be denouncing and holding [Success Academy CEO] Eva Moskowitz responsible and accountable for bringing him here to our community.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Observer, Mark-Viverito added, &quot;[C]oming into Harlem at that, right, where the decisions [the GOP is] making are having severe, detrimental impacts on communities that we represent is pretty, pretty disturbing.&quot;</p>

<p>Politico notes that Ryan&apos;s visit &quot;will be the latest in a series of high-profile visits by Republicans to the city&apos;s largest and most controversial charter network. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has visited Success Academy 1 in Harlem, and Ivanka Trump visited the same school shortly after the presidential election in November.&quot; </p>

<p>Success Academy boasts about its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/http://www.successacademies.org/results/">high performing students</a>&#x2014;and their corresponding test results&#x2014;as they continue to expand in the city. Critics say that the schools <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/success_academy_lawsuit_disabilitie.php">discriminate against special needs students</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/30/success_academy_charter.php">other struggling students</a>. Last year, a video showed a Success charter teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509193820/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/25/success_academy_video.php">apparently bullying a first-grader</a>. </p>
