<p>Penn Station&apos;s subway platforms are no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125433/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/11/rain_makes_curt.php">stranger to water features</a>&#x2014;but Bryant Park&apos;s subway platform wanted to get into the act too!</p>

<p>On the bright side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125433/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/01/video_when_it_rains_it_pours_inside.php">it wasn&apos;t on a train, right</a>?</p>

<p>As for subway flooding (there were some issues along the 4/5/6), the subway system is mostly underground, and on a day without rain, the MTA already pumps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125433/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/09/subway_hell.php">13 million gallons of groundwater out of the system</a>.  So when there&apos;s a lot of rain&#x2014;and fast&#x2014;the system can flood.  The MTA has been trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125433/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/21/subway_floodfig.php">combat this for years</a>&#x2014;yes, today&apos;s storm was crazy, but it was no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125433/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/08/wild_wednesday.php">August 8, 2007 storm</a> where all the subways were basically flooded!</p>
