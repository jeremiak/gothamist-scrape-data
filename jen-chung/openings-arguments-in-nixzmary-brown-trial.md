<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122322im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_daveh/nixzmary_3.jpg" class="left">Prosecutor Ama Dwimoh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122322/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/09/18/2008-09-18_nixzmary_browns_last_words_revealed_as_m.html">told jurors what 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown&apos;s final words</a> were, <strong>&quot;Mommy, Mommy, Mommy&quot; &quot;after being beaten, battered, broken and thrown naked onto a cold wooden floor.&quot;</strong>  Brown&apos;s mother Nixzaliz Santiago is on trial for the girl&apos;s murder, as the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office contends Santiago did nothing to prevent her husband Cesar Rodriguez from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122322/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/13/tragic_life_and.php">delivering a fatal beating</a> in January 2006. Dwimoh added, &quot;She left her to die. Nixzaliz Santiago simply did not care.&quot;</p>

<p>Santiago&apos;s lawyer Sammy Sanchez, however, said his client &quot;is not a monster,&quot; and said Rodriguez, already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122322/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/18/still_no_verdic.php">convicted of manslaughter</a>, was &quot;the real killer.  <strong>He was the one who masqueraded as a father, as a husband, and turned out to be a killer.</strong> Nixzaliz Santiago was also a victim. ... The entire family was victimized by this monster.&quot;  </p>

<p>Sanchez also painted Santiago as a troubled woman, who insisted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122322/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/nyregion/19nixzmary.html?ref=nyregion">keeping a jar with a miscarried fetus</a> and was also afraid of leaving Rodriguez and retreating back into the shelter system.  did admit his client knew Nixzmary was beaten &quot;but said she had no idea that the child was suffering from a brain injury that led to her death,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122322/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nynizx0919,0,5891482.story">according to Newsday</a>.</p>

<p>The first witness, a police officer who responded to a call hours after Nixzmary died, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122322/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/86015/first-witness-to-testify-in-trial-of-nixzmary-s-mother/Default.aspx">expected to testify today</a>.
