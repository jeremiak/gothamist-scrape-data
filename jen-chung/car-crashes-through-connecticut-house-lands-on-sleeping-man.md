<p>Earlier this morning, a car chase turned into one man&apos;s nightmare when a vehicle being pursued by Connecticut police crashed into a home in New Haven and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203061051/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Police-Pursuit-Ends-In-Real-Life-Nightmare-for-Sleeping-Man-138383629.html">landed on top of a sleeping man</a>.   The tenant, Michael Sweat, was trapped under the car for an hour and was taken to the hospital with second- and third-degree burns.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203061051/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/northern_suburbs&amp;id=8525535">According to the AP</a>, police officers in Hamden noticed a BMW X5 SUV that was wanted for various motor vehicle violations around 12:30 a.m.: &quot;The officers tried stopping the SUV... but the driver led them on a pursuit through the Southern Connecticut State University campus and into New Haven. Hamden police dispatchers notified New Haven police, and told them officers had tried to stop the vehicle using &apos;stop sticks,&apos; which the suspect swerved to avoid. The suspect lost control in New Haven&apos;s Newhallville neighborhood, slamming into a corner house. The BMW crashed through the home&apos;s facade, ending up fully within a first-floor bedroom and on top of Sweat, who was asleep in his bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Rescue workers had to shore up the house while they were rescuing Sweat.  And the suspect ran away.  Earlier this month, a NY teen was lucky to be alive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203061051/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/04/car_crashes_into_teen_bedroom_windo.php">when a car crashed through his bedroom window</a>. </p>
