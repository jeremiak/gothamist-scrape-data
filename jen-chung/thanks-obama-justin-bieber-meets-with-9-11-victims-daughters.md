Payton Wall and Madison Robertson, whose fathers died on September 11, 2001 while working at Cantor Fitzgerald, met the pop star on Thursday during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085032/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/tiny_justin_bieber_has_been_injured.php">his Macy&apos;s appearance</a>.  Payton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085032/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hail_to_the_bieb_nNQlGvuPEPGBiO1b4sqLLM">told the Post</a>, &quot;It was so cool. I couldn&apos;t even believe it,&quot; and before the visit, Madison <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085032/http://twitter.com/#!/Madisonerinn/status/83922290890375168">had Tweeted</a>, &quot;@ppaayyttaann obama kept his promise, off to see @justinbieber.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Bieber was at Macy&apos;s to promote his new perfume, Someday, and Payton revealed that he stayed on message with meeting with her, Madison and her little sister Avery, &quot;He just said &apos;Hi.&apos; He was asking us about the perfume and if we were wearing it.&quot;  Also, fun fact: Payton was more nervous around Bieber than Obama.</p>

<p>Payton had been inspired to contact the President after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085032/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/07/bieber-inspired_911_victims_daughte.php">seeing Bieber&apos;s film <em>Never Say Never</em></a> (&quot;We were so amazed by his story and how he never said never. It inspired us to believe in our selves and share our story to encourage others&quot;) and the White House randomly selected her letter as one for Obama. The President mentioned her during a speech and to meet her during his visit to the World Trade Center site in May, where he also bragged that he knew Bieber and could maybe help her with her dreams to meet the tiny Canadian phenomenon. </p>

<p>The young Bieber fans also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085032/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hail_to_the_bieb_nNQlGvuPEPGBiO1b4sqLLM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=/">brought along a cardboard cutout of Obama</a>.</p>
