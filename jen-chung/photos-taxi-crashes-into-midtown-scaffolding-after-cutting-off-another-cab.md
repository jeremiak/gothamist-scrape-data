But no: Earlier this morning at 1:30 a.m., a cab crashed into scaffolding on Sixth Avenue, between 36th and 37th Streets in midtown Manhattan&#x2014;allegedly <em>after trying to beat another cab to a fare</em>. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006162848/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9216245">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;One taxi driver said the other cab cut him off after spotting a customer on the other side of the street. &apos;I cross from the left hand side to pick a customer, and it was too close to save the accident,&apos; driver Jacob Owusu said. &apos;He cut me off. For a fare...He came from the other side. The left side there. He crossed. He saw the customer first, I didn&apos;t see the customer.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The scaffolding outside the building was destroyed and it&apos;s been removed now.</p>
