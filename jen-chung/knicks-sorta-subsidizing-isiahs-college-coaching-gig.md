The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173003/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=4070376">AP reports</a>, &quot;Thomas said his salary the first year from the Golden Panthers will be donated back to the school&apos;s athletic department... FIU athletic director Pete Garcia said that when Thomas learned about layoffs and budget cuts, he told the university president that the school should keep his salary.&quot;  Of course, the Knicks still owe him $12 million for the rest of his contract.  Thomas told reporters, &quot;I like rolling up my sleeves. I like taking some from the bottom and building it to the top. There&apos;s a lot of risk in that and there is also a lot of reward in that. But that&apos;s how I grew up.&quot;  Remember when Isiah said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173003/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/03/holy_shit_isiah.php">would bring a championship</a> to the Knicks?  Good luck, FIU.  <br>
