<p>This might be one of the more unusual photographs of a grand larceny suspect&#x2014;it&apos;s like the Case of the Hobbling Hirsute Perp! </p>

<p>The NYPD released this photograph to the media, explaining that this guy allegedly stole a laptop from 420 West 118th Street in Manhattan, which happens to be the location of Columbia&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151552/http://sipa.columbia.edu/about_sipa/visitor_info.html">School of International and Public Affairs</a>. The alleged theft took place on March 6, at 2:10 p.m.&#x2014;cops say, &quot;The suspect removed the victims bag which contained a laptop and fled the scene.&quot; Not very fast, we&apos;d say!</p>

The police describe him as a white male who was walking with crutches. We&apos;d call him a hipster if he was turning towards the Vespa. </p>
