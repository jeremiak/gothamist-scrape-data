<p>The NY State Police<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002955/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jdM23X4aUJ3OqFEO55gvQ9hNi6CA?docId=cfd2b50fbcfd4974bdc326fd28d9e149"> joined in the investigation</a> of the Westchester police shooting of Pace University student Danroy &quot;D.J.&quot; Henry.  The 20-year-old football player was killed after a confrontation with police: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002955/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/18/pace_university_student_shot_and_ki.php">Mount Pleasant police claimed</a> that a Pleasantville cop knocked on Henry&apos;s window, but Henry accelerated, with the cop on his hood, so the cop fired; another police officer fired when Henry drove towards him.  But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002955/http://www.LoHud.com/article/20101019/NEWS02/10190337/Passenger-in-Danroy-Henry-death-We-did-nothing-to-provoke-what-happened-">one of Henry&apos;s passengers said</a>, &quot;We did nothing to provoke what happened. It was just an unjust situation that we happened to be in.&quot;</p>

<p>Brandon Cox, whose arm was grazed by a bullet, added, &quot;He didn&apos;t and we didn&apos;t deserve anything that happened that night.&quot; Cox&apos;s mother told the Journal News, &quot;D.J. started moving because he knew he was in the &apos;no parking&apos; zone. As he was moving out, all of a sudden, another police officer jumps from behind a cruiser with gun drawn. D.J. didn&apos;t have time to stop, and hit him. Then they just started shooting.&quot;  The police officer who apparently fired the fatal bullet was identified as Aaron Hess, 33, &quot;a former New York City officer on the local force since 2003.&quot; </p>

<p>Police were at the strip mall, because a crowd formed outside a bar, which had thrown patrons out for fighting.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002955/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/10/19/2010-10-19_they_shot_at_us_for_no_reason_li_slain_grid_player_was_told_to_move_car_pal_sez_.html">Westchester DA Janet DiFiore said</a>, &quot;Witnesses will be interviewed, all evidence collected will be analyzed and video surveillance will be reviewed.&quot;</p>
