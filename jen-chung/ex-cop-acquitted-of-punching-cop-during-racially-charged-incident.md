Almonor and his wife had been arguing with cops at the Harlem station house that their 14-year-old son, who was arrested in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170712/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/nypd_stop_and_frisks_reach_record_h.php">stop-and-frisk</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170712/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/09/cop_vs_cop_paralyzing_punch_brings.php">was the victim of racial profiling</a>. Almonor&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170712/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/nyregion/ex-officer-acquitted-of-assaulting.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;<strong>The verdict supports the claim that their son was picked up only because he was African-American.</strong>&quot;  <p></p>

<p>In March 2010, Almonor&apos;s wife, Wilma Dore-Almonor, burst into the 30th Precinct (while Almonor was looking for parking), and quickly found herself into a heated confrontation with police officers&#x2014;cops allegedly told her, &quot;If you don&apos;t calm down, we&apos;ll have to ask you to leave&quot; and &quot;Get out or we&apos;ll have you arrested,&quot; while she told the cop that arrested her son, &quot;I know that you&#x2019;re a racist because I&#x2019;ve seen you in action&quot; and allegedly said, &quot;Get those f---ing cuffs off my son!&quot; Dore-Almonor was then arrested and she claims she was also punched by a female cop and other cops were stepping on her back. When Almonor entered, he allegedly punched a female cop.  </p>

<p> Dore-Almonor was charged with trespassing (a violation, not a crime), misdemeanor trespassing, and misdemeanor resisting arrest, and the Times reports the jury convicted her of trespassing and acquitted her of misdemeanor trespassing. The jury is still deciding on the resisting arrest charge.  </p>

<p>Almonor said after the verdict, &quot;I feel like I got my life back. I feel like I&#x2019;m living again. For a whole year I was like a walking zombie. This thing drains you.&quot;  The family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170712/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/retired_cop_suing_city_over_fight_i.php">is suing the city</a>.</p>
