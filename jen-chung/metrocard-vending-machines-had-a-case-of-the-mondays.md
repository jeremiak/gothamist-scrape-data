The problem first occurred during the morning rush and was resolved by 10 a.m. (says NYC Transit), but then reappeared during the evening rush hour.  This seems to happen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007065300/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/07/metrocard_machi.php">every so often</a>, which is all the more reason to keep a backup Metrocard.</p>
