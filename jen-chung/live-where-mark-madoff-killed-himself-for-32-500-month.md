                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_06_madoffapt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118081510im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_madoffapt.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i>From the rental listing</i></div> <p></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118081510/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2011/06/07/mark_madoffs_soho_loft_available_for_rent_at_32500month.php#mercer-rental-1">to a Curbed tipster</a>, a new four-bedroom rental available for just $32,500 at 158 Mercer Street is the former apartment of the late Mark Madoff&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118081510/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/nyregion/the-appraisal-high-priced-rentals-are-all-the-rage.html?ref=nyregion">expensive rentals are all the rage</a>, don&apos;t you know? Curbed says, &quot;The listing doesn&apos;t make the connection (we can&apos;t blame it for wanting to fly under the radar) and we haven&apos;t yet heard back from the broker, but the details line up: Mark Madoff and wife Stephanie purchased the 4,169-square-foot #4M for $6.075 million in 2005. The brokerbabble describes the apartment as having &apos;a very high end, magnificent renovation.&apos;&quot; Of course, Madoff, son of Ponzi schemer extraordinaire Bernard Madoff, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118081510/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/12/mark_madoffs_suicide_followed_final.php">killed himself in his apartment last December</a>.</p>

<p>The tabloids reported that Madoff was found hanging in the apartment by his father-in-law (while his baby was sleeping in another room):  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118081510/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/12/11/2010-12-11_bernie_madoffs_son_mark_hangs_himself_in_soho_apartment_sources_say.html">Daily News revealed</a>, per police sources, that Madoff &quot;knotted the black leash around a steel pole in a lighting rack on the living room ceiling&quot; and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118081510/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/15/mark_madoff_cremated_had_trouble_ha.php">Post detailed</a> that police found a vaccum cleaner cord and another dog leash, which were both snapped&#x2014;apparently because Madoff failed in hanging himself using those materials.</p>
