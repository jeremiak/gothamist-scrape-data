<p><em>Saturday Night Live </em>will be a very different show this fall, with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173748/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/19/videos_saturday_night_live_bids_far.php#photo-1">departures of Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis</a>, but it&apos;ll return with a familiar face on September 28th: Former cast member and head writer Tina Fey will be hosting the season premiere. Arcade Fire will be the musical guest. Does this mean Amy Poehler will resurface too? Please?</p>

<p>Then, on October 5th, hosting and musical act duties will be performed by Miley Cyrus, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173748/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/miley_cyrus_vmas.php">meme of the moment</a> (yay, more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173748/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/19/video_cookie_monster_rocks_snl_with.php#photo-7">Vanessa Bayer as Miley</a>!). A week later, Bruce Willis will host with Katy Perry as musical guest. </p>
