<p>A woman was beaten by a man who broke into her home as she was watching cartoons with her toddler. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622171120/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/24/n-j-mom-attacked-brutally-beaten-in-front-of-3-year-old-in-own-home/">The victim told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;He brutally beat me in front of my daughter. She watched the whole thing.&quot;</p>

<p>The violence from last Friday was caught on the family&apos;s nanny cam. Apparently the suspect managed to break down a back door of the Millburn, NJ home and happened upon the woman, who was making breakfast. Her toddler was with her while a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622171120/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Millburn-New-Jersey-Violent-Home-Robbery-Woman-Assaulted-Surveillance-Video-212855501.html">baby boy was sleeping upstairs</a>; her husband was at work in New York City. </p>

<p>According to WCBS 2, &quot;Once he was inside, the mom said the man began viciously beating her, eventually throwing her down a set of stairs. Her swollen and bloodshot eye and swollen lip were proof the man showed no mercy &#x2014; not even in front of the woman&#x2019;s 3 year-old daughter.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622171120/http://newjersey.news12.com/news/beating-attack-robbery-of-young-millburn-mother-caught-on-surveillance-video-1.5560562?firstfree=yes">victim told News 12</a>, &quot;I knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would too, and I was afraid she would get hurt. I took it. I didn&apos;t cry the entire time.&quot; She suffered bruising and a concussion. </p>

<p>The authorities believe the suspect thought the house was empty, because the shades were drawn and no car was in the driveway. The suspect, who is still at large, took the woman&apos;s wedding ring and other jewelry. The victim says, &#x201C;This can happen to anyone and you know what? If he can break my door down, he&#x2019;s going to break your door down.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone with information or who can identify the individual in the photo is asked to call Millburn Police at 973-564-7001. </p>
