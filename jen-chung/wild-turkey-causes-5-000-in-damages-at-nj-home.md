<p>Last week, a NJ resident was the victim of a, well, a <em>turkey </em>that went berserk inside her Kinnelon home. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522013205/http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2013/09/turkey_runs_amok_in_kinnelon_home_causes_5000_in_damages_cops_say.html#incart_river_default">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;a turkey had smashed through one of her home&apos;s windows and broken into the building&quot; and then &quot;ran amok once inside the home by breaking shelving, vases and other items and poking holes in sheet rock.&quot;</p>

<p>The turkey, a male &quot;tom,&quot; tried to peck its way out of another window but police say it could only manage to get its head out: &quot;When police arrived on the scene to try to remove the bird, the turkey ran into another room and crashed through a five-by-five double-pane window before fleeing into the woods, [Police Lt.] Schwartz said.&quot; </p>

<p>Schwartz added, &quot;There were feces everywhere&quot; and estimated damages at $5,000. Apparently turkeys are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522013205/http://www.njnwcoa.com/wildturkey.html">freaked out by reflections</a> of themselves, so they peck at shiny surfaces. And suddenly it seems we have a lot more in common with turkeys than we ever realized. </p>
