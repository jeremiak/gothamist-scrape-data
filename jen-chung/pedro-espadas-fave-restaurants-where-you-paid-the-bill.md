<p>We&apos;ve known that former Bronx State Senator Pedro Espada loves to (allegedly) eat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/16/espadas_bronx_clinic_ran_low_on_med.php">$100,000 in meals by using public money</a> from his <em>publicly-funded</em> health clinic, Soundview Health Clinic. Last month, federal prosecutors said that Espada and his family spent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/prosecutor_pedro_espada_spent_60k_o.php">about $60,000 on sushi and lobster</a> and finally the NY Post has broken out Pedro&apos;s Picks For Publicly-Funded Family Dinners.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/sushi_urprise_QvzaI9ViPARHA9pJfnrDnI">Post reports</a>, &quot;He billed his publicly funded health clinic about $103,000 for meals between 2005 and 2009, including more than $20,000 for a staggering 214 visits to a single sushi restaurant. He rang up another $63,000 in bills for nearly 400 meals at nine other eateries. Representatives of all 10 restaurants have testified at Espada&#x2019;s embezzlement trial in Brooklyn Federal Court that family members regularly dined with Espada &#x2014; and none of the meals appeared to be business expenses.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://toyosushi.com/">Toyo Sushi</a>, Pedro&apos;s #1 restaurant, is in Mamaroneck in Westchester County and its food gets a 22 from Zagat.  Of course, Mamaroneck is where Espada has a controversial home.  Besides prosecutors saying  he also billed taxpayers for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/18/espada_allegedly_stole_money_from_c.php">sweet white picket fence there</a>, it seemed as though Espada was spending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/21/bronx_state_senator_blocking_mta_ba.php">more time in Westchester</a> than the Bronx district he was elected from.  After losing re-election, Espada <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/27/pedro_espada_selling_his_fake_home.php">sold the Bronx apartment in 2011</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the beginning of Espada&apos;s defense team&apos;s presentation of witnesses.  But that didn&apos;t go so well: First defense witness was management consultant  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602133338/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/pedro-espada-defense-witness-refers-state-senator-a-soprano-article-1.1065304?localLinksEnabled=false">Cynthia Prorok, who said</a>, &#x201C;The [Soundview] staff I met with seemed nervous and guarded. You could cut the tension with a knife... It was very controlling. It was like being in an episode of &#x2018;The Sopranos.&apos;&quot; Then, when Prorok says she asked about Espada&apos;s crazy-high salary and benefits package of $600,000+ (a lot higher than other health clinic administrators) and went to look at his personnel file, Espada grabbed it from her and &quot;caused my calculator to fly under the table.&quot;</p>
