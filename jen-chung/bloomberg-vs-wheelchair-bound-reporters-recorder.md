<p>While Governor Paterson&apos;s press conference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508221127/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/16/paterson_proposes_to_legalize_gay_m.php">announcing the introduction of same-sex legislation</a> was an monumental landmark event, there was a very awkward moment.  Right before Mayor Bloomberg was to speak, some music started playing which made him freak out more than a little.</p>

<p>It turned out that music was from a recorder owned by disabled reporter Michael Harris (of the Examiner).  Harris later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508221127/http://www.politickerny.com/3115/wheelchair-bound-reporter-singled-out-bloomberg-wants-apology">told PolitickerNY</a> &quot;a photographer knocked over his jacket which held his recorder. When it fell onto the ground, the recorded starting playing. Harris said he at first didn&#x2019;t realize where the noise was coming from, but once he did, he could not reach down and get to the recorder easily.&quot;  So during the press conference, Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508221127/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/that-sound-you-heard-was-the-mayors-irritation/">continued to show his irritation</a>&#x2014;as CityRoom reports: </p><blockquote>The noise, which was not playing loudly enough for most other people in the room to notice, rattled Mr. Bloomberg.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Can we just stop this, and maybe we&#x2019;ll start again?&#x201D; the mayor asked.</p>

<p>At that point the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, leaned over to the mayor, covered the microphone on the lectern and whispered in his ear, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s disabled.&#x201D;<br>
Mr. Harris&#x2019;s disability, and the fact that he was clearly having difficulty reaching the recorder to shut it off, was apparently of little consequence to the mayor.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I understand that &#x2014; he can still turn it off,&#x201D; Mr. Bloomberg was overheard saying.</p></blockquote>Bloomberg apparently kept looking at Harris while saying, &quot;Maybe we should take everything outside.&quot;  Harris was upset by the Mayor&apos;s behavior, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508221127/http://www.politickerny.com/3115/wheelchair-bound-reporter-singled-out-bloomberg-wants-apology">telling PolitickerNY</a> that he was &#x201C;quite embarrassed at being singled out like that... I think the mayor took something very minor and made it into something major and was a very cheap shot at me. I do think an apology would be in order here.&quot; PolitickerNY also has video of the incident (above). <p></p>

<p>Another reporter offered some choice words about the mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508221127/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/04/heres_the_mayor.php">to the Village Voice&apos;s Running Scared</a>: &quot;What a dickhead. Michael is a good guy and doesn&apos;t deserve this shit from Mayor Midget.&quot;</p>
