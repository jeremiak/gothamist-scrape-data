The editorial then looks at Governor Paterson&apos;s and Representative Charles Rangel&apos;s rent-stabilized living situations (Paterson also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210038/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/16/governor_paters_2.php">has a home upstate</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210038/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/11/congressman_charles_rangel_and_his.php">Rangel</a> has a villa in the Dominican Republic).  The Sun writes, &quot;The effect is that a measure originally designed to keep the lower and middle classes from being forced out of the city <strong>has become a program that effectively subsidizes country homes outside the city for the upper middle class</strong>.&quot;</p>
