										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2017_04_mmspicey.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004224327im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_04_mmspicey.jpg" width="640" height="463"> <br> <i> Whee!</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Melissa McCarthy will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004224327/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/16/melissa_mccarthy_the_rock_jimmy_fal.php">hosting on May 13</a>, but she returned to the show last night&#x2014;for the first <em>Saturday Night Live</em> broadcast live across the country and Canada&#x2014;once again playing extremely beleaguered White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. As Easter is a time for forgiveness, McCarthy&apos;s Spicer apologized for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004224327/http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/sean-spicer-is-very-sorry-about-his-holocaust-comments">his Holocaust gaffe</a>, &quot;Spicey finally made a mistake. I know they&#x2019;re not really called the &#x2018;Holocaust centers&#x2019;&#x2026;I clearly meant to say &#x2018;concentration club,&#x2019; okay? Let it drop!&quot;</p>

<p>McCarthy was appeared in an Easter Bunny costume, a nod to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004224327/http://www.silive.com/news/2017/04/as_prep.html">Spicer&apos;s actual White House history</a>, explaining that everyone needed to &quot;shut up&quot; because he was &quot;sweating [his] Easter eggs&quot; in the outfit. &quot;Spicer&quot; also mangled Bashar al-Assad&apos;s name during the apology, referring to him as &quot;Bazooka Phylicia Ahmad Rashad.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It would be really great if the nitpickers could try and see the big picture and didn&#x2019;t solely focus on every little slur and lie I say,&quot; an exasperated &quot;Spicer&quot; said. &quot;P.S., I would like you to also know, that I am sensitive to the fact that they were sent there on trains but hey, at least they didn&#x2019;t have to fly United&#x2014;am I right?&quot; </p>

<p>Then &quot;Spicey&quot; decided to educate all the &quot;goys&quot; about Passover&#x2014;and used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004224327/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeggieTales">Veggie Tales</a> dolls to do so. &quot;Pharoah, he is a bad, bad hombre, and he&apos;s doing bad stuff to the Jews.&quot; </p>

<p>After casually mentioning, &quot;The President&apos;s probably going to bomb North Korea tonight,&quot; McCarthy said, &quot;Spicey&apos;s gotta hippity-hop... Just eat as much candy as you want because this is probably the last Easter on Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>McCarthy, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004224327/http://gothamist.com/tags/melissamccarthy">Spicer impression</a> has become the breakout this season,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004224327/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/real-time/SNL-Donald-Trump-Alec-Baldwin-Jimmy-Fallon-Melissa-McCarthy-Sean-Spicer.html">did the segment by satellite</a> from Los Angeles.
