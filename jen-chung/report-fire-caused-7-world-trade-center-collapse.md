<p><img alt="2008_08_7wtc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529152848im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_08_7wtc.jpg" width="230" height="311" class="left">One of the lingering conspiracy theories surrounding the attacks on September 11, 2001 is that 7 World Trade Center, which was not hit by a plane, was deliberately destroyed (here&apos;s one example of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529152848/http://www.wtc7.net/">conspiracy website</a>), because no other steel building has collapsed simply due to fire before.  But now a report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology says that the fire is the culprit.</p>

<p>Lead investigator Shyam Sunder said, &#x201C;Our study found that the fires in WTC 7, which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings, <strong>caused an extraordinary event</strong>. Heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down.&#x201D;  And referring to the fuel stored at 7 WTC, he added, &quot;<strong>Video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of WTC 7</strong>.&quot; The fires were started when debris from the World Trade Center towers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529152848/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/nyregion/22wtccnd.html?em">fell onto the lower building</a>.  </p>

<p>The key factor contributing to the collapse is &quot;<b>thermal expansion</b>of long-span floor systems at temperatures &apos;hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings.&apos;&quot; In other words, building owners, check your buildings. The report suggests that if a water main had not been broken due to the collapse at the Twin Towers, the sprinkler system at 7 WTC would have prevented the building&apos;s collapse.  </p>

Former mayor Rudy Giuliani had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529152848/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/26/nypd_memorandum.php">placed his emergency command center at 7 WTC</a>, in spite of NYPD recommendations against doing so.  </p>
