Police arrested an 11-year-old boy for putting the razor there (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035312/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6753265">investigators found</a> the razor &quot;had been inserted into the slide through a hole created from underneath the slide, so that just the edge of the blade stuck up into the slide and would cut anyone sliding down&quot;) and apparently the boy had vandalized the Pleasant Valley playground before.  The victim, Sean Yambo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035312/http://wcbstv.com/local/razor.slide.razor.2.981489.html">required 30 stitches to close up</a> the laceration (it&apos;s pretty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035312/http://wcbstv.com/local/razor.slide.razor.2.981489.html">gory-looking</a>).  His father told WCBS 2, &quot;It was horrifying to say the least. Every night we&apos;re changing the gauze and what not. The pain, the agony, the screaming,&quot; and added, &quot;I feel bad for the other kid who was involved who did it. He&apos;s 11, so something is wrong with him, too.&quot;</p>
