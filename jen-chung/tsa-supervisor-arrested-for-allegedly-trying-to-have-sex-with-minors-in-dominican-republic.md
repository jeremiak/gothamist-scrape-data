<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161921/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9532765">WABC 7 reports</a> that a TSA supervisor was arrested at JFK Airport today, for allegedly tying to set up &quot;a meeting in the Dominican Republic to engage in sexual activity with minors.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Lythcott is accused of having sex with underage girls &quot;for $80.&quot;  The TSA said, &quot;The agency is currently in the process of terminating his employment. At this time, he is on indefinite suspension. TSA holds its employees to the highest ethical standards and expects all TSA employees to conduct themselves with integrity and professionalism. These alleged crimes are egregious and intolerable.&quot;</p>

<p>He is being arraigned this afternoon.</p>
