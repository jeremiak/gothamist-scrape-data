The lawsuit claims Columbia has defamed her by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521231914/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/24/columbia_professor_suspended_over_p.php">dismissing her after their plagiarism probe</a>; the Columbia Spectator reports, &quot;The introduction to the 92-page complaint is titled &apos;<strong>the academic lynching of Professor Madonna Constantine</strong>,&apos; and states that these allegations were part of an &apos;invidious scheme to ruin the scholarly reputation of the Plaintiff through a conspiracy to drum up and eventually publish false claims against the Plaintiff.&apos;&quot;  (It should be noted two of Constantine&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521231914/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/25/division_over_c.php">accusers are minorities</a>, one black, one Asian.)  A Teachers College spokeperson said, &quot;This case is totally without merit, and we intend to defend against it rigorously.&quot;  Constantine&apos;s tenure at Teachers College included a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521231914/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/11/columbia.php">2007 incident where a noose</a> was found hanging on her office door; no suspects were ever found.  </p>
