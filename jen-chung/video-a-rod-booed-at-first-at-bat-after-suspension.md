<p>Alex Rodriguez re-appeared in the Yankees&apos; line-up last night in a game at the Chicago White Sox, hours after the MLB <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153418/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/05/211_game_suspension_for_alex_rodrig.php">suspended him for 211 games</a>. Rodriguez, who had been nursing a quadriceps strain (as well as recovering from hip surgery), is allowed to play until his appeal is heard. But White Sox fans booed him heartily at his first at-bat:</p>

<p>Rodriguez managed to single, which was his only hit of the evening. The Yankees lost the game, 8-1, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153418/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/a-rod-dodges-ped-questions-press-conference-article-1.1418375">Rodriguez said</a>, &quot;It was fun to go out there and play the game again. It was a tough game for us, but it was good to be out there.&#x201D; He didn&apos;t address questions about his alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs, saying there &quot;will be a time and place,&quot; adding, &quot;From this moment on, I want to focus on baseball, play every game like it&#x2019;s do-or-die. Every game is very important for us.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The players union president, Michael Weiner, told reporters that the 211-game suspension was &quot;way too harsh... We&#x2019;ve never had a 200-plus penalty for a player who may have used drugs, and you know, among other things, I just think that is way out of line.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153418/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/sports/baseball/mlb-suspends-12-in-doping-investigation.html?_r=0">Times reports </a>that Weiner doesn&apos;t believe the appeal will be heard until November, &quot;which means Rodriguez can presumably play through the rest of the season.&quot;</p>
