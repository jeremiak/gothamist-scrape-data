One dog owner explains, according to lore, &quot;<strong>There&apos;s a two-man team, with one in a gray hoodie on a bicycle who comes by and slices the leash with a razor, then goes away with the dog.</strong> The other guy calls you up later on and says, &apos;Hey, I found your dog! What&apos;s it worth to you?&apos;&quot; While others have heard about this team and their dastardly M.O., even heeding advice like, &quot;Don&apos;t leave your dog outside Starbucks. And don&apos;t use leashes that people can slice through,&quot; and keeping a careful eye out for bicyclists, the police at the 12th Precinct say there have been no dognapping reports in the past few weeks.  A Brooklyn College poli-sci professor tries to explain the paranoia through the lens of the financial crisis, &quot;<strong>A small dog creates a tremendous amount of emotional attachment, but at the same time it is a luxury item--and that&apos;s being taken away.</strong>&quot;</p>
