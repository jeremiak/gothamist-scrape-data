<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115302/http://www.kathygriffin.net/">Kathy Griffin</a> proved to be the <i>perfect</i> co-host yet again for CNN&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve countdown coverage when she yelled back at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115302/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/01/2009_new_years_in_times_square.php">Times Square</a> heckler.  The self-proclaimed D-List comedienne, co-hosting with Anderson Cooper, was so fed up with someone (we&apos;re not sure if it was a man or a woman, but we hope he/she emerges!) that she yelled&#x2014;on air&#x2014; &quot;<strong>Screw you. Why don&apos;t you get a job, buddy? You know what? I don&apos;t go to your job and knock the dicks out of your mouth</strong>.&quot; </p>

<p>The NY Post, which suggests that Griffin could be on CNN&apos;s S-list (ha!), says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115302/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01012009/tv/comic_kathy_lashes_out_at_heckler_on_cnn_146790.htm">she was not available for comment</a>, but noted that her fans were voicing their support on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115302/http://www.myspace.com/kathygriffin">MySpace</a>: &quot;Best way to bring in a New Year EVER&quot; and &quot;Kathy, you can come to my job and knock the dicks out of my mouth anytime!!!! LOVE YA&quot;</p>

<p>After the jump, some montages of Griffin and Cooper&apos;s coverage.  And Entertainment Weekly&apos;s Popwatch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115302/http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2008/12/katthy-griffin.html">was also amused</a> by how Cooper &quot;admit[ed] he can&apos;t properly pronounce double Ts, especially embarrassing as he lives in &apos;Manhadden.&apos;&quot;  (P.S.  Cooper&apos;s resolution is to <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115302/http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/">blog more</a></i>.)</p>
