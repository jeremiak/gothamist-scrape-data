										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_06_sheldonsi.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312174521im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_06_sheldonsi.jpg" width="200" height="243" class="image-left"> </span>Now that State Senator Hiram Monserrate has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312174521/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/hiram_monserrate_tells_daily_news_h.php">rejoined the Democratic caucus</a> and thrown the Senate into a 31-31 tie, the state Supreme Court judge who was going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312174521/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/12/judge_wants_senate_democrats_republ.php">hear Democrats&apos; and Republicans&apos; arguments</a> over who should rule the Senate this morning instead <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312174521/http://www.politickerny.com/4027/judge-orders-senate-foes-back-table">said both sides need to resolve it</a> themselves.  Justice Thomas McNamara said, <strong>&quot;As a matter of public policy, you guys should work this out so I&apos;m directing you to go across the street and do that and report back to me at one o&apos;clock.</strong> There are 64 (sic) members over there, who are, in my opinion, hopefully, capable of getting together and working through what I have every understanding and appreciation are very serious and difficult matters, but which can be resolved and can be worked through in a way to be beneficial to the citizens of this state.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, it&apos;s hilarious to think about Pedro Espada Jr.&apos;s comments over the past 24 hours, before and after Monserrate&apos;s change of heart.  Witness, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312174521/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/nyregion/15albany.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times story in today&apos;s edition</a>, Espada continuing to speak in the third person about how Monserrate wasn&apos;t going anywhere: &quot;Monserrate stays with Espada, and Espada stays put, too. We need to get back to business.&quot;  And now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312174521/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/06/15/2009-06-15_albany_judge_orders_warring_senate_parties_back_to_table.html">a recent Daily News article</a>, where Espada goes to the first-person: &quot;We go with the cards that are dealt, and it&apos;s not a bad hand I still have.</p>

<p>While the Senate&apos;s fate twists and turns in the wind, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (pictured) is threatening to pull the Assembly out of Albany if things continue as such.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312174521/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06152009/news/regionalnews/albany_shel_shock_174336.htm">He told the Post</a>, &quot;At this point, there doesn&apos;t seem to be any reason to stay. If there&apos;s anything to come back for, obviously our members are on call all year around, but at this point, there doesn&apos;t seem to be... We have no direction right now, we have no idea what&apos;s happening. If the Senate gets straightened out, then that&apos;s fine.&quot;</p>
