Now that everyone knows how Gisele Bundchen fired back at a Giants fan who said, &quot;Eli owns your husband!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302015636/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/gisele_bundchen_post-super_bowl_fre.php">by slamming Tom Brady&apos;s colleagues</a>&#x2014;&quot;My husband cannot (bleeping) throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time. I can&#x2019;t believe they dropped the ball so many times&quot;&#x2014;the supermodel gets the &quot;Super Brat&quot; treatment on the Beantown tabloid, The Boston Herald.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302015636/http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/06/new-england-patriots-gisele-bundchen/#.TzFpephZ9SV">Sources from the Patriots organization told TMZ</a> that Bundchen &quot;violated a &apos;code of brotherhood&apos; by bashing Tom Brady&apos;s receivers... Teammates are &apos;disappointed&apos; Gisele decided to air her grievances after the game last night... According to sources, Tom&apos;s teammates feel betrayed by Gisele&apos;s behavior -- the Pats organization is a brotherhood and Gisele&apos;s pot shot violated the code -- which is basically ... win as a team, lose as a team.&quot;  A source explained, &quot;It&apos;s like knocking someone when they are down.&quot;</p>

<p>One Boston Herald columnist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302015636/http://www.bostonherald.com/news/columnists/view.bg?articleid=1401812">writes</a>, &quot;Gisele has quickly gone from model fan to model twit. Each time she opens her mouth, she shows just how little is going on in the space between her ears. There&#x2019;s no grace, no gratitude, no charm. Brazil can have this gorgeous grouch. Or even LA. Here in Boston we prefer stars with heart, spirit and polish. Someone we can rally behind when the season is over and the city&#x2019;s dreams have been smashed like a cheap toy. Gisele, on behalf of thinking women everywhere, I beg you: Just shut up.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302015636/http://bostonherald.com/news/columnists/view/20220207toms_catch_draws_flak_nobody_can_live_up_to_super_standards/srvc=home&amp;position=0">Another opined</a>, &quot;OK, I&#x2019;m sure it hurt [when the Giants fan mocked your husband]. We were all in the fetal position. But here&#x2019;s what Super Gi doesn&#x2019;t get: When you are divinely blessed in every aspect of life &#x2014; looks, love, luck, loot &#x2014; you are supposed to ignore mere mortals who harass you. Maybe you even smile and offer an autograph. What you don&#x2019;t do is defend your man by dumping on his teammates with a no-class expletive.&quot;</p>

<p>TMZ adds salt to the wound by sharing this video of Gisele telling Brady <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302015636/http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/06/gisele-bundchen-tom-brady-super-bowl-amazing-best-game/?adid=hero1#.TzFrl5hZ9SU">that he played the best game of his life</a>:</p>
