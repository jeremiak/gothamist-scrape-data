The slugger&apos;s lawyer said it was reached &quot;amicably,&quot; &quot;They deliberately engaged in a private negotiation.&quot;  She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117112037/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/07/cya_arod_crod_claims_marital_miscon.php">wanted a share of his considerable earnings</a> while he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117112037/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/31/arod_says_prenup_should_stand.php">wanted the pre-nup to stand</a>, but no details were released about how things ended up.  C-Rod <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117112037/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09192008/news/regionalnews/a_rod_and_wife_strike_a_divorce_deal_129819.htm">was spotted in NYC this week</a> (we even think we saw her on the Upper West Side with daughter Natasha!), but the divorce will be finalized in Florida.
