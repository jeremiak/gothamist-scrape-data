<p>Tonight, the Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050705/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/midnight-the-shining">a midnight screening of the seminal 1980 horror film, <em>The Shining</em></a> to coincide with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050705/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/rodney-ascher-room-237">the release of <em>Room 237</em></a>, a new documentary delving into the many mysteries and weird theories about Kubrick&apos;s terrifying adaptation of the Stephen King novel. </p>

<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050705/http://www.room237movie.com/">Room 237</a></em> director Rodney Ascher and producer Tim Kirk will be present and participating at different screenings of the doc today and tomorrow: They&apos;ll be at the 6:30 p.m. screening tonight and the 1:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. showings tomorrow. But if you can&apos;t make one of those, don&apos;t worry&#x2014;Room 237 is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050705/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/rodney-ascher-room-237">playing all weekend</a>. <br>

While King wasn&apos;t pleased with the liberties that Kubrick took with <em>The Shining</em>, the film has become a touchstone in popular culture (here&apos;s a link to a bad BUT COMPLETE dub of The Simpsons&apos; Treehouse of Horror spoof, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050705/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=p_1DBC4KHx8"><em>The Shinning</em></a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050705/http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/03/tom-carson-reviews-room-237-the-documentary-that-awesomely-decodes-stanley-kubricks-the-shining.html">Deep readings</a> of the film from obsessive fans inspired <em>Room 237</em>:</p>

<p>The <em>Room 237</em> trailer was inspired by the original trailer for <em>The Shining</em>, which didn&apos;t show very much:</p>
