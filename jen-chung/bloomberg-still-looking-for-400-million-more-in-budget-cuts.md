<p>Mayor Bloomberg, who has promised that his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064906/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/bloombergs_656_billion_budget_teach.php#photo-1">$65.6 billion budget</a>, which includes thousands of layoffs, will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064906/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/26/bloomberg_promises_new_budget_will.php">hurt</a>, has eased up a little bit on one thing: The amount he&apos;s reducing funding for child care services for low-income children.  Still, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064906/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/nyregion/bloomberg-budget-will-seek-400-million-more-in-cuts.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a> that Bloomberg is looking for an additional $400 million from other city agencies to fill the deficit.</p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson told the Times, &quot;While the city&#x2019;s economy and fiscal situation continue to improve, Albany and Washington continue to face serious challenges, and their cuts are real.&quot; The mayor will be announcing his budget this morning.</p>

<p>As for the child care services, originally Bloomberg was proposing to cut funding for 16,000 children&apos;s day care slots (the city has 106,000 child care subsidies).  According to the AP, &quot;Under the mayor&apos;s [latest] proposal, the only children who would lose care next year are 1,350 aging out of the program. Another 10,000 would be placed in a city program offering after-school activities instead of getting subsidies.&quot; The Times adds that the City Council could offer up more money.  </p>

<p>Bloomberg&apos;s revised stance on child care funding might make Council members more amenable to passing the austere budget; Councilman David Greenfield had told City Hall News last week he wouldn&apos;t vote on cutting those child care service cuts, &quot;It&apos;s a matter of fairness. It&apos;s a matter of equity. It&apos;s a matter of morality. This is the line in the sand.&quot;</p>
