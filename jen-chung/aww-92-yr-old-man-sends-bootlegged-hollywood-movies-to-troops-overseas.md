<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131119211606/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/nyregion/at-92-movie-bootlegger-is-soldiers-hero.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times has a wonderful feature</a> on 92-year-old Massapequa, Long Island resident Hyman Strachman who devotedly sends care packages to troops overseas.  And what&apos;s in the packages?  Bootlegged copies of Hollywood blockbusters, which troops receive sometimes before they are even in the States.  Strachman admitted to violating copyright laws, but explained, &quot;Every time I got back an emotional e-mail or letter [from a soldier], I sent them another box.&quot;</p>

<p>The Times guesstimates that Strachman may have sent 300,000 discs since 2004 (translating to a possible &quot;personal outlay of over $30,000&quot;) and offered the poignant, possible motivation behind his actions, &quot;After Mr. Strachman&#x2019;s wife of more than half a century, Harriet, died in 2003, he discovered a Web site that collected soldiers&#x2019; requests for care packages. He noted a consistent plea for movie DVDs and wound up passing his sleepless nights replicating not only the films, but also a feeling of military comradeship that he had not experienced since his own service in the Pacific during World War II.&quot;</p>

<p>Strachman buys the movies from bootleggers at Penn Station, uses a professional DVD duplicator to make the copies (he eventually destroys &quot;originals&quot;) and sends them to an army chaplain, who pass them on to soldiers.  He hasn&apos;t had to face the law yet, &quot;I thought maybe because I&#x2019;m an old-timer.&quot; The Motion Picture Association of America&apos;s Howard Gantman spoke to the Times, which reports that his &quot;sole comment dripped with the difficulty of going after a 92-year-old widower supporting the troops. &apos;We are grateful that the entertainment we produce can bring some enjoyment to them while they are away from home,&apos; Mr. Gantman said.&quot;   </p>

<p>Soldiers will be getting movies like <em>The Artist</em> and <em>Moneyball</em> from Big Hy soon.  And, for reference, the man who shared a bootlegged copy of Wolverine before it was released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131119211606/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/wolverine_bootlegger_sentenced_to_a.php">was sentenced to a year in prison</a>. </p>
