Imam Feisel Abdul Rauf<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163433/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100830/NATIONAL/708299835/1001"> told The National</a>, an English paper in Abu Dhabi, &quot;<strong>There is no doubt that the election season has had a major impact upon the nature of the discourse.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Times explains, &quot;The imam said he was intent on eliminating the notion that Islam could be equated with extremism,&quot; with Rauf telling the paper, &quot;The radicals feed off each other and need each other to sustain themselves. So we need right now to combat the radical voices. That&#x2019;s the only way we can win this struggle, and establish a peaceful world order, which is what everybody wants and everybody needs.&quot; Rauf added, &quot;America was created by people who fled Europe seeking religious freedom and religious liberty. So it is an essential part of the American worldview and creed, that religious liberty is a fundamental protected right...  This is something which I believe the Muslim world insufficiently appreciates about America. I&#x2019;d like to see them understand that better, recognise that better. And recognise that in that is a value which lies at the very core of the Quranic value.&quot;</p>

<p>Another American right: Complaining about one&apos;s landlord, even if he is an imam:  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163433/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/mosque_slumlord_K7LEYxaJRDmD3IhbhkhtXL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a>, &quot;Across the Hudson,  Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is known as an alleged slumlord. At buildings in Union City and Palisades Park, where Rauf reportedly got tax dollars to renovate low-income apartments, tenants yesterday said their gripes about their lousy housing conditions have been ignored.&quot; Lousing housing conditions like...bedbugs!  One in Union City said, &quot;Why doesn&apos;t he help the tenants he has before he builds a new place, claiming he wants to help people? Nothing gets done. We have to go through City Hall to get things done.&quot;</p>
