<p>Now that the investor who provided much of the money to buy 45-47 Park Place&#x2014;aka the site of the controversial mosque and community center proposed for a site two blocks from Ground Zero&#x2014;admitted he&apos;d <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529124021/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/09/ground_zero_imam_moving_mosque_woul.php">happily sell the building for whatever purpose</a> if he made a profit, Donald Trump has offered to buy him out.  But while Hisham Elzanaty mentioned $18-20 million figures (the building was bought for $4.8 million), Trump is only offering a 25% premium.  </p>

<p>He says, &quot;I am making this offer as a resident of New York and citizen of the United States, not because I think the location is a spectacular one (because it is not), but because it will end a very serious, inflammatory, and highly divisive situation that is destined, in my opinion, to only get worse.&quot;  Hey, he isn&apos;t doing this because the new season of <em>The Apprentice</em> is coming up... or is he?</p>

<p>After the jump, check out his letter.  Also, Trump has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529124021/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/24/videos_mosque_scare-mongering_in_ac.php">previously said</a>, &quot;It&apos;s very insensitive and it shouldn&apos;t be there. I&apos;m a big believer in freedom of religion, but I think the mosque being in that location is absolutely wrong.&quot;  </p>
