However, the White House meeting didn&apos;t go very well, if you believe the press from Israel, which has been likening it to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120122214046/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Bibis_hazing.html">&quot;hazing&quot; and an &quot;ambush.&quot;</a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120122214046/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/7521391/Obama-snubbed-Netanyahu-for-dinner-with-Michelle-and-the-girls-Israelis-claim.html">According to the Telegraph</a>, Israel&apos;s Maariv newspaper wrote, &quot;There is no humiliation exercise that the Americans did not try on the prime minister and his entourage. Bibi received in the White House the treatment reserved for the president of Equatorial Guinea.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Supposedly, behind closed doors, Obama gave Netanyahu a list of 13 demands, including not building settlements in East Jerusalem, the event that sparked the White House&apos;s distrust.  The Telegraph reports, &quot;When the Israeli prime minister stalled, Mr Obama rose from his seat declaring: &apos;I&apos;m going to the residential wing to have dinner with Michelle and the girls,&apos;&quot; though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120122214046/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34979.html">Politico says</a>, &quot;Israeli officials let it be known that the talks had broken for Obama to put his daughters to bed, then resumed.&quot;  </p>

<p>Then, the pair had another meeting; a BBC reporter traveling with Netanyahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120122214046/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8588521.stm">wrote</a>, &quot;The following morning, all media engagements for Netanyahu were cancelled. His staff wouldn&apos;t say a word, but it was written all over their faces that things were not good for the prime minister.&quot;  Also there were no photo ops or press releases from the White House:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120122214046/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/03/after_humiliation_netanyahu_sa.html">Per NPR</a>, &quot;One [Israeli] commentator described the Obama administration as treating the Israeli leader with &apos;swinish contempt&apos;.&quot;</p>
