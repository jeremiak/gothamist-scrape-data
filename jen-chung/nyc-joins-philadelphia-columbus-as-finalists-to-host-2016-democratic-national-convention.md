<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011522/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/06/de_blasio_proposes_brooklyns_barcla.php">As expected</a>, the Democratic National Committee has selected Brooklyn&apos;s Barclays Center as a finalist to host the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Because what better way to show America that the White House is ready for a true progressive than saying it from the home of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011522/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/24/nyc_releases_video_to_land_2016_dem.php#photo-1">artisanal brunches and Bill de Blasio</a>? </p>

<p>The other two finalists are Philadelphia and Columbus. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011522/http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/democratic-national-convention-2016-finalists-113139.html">According to Politico</a>, &quot;[DNC Chair Debbie] Wasserman Schultz said the Democrats&#x2019; convention will be held either the week of July 18, July 25 or Aug. 22. Republicans will hold their convention in Cleveland, likely in early July, meaning the GOP convention will precede the Democratic gathering... Columbus is a growing city in the capital of a key swing state. But there have been questions about whether Ohio has a big enough donor base to raise the money for two conventions.&quot; More importantly, Hillary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011522/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/08/the_clintons_would_like_to_hold_the.php">would like the convention in Brooklyn</a>.</p>

<p>De Blasio said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011522/http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/928-14/new-york-city-10-million-commitments-dnc-bid">$10 million has already been raised</a> for the potentially $100 million convention, &quot;With this unprecedented show of support from such a broad cross-section of New Yorkers, we&#x2019;ll be ready to hit the ground running the moment we&#x2019;re named the host of the 2016 convention. Taken together, today&#x2019;s announcements show that New York City is both excited and prepared to host a fully-funded convention in all five boroughs to showcase the Democratic nominee for president.&quot; City officials also say $200 million would be pumped into the city&apos;s economy. </p>

<p>Former Pennsylvania governor and Philadelphia mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011522/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/nyregion/new-york-city-is-finalist-for-2016-democratic-national-convention.html?ref=nyregion">Ed Rendell said Brooklyn sucks</a>, &quot;How would you like to transport, in the middle of rush hour, thousands of delegates from Midtown to Brooklyn?&quot; but NYC officials have pointed out the Atlantic Avenue transit hub is right outside the Barclays Center. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011522/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/cops_not_happy_about_potention_broo.php">police union isn&apos;t happy either</a>.</p>
