Some on Wall Street think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522012606/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/business/06bonus.html?ref=business">it&apos;s a &quot;sign of restraint&quot;</a>&#x2014;the Wall Street Journal characterizes it as Goldman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522012606/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704533204575047132761932208.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection">&quot;bowing&quot; to criticism</a> about executive pay.  </p>

<p>A compensation consultant told the WSJ that Blankfein&apos;s bonus &quot;is certainly significantly lower than people anticipated,&quot; but said people would still be pissed at him and Goldman Sachs, &quot;If you are outside looking in, they still aren&apos;t beloved, because they likely eating your lunch and breakfast.&quot; Indeed: Vermont Congressman Peter Welch (D) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522012606/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/05/AR2010020503976.html?hpid=sec-business">said</a>, &quot;<strong>It is only in their world where you can come within an eyelash of destroying the economy and then reward yourself with what you call a &apos;modest&apos; $9 million pay day</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Blankfein received a $68 million bonus in 2007 and many had expected that his 2009 reward would top that, since 2009 was Goldman Sachs&apos; most profitable ever.  Blankfein had<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522012606/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/23/ny_times_not_happy_with_goldman_sac.php"> acknowledged some responsibility</a> of his company&apos;s involvement in the global economic meltdown last year, but he also raised ire when saying his firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522012606/http://www.businessinsider.com/lloyd-blankfein-says-he-is-doing-gods-work-2009-11">was doing &quot;God&apos;s work.&quot;</a>  Now Blankfein&apos;s &quot;small&quot; bonus is being compared to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon&apos;s, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522012606/http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/jpmorgans-dimon-gets-17-billion-bonus/?ref=business">around $17 million</a> (about $8 million in stock, no cash).</p>
