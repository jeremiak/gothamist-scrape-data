<p>The man arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054358/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/21/park_slope_groper_charged_with_touc.php">allegedly groping three girls</a> in Park Slope <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054358/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/6/dtg-slope-groper-trial-2016-02-05-bk.html">was acquitted last week</a>. </p>

<p>In 2013, police were anxiously searching for a man who had not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054358/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/nypd_releases_sketch_of_park_slope.php">only groped young girls</a>&#x2014;grabbing the buttocks of an 11-year-old on 4th Street near 6th Avenue; brushing up against a 10-year-old girl on Fifth Avenue and then rubbing himself on her and grabbing her buttocks, as well as the buttocks of an 11-year-old&#x2014;but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054358/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/19/park_slope_groper_still_on_the_loos.php">assaulted an undercover police officer</a> who was questioning him on the street. Jesse Dailey, 34, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054358/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/21/park_slope_groper_charged_with_touc.php">was caught</a> after some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054358/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/23/park_slope_groper.php">Good Samaritans stopped him</a> after the incident with the police officer (they let him go, but one took a photograph of his ID). </p>

<p>However, when the case finally went to trial recently, Dailey was found not guilty after, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054358/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/6/dtg-slope-groper-trial-2016-02-05-bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper reports</a>, &quot;police bungled the investigation and the evidence against him did not add up to a conviction, according to one juror.&quot;</p>

<p>For instance, a police officer apparently showed a photograph of Dailey to a victim before the victim saw Dailey and others in a police line-up. The cop then lied during his testimony, claiming he never showed the picture. The Brooklyn Paper also noted that the only victim who saw the groper&apos;s face &quot;did not identify Dailey when asked if her attacker was in the court room.&quot;</p>

<p>Juror Alley Olivier&#x2014;who writes for the Brooklyn Paper&#x2014;told the publication, &quot;It was a hard decision&quot; to acquit Dailey of the groping charges as well as the assault on the police officer. &quot;We really wanted to see justice done for these girls.&quot; She explained, &quot;We didn&#x2019;t have enough evidence to prove it was Jesse Dailey.&quot;</p>
