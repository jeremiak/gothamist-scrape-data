<p>In time for the fall season, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512100632/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bedbugs</a> are at New York City&apos;s department stores (checking out the new fashions) and schools (hitting the books, natch)!!  Apparently Bloomingdale&apos;s had at least <em>one</em> bedbug on premises&#x2014;the store says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512100632/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/126065/bed-bug-found-at-bloomingdale-s/">it was removed</a>, it&apos;s not widespread and bedbug dogs have been checking out the store&#x2014;and we just received a memo (see picture above) that Macy&apos;s sent to its employees!</p>

<p>The employee tells us, &quot;I work in the office at the Macy&apos;s in Herald Square, where bedbugs were found today on the 17th floor. All of my coworkers are freaked out, and they are closing the office tonight and tomorrow for extermination/sanitation. The store will remain open. Attached is the memo we all received -- sorry for the crappy cell phone picture, but unsurprisingly we got this on paper instead of electronically.&quot;  As for reaction to the Bloomingdale&apos;s bedbug, one teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512100632/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bloomingdale_bedbug_2mEp6z7yrdOUMyA08CEzbP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;This is disgusting -- I&apos;m itching all over right now. <strong>I can&apos;t believe they finally made it to Bloomingdale&apos;s.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512100632/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/nyregion/25bedbugs.html?hpw">NY Times looks at the bedbug epidemic at schools</a>, &quot;So far this month, the city&#x2019;s 311 help line has received 22 calls about bedbugs in schools, its records show. It is unclear whether additional cases were reported by other means.&quot;  The Department of Education says that no schools have been closed&#x2014;&quot;Each confirmed case is dealt with expeditiously&quot;&#x2014;but a Bedford-Stuyvesant school&apos;s teachers &quot;said Friday that there had been multiple instances of bedbugs since the beginning of the school year.&quot; The DOE says that bedbugs seem to be a bigger problem in cooler months, &quot;What we&#x2019;ve found is that they crop up during winter time, on heavy clothing, like jackets.&quot; Oh, crap&#x2014;global warming isn&apos;t sounding so bad, is it?</p>
