<p>A day after Fox News broadcast a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015030/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/05/fox_news_chinatown_video.php">racist, demeaning segment</a> filmed on the streets of Chinatown, New York elected officials gathered outside its NYC headquarters to demand an apology&#x2014;and to retract the clip. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who organized the protest, said, &quot;This offensive, racist segment was somehow created and approved to be broadcast into the homes of millions of people. In passing off its demeaning stereotypes and shameful ignorance as &apos;all in good fun&apos;, it only further insults the entire Asian American community.&quot; </p>

<p>The five-minute segment had O&apos;Reilly Factor correspondent (and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015030/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/daily_show_fox_chinatown.php">ignorant sack of shit</a>&quot;) Jesse Watters discussing the 2016 election with people in Chinatown, because Donald Trump kept mentioning China during the debate. What ensued was Watters belittling Asians, including senior citizens, while also asking about karate (which is Japanese) and learning tae kwon do (which is Korean). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015030/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/lighten_up_just_a_lil_racism.php">Watters later said</a> he was a &quot;political humorist&quot; and, essentially, it was everyone else&apos;s problem they were offended. </p>

<p>&quot;Every day we see more and more of these kinds of views expressed,&quot; Kim lamented. &quot;Trump&apos;s candidacy has brought this intolerance into mainstream society, and instead of countering this, Fox&apos;s O&apos;Reilly Factor has decided to reinforce these same divisive and racist sentiments. We are here to say to Watters, O&#x2019;Reilly, Fox News and all of America, that we, too, are American, and this type of racism is un-American and unacceptable.&quot; He added, &quot;We are also prepared to take this fight to the next level by calling for public boycotts of all corporations who sponsor this show until they comply with our community&#x2019;s demands.&quot;</p>

<p>Other officials who were at the gathering include New York&apos;s only Asian member of Congress, Rep. Grace Meng; Public Advocate Letitia James; City Comptroller Scott Stringer; Rep. Nydia Velazquez; Assembly members Walter Mosley and Nily Rozic; and Council Members Peter Koo and Margaret Chin.</p>

<p>Yuh-Line Niou, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015030/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/14/yuh-line_niou_wins_primary_for_shel.php">who won the Democratic primary</a> for disgraced ex-Assembly Member Sheldon Silver&apos;s lower Manhattan seat and will likely be elected to office in November, made emotional remarks about how troubling Watters&apos;s segment was. She called the clip incredibly &quot;efficient&quot; as it made her &quot;reliv[e] my entire trauma from childhood,&quot; and went on to describe how, as a child, she was taken to the coat room and all the other students took turns spitting on her &quot;because I was Asian-American. They also tried to light me on fire.&quot; </p>

<p>Niou said Fox News was perpetuating stereotypes that lead to that bullying, destructive behavior:</p>

<p>Fox News has not commented on the segment yet. </p>
