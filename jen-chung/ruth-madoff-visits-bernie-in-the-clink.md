                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:325px; "> <img alt="2009_04_rmadof.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014016im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_rmadof.jpg" width="325" height="241"> <br> <i>Photograph of Ruth Madoff leaving the Metropolitan Correctional Center (with bodyguards) by Mary Altaffer/AP</i></div> With two tall bodyguards, Ruth Madoff visited her disgraced financier husband Bernard at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. This was her first visit there since he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014016/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/12/madoff_i_knew_what_i_was_doing_was.php">pleaded guilty on March 12</a>.<p></p>

<p>The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014016/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/04/06/2009-04-06_bernie_madoff_gets_visit_from_wife_ruth_.html">has an account of the scene</a> outside the lock-up: &quot;Ruth Madoff dropped in to the lockup for a tete-&#xE1;-tete with her beloved Bernie on Monday, emerging as silent as the Sphinx about her first visit behind bars.... [She] looked calm and relaxed and even let slip a fleeting smile at the swarm of journalists buzzing around her. <strong>Still, as questions such as &apos;Was he contrite?&apos; and &apos;Are you going to turn your money over to the feds?&apos; flew at her, Ruth played deaf</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, accusations and insinuations that Ruth Madoff was intimately involved with her husband&apos;s Ponzi scheme continue to roll in. Yesterday, Lucinda Franks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014016/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-04-06/ruths-madoffs-private-world/">wrote in The Daily Beast</a> that a Palm Beach socialite told her, &quot;Everyone down here thinks she was involved in the Ponzi scheme&quot; before launching into a story of how Ruth lined up an investor for Madoff. In the April Vanity Fair, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014016/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/04/madoff200904">implied that Ruth is smarter than her husband</a>: &quot;While Bernie spent his freshman year at the University of Alabama&#x2014;at that time, some say, an easier entrance portal for students who couldn&#x2019;t get accepted into eastern colleges&#x2014;Ruth passed the entrance requirements for Queens College.&quot;</p>

<p>Franks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014016/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/06/earlyshow/main4921891.shtml">told the CBS Early Show</a> that while one of Madoff&apos;s victims includes his own sister, &quot;<strong>I don&apos;t think Ruth&apos;s worries are about money right now. Her husband salted away money all over the world in her name, and this is what investigators are trying to get back now.</strong>&quot;   One less salt mine: Madoff&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014016/http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/french-firm-seeks-to-commandeer-madoff-yacht/">$7 million yacht was seized by French authorities</a> (this is a different boat from the two seized in Florida).  </p>
