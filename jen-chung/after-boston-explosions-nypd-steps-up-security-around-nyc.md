<p>After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162531/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php#photo-1">fatal explosions at the Boston Marathon finish line</a>, the NYPD is increasing its security here. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne issued a statement, &quot;We&apos;re stepping up security at hotels and other prominent locations in the city through deployment of the NYPD&apos;s critical response vehicles (CRVs) until more about the explosion is learned.&quot;</p>

<p>The CRVs are part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162531/http://www.nypdshield.org/public/initiatives.aspx">NYPD&apos;s Counter-Terrorism Initiatives:</a> &quot;Uniformed officers from each of the City&apos;s 76 precincts in marked vehicles meeting at strategic locations in a massive show of force for deployment around the city at bridges, transportation facilities, and other highly critical and sensitive locations.&quot; The CRV surge was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162531/http://gothamist.com/2004/07/29/nypd_critical_response_surges.php">familiar sight in the past</a>:</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162531/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/two_explosions_at_boston_marathon_iMR0LCkcwASg0RQfVsH1yI">source tells the NY Post</a>, &quot;This changes everything [in New York]. Everyone&#x2019;s on high alert. Our marathon was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162531/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/quinn_joins_anti-marathon_bandwagon.php">canceled in November</a>. Who knows if that changed someone&#x2019;s plans?&quot; </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement, &quot;As law enforcement authorities investigate today&#x2019;s explosions in Boston, I ask all New Yorkers to keep the victims and their families in your thoughts and prayers. I have spoken with Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, and the NYPD has stepped up security at strategic locations and critical infrastructure, including our subways. Some of the security steps we are taking may be noticeable, including deployment of Critical Response Vehicles and additional police personnel, and others will not be. We have 1,000 members of the NYPD assigned to counter-terrorism duties, and they - along with the entire NYPD and the investments we have made in counter-terrorism infrastructure - are being fully mobilized to protect our city.&quot;</p>

<p>Governor Cuomo also issued a statement, &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Boston and Massachusetts as reports come in on the horrific tragedy at the Boston Marathon. I have directed state agencies, including the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, State Police, the MTA and the Port Authority, to be on a heightened state of alert as we learn more about this incident. New York National Guard on Sunday sent three vehicles and 6 soldiers to support the Marathon, and they are on hand to assist with emergency response and work together with local authorities following this incident.&quot;</p>
