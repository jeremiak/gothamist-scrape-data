                            <p>We are in the Banksy-created rabbit hole, wondering when he&apos;ll reveal his next piece in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062912/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/banksys_back_in_nyc_for_octoberfirs.php">his month-long NYC &quot;residency&quot;</a>. And we&apos;re still debating whether his latest stencil is authentic. Which is why we&apos;ve created this GIF.</p>

<p>In this mesmerizing GIF, you&apos;ll see the 800 phone number appear on the right part of the sidewalk.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062912im_/http://mlkshk.com/r/UMRK"></p>

<p>When we first received this photograph of the dog peeing on the hydrant image on West 24th Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062912/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/this_looks_like_banksy_but_probably.php#comment-1068261285">we didn&apos;t <em>think</em> it was Banksy</a>, but who knew? However, unlike his earlier Allen Street, there was no 800 number near the piece. (The 800 number, 800-656-4271, is the audio guide to his show.) This image below was taken by David. K at 1 p.m.</p>

<p>David K. tells us today, &quot;I did not notice a toll free number on the sidewalk.  Now that I think about it, there was a guy loudly telling everyone at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062912/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/new_banksy_on_the_westside.php">25th/10th site</a> about the new &apos;Banksy&apos; on 6th and 24th, giving very specific directions as well.  I&apos;m wondering if it is a fake, could this be the culprit.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, by the evening, there was an 800 number (one reader sent a photograph of it at 9:57 p.m.) and the recording does refer to an image dog peeing on a hydrant. And then this morning, Banksy claimed it on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062912/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/banksy_is_not_on_twitter_just_insta.php">his official Instagram</a>:</p>

<p>Still, one hypothesis is that Banksy is taking credit for a Fakesy. Why is this so important? It&apos;s not hugely important&#x2014;<a <br="">
