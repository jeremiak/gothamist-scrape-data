<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123230244/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/04/man_found_killed_bound_in_his_chels.php">discovered the body of John Laubach, 57</a>, in his West 22nd Street apartment earlier this month; while his apartment was ransacked and laptop and credit cards stolen, there were no signs of forced entry.  Laubach, who recently suffered a stroke, may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123230244/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/police-hunting-suspects-killing-chelsea-businessman-john-laubach-article-1.1037780#ixzz1p1kjBteY">hired the pair as caretakers</a> (a friend said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123230244/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120310/chelsea-hells-kitchen/chelsea-man-befriended-grifters-who-may-have-killed-him-friend-says">was introduced to &quot;grifters&quot;</a>).  </p>

<p>Apparently cops tracked the pair&apos;s phone calls. A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123230244/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/suspects_in_chelsea_gay_tryst_slay_HfU9aNhs1x7tKVeH3LVjhO">tells the Post about the arrest</a>, &quot;There was a little hesitation. They didn&#x2019;t open the door right away, but there was no struggle. I don&#x2019;t blame them. If I knew I was getting arrested, I&#x2019;d hesitate too.&quot;</p>
