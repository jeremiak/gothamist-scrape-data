However, they hope the public can help them find the second one.<p></p>

<p>According to the police, a 32-year-old woman was sexually assaulted twice in an hour: The first attack occurred at 5 a.m. on August 31st, when the woman was walking in front of 187 Gates Avenue; the NYPD says that a suspect pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. The suspect claimed he had a gun and would use it but did not display it.</p>

<p>Then the second attack occurred around 6 a.m., in front of 58 Irving Place, when a second suspect pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. Again, police say the second suspect claimed to have a gun and said he would use it, but never displayed it.</p>

<p>The suspect in the first attack was caught&#x2014;Nicholas Isaac, 17, was charged with robbery, criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. Isaac lives at 21 Clifton Place, just a few blocks from 187 Gates Avenue.</p>

<p>The second suspect is still at large. Police released a sketch of the suspect, as well as surveillance video (below).</p>

<p>While it was initially suspected the two attackers might have known each other, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013603/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140917/clinton-hill/woman-was-sexually-assaulted-by-man-she-asked-for-help-after-earlier-attack">DNAinfo reports that the victim</a> &quot;begged a passerby for help shortly after the attack &#x2014; and instead, he sexually assaulted her too, police sources revealed this week.&quot; Now police don&apos;t believe the attackers know each other; Captain Peter Fiorello, the 88th Precinct&apos;s commanding officer, said at a community board meeting, &quot;It&#x2019;s disgusting that this type of thing can happen.&quot;</p>
