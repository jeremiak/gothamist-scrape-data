Her grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512025427/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/dream_dashed_uDUZEkXmPegpigwYhZ2tvI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the NY Post</a>, &quot;New York was her dream.&quot;</p>

<p>Singleton, a 22-year-old from Pennsylvania, had graduated from Bucknell University last year and was living on Berkeley Place in Park Slope. (Her grandmother said she was taking acting classes at NYU and working at a clothing store.) She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512025427/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/woman_found_dead_at_canal_st_statio.php">was last seen at McKenna&apos;s</a>, a West 14th Street bar, before taking the 1 train at the nearby 1/2/3 station at 1:30 a.m. early Sunday. Her body wasn&apos;t noticed at the Canal Street station until about 1 p.m. </p>

<p>At first, it was believed that Singleton was struck by a train, but some evidence suggests she suffered head trauma consistent with a fall (the medical examiner&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512025427/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/nyregion/body-on-subway-tracks-unnoticed-for-hours.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">is continuing its work</a>). As for why her body went unnoticed for hours, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512025427/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/nyregion/body-on-subway-tracks-unnoticed-for-hours.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">NY Times has some details</a>:</p><blockquote>A dozen trains, perhaps more, may have passed over the spot at the northern end of the station, where Ms. Singleton&#x2019;s body lay curled in a deep trough on Sunday morning, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x2019;s station manager, William Doyle.<p></p>

<p>Mr. Doyle, who was at the station on Sunday, said several factors could explain the extended period of time that apparently elapsed before someone notified the police around 1:30 p.m. about a limp body in the tracks. The downtown platform is deserted at the northern end; the space between the rails is deep and crossed by several ties, which could have obscured her; the approach to the station is ramrod straight and trains enter quickly.</p>

<p>The police said Ms. Singleton&#x2019;s face was covered with dirt from the station, complicating any quick identification and perhaps, along with her dark clothes, masking her from immediate view.</p></blockquote>Singleton was wearing leather pants and high-heeled boots when she was found, but police did not find a wallet or cellphone (police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512025427/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/aaaaa-article-1.1311323">don&apos;t think she was robbed</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512025427/http://pix11.com/2013/04/08/woman-found-dead-on-subway-tracks-identified-by-police/">According to WPIX</a>, &quot;The owner of McKenna&#x2019;s told PIX11 that he thought she seemed okay, and didn&#x2019;t look inebriated when she left.  Surveillance video may have told a different story however.  Police sources say she appeared to stumble and weave as she walked.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Her grandmother Janet Singleton told the Post, &quot;She was a beautiful girl, with beautiful, long brown hair and big brown eyes... It&#x2019;s horrible, horrible, horrible. She was the most outgoing, beautiful girl. She was so talented, she sang, she danced.&quot; She added, &quot;She just thought [New York] was the more wonderful place to live. I talk to her every Thursday, and she was telling me ... she was enjoying herself going to plays and different activities in the city. She realized the beginning of her dream. Now, she&#x2019;ll do it in heaven, I guess.&quot;<br>
