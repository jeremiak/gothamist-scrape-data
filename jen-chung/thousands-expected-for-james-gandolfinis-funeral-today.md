                            <p>At 10 a.m., a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831193202/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/24/james_gandolfinis_funeral_service_w.php">private funeral</a> is being held for James Gandolfini at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The actor, a New Jersey native and NYC resident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831193202/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/james_gandolfini_has_died_at_51.php">died last week</a> of a heart attack while vacationing in Rome.</p>

<p>A private wake for Gandolfini was held at the Robert Spearling Funeral Home in Park Ridge, NJ. The wife of Gandolfini&apos;s roommate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831193202/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/06/mourners_ushering_into_wake_for_sopranos_star_james_gandolfini.html">from his Hoboken days said</a>, &quot;He is not Tony Soprano. He&#x2019;s Buck from Rutgers who got lucky and became a star.&quot; There was no Sopranos memorabilia inside. A man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831193202/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/gandolfini-loved-arrive-nj-wake-article-1.1383398">who is married to Gandolfini&apos;s cousin told the Daily News</a>, &quot;It&apos;s a nightmare for the whole family. It&apos;s a horrible, horrible thing, everybody is just devastated.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, police and barricades are positioned outside the Morningside Heights church, with crowds of fans arriving to pay tribute to the late actor. One nearby resident who was lined up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831193202/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/06/james_gandolfini_funeral_casket_departs_park_ridge_for.html#/0">told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;He was an incredible actor. The show was about a gangster, but he still took care of his family. He reached out to people. I used to run home from work and watch my family.&quot; Another remarked, &quot;The whole family, their friends, it was real. Even when he was killing people, I felt like they didn&apos;t just gloss over it. I never missed an episode, but I miss him.&quot;</p>

<p>Gandolfini&apos;s career spanned television, film and stage&#x2014;last night, Broadway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831193202/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/06/james_gandolfini_funeral_broadway_lights_dim.html">dimmed its lights in his honor</a>. The funeral is reportedly being filmed by HBO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831193202/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hbo_mob_scene_for_big_tony_funeral_9uycFTXwbrMFT7PKHTxgDM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">as a private gift for the family</a>.</p>
