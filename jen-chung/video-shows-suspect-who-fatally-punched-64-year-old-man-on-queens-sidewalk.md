<p>A 64-year-old man died after being found unconscious on a sidewalk in June, and now police are disseminating a video that shows him being punched in the head before his death. Investigators are hoping the public can help them locate the suspect who punched the victim, along with the suspect&apos;s friend.</p>

<p>Robert Gorman was found on the corner of Queens Boulevard and Main Street on June 26th, just after midnight, by police officers responding to a 911 call. He was later pronounced dead at Jamaica Hospital, and a subsequent police investigation found video of a man using a closed fist to punch him in the head. The video also shows Gorman falling to the ground, struggling to get up, and staying there.</p>

The male suspect, who is wanted for assault, is described as 30-35 years old with short black hair and was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, black shorts and sneakers and holding a black bag. His female companion is described as having short hair and glasses; she was last seen wearing white T-shirt, blue jeans and sandals.</p>

It is unclear if the punch led directly to Gorman&apos;s death.&quot; Gorman&apos;s medical history includes heart attacks and a stroke. The NYC Medical Examiner&apos;s office will determine the cause of death.</p>
