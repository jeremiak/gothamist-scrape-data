Police director Sam Jefferson said, &quot;They should be aware of people around the playground who are not with children and are acting suspiciously. Do not hesitate to call police.&quot; Now parents&#x2014;and kids&#x2014;may be breathing more easily, because a suspect has been arrested.</p>

<p>A little girl told police that she &quot; saw a man grab her 8-year-old brother and kiss him on the cheek&quot; on May 26.  The Jersey Journal reports that another witness said the same, and &quot;they called police Friday because the man had just grabbed another juvenile and kissed the child on the lips. While at the park Friday, police spoke to an 11-year-old boy who said that on May 18 he was approached from behind by a man of the same description who spun him around to face him, reports said. The boy said the man asked him &apos;What&apos;s your name?&apos; but that he pushed him away, reports said.&quot;  It&apos;s believed that at least six boys and girls were kissed.</p>

<p>On Saturday, a man tackled the suspect, 34-year-old Ailesh Kumar Hasmukhial Modi.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030227/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7496140">According to WABC 7</a>, the man&apos;s son spotted Modi, who now &quot;faces a number of charges including public lewdness, endangering the welfare of a child and resisting arrest.&quot;</p>
