<p>Amanda Bynes really wants to set the record straight about her alleged bong-tossing on Thursday night. She posted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144111/https://twitter.com/AmandaBynes/status/339046285778751489">very very very long missive on Twitter</a> outlining a few things&#x2014;like how she&apos;s suing the NYPD, that she&apos;s allergic to drugs and alcohol, she&apos;s also suing for being put in a mental hospital, and becoming a singer/rapper. Oh, and she&apos;s getting a nose job.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s her whole Tweet:</p><blockquote>For once and for all, this is the last thing I&apos;ll say about the mistaken arrest. I&apos;m suing NYPD for illegally entering my apartment, lying about drugs on me and lying about me tampering with non existent drug paraphernalia, then I&apos;m suing for being put into a mental hospital against my will, then locked up overnight for coming home after a facial and working out with my trainer like the good girl that I am. I&apos;m allergic to alcohol and drugs and don&apos;t partake in any of the above. I&apos;m so offended by all of this but so proud to not be a drug or alcohol user. I don&apos;t need to talk about this anymore. My lawyer and I are taking this offense so seriously! Everything they did was against the law and The judge saw that there was no drugs on me or proof of any type of bong or mental illness (I was so offended to even be taken to a mental hospital and they would not let me call my lawyer until the next day after being in jail all night, then I went to court and was immediately released because the judge saw that I was wrongly arrested. The cops found no proof of any type of drug use or evidence of drug paraphernalia such as a bong in or around my apartment) I&apos;m also suing my apartment complex for lying about me smoking in my building. I&apos;m free forever! You can&apos;t lock up an innocent person! Thanks for caring! Look forward to seeing me in music videos! I&apos;m getting in shape and getting a nose job! I&apos;m looking forward to a long and wonderful career as a singer/rapper!</blockquote>Police were called to Bynes&apos; West 47th Street apartment (on the 36th floor) after building workers believed she was smoking pot in the lobby. Bynes allegedly threw a bong out of the window. Hours after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144111/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/amanda_bynes_arrested_in_midtown_fo.php">arrested for marijuana possession</a>, reckless endangerment, and tampering with evidence&#x2014;and being taken to Roosevelt Hospital for a psych evaluation&#x2014; Bynes was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144111/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/amanda_bynes_heads_to_court_to_face.php">freed on her own recognizance</a>.<p></p>

<p>She has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144111/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/_view_more_videos_at.php">repeatedly denied owning a bong</a> and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144111/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/amanda_bynes_claims_nypd_officer_se.php">said that a cop slapped her vagina</a>. Now, Bynes is a hot target for paparazzi who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144111/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/26/messed-up_photographer_repeatedly_y.php">will stop at nothing to try to photograph her</a>.</p>
