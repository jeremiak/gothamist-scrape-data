<p>During this long weekend, the MTA will be doing a lot of service work. Fourteen lines are affected&#x2014;for instance, L train riders will have to take a shuttle bus between Lorimer and Broadway, &quot;due to yard fence work and track work at Myrtle Avenue and Halsey Avenue&quot;&#x2014;through Monday.  Also, there&apos;s no 1 train between 14th Street and South Ferry, the 2/3 is running local between Chambers and 96th Street, the uptown A/C/E is skipping stops... you can see what you may have to deal with at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190136/http://mta.info/">MTA&apos;s website</a> or you can see the notice below.  But there&apos;s one bright spot:  The Department of Transportation is handing out free MetroCards today and tomorrow!</p>

<p>As part of its &quot;You the Man&quot; campaign to reduce drunk driving, the DOT is giving away 1,000 single-ride MetroCars.  Today, they&apos;ll be at Red Hook Park baseball fields, followed by Prospect Park (near 15th Street), Brooklyn between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. and tomorrow they&apos;ll be in Central Park (around Great Lawn and Band Shell), Manhattan between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m.  Check the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190136/http://twitter.com/#!/YouTheManNYC">You the Man Twitter for more details</a>.</p>
