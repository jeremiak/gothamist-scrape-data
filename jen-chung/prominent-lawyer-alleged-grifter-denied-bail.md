According to the NY Times, prosecutors say the once-prominent lawyer &quot;<strong>used guile, a box of cellphones and a series of phony Web sites and e-mail addresses to steal more than $380 million</strong>.&quot;  A judge agreed that Dreier is a flight risk (the feds think he has assets hidden overseas), ignoring his defense lawyer Gerald Shargel&apos;s suggestion of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145634/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/12/12/2008-12-12_is_marc_dreier_a_gang_member_prison_offi.html">house arrest under two guards</a>&#x2014;and making his elderly mother and teenaged stepson responsible for $10 million bond.
