Though Bank of America announced a better-than-expected first quarter profit, CEO Ken Lewis said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103331/http://www.cnbc.com/id/30304651">there are still many credit problems</a>.  The market had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103331/http://www.cnbc.com/id/30267869">gaining over the past six weeks</a> but now an asset manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103331/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6I_wChaeq7w&amp;refer=home">told Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;<strong>We&#x2019;re going to get a lot of earnings releases this week and by and large they&#x2019;re going to be disappointing. Besides, we&#x2019;ve had a very sharp run-up in the market. So I see a period of consolidation now, maybe a week or two of declines.</strong>&quot;</p>
