<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_obprie.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524025348im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_obprie.jpg" width="290" height="214" class="image-left"> </span>President Obama decided to address the media about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524025348/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/01/justice_souter_restires_from_suprem.php">Supreme Court Justice David Souter&apos;s retirement</a> and made an unexpected cameo during White House press secretary Robert Gibbs&apos; press briefing.  After joking needing to do Gibbs&apos; job for him, Obama said he just spoke to Souter and called him a &quot;fair-minded and independent judge&quot; and noted how he &quot;consistently defied labels and rejected absolutes, focusing instead on just one task -- reaching a just result in the case that was before him.&quot;  The President added told Souter that he was &quot;incredibly grateful for his dedicated service.&quot;</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524025348/http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/05/01/The-Presidents-Remarks-on-Justice-Souter/">read the President&apos;s remarks here</a> or see them below.  As for the next justice, Obama said, &quot;<strong>I will seek somebody with a sharp and independent mind and a record of excellence and integrity</strong>.  I will seek someone who understands that justice isn&apos;t about some abstract legal theory or footnote in a case book.  It is also about how our laws affect the daily realities of people&apos;s lives -- whether they can make a living and care for their families; whether they feel safe in their homes and welcome in their own nation.&quot;  And you can see Souter&apos;s resignation letter here [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524025348/http://www.whitehouse.gov/asset.aspx?AssetId=1474">PDF</a>]&#x2014;look like he signed with a fountain pen.  </p>

<p>Obama ended his time at the press briefing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524025348/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/05/potus-interrupt.html">by telling reporters</a>, &quot;I would like you to give Robert a tough time again.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524025348/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/obama-announces-souters-retirement/">Caucus notes</a> that Gibbs, when he got the lectern back, told reporters &quot;You can be assured that we&#x2019;ll have a rigorous process in place,&quot; referring to the vetting issues that plagued Cabinet appointees earlier this year.</p>

<p>Also, Gawker has this quote from a dazzled Savannah Guthrie of MSNBC: &quot;I felt a little bit like I was having a dream sequence... We attend those briefings every day and rarely are they so exciting.&quot;</p>
