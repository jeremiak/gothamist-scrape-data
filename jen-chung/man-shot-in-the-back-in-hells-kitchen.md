<p>A 24-year-old man was shot in midtown Manhattan early this morning, and police believe the shooting may have stemmed from an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314084718/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-wounded-in-shooting-outside-manhattan-hotel/1763198/">incident at a &quot;nearby club.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The man was shot on West 48th Street and 11th Avenue, in Hell&apos;s Kitchen, around 4 a.m. An NYPD spokesperson said the victim heard some shots and then felt pain in his back, realizing he had been hit. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>The shooting happened near the Ink48 Hotel. One witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314084718/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Shot-West-Side-INK-Hotel-The-Press-Lounge-414235353.html">tells NBC New York</a> that the Ink48 Hotel&apos;s rooftop lounge, The Press Lounge &quot;was taped off shortly after the shooting.&quot;</p>

<p>There are no arrests at the time and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
