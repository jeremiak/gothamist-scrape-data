<p>A mother and son were allegedly assaulted outside their home on Thanksgiving morning by a group looking for a lost iPhone.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident took place at 3 a.m. on November 26th, when &quot;two females and a male knocked on the door of a house on Randall Avenue demanding their phone back.&quot; The trio allegedly insisted they tracked their lost iPhone to the house, but the occupants, a 43-year-old woman and her son, said they didn&apos;t have the phone and suggested they call the police.</p>

<p>The mother and son were able to get the suspects to leave their house, but the police say, &quot;when they tried to get their license plate, were assaulted by the suspects.&quot; The suspects fled and the mother and son were taken to Jacobi Hospital for treatment. </p>

<p>The authorities released surveillance footage of the two females &quot;at the location where they claimed to lose the phone&quot; and detectives would like to talk to them about the assault. </p>
