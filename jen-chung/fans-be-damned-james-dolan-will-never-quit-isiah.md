<p>After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172054/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/last_nights_action_david_stern_rule.php">NBA ruled</a> that the Knicks&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172054/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/06/like_a_bad_penny_isiah_thomas_is_ba.php">(re)hiring of Isiah Thomas</a> as a consultant, while Thomas would remain coach of Florida International University, was against league policy, Thomas rescinded his acceptance of the gig, &quot;After speaking with [NBA] Commissioner [David] Stern and Knicks executives, it has become apparent that my new agreement violates certain NBA bylaws. Because of this, I have decided to rescind my contract with the team. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Jim Dolan, Donnie Walsh, Mike D&#x2019;Antoni and the entire Knicks organization, and I want to thank them for affording me this opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172054/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/isiah_won_be_working_for_knicks_wE6ChdKRd6QwL5gAwOotxI">Post says</a> the NBA&apos;s decision &quot;[saves] Jim Dolan from himself,&quot; it seems that Dolan doesn&apos;t want to be saved: Dolan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172054/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/2010/08/11/2010-08-11_nba_sources_say_isiah_turns_down_knicks_gig.html">said in a later statement</a>, &quot;Although I&apos;m disappointed that Isiah will not be working with the Knicks as a consultant, I continue to believe in his basketball knowledge, including his ability to judge talent<strong>. He&apos;s a good friend of mine and of the organization and I will continue to solicit his views. He will always have strong ties to me and the team.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>One note: Thomas actually had a teeny mea culpa for his horrible &quot;official&quot; years with the Knicks, &quot;One of the biggest regrets of my life is that the Knicks didn&#x2019;t perform up to the standards the fans had every right to expect while I was in charge. I take full responsibility for that. I was very much looking forward to this unique opportunity to help the organization do what I do best: find basketball talent. I wish the team nothing but success in the future.&#x201D;</p>
