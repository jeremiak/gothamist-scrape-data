According to CityRoom, &quot;It came in response to a lawsuit the lawyers filed on Tuesday, claiming, among other things, that the process that led to the rezoning excluded and discriminated against minority groups around the Broadway Triangle site, including blacks and Latinos, violating the Constitution and federal and state civil rights laws.&quot; Now any work on the site will have to wait until a hearing in March.</p>
