<p>Do you have someone to impress on Valentine&apos;s Day, a bathing suit, and oh, $1,500 handy? Then the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065310/http://www.peninsula.com/new_york/en/Enticements/default.aspx?gclid=CN_LsoWP860CFULd4AodFCPRtw">Peninsula Hotel</a>&apos;s Valentine&apos;s Day dinner package might be for you: The Fifth Avenue hotel is offering only <em>one</em> couple the chance to splurge on a five-course meal with a chance to swim in its pool. And it&apos;ll be really private. The hotel says, &quot;The entire pool area, located on the 22nd floor and featuring views of the sparkling city skyline, will be reserved for the use of the couple to enjoy a five-course meal paired with a bottle of vintage Champagne and followed by a dip in the pool.&quot;</p>

<p>More details from the hotel: &quot;The couple will be greeted with a rose petal and candlelit walkway as they enter the pool area and are led to their romantic table, set elegantly for two with plush linens and glistening stemware. A personal attendant will be on hand to see to the couple&#x2019;s every need for the entire evening. Following dinner, the couple can slip into their swimsuits and enjoy a private swim in the pool, which is heated to a tempting 84 degrees F.&quot; It&apos;s unclear whether the personal attendant will remind the couple to wait a half hour before swimming.</p>

<p>While the $1,500 doesn&apos;t include tax or gratuity, there <em>are</em> &quot;His and hers monogrammed Peninsula robes and slippers.&quot;  The dinner is for 9 p.m. until 12 a.m. on February 14, 2012; to reserve, you must contact  the hotel (212-903 3923 or diningpny@peninsula.com) by February 10, 2012.  The real players, though, have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065310/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/white_castle_valentines_reservation.php">already made their Valentine&apos;s Day reservations at White Castle</a>.</p>
