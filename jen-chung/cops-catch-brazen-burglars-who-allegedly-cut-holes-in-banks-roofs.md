<p>Three Brooklyn residents were arrested yesterday for a pair of elaborate and well-orchestrated bank burglaries that involved using blow torches to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021143/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/queens_bank_robbery.php">cut through the banks&apos; roofs to access vaults</a>. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told reporters, &quot;These heists resembled scenes from the movie <em>Heat</em>&#x2014;the work of a crew that was well organized, meticulous and elusive to law enforcement.&quot; However, the robbers still left what U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said was &quot;enough of a trace for the FBI and NYPD&quot; to track them down.</p>

<p>The authorities say that Michael Mazzara, Charles Kerrigan and Anthony Mascuzzio are the culprits behind the April burglary of an HSBC in Brooklyn and the May burglary of a Maspeth Federal Saving Banks in Queens: &quot;On both occasions, the burglars used acetylene blowtorches to cut into the top of the banks&apos; vaults from the roof of the building. At the Maspeth Federal Savings Bank branch, they shielded their activities from view by constructing a plywood shed on the roof the bank.&quot;</p>

<p>Once they accessed the vaults, they took cash and ransacked safe deposit boxes. The estimated haul from the HSBC burglary was $330,000 in cash and an unknown amount of valuables, while the Maspeth bank was missing $296,000 in cash and $4.3 million in valuables. At the Maspeth bank, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021143/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/queens_bank_robbery.php">empty safe deposit boxes</a> were left on the roof. </p>

<p>Apparently surveillance footage and financial records showed Mazzara, Kerrigan and Muscuzzio preparing for the burglaries. Bratton said they bought plywood at Home Depot and procured torches from a welder in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>&quot;They partied in Las Vegas and took trips to Miami while residents of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and Rego Park [Queens] got taken to the cleaners,&quot; Bratton added.</p>

The younger Mascuzzio was released from federal lockup in March 2015 after doing time for selling pot.&quot; A lawyer is working on a bail package for him, while Mazzara was released on $2 million bond (with an ankle monitoring bracelet) and Kerrigan is free on $150,000 bond (also with an ankle monitoring bracelet). </p>
