McMillan is now a quadriplegic after injuries sustained in the 2003 crash and requires round-the-clock medical care.  His lawyer Evan Torgan said, &quot;He was gratified that the judge recognized his suffering [and] he&apos;s hoping that the case is almost over&quot; (the city is reviewing the decision).  Interestingly, Judge Weinstein also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160726144149/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/nyregion/18ferry.html?ref=nyregion">reduced Torgan&apos;s payment</a>, from a third to 20%, which means he&apos;ll get $3.7 million instead of $6.1 million.  Torgan said that was unfair, but Weinstein said, &quot;<strong>If the client should give you a gift of two and a half million dollars. I&#x2019;m not approving or disapproving it.</strong>&#x201D;</p>
