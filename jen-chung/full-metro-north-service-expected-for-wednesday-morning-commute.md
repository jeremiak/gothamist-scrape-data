                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_05_mncrash2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204428im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_mncrash2.jpg" width="640" height="436"> <br> <i> A view of the trains on Saturday, a day after the crash (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It looks like commuters on Metro-North&apos;s New Haven line will only have to endure one more day of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204428/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/20/mta_reveals_metro-north_weekday_com.php#photo-1">cobbled-together service</a>: The MTA believes it will have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204428/http://new.mta.info/metro-north-foresees-full-service-wednesday-morning">full service restored by tomorrow morning</a>. 100 workers have been working around the clock to fix the damaged line from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204428/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/at_least_20_injured_after_metro-nor.php">train derailment and collision on Friday night</a>.</p>

<p>The collision occurred near Bridgeport and essentially suspended service to New Haven. The MTA put a shuttle train between New Haven and Bridgeport, and also arranged for 120 buses for commuters, to help get them to New York City.</p>

<p>Metro-North President Howard Permut said, &quot;We are confident that the reconstruction work, inspection and testing will be completed in time for a normal rush hour on Wednesday. We are grateful for the tireless work of all departments and employees engaged in this huge task.&quot;</p>

<p>The MTA offered these stats about yesterday&apos;s commute: </p><blockquote>About 750 people rode the shuttle trains and boarded buses at Bridgeport to Stamford, just 20% of the 4,000 people who ordinarily board trains at New Haven, Milford and Stratford during the AM peak.  However, overall AM Peak ridership on the entire New Haven Line was down just 20%, which means, many people drove to other stations to catch a train.  And a 6% increase in ridership was counted on the Harlem Line.<br>
 <br>
In all, the buses, including the local, intermediate route, carried about 1,200 in the AM peak on Monday, May 20, and another 1,500 people between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. </blockquote>Still, some commuters were exhausted. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204428/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/northern_suburbs&amp;id=9107844">AP reports</a>, &quot;For Gary Maddin, the drive from his home in Milford, Conn., to the Bridgeport train station normally takes 20 minutes. On Monday, it took an hour. Then he had a shuttle bus and a train ride before he got to his destination, Grand Central Terminal in New York. &apos;It&apos;s a lot,&apos; he said. &apos;It&apos;s a nightmare just to get into the city today.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>The investigation into what caused the derailment is also continuing.</p>
