Yes, it&apos;s The Donald!  Black took up a possible Trump candidacy on The Daily Show last night, pointing out, &quot;You might say the guy would make a terrible leader. I mean, the guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163715/http://gothamist.com/2004/11/22/trump_to_financiers_im_brokeagain.php">bankrupted his own casino</a>.... a casino&#x2014;where the HOUSE ALWAYS WINS&#x2014;unless it&apos;s Donald Trump&apos;s house.  And you&apos;re right, he&apos;d make a terrible leader. But we&apos;re done with presidents&#x2014;we&apos;ve tried every option, dumb president, smart president, white president, black president&#x2014;DOESN&apos;T WORK. What this country needs is a third world dictator&#x2014;and Donald Trump has what it takes to be that.&quot;</p>

<p>Black went on, &quot;He&apos;s already got a plane with his name on it, solid gold buildings, a harem.&quot; Plus, his hair is as eerie as Kim Jong-Il&apos;s and his taste in decor is suspiciously like Saddam Hussein&apos;s. And then there&apos;s his ego&#x2014;he said in an interview last week, &quot;Part of the beauty of me is that I am very rich,&quot; claiming he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163715/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/03/17/trump-on-2012-part-of-beauty-of-me-is-im-very-rich/">could drop $600 million</a> into a campaign immediately. Of course, this is the same man who had to <em>sue</em> a reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163715/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/03/trump_drags_sulzberger_into_defamat.php">who cited his earnings as being in the hundreds of millions</a>, versus billions (the lawsuit was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414163715/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/judges_tosses_donald_trumps_la.html">thrown out</a>). Anyway, Black was thrilled, &quot;<strong>This is what I&apos;ve been waiting for my whole life. A President who&apos;s not afraid to tell the truth about being a lying asshole</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>And for you other Trump fans, the Draft Trump effort tells us they have a New York coordinator&#x2014;Marjory Jaeger &quot;known as a jack of all trades in Western New York political circles&quot; is on board and says, &quot;As we look toward 2012, Americans know what is on the line for us -- We know how imperative it is to take back our White House. I&apos;m hoping to garner as much support as possible for Mr. Trump, in New York, over the coming months.&quot;</p>
