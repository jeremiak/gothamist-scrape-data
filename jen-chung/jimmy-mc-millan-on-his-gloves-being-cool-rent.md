He&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161717/http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?q=the+rent+is+too+damn+high&amp;date=2010-10-19&amp;sa=X">on fire (according to Google)</a> and his mustache and gloves are making statements.  Oh, and why was he wearing gloves?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161717/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/10/jimmy-mcmillans-debate-gloves.html">He told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m a war vet. Don&#x2019;t forget I was in Vietnam for two and half years and I have three Bronze Stars, but the chemicals of Agent Orange -- dioxin and a lot of other chemicals mixed up -- I would get sick. When I get home tonight, I know I&#x2019;m not going to be able to breathe if I take them off. It could be psychological, I don&#x2019;t know, but I just put em on and wear them anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>McMillan, 64, has also&#x2014;naturally&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161717/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/american-mustache-institute-endorses-jimmy-mcmillan-for-governor/64826/">won the endorsement</a> of the American Mustache Institute (&quot;Indeed, as a person of Mustached American heritage, you represent all that is good and decent about America, and clearly, someone who should be leading the great state of New York&quot;) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161717/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18lesser.html">professed that his role model is Ronald Reagan</a>. He discussed his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161717/http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/jimmy-mcmillan-was-cool-hell?utm_medium=partial-text&amp;utm_campaign=home">debate performance with the Observer</a>, &quot;To be honest with you I was cool as hell. Even with my gloves on I was freezing, it was like I was in the North Pole!&quot; noting he&apos;s been &quot;endorsed by 200 different radio stations across the country and has received 40,000 emails of donations through his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161717/http://www.rentistoodamnhigh.org/">website</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>McMillan added he had some help, &quot;My niece called me this morning and said &apos;Uncle Jimmy, you&apos;ve got to slow down!&apos; But no, everything goes so fast- they put that little yellow light on and you have to make your point. So I thought to myself: &apos;I&apos;m a karate expert and a musician: I have 15 seconds. Now its time for the humorous Jimmy McMillan to come out.&apos; I used my humor to get my message out. And I got every person on that stage to say the rent is too damn high- it worked.&quot;</p>
