	<p>This morning, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended an interfaith prayer service in Boston, to remember the victims of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113605/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php">Monday&apos;s devastating bombing</a> during the Boston Marathon. He said, &quot;I&#x2019;m here today on behalf of the American people with a simple message: Every one of us has been touched by this attack on your beloved city. Every one of us stands with you.&quot; </p>

<p>The attacks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113605/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/17/all_three_fatalities_in_boston_bomb.php">killed three people</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113605/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/boston_marathon_bombings_terrorism.php#photo-1">injured nearly 200</a>. To the bomber(s), Obama pointedly said, &quot;Yes, we will find you. And, yes, you will face justice. We will find you. We will hold you accountable, but, more than that, our fidelity to our way of life, to a free and open society, will only grow stronger &#x2014; for God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity but one of power and love and self discipline.... It should be pretty clear by now that they picked the wrong city to do it.  Not here in Boston.  Not here in Boston.&quot;</p>

<p>During the service, a number of people spoke. Reverend Liz Walker of the Roxbury Presbyterian Church said, &quot;Help us find our way through the darkness now,&quot; while Boston Mayor Tom Menino told those gathered, &quot;Nothing can defeat the heart of this city.&quot;</p>

<p>Nasser Weddady, the civil rights director of the American Islamic Congress, mentioned witnessing a car bombing in Syria as a child, &quot;Whoever killed a soul, it is as if he killed mankind entirely. And whoever saves a soul, it is as if he save all mankind.&quot; He also noted that he had become a citizen just last week in Boston, pledging to protect the country, &quot;No one has to take a formal oath. We know instinctively that we must rise to the occasion. That is what makes us Americans.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113605/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/fbi_expected_to_release_photos_of_2.php">investigation is ongoing</a>.</p>
