<p>The man accused of robbing a Manhattan apartment was caught on camera by the home&apos;s surveillance video system. While the suspect stole the video camera, the footage was kept on the cloud. Thanks, Big Brother!</p>

<p>The police say that the burglary took place on Friday, July 22, at 1:37 p.m.: &quot;An unidentified male gained entry to an apartment on East 14th Street and Avenue A by picking the lock. Once inside, the unidentified male removed a white iPad 4, a Canary security system and other electronics/accessories with a combined value of $964.&quot;</p>

<p>The tenant, a 29-year-old man, was not at home at the time. </p>

<p>The suspect can be seen very clearly on the Canary video and is wearing a blue baseball cap, a striped polo shirt, grey cargo shorts and black sneakers:</p>
