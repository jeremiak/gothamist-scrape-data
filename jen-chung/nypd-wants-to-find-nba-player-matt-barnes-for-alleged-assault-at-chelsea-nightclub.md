<p>Sacramento Kings forward Matt Barnes said on Instagram, &quot;There&apos;s always two sides to a story,&quot; after it was reported that he was involved in an altercation at a Chelsea nightclub early this morning. The NYPD confirmed today that police are looking for the 36-year-old basketball player for allegedly assaulting three people.</p>

<p>Around 3:20 am., cops were called to Avenue Nightclub on 10th Avenue near 16th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015212/http://www.tmz.com/2016/12/05/matt-barnes-bar-fight/">According to TMZ</a>, the report mentioned &quot;a man assaulting 2 women and another man. We&apos;re told things got physical when Barnes allegedly choked one woman during an argument&#x2014;and when 2 other people tried to intervene ... he punched both of them.&quot;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015212/http://www.tmz.com/2016/12/05/matt-barnes-demarcus-cousins-fight-defense/">a rep for Barnes later told the gossip site</a> that &quot;Barnes was having a good time at Avenue Nightclub with his teammate, DeMarcus Cousins, when he went to sit at his VIP booth and accidentally &quot;butt bumped&quot; a woman who was at the next booth over. Barnes claims the woman reacted by slapping him in the face, hard&#x2014;and that&apos;s when all hell broke loose.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015212/http://nypost.com/2016/12/05/matt-barnes-accused-of-choking-woman-in-nightclub/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;Barnes allegedly choked a 26-year-old woman sitting at a nearby table after she reached over to grab something, according to sources. That&#x2019;s when her 35-year-old boyfriend intervened and got hit in the head by bottle. The bottle was not thrown by Barnes, sources said.&quot; </p>

<p>Then more bottles were allegedly thrown, and a 27-year-old woman was hit by one. A source told the Post, &quot;Don&#x2019;t know what sparked the dispute. This was a wild melee. This was a real good old fashioned barroom brawl.&quot;</p>

<p>A video from TMZ shows Cousins saying, &quot;I hit hit the s*** out this ni***!</p>

<p>Barnes&apos;s attorney told TMZ, &quot;We do not believe a crime was committed and are hopeful no charges will be pressed.&quot;</p>

<p>The Kings were in town to play against the Knicks last night. Before the Kings&apos; loss, Barnes showed off his clothes:</p>
