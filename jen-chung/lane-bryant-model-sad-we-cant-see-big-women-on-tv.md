<p>Because no one can get enough of controversy, even manufactured controversy, over a commercial featuring a plus-size model in a bra and underwear, here&apos;s more about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170846/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/lane_bryant_claims_abc_doesnt_like.php">Lane Bryant lingerie ad kerfuffle</a>:  </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_04_agrahama.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170846im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_agrahama.jpg" width="230" height="213" class="image-left"> </span>Model Ashley Graham, who is size 16 and 38D, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170846/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-lane-bryant-model,0,6539838.story">spoke to WPIX </a>about how ABC and Fox declined to air the ad, &quot;The Victoria&apos;s Secret girls can flaunt around their panties all day long. But when there&apos;s a bigger woman with a little bit extra, they snipped it out immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>Lane Bryant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170846/http://insidecurve.lanebryant.com/buzz/the-lingerie-commercial-fox-and-abc-didnt-want-it/">&quot;Inside Curve&quot; blog says,</a> &quot;ABC refused to show the commercial during &apos;Dancing with the Stars&apos; without restricting our airtime to the final moments of the show.  Fox demanded excessive re-edits and rebuffed it three times before relenting to air it during the final 10 minutes of &#x201C;American Idol,&#x201D; but only after we threatened to pull the ad buy... <strong>We knew the ads were sexy, but they are not salacious</strong>... If Victoria&#x2019;s Secret and Playtex can run ads at any time during the 9pm to 10pm hour, why is Lane Bryant restricted only to the final 10 minutes?&quot; The ad is after the jump.</p>

<p>Graham went on to tell WPIX, &quot;Honestly, it&apos;s sad. It&apos;s sad to me. I feel sad for all the women that are plus-sized ... I think the majority of women in America are my size, 12, 14, 16 and they want to see themselves on television, <strong>they want to see themselves being beautiful in a bra and underwear</strong>.&quot;</p>
