<p>Last night, an explosion occurred at a Totowa, NJ factory that produces egg nog flavoring. Two workers were injured.</p>

<p>The incident happened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015115/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2-injured-in-explosion-at-totowa-s-pharmachem-laboratories-1.1061351">around 7 p.m.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015115/http://7online.com/news/2-injured-after-vat-of-eggnog-flavoring-explodes-in-totowa/236680/">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;The sudden explosion ripped through three stories of Pharmachem Laboratories on 15 Adams Drive on Saturday evening... Pharmachem produces ingredients that flavor foods. <strong>Investigators say workers had just gotten started on a new recipe for eggnog when somehow, it ignited.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Totowa Fire Marshal Allen Del Vecchio said, &quot;There was a big vat that had this product in it... what we&apos;re trying to determine is what ignited this product and caused the explosion.&quot; He added that he could feel the explosion a mile away in his own home, &quot;The whole back of the building was completely blown out, probably half of this building may have to be torn down.&quot;</p>

<p>The workers luckily only suffered minor injuries. </p>
