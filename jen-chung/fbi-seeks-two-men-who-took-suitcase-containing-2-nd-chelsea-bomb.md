<p>The FBI has put out a formal notice asking for help in finding the two men who took the second pressure cooker bomb out of a suitcase in Chelsea last weekend. The discovery of the second bomb led the authorities to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/ahmad_khan_rahami.php">suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami</a>.</p>

<p>From the FBI&apos;s release:</p><blockquote>Closed circuit television recordings indicate that these individuals allegedly located a piece of luggage on the sidewalk, removed an improvised explosive device from the luggage, and then left the vicinity leaving the device behind but taking the luggage.<p></p>

<p>The image shown was taken on West 27th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues in Manhattan between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., on Saturday, September 17, 2016, in the same hour that an explosive device had detonated on West 23rd Street.</p>

<p>The FBI is interested in speaking to these individuals and recovering the luggage.</p>

<p>If you have any information concerning this case, please contact the FBI&apos;s Toll-Free Tipline at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324), your local FBI office, or the nearest American Embassy or Consulate.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Federal officials say that Rahami placed a series of bombs in New York and NJ on Saturday and Sunday: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/pipe_bomb_explodes_on_route_of_seas.php">Three pipe bombs&#x2014;one of which detonated</a>&#x2014;were found in Seaside Park, NJ on Saturday morning; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/chelsea_explosion.php">bomb exploded on West 23rd Street</a> in Manhattan at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, injuring dozens; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/18/chelsea_explosion_investigation_con.php#photo-1">bomb was found on West 27th Street</a> before midnight on Saturday and removed by the NYPD; and on Sunday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/nypd_ids_man_chelsea_explosion.php">five pipe bombs were found in a trash can</a> at the Elizabeth, NJ train station (a bomb robot detonated one). </p>

<p>Regarding the West 27th Street bomb, police say that two men were seen on surveillance video. According to the Post, &quot;A pair of scavengers unknowingly handled a pressure cooker bomb when they removed the device from a suitcase in Chelsea before leaving it exposed on the sidewalk while walking off with the rolling luggage, sources and police officials said. Two men captured on video surveillance Saturday night can be seen opening the bag on West 27th Street, removing the bomb from the suitcase, placing it on the sidewalk and then walking away with the suitcase, sources said.&quot; </p>

They had actually picked this up off the street and they walked off with it.&quot;</p>

<p>The exposed pressure cooker, which had Christmas lights and a cellphone attached, was then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/chelsea_bomb_discovery.php">spotted by a resident who called the police</a>. The cellphone was traced back to Rahami, a 28-year-old NJ resident.</p>

<p>The Elizabeth, NJ bombs were found by a homeless man and his friend who were looking for a bag. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022751/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/us/elizabeth-nj-garbage-bomb-heroes/">Lee Parker said</a>, &quot;When I noticed the bag I said, &apos;This is fine, I can have this for work, I can put my lunch in.&apos;&quot; His friend Ivan White said, &quot;I knew what I was looking at as soon as I saw it. It wasn&apos;t the cartoon bomb with the tick-tock tick-tock, but it had wires.&quot;</p>
