The police are treating the slaying as a homicide, but the victim&apos;s relatives believe it&apos;s also a hate crime.<p></p>

<p>Nazma Khanam had been walking home with her husband from their souvenir shop on Wednesday night when she was attacked outside of 160-12 Normal Road in Jamaica. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022647/http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/aunt-of-nypd-transit-cop-killed-in-robbery-attempt/">The Post reports</a> that her husband had stopped at one point: &quot;His asthma acted up, and the 60-year-old retired teacher walked ahead of him while he caught his breath. Just moments after his wife was out of view, the husband heard her let out a blood curdling scream &#x2014; and sprinted to catch up with her. When he found Khanam, she was bleeding on the sidewalk with a piece of the knife sticking out of her, cops said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody killed me,&quot; Khanam <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022647/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-stabbed-death-queens-walking-home-husband-article-1.2773987">reportedly</a> told her husband as he held her in his arms. Khanam was rushed to Jamaica Hospital and pronounced dead shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The couple had come to the U.S. in 2009 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022647/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/02/queens-woman-stabbed-funeral/">became citizens in June</a>.</p>

<p>Khanam was wearing traditional Muslim clothing, and her family doesn&apos;t think she was the target of a would-be robber. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022647/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-stabbed-death-queens-walking-home-husband-article-1.2773987">A nephew told the Daily News</a> &quot;They didn&#x2019;t take her phone, pocketbook, bag, nothing. We feel this is a hate crime... We want justice.&quot; </p>

<p>Earlier in the month, an imam and his assistant were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022647/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/queens_muslim_murdered.php#photo-1">fatally shot, execution-style, in Ozone Park</a>, stoking fears that they were targeted because they were Muslim. (The suspect, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022647/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/nyregion/man-charged-in-killing-of-queens-imam-and-aide-pleads-not-guilty.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion">pleaded not guilty on Thursday</a>, has yet to be charged with a hate crime).</p>

<p>&quot;The thing that&apos;s very shocking is that this was 9 at night,&quot; resident Tahir Qayyum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022647/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/01/queens-woman-fatally-stabbed/">told CBS2</a>. &quot;The fact that a few weeks ago, an imam was killed, the election, the hate sentiment. I understand everything is going to say it was a hate crime, but I don&apos;t want to rush to judgement until the police clarify.&quot;</p>

<p>The authorities released video of a male person of interest in Khanam&apos;s killing:</p>
