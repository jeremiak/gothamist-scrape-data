</div></div>					<p>The 250-foot tall crane that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150505/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/27/crane_collapse_in_lower_manhattan.php">partially collapsed and ended up leaning on 80 Maiden Lane</a> last night was righted and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150505/http://www.ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/115981/crews-secure-fallen-crane-in-lower-manhattan">taken apart</a> this morning. No one was injured (even though some of the building&apos;s bricks fell when the crane hit it) but concerns over the crane&apos;s stability prompted the evacuation some neighboring Financial District buildings.  This morning, residents and workers in 80, 83, 90 and 100 Maiden Lane as well as 2 Gold Street were allowed back (there are still some street closures) as the authorities continue to investigate.</p>

<p>One area resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150505/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/pedestrians_flee_as_crane_smacks_o3RiEwml2MyAvD8ET8FYOJ">told the Post</a>, &quot;We saw it inching down, it took off some of its fa&#xE7;ade. I don&apos;t know how it didn&apos;t do more damage.&quot; Another said the installation of the crane &quot;looked wrong from the start.&quot; And one person was very lucky, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150505/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/27/2010-03-27_crane_crashes_into_top_of_25story_building_in_manhattan_sending_bricks_flying_do.html">telling the Daily News</a>, &quot;All of a sudden I heard these tremendous bangs, like thunder. I looked up and stuff was pouring down out of the sky. Big, big chunks of the side of the building. ... I jumped under an awning to save myself.&quot;</p>

<p>The crane was set up in a plaza across from 80 Maiden Lane yesterday morning to move the building&apos;s AC units.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150505/http://www.1010wins.com/Crane-Righted--Off-Building/6672275">AP reports</a>, &quot;It was unclear what it was doing at the time because it was likely workers had already gone home for the day, Department of Buildings Commissioner Robert LiMandri said.&quot;  Well, one person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150505/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7354595">who spoke to WABC 7 said</a>, &quot;I thought it was kind of strange. It occurred to me when I was walking by,<strong> I wondered why they had the base of the crane on this unconsolidated earth, instead of street level.</strong> So I&apos;m really not surprised that they&apos;re having problems with it right now.&quot;</p>
