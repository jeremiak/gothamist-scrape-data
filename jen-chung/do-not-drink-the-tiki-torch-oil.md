Apparently the victims from Burlington and Bergen Counties believed they were drinking apple juice, but it&apos;s actually a kerosene-like substance (one victim was an 8-year-old girl who now has permanent lung damage; another person &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102174519/http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/topstories/index.ssf/2008/07/tikitorch_oil_kills_woman_and.html">mistook the oil for bottled water and tried to make coffee, but didn&apos;t get sick</a>&quot;).  NJ Poison Information and Education System executive director Steve Marcus says, &quot;During my 40 years in medicine, you get an occasional kid who ingests kerosene, but I have never seen this kind of cluster.&quot;  The product is Tiki Torch Fuel from Lamplight Farms Inc.</p>
