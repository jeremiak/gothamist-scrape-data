<p>A judge ordered that a Brooklyn woman held without bail after she was arraigned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015426/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/24/brooklyn_woman_arrested_for_killing_1.php">for killing her roommate</a> and then dismembering her body before leaving the parts all over Long Island. District Court Judge G. Ann Spelman said Leah Cuevas, 42, was &quot;charged with the worst conduct that humans can be capable of.&quot;</p>

<p>Suffolk County prosecutors say that Cuevas had rented out a room to Chinelle Latoya Browne, 27, in her Brooklyn apartment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015426/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/leah-cuevas-to-be-arraigned-in-slaying-of-chinelle-browne-cops-say-1.8880871">From Newsday</a>:</p><blockquote>Witnesses to their final argument told investigators Cuevas was &quot;pretending&quot; to be the landlord and had been collecting $400 a month from Browne for four to five months, according to court papers.<p></p>

<p>The building didn&apos;t have hot water, and a cord from the apartment prosecutors said Cuevas shared with her husband supplied the only electricity, which would periodically be shut off, according to court records.</p>

<p>Browne eventually learned that Cuevas was not the landlord and the two had argued, said a law enforcement source who did not want to be identified.</p></blockquote>Witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015426/http://nypost.com/2014/07/24/woman-decapitated-roommate-as-she-begged-for-her-life-court-docs/">say they heard Browne crying out</a>, &quot;<strong>No, Lee! No, Lee! What you doing? Oh no! Oh no! ... I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry</strong>,&quot; before screaming. Prosecutors allege that Cuevas decapitated Browne; Browne&apos;s blood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015426/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/24/suspect-charged-after-womans-dismembered-body-found-on-l-i-due-in-court/">was found in Cuevas&apos; apartment and hallway</a>. One neighbor Donald Watson told WCBS 2, &quot;We heard all the argument, and we never knew that it escalated to this,&quot; while another said of Cuevas, &quot;She was mean lady. She want to fight with everybody.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Body parts, including the arms and the head, were found in four different locations in Bay Shore and Hempstead earlier this month. Detectives believed the body to be Browne&apos;s because a tattoo on an arm matched one of hers. </p>

(Browne) said she wanted to take her money and move out but the landlord said, &#x2018;No.&#x2019; She wanted the $200 ... but Browne said, &#x2018;I need the $200 to move out.&#x2019;&quot; The News adds, &quot;Browne also accused Cuevas of having sex with a man on a city bus, allegations made in front of Cuevas&#x2019; husband, court documents show.&quot;</p>

<p>Browne came to New York from Guyana, where she left behind her husband and four children. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015426/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/nyregion/brooklyn-woman-is-accused-of-dismembering-neighbor.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">Dale Browne said that his wife was looking for an apartment</a> so the rest of the family could join her, &quot;My wife was a human being, a mother of four, a wife and all that goes with that connotation. She loved her family; she made a sacrifice to leave Guyana to come here... What hurt the most is when the prosecutor described the words that she screamed out. I can hear those words, you know? Pretty animalistic. Just a beast that did this.&quot;</p>
