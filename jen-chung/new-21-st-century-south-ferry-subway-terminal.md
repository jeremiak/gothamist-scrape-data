</div></div><p>Yesterday, the MTA offered a first look at the new $530-million South Ferry subway terminal. The project, the bulk ($420 million) funded by the feds, is an definite upgrade. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142622/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2008/12/12/inside-the-new-south-ferry-terminal/">Second Ave. Sagas went on the tour and reports</a>:</p><blockquote>The current station at South Ferry is more than a bit decrepit. It&#x2019;s a tiny station with room for five cars, and since it&#x2019;s on a steep curve, it employs movable platforms. Somehow, it also serves six million passengers a year bound for Staten Island, Lady Liberty and all points in between...<p></p>

<p>So what can you get for $527 million these days? Well, for starters, we get 1800 feet of total construction. Of that, 1200 of those feet are a part of a brand new tunnel with the remainder serving as the station.</p>

<p>Instead of just one track, we now have two ten-car tracks. The station will serve as a bona fide terminal. As such, according to the MTA, the potential capacity along the 1 line will increase from around 17 trains an hour to up to 24, and the easing of the Lower Manhattan bottleneck could shave six minutes off of a trip from 242nd St. to South Ferry. The station is also equipped with signals ready for computer-based train control, if and when the MTA gets that program off the drawing board and into the tunnels.</p></blockquote>This also means the platform is full-length&#x2014;no more rushing to the front of the car to leave.  There&apos;s also &quot;tempered air&quot; (air-circulation!), loads of security cameras and a gorgeous mosaic map of Manhattan.   MTA Capital Construction executive Uday Dorg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142622/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/12/12/2008-12-12_new_south_ferry_subway_station_to_open_i.html">mentioned the rubber panels</a> under the rail ties that will absorb noise, &quot;You don&apos;t get the same screeching noise when the train pulls into the station.&quot;  And the Daily News also noted MTA Capital Construction president Michael Horodniceanu&apos;s proud proclamation, &quot;It&apos;s a real 21st Century station.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142622/http://www.silive.com/news/advance/index.ssf?/base/news/12290877048010.xml">Advance says</a> the old station will become train storage for &quot;two or three extra trains on hand for rush hours.&quot;  And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142622/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/nyregion/12station.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times found</a> the station a little sterile and clinical, what with the gleaming white tile, but maybe that&apos;s because it&apos;s...clean.  </p>
