<p>The 21-year-old man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021431/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/30/your_move_naked_cowboy.php">taunted police for almost 90 minutes while pacing naked</a> on a Times Square structure before falling onto the sidewalk has officially been charged with crimes for his antics. </p>

<p>Krit McClean was arrested for public lewdness and disorderly conduct, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021431/http://nypost.com/2016/07/01/naked-times-square-guy-arrested-for-crazy-hour-long-show/">according to the Post</a>. On Thursday, he took off his clothes in Duffy Square around 7 a.m., and, a Gray Line bus tour ticket seller told us, Times Square Alliance workers told him to put his clothes back on. McClean did but then took them off again and eventually went up the red stairs above the TKTS booths on West 47th Street. </p>

<p>By 7:40 a.m., the police were on the scene, trying to convince McClean to come down. He spent the next hour and a half dancing, running and squatting (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021431/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b2hFhOh4SE">see video</a>), while yelling disparate statements, like asking for Donald Trump or  yelling &quot;I love fashion! It&#x2019;s taught me so much.&quot; A smoothie stand worker thought he also said, &quot;Mom mom mom mom.&quot; </p>

<p>McClean also taunted the officers, spitting at them and punching them in the arm. The incident was Periscoped by a person at the Olive Garden across the street. </p>

<p>The NYPD set up an inflatable rescue cushion, but McClean, who threatened to jump repeatedly, ended up jumping off the 16 foot high structure and landing on the sidewalk. He broke his arm. </p>

<p>The Post reports that when Police Commissioner Bratton was asked if McClean had drugs with him, Bratton said, &quot;He was naked &#x2014; he didn&#x2019;t have any drugs on him.&quot; His clothes were found neatly folded near 46th Street and a backpack was also recovered. </p>

<p>McClean, who has worked as model, is still under psychiatric evaluation at Bellevue Hospital.</p>
