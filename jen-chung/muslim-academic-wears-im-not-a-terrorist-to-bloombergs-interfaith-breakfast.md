<p>While some Muslim leaders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003253/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/muslim_leaders_boycott_bloombergs_i.php">boycotted Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s interfaith breakfast</a>&#x2014;noting the reports that the NYPD has been spying on Muslim communities&#x2014;but one Muslim academic and activist attended...and wore a t-shirt that said, &quot;I AM NOT A TERRORIST.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003253/http://www.husseinrashid.com/">Hussein Rashid</a> explained on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003253/http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/husseinrashid/5539/muslim_boycott_of_bloomberg&#x2019;s_interfaith_breakfast/">Religion Dispatches yesterday</a>:</p><blockquote>This boycott makes it obvious that while the NYPD is targeting Muslims, they are violating the rights of Americans. The issue is not a Muslim one, but an American one. My goal in going to make sure my compatriots from other faith traditions understand how serious this threat is. If I am suspect, and based on what we know of the NYPD&#x2019;s scattershot approach I have no reason to believe I am not, then anyone I associate with is suspect. I intend to meet as many faith leaders as I can tomorrow and ask them how they feel about spied upon by the NYPD.Capital New York&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003253/http://twitter.com/#!/azipaybarah">Azi Paybarah</a> spotted Rashid and took a photograph; Rashid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003253/http://twitter.com/#!/islamoyankee/status/152788439086018560">later Tweeted</a> (in response to a question <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003253/http://twitter.com/#!/Newyorkist/status/152777621174882304">from NewYorkist</a>), &quot;staff saw. no comment. lots of supportive comments from other interfaith leaders&quot; and &quot;For those interested in my T-shirt, I got it from @blacklava http://tinyurl.com/cabvw4k&quot;<p></p>

We understand some people may question what we do. I think some of the issues that surfaced in these articles are half-truths, are things that are not true. But we understand. <strong>That&apos;s life in the big city.</strong>&quot;</p></blockquote>
