<p>Last night, a pair of home invasion robbers attempted to pillage a home in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. However, a 10-year-old boy managed to disarm one of the robbers and then shoot the gun to ward them off.</p>

<p>Around 5:30 p.m., two men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022817/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gun_kid_foils_thugs_DfS6l5xrRKb7EqZfMuyxVN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">posing as FedEx deliveryman entered the home</a>, which had two teens and the boy. The Post reports the men &quot;ordered two teens to stay in the living room while they searched the house.&quot;</p>

<p>When one of the armed robbers got to the boy&apos;s bedroom, the boy apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022817/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Boy-Fires-Gun-at-Robbers-Home-Invasion-Suspects-Canarsie-Brooklyn-210026651.html">slammed the door against the man</a> so hard that the robber dropped his gun. </p>

<p>Then the boy<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022817/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/04/police-boy-10-foils-home-invasion-in-brooklyn/"> picked up the gun and fired it</a>, which prompted the two robbers to flee. </p>

<p>Neighbors were amazed&#x2014;one said to WCBS 2, &quot;He&#x2019;s a brilliant kid if he did that. He&#x2019;s a brave kid to save his mother and father.&quot; The police are investigating and have reportedly spoken to members of the family. Another neighbor told the Post, &quot;They have a store, so maybe the person who robbed them knew there was a lot of cash in there. Look, they have two brand-new BMWs in the driveway,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, that&#x2019;s kind of unusual for this neighborhood.&quot;</p>
