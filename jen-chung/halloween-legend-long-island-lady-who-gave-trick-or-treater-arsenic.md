<p>Are stories of Halloween poisoned candy just propaganda from dentists and concerned parents&#x2014;or is it real?  Well, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031947/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/birth_of_ween_legend_cp7nItVVtwzB4NQjJlhw3J#ixzz1cHZKSCUL">Post suggests</a> that the 1964 incident of a Long Island woman who handed out arsenic pellets was the one that launched a million fears.  </p>

<blockquote>It was Oct. 31, 1964, when Elise Drucker, her sister Irene and a school pal set out along Salem Ridge Road in Greenlawn to fill their sacks with goodies.

<p>&#x201C;We were hobos,&#x201D; said Elise Gray, 60, then a teen enjoying one of her last Halloweens.<br>
When they arrived at Helen Pfeil&#x2019;s house, it started as a typical interaction between candy seeker and candy giver.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you a little old to be trick-or-treating?&#x201D; Pfeil, then 47, softly teased.</p>

<p>The housewife -- a mother of teenage children herself -- dropped what appeared to be a load of sugary loot into each of the three bags.</p>

<p>The youngsters had no way of knowing that arsenic pellets had been mixed in with the candy, wrapped in napkins.</p>

<p>It wasn&#x2019;t until the girls returned home that the sinister truth was revealed.</p>

<p>Gray, now married and living in Maine, said her mom dutifully spread the colorful treats out on the table at their Centerport home to investigate.</p>

<p>And it&#x2019;s a good thing she did.</p>

<p>Inside a napkin was a bottle-cap-shaped ant trap with the warning &#x201C;poison.&#x201D;</p></blockquote> Snopes has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031947/http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp">little more description about Pfeil&apos;s actions</a>: &quot;Annoyed that many of the trick-or-treaters were too old to be asking for free candy, she made up packages of inedible &quot;treats&quot; to give to teenagers. The packages contained dog biscuits, steel wool pads, and the ant buttons (which were clearly marked &quot;Poison&quot; and labeled with a skull and crossbones). She also took the precaution of telling the teenagers the packages were a joke when she handed them out, and there is no record of anyone&apos;s being harmed by her actions.&quot; Still, Pfeil pleaded guilty to endangering children and served a suspended sentence.  <p></p>

<p>The Halloween candy tampering fear reached its height in 1982 (prompted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031947/http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/menus/candy-tampering.htm">Tylenol tampering incident that killed 12</a>) but while tampered candy was found, no children died. A sociologist who studies &quot;Halloween sadism&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031947/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/birth_of_ween_legend_cp7nItVVtwzB4NQjJlhw3J?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">explained to the Post</a>, &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t believe in ghosts and goblins. We believe in criminals. We have revised what the Halloween menace is -- [from] the homicidal maniac [to] a person so crazy that he poisons the candy of strangers.&#x201D; </p>
