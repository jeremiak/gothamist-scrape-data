					<p>A stunning, three-story&#x2014;don&apos;t worry, it has its own private glass elevator&#x2014;penthouse with panoramic views of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn is now off the market as the most expensive condo sale ever in Brooklyn. The Clock Tower penthouse at 1 Main Street in DUMBO was sold for $15 million. That works out to $3.75 million for each of those four 14-foot glass clocks!</p>

<p>The apartment, which is 6,813 square feet with three bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms, has been for sale since 2010, when its asking price was $25 million. When Corcoran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091355/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/2546956">took over the listing in 2013</a>, the apartment was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091355/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/07/insane_dumbo_clocktower_apartment_o.php#photo-1">re-listed at $18 million</a>... more reasonable, right?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091355/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/realestate/a-brooklyn-condo-sells-for-a-record-15-million.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Real%20Estate&amp;pgtype=imageslideshow&amp;module=RelatedArticleList&amp;region=CaptionArea&amp;version=SlideCard-1&amp;_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, the apartment has been in contract since June: &quot;[T]he closing was delayed, [Corcoran&apos;s Frank] Castelluccio said, while the developer, the Two Trees Management Company of Dumbo, made some design modifications to the apartment at the buyer&#x2019;s request. &apos;He felt very tranquil there,&apos; Mr. Castelluccio said of the buyer, who plans to use the unit as a primary residence, &apos;even though the whole city was buzzing underneath.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Monica Luque of Douglas Elliman represented the buyer.</p>

<p>The apartment&apos;s &quot;clock tower&quot; is instantly recognizable while heading to Brooklyn on the Brooklyn Bridge, and the building is steps from Brooklyn Bridge Park. Anne Hathaway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091355/http://ny.curbed.com/2014/6/11/10089122/anne-hathaway-dreams-of-ditching-4-25m-clocktower-loft">used to live in the building</a>, but since she left there&apos;s still a celebrity quotient there: Socialite Olivia Palermo and husband Johannes Huebl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091355/http://observer.com/2017/01/olivia-palermo-johannes-huebl-buy-brooklyn-nyc-apartment/">reside there</a>. The apartment also inspired this timeless almost-NSFW <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403091355/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/23/brooklyn_paper_editor_makes_real_re.php">Brooklyn Paper video</a>.</p>
