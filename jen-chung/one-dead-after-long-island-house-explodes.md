<p>Last night, a home in Port Washington, Long Island went up in flames after an explosion. A woman and child were able to escape, but police say a body was found near the house.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014940/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/investigation-continues-into-port-washington-explosion-fire-1.8977165">According to Newsday</a>, the fire started just before 9 p.m.&#x2014;and police were already on the property for a domestic call:</p><blockquote>&quot;&apos;As they led the individuals to safety the detached garage exploded and burst into flames,&apos; Nassau police said in a statement released Wednesday.<p></p>

<p>Police did not say Wednesday if the domestic call is the focus of an ongoing probe by arson and homicide investigators into the cause of the explosion and the fast-moving fire that followed. The explosion and fire destroyed a detached garage or &quot;carriage house&quot; and the concussion from the blast was reportedly felt by residents in towns more than a mile away.</p></blockquote>One witness described a fireball <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014940/http://nypost.com/2014/08/05/one-dead-after-house-explodes-on-long-island/">that was 30 feet tall</a>. Neighbors felt their homes shake and worried the fire would spread to other houses.<p></p>
