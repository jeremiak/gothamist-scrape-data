title: Insensitive "I Might Have Tacos" Mayor Still Hasn't Resigned

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_01_maturo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128213519im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_01_maturo.jpg" width="365" height="264" class="image-left"> </span>Two days after telling a TV reporter that he would reach out to the Latino community by maybe having some tacos, East Haven, Connecticut mayor Joe Maturo is still getting criticized.  Yesterday, the Hartford Courant called for his resignation in an editorial, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128213519/http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/editorials/hc-ed-maturo-20120125,0,5721278.story">&quot;The Mayor Is An Idiot,&quot;</a> and today, the NY Times has an editorial, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128213519/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/opinion/an-outrage-in-east-haven-conn.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">&quot;An Outrage in East Haven,&quot;</a> asking for the same.</p>

<p>Four officers from the East Haven police department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128213519/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/in_wake_of_racist_cop_scandal_ct_ma.php">were arrested by the FBI</a>, and federal authorities say they had violated Latinos&apos; civil rights by &quot;conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate various members of the East Haven community in violation of their constitutional rights... In some cases, the victims were handcuffed with their hands behind their backs when officers assaulted them.&quot; Maturo has essentially supported the department, saying that while the charges were disturbing, they were innocent until proven guilty.  When WPIX reporter Mario Diaz asked him, &quot;What are you doing for the Latino community tonight?&quot;, Maturo said sarcastically, &quot;I might have tacos when I go home. I&apos;m not quite sure yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Maturo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128213519/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-east-haven-mayor-denies-investigation,0,3187656.story">who hasn&apos;t resigned</a>,  claimed he was giving a flippant response to a flippant question, but numerous people have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128213519/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/hundreds_of_tacos_delivered_to_inse.php">slammed his ill-considered remarks</a> and an immigration activist group delivered 500 tacos to his office.  On the other hand, one Latino resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128213519/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/nyregion/east-haven-mayor-continues-to-be-criticized-for-tacos-remarks-about-latino-abuse.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;Enough is enough. It was the wrong comment to make. There was never a proper time to make that kind of comment. It was uncalled for, and it&#x2019;s time to move on.&quot;<br>
