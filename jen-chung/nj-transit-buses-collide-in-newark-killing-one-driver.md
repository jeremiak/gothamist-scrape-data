<p>A NJ Transit bus driver died after two NJ Transit buses collided in Newark this morning. It&apos;s believed that both buses &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011748/http://abc7ny.com/news/bus-driver-dead-19-hurt-after-njt-buses-collide-in-newark/1475969/">ran into each other, likely at high speed</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The crash occurred around 6 a.m., at Raymond Boulevard and Broad Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011748/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NJ-2-NJ-Transit-Buses-Collide-Serious-Accident-Injuries-Newark-390676851.html">NBC New York described the scene</a>: &quot;one bus smashed into the other, crumpling the multi-ton vehicle like an accordion and spewing glass on the ground amid mangled chunks of metal.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011748/http://pix11.com/2016/08/19/new-jersey-bus-appears-to-t-bone-another-forcing-it-to-flip-at-newark-intersection/">PIX 11 reports</a>, &quot;A No. 59 bus driver was traveling northbound on Broad Street with no passengers onboard and T-boned the No. 13 bus going west on Raymond Blvd. with about 20 passengers onboard, according to a NJ Transit spokesperson. The driver of the No. 59 bus was killed in the crash and several passengers were hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>A different bus driver who saw the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011748/http://pix11.com/2016/08/19/new-jersey-bus-appears-to-t-bone-another-forcing-it-to-flip-at-newark-intersection/">said one bus ran a red light</a>.</p>

<p>A good Samaritan, Khalil Smith, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011748/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/19/newark-buses-collide/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I was standing at the bus stop down here when the 13 [bus] pulled down. The light changed and the other bus T-boned the 13, knocking it into the air. Me and a couple of other guys start trying to pull people out of the bus, break the windows and pull pieces of the chairs and stuff out of the bus to get to the people.&quot;</p>
