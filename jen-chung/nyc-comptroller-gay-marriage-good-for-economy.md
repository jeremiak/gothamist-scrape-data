The report is an update of his 2007 study, <em>Love Counts: The Economic Benefits of Marriage Equality for New York</em>. If the recession doesn&apos;t reduce the number of out-of-state guest, NY State could expect a $210 million gay marriage boom ($178 million is the recession is a factor) while NYC would expect $149 million ($120 million if the recession affects guest count). There <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133009/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/would-gay-marriage-help-the-state-economy/">would be higher insurance costs</a>&#x2014;$69 million, $37 million paid by employers.  Thompson said, &quot;Legalizing marriage for same-sex couples is not only good for the couples, but also for our economy. And while other states across our nation have legalized marriage for same-sex couples since my last report, I expect New York to still stand as a prime destination for many couples because it will stand as a welcoming beacon of diversity and acceptance.&quot; He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133009/http://www.comptroller.nyc.gov/press/2009_releases/st09-05-057.shtm">is also &quot;disappointed&quot;</a> the California Supreme Court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133009/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/26/prop_8_upheld_by_california_supreme.php">upheld Prop 8</a>.</p>
