The Daily News&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/actor-michael-mckean-laverne-shirley-struck-car-upper-west-side-manhattan-article-1.1082864">photographs at the scene show a bloodied McKean</a> on a board.  Apparently McKean has a broken leg and was taken to St. Luke&apos;s in critical condition; his condition was upgraded but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/actor_michael_mckean_suffers_broken_dEzjmVrwy6wyxnzgE8RTJO">doctors are checking</a> to see if the 66-year-old has other broken bones.<p></p>

<p>Three passengers in the vehicle that hit him were also taken to the hospital. No criminality is suspected in the 3 p.m. incident (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/heres_why_drivers_get_away_with_mur.php">no surprise</a>) but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120522/upper-west-side/spinal-tap-actor-michael-mckean-struck-by-car-on-broadway">a nearby doorman told DNAinfo</a> that cars running red lights were the norm, &quot;That&#x2019;s a horrible corner, a very dangerous corner. Believe me, this happens every week.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/actor-michael-mckean-laverne-shirley-struck-car-upper-west-side-manhattan-article-1.1082864">News&apos; photos also show</a> a knocked over mailbox and trash can, plus the shattered windshield of the car.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571106/">McKean</a> has been appearing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://thebestmanonbroadway.com/">The Best Man</a> on Broadway; his manager Harriet Sternberg said she hoped he would be okay but added, &quot;He&#x2019;s upset about missing his curtain. He&#x2019;s never missed a performance in his career.&quot;  When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150909/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/08/michael_mckean.php">we interviewed him </a>while he was in The Homecoming in 2008, he said, &quot;I seem to be working here in New York more than anywhere and it is my home town; I love the city. So we&#x2019;re looking for a place here.&quot;</p>
