But it also seems there are more idiots either making fake bombs (like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061054/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/nypd_someone_left_fake_bomb_outside.php">one outside a Bay Ridge house</a>) or calling about them. The NYPD is looking for one man who called about an alleged bomb on an N train on Thursday. </p>

<p>According to the police, a man called 911 at 3:31 p.m. on April 18 to say a bomb had been put on a N arriving at Times Square in five minutes. The call was made from a payphone at the northeast corner of West 48th Street and Seventh Avenue.<br>
 <br>
Police released this photograph of the suspect, described as a white male in his 20-30s, with blondish hair and carrying a black backpack.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061054/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">the Crime Stoppers Website</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
