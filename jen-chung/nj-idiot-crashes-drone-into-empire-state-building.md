<p>A Jersey City resident thought it would be a great idea to fly his drone in midtown Manhattan yesterday. Of course, he ended up crashing it into the 40th floor of the Empire State Building.</p>

No one was hurt... [Riddle] then entered the lobby and spoke with security, &#xAD;casually asking to retrieve the hobby craft, sources said. Security guards summoned cops, who busted Riddle on charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief.&quot;</p>

<p>Don&apos;t worry&#x2014;he Tweeted about it:</p>

<p>The NYPD and FBI both responded to the incident, but, NBC New York adds, &quot;Investigators said that they do not believe the crash was intentional.&quot; Last year, a NYC school teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302102744/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/04/fail_nyc_teacher_arrested_after_cra.php#photo-1">crashed his drone into the stadium</a> during a U.S. Open match; luckily the section was empty. </p>
