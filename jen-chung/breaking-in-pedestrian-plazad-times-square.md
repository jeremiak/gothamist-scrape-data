</div></div>					<p>With seven blocks along Broadway in Times Square and Herald Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042547/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/23/car_ban_hits_times_square_herald_sq.php">closed to vehicular traffic</a> for pedestrian promenading pleasure (oh, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042547/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/23/car_ban_hits_times_square_herald_sq.php">to ease traffic congestion too</a>) on Sunday, New Yorkers and tourists alike have been testing out the suddenly clear streets.  The Broadway pedestrian plazas are between 42nd and 47th Streets and between 33rd and 35th Streets, and in the Times Square stretch, there were lawn chairs for perambulators.</p>

<p>A Queens resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042547/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05252009/news/regionalnews/amazing_feet_on_broadway_170858.htm">was enthusiastic to the Post</a>, &quot;It&apos;ll encourage people to drive less and walk around more. It raises awareness about alternate transportation and cleaner air. I think New Yorkers can adjust to anything... It&apos;s a little chaotic right now, but a place like this, in the middle of Manhattan, will be very unique.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042547/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/nyregion/25bway.html?scp=2&amp;sq=times%20square&amp;st=cse">NY Times spied a couple who made the trip</a> all the way from Inwood&#x2014;with their 14-month-old child in tow&#x2014;to see the change&#x2014;the wife said, &quot;I like the experience because now I don&#x2019;t feel like I&#x2019;m competing with cars.&quot;</p>

<p>And a European tourist was approving,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042547/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/05/25/2009-05-25_pedestrians_enjoy_first_day_of_carfree_stretches_of_broadway_at_times_square_her.html"> telling the Daily News</a>, &quot;This is good, I must say. <strong>In Amsterdam, where I live, in the city center, you&apos;re not allowed to drive. It feels a lot safer that way.</strong>&quot; But naturally, there were detractors&#x2014;namely the drivers, such as the cabbies who complained to the News: One said, &quot;I think it&apos;s really stupid. It&apos;s going to mess up all the traffic in midtown&quot; and another worried, &quot;The [pedicab] bikers will take away our business because taxis can&apos;t pick up people in front of Macy&apos;s anymore.&quot;  </p>
