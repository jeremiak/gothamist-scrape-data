He had been involved with Top Chef host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515060343/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/30/padma_lakshmis_baby_daddy_drama_and.php">Padma Lakshmi</a>, and now it turns out that he left a trust fund to Lakshmi&apos;s two-year-old daughter Krishna.</p>

<p>Lakshmi was sued by Krishna&apos;s biological father, Adam Dell (brother of computer magnate MIchael Dell), last year, and the lawsuit claimed that Lakshmi hoped that Forstmann was actually Krishna&apos;s father (the matter was later settled).  Lakshmi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515060343/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2105916/Billionaire-Teddy-Forstmann-gives-trust-fund-lover-Padma-Lakshmis-daughter.html">reportedly let Krishna refer to Forstmann as &quot;Papa&quot;</a> and had praised Forstmann in a speech, &quot;I am lucky to have someone who unwaveringly gave me love and manly support &#x2014; and is also the person that I love. So thank you, Teddy.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515060343/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/billionaire-teddy-forstmann-left-big-trust-fund-2-year-old-daughter-padma-lakshmi-article-1.1027848">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;In the will, filed in Manhattan Surrogate&#x2019;s Court, Forstmann refers to reality cooking show queen Lakshmi as &apos;my friend.&apos; The document forgives all debts she owed him &#x201C;&apos;representing loans made by me before or after the date of this will.&apos;&quot;  </p>

<p>However, details of the trust for the toddler are not public.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515060343/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2105916/Billionaire-Teddy-Forstmann-gives-trust-fund-lover-Padma-Lakshmis-daughter.html">Daily Mail says</a>, &quot;The trust fund could run into the millions and could be used to pay for education or to just make Krishna financially secure for the rest of her life.&quot;  When Forstmann died, his wealth was estimated at $1.8 billion.</p>
