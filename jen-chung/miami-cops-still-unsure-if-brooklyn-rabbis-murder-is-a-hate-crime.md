<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014841/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/10/crown_heights_orthodox_rabbi_fatall.php">fatal shooting of a Brooklyn rabbi</a> in Miami has rocked the Jewish community in New York and Florida. While Rabbi Joseph Raksin&apos;s grieving family believes he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014841/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/10/crown_heights_orthodox_rabbi_fatall.php">targeted in a hate crime</a>, Miami police have not indicated that it was in fact a hate crime.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014841/http://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/08/11/symbols-of-hate-scrawled-on-rabbis-suv/">According to CBS Miami</a>, Major Hector Llevat, head of the homicide bureau, said a &quot;full&quot; homicide team was working on the case and begged the public for help, &quot;The more information we get the better. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you think it&#x2019;s insignificant, if you heard something, if you know somebody, any information that you have that could potentially connect the dots to bring these people to justice.&quot;</p>

Police are not sure of a motive, because he wasn&apos;t carrying any money (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014841/http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/08/09/4280988/two-men-sought-in-fatal-shooting.html">another rabbi pointed out that</a> Orthodox Jews don&apos;t carry money on Sabbath. &quot;There hasn&#x2019;t been a robbery on Sabbath for the past 35 years.&quot;)  <p></p>

<p>Llevat said, &quot;It would appear initially, early observations that it could be perhaps a robbery. This gentleman was an observant religious man and so information is that he would not have a wallet or anything of value on him at that moment... Right now, there are no indications that it was a hate crime or related to a hate crime, however, we are not closing that door and we&#x2019;re not ruling anything out.&quot;</p>

<p>A New York funeral for Raksin is being held for him today. His body <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014841/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/11/funeral-to-be-held-for-brooklyn-rabbi-killed-in-miami/">arrived back in Brooklyn this morning</a>. After a funeral in Miami, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014841/http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/08/10/4282432/hundreds-mourn-brooklyn-rabbi.html">his son-in-law said</a>, &quot;We should never forget the value of human life.&quot; Notably, a rabbi and his wife who attended the Miami funeral <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014841/http://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/08/11/symbols-of-hate-scrawled-on-rabbis-suv/">returned home to find &quot;hate symbols&quot; on their car</a>.<br>
