<p>Earlier this week, lawyers for disgraced former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/30/roger-ailes-s-lawyers-escalate-his-vicious-war-against-journalist-gabe-sherman.html">contacted the Daily Beast&apos;s Lloyd Grove</a> to smear New York Magazine&apos;s Gabriel Sherman, because Sherman had been working on a(nother) damning story about Ailes. That story has now been published: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/how-fox-news-women-took-down-roger-ailes.html?mid=nymag_press">The Revenge of Roger&#x2019;s Angels: How Fox News women took down the most powerful, and predatory, man in media</a>.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/roger_ailes_officially_forced_out_o.php">Ailes was ousted</a> from the cable news channel he founded after former Fox News personality <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/06/gretchen_carlson_roger_ailes.php">Gretchen Carlson sued him</a>, accusing him of sexually harassing her and retaliating against her complaints about the toxic atmosphere by demoting and eventually firing her. Other women stepped forward to tell their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/09/six_more_women_say_they_were_sexual.php">tales of Ailes&apos; allegedly disturbing behavior</a>, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/30/ex-fox_news_booker_roger_ailes_psyc.php">accusations of &quot;psychological torture&quot;</a> and how Fox News employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/ex_host_andrea_tantaros_sues_fox_ne.php">enabled Ailes to act this way</a>, like demanding that female TV personalities &quot;twirl&quot; for him to show off their bodies. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_09_railes.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_09_railes.jpg" width="640" height="476"> <br> <i> Roger Ailes (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Sherman details how Carlson&apos;s decision to fight back started two years ago: </p><blockquote>Taking on Ailes was dangerous, but Carlson was determined to fight back. She settled on a simple strategy: She would turn the tables on his surveillance. Beginning in 2014, according to a person familiar with the lawsuit, Carlson brought her iPhone to meetings in Ailes&#x2019;s office and secretly recorded him saying the kinds of things he&#x2019;d been saying to her all along. &#x201C;I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you&#x2019;d be good and better and I&#x2019;d be good and better. Sometimes problems are easier to solve&#x201D; that way, he said in one conversation. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure you can do sweet nothings when you want to,&#x201D; he said another time.<p></p>

<p>After more than a year of taping, she had captured numerous incidents of sexual harassment. Carlson&#x2019;s husband, sports agent Casey Close, put her in touch with his lawyer Martin Hyman, who introduced her to employment attorney Nancy Erika Smith. Smith had won a sexual-harassment settlement in 2008 for a woman who sued former New Jersey acting governor Donald DiFranceso. &#x201C;I hate bullies,&#x201D; Smith told me. &#x201C;I became a lawyer to fight bullies.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Originally Carlson&apos;s legal team was going to file a suit against in September, but when she was fired on June 23rd, &quot;the day her contract expired,&quot; Smith then &quot;raced to get the suit ready. Over the Fourth of July weekend, Smith instructed an IT technician to install software on her firm&#x2019;s network and Carlson&#x2019;s electronic devices to prevent the use of spyware by Fox. &apos;We didn&#x2019;t want to be hacked,&apos; Smith said. They filed their lawsuit on July 6th.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Fox News&apos; parent company, 21st Century Fox, started an internal investigation as well, and apparently network star Megyn Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/19/report_megyn_kelly_told_investigato.php">relayed her stories of Ailes&apos; inappropriateness</a> and also asked other Fox News colleagues to come forward. Sherman writes, &quot;Ailes was furious with Kelly for not defending him publicly. According to a Fox source, Ailes&#x2019;s wife Elizabeth wanted Fox PR to release racy photos of Kelly published years ago in GQ as a way of discrediting her. The PR department, in this instance, refused. &quot;</p>

<p>Carlson is reportedly close to an eight-figure settlement. As for Ailes, well, he&apos;s apparently working with Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/16/thelma_and_louise_style.php">on his campaign</a>/soft launch of his own (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223811/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/31/no_really_shut_up.php">dog-whistle</a>) network. </p>
