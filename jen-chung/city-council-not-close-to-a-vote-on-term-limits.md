title: City Council "Not Close to a Vote" on Term Limits
---

<p>City Council Speaker Christine Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054410/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/86825/council-speaker-puts-off-term-limit-bill/Default.aspx">just had a press conference</a> and only said that the Council has discussed the issue--she didn&apos;t have any further statement--according to NY1.  Legislation was introduced today, and it&apos;ll be &quot;referred to a committee, followed by a public hearing, and then a possible vote.&quot;  City Councilman Bill de Blasio said of Council support, &quot;I think it&apos;s very, very evenly split, literally. Some very strong &apos;no&apos; voices, some very strong &apos;yes&apos; voices, some real undecided folks. I think people were honest about the mixed feelings they&apos;re having.&quot;  We&apos;ll have more of a roundup on the latest term limits news later.</p>
