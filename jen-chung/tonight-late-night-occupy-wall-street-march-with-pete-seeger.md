<p>Tonight, Occupy Wall Street protesters are heading to the Upper West Side for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111023213755/http://occupywallst.org/article/occupy-columbus-circle/">Occupy Columbus Circle</a>! At 10:30 p.m., they are meeting outside at Broadway and 95th Street in front of Symphony Space, where legendary fold singer Pete Seeger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111023213755/http://www.symphonyspace.org/event/6814-clearwater-honors-george-wein">is performing</a> at 8 p.m., and then they&apos;ll walk to Columbus Circle.  And Seeger&apos;s grandson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111023213755/http://online.wsj.com/article/APc88b14ac3c14479d8cab3bb3f71a95fa.html">says the 92-year-old is &quot;all fired up&quot;</a> to join the movement after the benefit.</p>

<p>According to the AP, &quot;Tao Rodriguez Seeger says he plans to play &quot;Pied Piper&quot; after performing with his grandfather and other musicians Friday night. Tao Seeger says 750 people will attend the Clearwater environmental benefit at Symphony Space. He&apos;s inviting them all outside afterward to sing and walk together.&quot; Tao Seeger also says singing in NYC is good: &quot;The city&apos;s got great reverb.&quot;</p>
