										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_09_philharm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205850im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_philharm.jpg" width="230" height="161" class="image-left"> </span>Sure, the State Department cleared the NY Philharmonic to go to Cuba next month, but the donors who helped fund that trip weren&apos;t allowed, so it&apos;s all off!  The Philharmonic said, &quot;We have been told by officials at the Treasury Department that the current regulations governing travel to Cuba does not provide for this particular category of people&quot;&#x2014;rich patrons of the arts&#x2014;&quot;Without (their) support, this trip is not financially possible.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205850/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/new-york-philharmonic-trip-to-cuba-postponed/">According to Arts Beat</a>, 150 individuals had helped underwrite the trip at $10,000 a pop.  Philharmonic president Zarin Mehta pointed out, &quot;The patrons were excited about giving us the money with the opportunity of going to see Havana and be a witness and support their orchestra... I wouldn&#x2019;t want to insult them. I think it&#x2019;s most likely they would say, &apos;Go another time.&apos;&quot; The Philharmonic hopes that noisy lawmakers like Senator Schumer and Reps. Israel and Rangel will help them convince the Treasury Department to let the patrons go.  </p>

<p>Last year, the Philharmonic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205850/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/26/new_york_philha.php">made a historic trip to North Korea</a>.</p>
