title: Jersey City Manhole Rescue Operation Turns Up... Garbage
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2011_06_manholegarb.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405063920im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_manholegarb.jpg" width="300" height="211"> <br> <i>Via WABC 7</i></div> After a &quot;contracting crew using miniature cameras to examine underground pipelines&quot; spotted a large bag in a Jersey City sewage pipe this morning, they contacted the fire department and police.  The police looked at the images and believed a large hand was coming out of the bag. Now, one three-hour operation later (complete with hovering news copters), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405063920/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=8182332">WABC 7 reports</a> there was no hand and the bag was just garbage.  <p></p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405063920/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/06/10/workers-scramble-to-rescue-man-who-fell-down-jersey-city-manhole/">WCBS 2 puts it</a>, &quot;Rescue workers responded to the scene at Halliday and Forrest Streets. They set up equipment to go hunting for what they believed was a worker who fell into the manhole. They donned hazardous materials suits and entered the narrow space. All they turned up was a bag of garbage.&quot;</p>

<p>The underground pipes are full of hazardous gases, so the emergency workers who went 30 feet underground to examine the bag were wearing oxygen masks.</p>
