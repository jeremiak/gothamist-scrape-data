</div></div>					<p>Yesterday afternoon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324193407/http://gothamist.com/tags/faisalshahzad">Faisal Shahzad</a>, the Pakistani immigrant (and naturalized U.S. citizen) accused of training with the Pakistan Taliban and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324193407/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/18/times_square_bomb_suspect_shahzad_i.php">attempting to bomb Times Square</a> pleaded guilty to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324193407/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/18/times_square_bomb_suspect_shahzad_i.php">charges</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324193407/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/06/22/2010-06-22_faisal_shahzad_rage.html">saying</a>, &quot;It&apos;s a war... I&apos;m going to plead guilty a hundred times over because until the hour the U.S. pulls its forces from Iraq and Afghanistan and stops the drone strikes ... we will be attacking the U.S. And I plead guilty to that.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324193407/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/homicidal_Tg4YnOCqWIfBjw9oiSdkTN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post details Shahzad&apos;s exchange</a> with federal judge Miriam Cedarbaum: When she asked, &quot;You wanted to injure a lot of people?&quot;, Shahzad replied, &quot;Yes. Damage the building, and injure or kill them. One has to consider where I&apos;m coming from -- that is, I consider myself a &apos;Mujahid,&apos; a Muslim soldier... The US and NATO forces, along with 40 to 50 countries, attacked Muslim lands.&quot;  But when Cedarbaum asked, &quot;But the people who were walking in Times Square that night -- did you look around to see who they were?&quot;, Shahzad said, &quot;The people select the government. We consider them all the same.&quot; </p><blockquote>&quot;Including the children?&quot; Cedarbaum asked incredulously.<p></p>

<p>&quot;Well, the [US military] drone hits in Afghanistan and Iraq, they don&apos;t see children, they don&apos;t see anybody,&quot; Shahzad coolly replied. &quot;They kill women, children -- they kill everybody. It&apos;s a war, and in war, they kill people. They&apos;re killing all Muslims.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t consider it a crime,&quot; he flippantly said of his fiendish plot. &quot;I don&apos;t care for the laws of the United States.&quot;</p></blockquote><br>
A former U.S. Attorney<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324193407/http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/faisal.shahzad.domestic.2.1764139.html"> told WCBS 2</a> that Shahzad&apos;s courthouse claims, coupled with the fact that he is cooperating with the authorities, are &quot;Consistent with someone who craves attention and will get it by whatever means is handy at any particular time.&quot;  And in while he may be cooperating, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324193407/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/nyregion/22terror.html?ref=nyregion">not granting him any sentencing leniency</a>.<p></p>
