Because another juror allegedly flashed gang signs at her!<p></p>

<p>Anthony Marshall, the son of late philanthropist Brooke Astor, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065535/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/brooke_astors_son_found_guilty_of_g.php">found guilty of grand larceny</a> by swindling millions from his mother&apos;s estate while she was still alive.  During deliberations, juror Judith DeMarco, a legal analyst for Bloomberg News, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065535/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/07/astor_trial_jurors_endure_threats_c.php">asked to be dismissed from the jury</a>, fearing for her personal safety, but eventually stayed on the jury. She later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065535/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aesLgohQsZJk">told Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;I had trouble getting over my reasonable doubt and I struggled with it. I did ultimately what I felt was the right thing... As much as I wanted to find the man innocent, this was a criminal case and there were mounds and mounds of evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Now DeMarco has told the defense that she thought fellow juror Yvonne Fernandez was flashing gang signs at her&#x2014;Fernandez had said earlier she dated a member of the Latin Kings&#x2014;and, &quot;None of the jurors were willing to give either of these defendants a shot in that jury room. I held out as long as I could.&quot; She also shared dozens of e-mails the jurors sent each other: The Times describes, &quot;In the e-mail messages among the jurors, they discuss how they should all play down the confrontation between Ms. Fernandez and Ms. DeMarco&quot; when talking to the media. After the trial ended, Fernandez told the media that she had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065535/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/09/astor_jurors_say_marshalls_flaw_was.php">apologized to DeMarco</a>,&quot; but DeMarco had emailed the group, &quot;I only once said I felt threatened &#x2014; AND I DID.&quot; </p>
