										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140723/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2010/06/police_evacuating_st_george_wh.html">Staten Island Advance reports</a>, &quot;Police officers are evacuating the St. George and Whitehall ferry terminals after a bomb threat was called in, a source told the Advance.&quot; The caller allegedly said that a bomb would go off at the &quot;Staten Island Ferry Terminal at 9:30 a.m.&#x201D;  It&apos;s unclear which terminal the caller was referring to, so &quot;Both terminals on the Staten Island and Manhattan sides are currently being swept by bomb-sniffing dogs.&quot; <b>Update</b>:  The terminals reopened after the dogs found nothing suspicious. </p>
