</div></div>					<p>Tonight, Johan Santana pitched the first no-hitter in the Mets&apos; 50-year history in a 8-0 win over the Cardinals.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150443/http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=21938903&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=nym&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_21938903&amp;v=3">Watch the last out here</a>&#x2014;and check out this edited montage of the no-hitter below!</p>

<p>This was also the first no-hitter of Santana&apos;s career.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150443/http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mets/johan-santana-pitches-mets-first-no-hitter-1.3756459?cmpid=Breaking_News_newsletter">Manager Terry Collins said</a>, &quot;He&apos;s been incredible. He&apos;s been absolutely outstanding. To give us the quality outings that he&apos;s given us has been remarkable, coming off what he had to go through. I just hope the next&#x2014;what&apos;s he had, nine starts? I just hope the next 20 will be as good.&quot;</p>

<p>Santana, who had shoulder surgery last season, threw 134 pitches, walking five and striking out eight batters*. After the game, he said, &quot;We work very hard, all the things I have gone through, this is very, very special &amp; I know this means a lot to New York... Coming into this season I was just hoping to come back and stay healthy and help this team, and now I am in this situation in the greatest city for baseball.&quot; Also: &quot;I don&#x2019;t think I have ever thrown a no-hitter, even in video games. I had no sense that I would throw a no-hitter.&quot; Awww.  You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150443/http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=21940047&amp;c_id=nym&amp;partnerId=aw-6740945364188552030-1037">watch his post-game interview here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150443/http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mets/johan-santana-pitches-mets-first-no-hitter-1.3756459?cmpid=Breaking_News_newsletter">Newsday points out</a> that Santana got a &quot;little help from Mike Baxter, as well as third-base umpire Adrian Johnson. Baxter made a spectacular one-out catch on the warning track in the seventh, stumbling shoulder-first into the wall on Yadier Molina&apos;s screaming liner to leftfield&quot;&#x2014;Baxter left the game with a shoulder contusion&#x2014;*&quot;As for Johnson, he might&apos;ve given the Mets a break in the sixth inning when he blew a call on a ball hit by former Met Carlos Beltran in his first game at Citi Field since he was traded to the Giants last season.&quot;  Cranky Cards fans (or Mets haters) are already talking &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150443/https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/faux%20hitter">faux hitter</a>&quot; while Yankees fans are scoffing that it took the Mets 8,020 games to get a no-hitter.</p>

<p>Also, did you see the fan run onto the field?</p>

<p>No Tweets from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150443/http://twitter.com/#!/nygovcuomo">Governor Cuomo,</a> but his office did send a statement via e-mail: &quot;I congratulate Johan Santana and the entire Mets organization for achieving a milestone in franchise history. The no-hitter thrown tonight by Johan truly demonstrates New York-style resilience and dedication, as after overcoming injuries and setbacks, Santana has put his name among the giants in baseball history. As a Queens native, born and raised, I congratulate Johan, manager Terry Collins, and the entire franchise on this landmark achievement.&quot; <b>Update</b>: Cuomo just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150443/https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/208750989757513730">Tweeted a link to his statement</a>!  Now we need a GIF of him high-fiving Mr. Met!</p>
