<p>Some abandoned luggage from the Dominican Republic contained almost five pounds of cocaine, according to Customs and Borders Protection.  The luggage, left at JFK Airport last week, contained four suspiciously heavy sneakers.  </p>

The street value of the cocaine is over $107,000. The CBP, naturally, is trying to find the owner of the luggage.  </p>
