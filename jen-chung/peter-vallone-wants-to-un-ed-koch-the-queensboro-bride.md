title: Peter Vallone Wants To Un-Ed Koch The Queensboro Bride
---


                            
                            
                            
                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_edkochbridge.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_edkochbridge.jpg" width="640" height="425"> <br> <i> Ed Koch at the bridge&apos;s naming (NYC Mayor&apos;s Office)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Now that former mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/01/ed_koch_brash_three-term_mayor_of_n.php">Ed Koch is dead</a>, why not remove his name from the Queensboro Bridge? That&apos;s what City Councilman Peter Vallone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/throw_koch_off_bridge_vallone_Q0CRqC2Vwg6lW0PkUnXtVI">wants to do</a>!</p>

<p>To be fair, when the Bloomberg administration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/08/will_koch_bridge_catch_on_like_the.php">proposed it in late 2010</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/15/vallone_agrees_koch_bridge_is_a_bad.php">Vallone hated the idea</a> from the start, saying, &quot;Mayor Ed Koch is truly a great man and deserving of an honor like this, but renaming a landmark so closely linked to our borough&#x2019;s culture and history is not appropriate. The city would not rename the Brooklyn Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge should be treated equally.&quot; </p>

<p>Vallone voted against the measure (as did Charles Barron, who suggested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/some_more_thoughts_about_the_ed_koc.php">Rikers Island be named after Koch</a> instead, since so many young black went there due to his policies), but the City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/queensboro_bridge_could_be_koch_bri.php">voted 38-12 to rename the structure</a>. Since then, he&apos;s been deeply <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=183581645083832&amp;id=1401020077">critical of the bridge</a>. And let&apos;s face it: Does anyone really call it the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge anyway?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/throw_koch_off_bridge_vallone_Q0CRqC2Vwg6lW0PkUnXtVI">Now Vallone tells the Post</a>, &quot;Never in a million years would they think to rename the Brooklyn or Manhattan Bridges. But for some reason, it was OK to slap Queens around,&quot; vowing, &quot;I&#x2019;m not going to rest until it&#x2019;s rectified, until we get our bridge back.&quot; It&apos;s also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821014057/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/26/driver_sues_city_for_ed_koch_queens.php">dangerous bridge</a>!</p>

<p>He thinks naming the Municipal Building after Koch would be more fitting, &quot;My problem is not with Ed Koch. My problem is with taking a bridge from the people of Queens.&quot; </p>
