And there were some boo birds there!  One fan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313094737/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/107581/game-3-loss-aside--yankees-fans-rally/">told NY1,</a> &quot;Joe Girardi blew the game. He went over in the dugout and looked at the book and he took Robertson out because of something the book says. You can&apos;t manage the playoffs by the book. <strong>This loss is on Girardi&apos;s head.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, recriminations all around for Girardi: The Daily News&apos; Mike Lupica <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313094737/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2009/10/20/2009-10-20_lupica_girardi.html">writes</a> in the 11th inning, &quot;Now here came Joe Girardi to do some bad managing, at a bad time, on a day when his team could have gone up three games to none on the Angels,&quot; while the Post&apos;s Mike Vaccaro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313094737/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/joe_maneuvers_finally_crap_out_iGPL5HrQeKzf7uzJLtquhM">notes</a> Girardi&apos;s been doing this all season, &quot;Time after time, game after game, Girardi seemed hell-bent on turning the Yankees into a Little League team, making sure everyone got to play every night. It was harrowing sometimes. It was breathtaking. And it had worked: every lever Girardi pulled, every button he pushed, every switch he flicked. All of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, another fan looked on the bright side of the situation, telling NY1 he was glad he could watch the loss at the stadium, &quot;<strong>The real New York fans are here.</strong> You know the real New York fans are here, so this is outstanding. I really dig it man.&quot;</p>
