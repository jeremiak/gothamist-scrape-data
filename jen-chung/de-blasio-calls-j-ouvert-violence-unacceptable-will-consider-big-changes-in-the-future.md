										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/05/two_fatally_shot_during_jouvert_fes.php#photo-1">two killings during the J&apos;Ouvert celebration</a> in Brooklyn this morning prompted Mayor  Bill de Blasio to say there&apos;s &quot;more&quot; that needs to be done with making the pre-West Indian American Day Parade event safe. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/https://twitter.com/erinmdurkin/status/772810709726031875">told reporters this morning</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/https://twitter.com/erinmdurkin/status/772810859806658560">before the parade</a>, &quot;Our hearts are heavy today...Last night there was violence that is fundamentally unacceptable... We&apos;re fundamentally angry and focused on those who undermine the safety of the many.&quot;</p>

<p>In one incident at Empire Boulevard and Flatbush Avenue around 4 a.m., a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/05/two_fatally_shot_during_jouvert_fes.php#photo-1">17-year-old boy named Tyreke Borel died</a> from a gunshot wound to the chest; two other women, ages 68 and 72, were also injured. And at 4:14 a.m., in front of 44 Empire Boulevard, 22-year-old Tiarah Poyau was fatally shot in the face. Another woman, 23, was stabbed in the back at Ocean Avenue and Eastern Parkway, while a man was shot in the leg at Clarkson and Rogers Avenues.</p>

<p>The NYPD had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/26/nypd_will_double_number_of_cops_lig.php">doubled the number of police officers</a> and also increased other elements to promote safety, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/31/jouvert_2016_preparations.php">200 light towers</a> (there were only 40 last year). </p>

<p>This morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/people-shot-ouvert-parade-brooklyn-article-1.2778145">Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said</a>. &quot;We always...plan for the worst and hope for the best.  Unfortunately despite those high hopes and all the work that went into the event, last night...we had unfortunate tragedy once again affect this event. That will not deter us.&quot;</p>

<p>De Blasio said that he&apos;d consider various ways to make J&apos;Ouvert safer:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;All options are on the table,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/https://twitter.com/BilldeBlasio">@BilldeBlasio</a> says of possibility of screening people before letting them into Jouvert</p>&#x2014; Erin Durkin (@erinmdurkin) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/https://twitter.com/erinmdurkin/status/772816851688620032">September 5, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016015018js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>As for whether the popular gathering should be cancelled, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/http://nypost.com/2016/09/05/de-blasio-says-jouvert-could-be-cancelled-after-night-of-violence/">de Blasio said</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m not going to go into detail until we do a full review.&quot;</p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose aide Carey Gabay was killing during J&apos;Ouvert last year, said, &quot;The violence last night, we need to get the message. NYPD doubled the number of police they had on duty, I don&#x2019;t know what else they could&#x2019;ve done, and I think the lesson is it&#x2019;s not just about more police. It&#x2019;s going to take all of us working together to make a difference. It&#x2019;s going to take the leaders of the community. It&#x2019;s going to take the organizers of the parade. It&#x2019;s going to take the participants of the parade. It&#x2019;s going to take the neighbors and the residents to say &apos;Enough is enough.&apos; We have to stop the violence, stop the shooting, stop the killing, and we have to do something about the insanity of illegal guns in this country.&quot;</p>

<p>Last week, NY1 political anchor Errol Louis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015018/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/errol-louis-ouvert-safe-article-1.2770506">wrote in the Daily News</a>, &quot;My great worry about the upcoming J&#x2019;Ouvert middle-of-the-night celebration is that thousands of New Yorkers will once again be needlessly exposed to proven, preventable danger in the streets. For a variety of reasons &#x2014; including sheer political cowardice &#x2014; too few elected leaders seem willing to challenge or rethink the wisdom of holding an event at 4 a.m. in parts of Brooklyn where gang activity and gunplay are not under control.&quot;</p>

<p>He called last year&apos;s violence &quot;the predictable consequence of inviting hundreds of thousands of people to drink and carouse in the streets with no clear limits placed on behavior. J&#x2019;Ouvert, in practice, gives criminals a chance to roam the streets and settle scores, using the darkness, drinking, crowds and costumed revelry as cover.&quot;</p>

<p>Louis has been very upset and frustrated this morning:</p>
