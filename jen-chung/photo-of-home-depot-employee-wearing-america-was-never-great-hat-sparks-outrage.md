<p>A Staten Island Home Depot employee has been targeted with death threats after a photograph of her wearing an &quot;America Was Never Great&quot; hat circulated on social media. But Krystal Lake says her anti-Trump hat has a point, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135814/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/home_depot-workers_america_was_never_great_hat.html#incart_big-photo">explaining to the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;The point of the hat was to say America needs changing and improvement. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a positive message to say, &apos;Let&apos;s look to the past.&apos;&quot; Preach!</p>

<p>Apparently the photograph was taken on Sunday, and by Wednesday, Lake&apos;s friends and coworkers asked her if she&apos;d seen the social media reaction. &quot;Everyone kept asking me if I was on Facebook or Twitter, which I hadn&apos;t been,&quot; she said to the Advance, &quot;and then I saw how many people were sharing [the picture] and that it was going viral. I was honestly shocked -- I didn&apos;t expect any of this to happen.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135814/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/home_depot-workers_america_was_never_great_hat.html#incart_big-photo">According to Lake</a>, she only wore the hat on Sunday, and while Home Depot says that employees are not allowed to wear items showing political support, she told the Advance, &quot;For the past two months, there have been a few people I work with wearing &apos;Vote for Trump&apos; pins on their uniforms... But no one ever says anything to them.&quot;</p>

<p>Lake, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135814/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/5_things_to_know_about_home_de.html#incart_big-photo">senior at College of Staten Island</a>, majoring in Media Studies, revealed she received dozens of death threats so far, &quot;I feel it offended a lot of people because a lot of Trump supporters live in Staten Island. Trump is very rash and in your face, but when someone else has a message against him, his supporters can&apos;t take the criticisms.&quot;</p>

<p>Naturally, these outraged Americans are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135814/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/outraged_customers_ambush_home.html#incart_river_home#incart_big-photo">freaking out on Home Depot&apos;s Facebook page</a>, demanding that Lake be fired and claiming they&apos;ll start shopping at Lowe&apos;s. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135814/https://www.facebook.com/homedepot/photos/a.246836160030.181674.106485550030/10154865675285031/?type=3&amp;theater">For instance</a>, &quot;I was just about to go to Home Depot to purchase a lawn mower and new washer and dryer for the home my wife and I just moved into. I just happened to pull out my phone and saw a post from someone. When I looked at their profile, I saw the attached image. Needless to say, I will not be buying the items from Home Depot now. I fully support people&apos;s right to free speech, but there are guidelines employees should be required to follow to present a friendly, helpful image to customers. If this is what you allow your employees to do, you should not be in business in America.&quot;</p>

<p>She added, &quot;People have been saying really racist things to me and that they&apos;re going to come and find me,&quot; she said, &quot;and that what I said is disgraceful and I hate America&#x2014;but I don&apos;t hate America. I know there are a lot of opportunities here. I just wish we would worry about making America <em>better</em>&#x2014; not &apos;great again.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Lake, who supports Bernie Sanders, plans to wear the hat again.</p>
