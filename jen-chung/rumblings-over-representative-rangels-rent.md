<p>The NY Times&apos; revelation that Representative Charles Rangel has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163103/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/11/rangel_says_his_rent_is_fine_and_bl.php">four rent-stabilized apartments</a> put the Congressman on the defensive yesterday. Rangel held an unusual sidewalk press conference, where he got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163103/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/11/rangel_says_his_rent_is_fine_and_bl.php">testy with the NY Times reporters</a> when not insisting his apartment situation was not so strange or a special favor--&quot;Paying the legal rent is not a gift&quot;--from his building&apos;s owner, the Olnick Organization which has in other cases <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163103/http://breakingnews.nydailynews.com/dynamic/stories/N/NY_RANGEL_RENT_BAOL-?SITE=NYNYD&amp;SECTION=TOP_STORIES&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">kicked out rent-stabilized residents</a> in favor of charging market rate rents.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163103/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/07/11/2008-07-11_im_not_getting_rent_deal_rep_charles_ran-1.html">He said</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t see anything unfair about it, and I didn&apos;t even know it was a deal.&quot;</p>

<p>Rangel explained that two of the units were already combined when he first got them and that about 10 years ago, the apartment next door became available and the Rangels took it over. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163103/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/nyregion/12rangel.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=nyregion">Per  the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I got that apartment and I used that as my den and my office,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;When I came in late at night from Washington I&#x2019;d go in there first. It&#x2019;s a studio apartment. It has its own kitchen and bathroom and no bedroom.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>He added: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not apologizing to anyone for that.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>
