He was shot twice in the face and once in the shoulder and taken to Bellevue Hospital.&quot;  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210508/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/09/15/2009-09-15_hardhat_shot_three_times_in_bklyn_deli.html">Daily News has more details</a>:  In spite of being shot, construction worker Brian Delamore, who has been working at a hotel site on Franklin Avenue, &quot;managed to stagger out of the Flushing Deli in Clinton Hill before collapsing on the sidewalk, police and witnesses said.&quot;  A deli worker said of the shooter, &quot;<strong>There was no argument. The guy just came up to him</strong>.&quot;  Delamore is still at Bellevue; it&apos;s unclear whether there is a motive. The incident occurred in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210508/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_079.shtml">79th Precinct</a> (which says it represents the Bed-Stuy section).</p>
