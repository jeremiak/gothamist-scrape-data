<p>This sure puts the &quot;d&apos;oh!&quot; in guido, amirite? The reality star Michael Sorrentino&#x2014;better known as &quot;The Situation&quot; from <em>Jersey Shore</em>&#x2014;and his brother-slash-manager Marc Sorrentino are accused of filing false tax returns from 2010 through 2012. Basically, they didn&apos;t pay the correct taxes on $8.9 million of income from promotions and appearances, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office says.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said, &quot;The brothers allegedly also claimed costly clothes and cars as business expenses and funneled company money into personal accounts. The law is absolutely clear: telling the truth to the IRS is not optional.&quot; In other words, GTL isn&apos;t tax-free.</p>

<p>From the press release:</p><blockquote>As part of the conspiracy, the brothers submitted or caused to be submitted to the IRS false documents which understated the gross receipts received by the brothers and the two companies. The brothers also submitted false personal tax returns which failed to report all of the income they received, and Michael failed to file a personal tax return in 2011, despite earning $1,995,757 that year.  <p></p>

<p>As part of the conspiracy, the brothers also fraudulently claimed millions of dollars in personal expenses as business expenses, including payments for high-end vehicles and clothing, personal grooming expenses, and distributions - or direct payments - from the businesses to personal bank accounts. </p></blockquote>Jonathan D. Larsen, Acting Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, said, &quot;Most individuals file truthful tax returns and pay their fair share of taxes. However, as alleged in today&apos;s indictment, rather than living in reality and reporting their true income, Michael Sorrentino and his brother Marc created the illusion that they earned less income by filing false and fraudulent tax returns. No matter what your occupation or status in life, if you attempt to cheat on your taxes for personal financial gain, you face real consequences including criminal prosecution and a possible prison sentence.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The brothers were each charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States; Marc Sorrentino was hit with three counts of filling false tax returns while The Situation himself was with two counts. Both face up to three years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The Situation faces a year and a $100,000 for not filing a personal tax return.</p>
