					<p>St. Patrick&apos;s Day is in two weeks, but the celebration really kicks off this weekend with a parade on Staten Island, and two in Queens!</p>

<p>The first parade is the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703020153/http://queenscountyparade.org/">Queens County St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade</a> in the Rockaways on Saturday, March 3rd. The parade starts at 1 p.m. and ends at 5 p.m., and even though a lot of major public officials attend (last year, Mayor de Blasio and Public Advocate James were there), it still has a small town feel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703020153/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/06/photos_rockaways_st_patricks_day.php">thanks to the many lawn parties along the way</a>. Here are the street closures:</p>

<p><strong>Formation:</strong><br>
- Newport Avenue between Beach 130th Street and Beach 129th Street<br>

<span class="photo_caption">Mayor de Blasio at last year&apos;s Rockaway parade. (Scott Lynch/Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>On Sunday, there are two parades: First it&apos;s the Richmond County St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade on Staten Island at noon. Mayor de Blasio won&apos;t be attending, but that&apos;s nothing new&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703020153/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/de_blasio_skipping_staten_isla.html">Staten Island Advance reports</a>, &quot;This will be the fourth year in a row de Blasio hasn&apos;t attended the Staten Island St. Patrick&apos;s Parade. The last three times, the mayor boycotted the parade for not being inclusive. The mayor&apos;s office wouldn&apos;t say if de Blasio would have chosen to boycott the event again if he didn&apos;t have &apos;scheduling conflicts.&apos;&quot; Here are details on where the Richmond County parade will be:</p>

<p><strong>Formation:</strong><br>
- Hart Boulevard between Forest Avenue and Revere Street </p>

<p><strong>Route:</strong><br>

<span class="photo_caption">(Scott Lynch/Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>Speaking of inclusiveness, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703020153/http://www.stpatsforall.com/">St. Patrick&apos;s Day for All</a> parade in Queens, which prides itself for being welcome to all to &quot;celebrate Irish heritage and culture regardless of race, gender, creed or sexual orientation,&quot; is at 1 p.m. on Sunday.</p>
