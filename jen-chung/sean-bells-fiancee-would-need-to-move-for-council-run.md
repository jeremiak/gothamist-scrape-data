At White&apos;s funeral, Nicole Paultre Bell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054919/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/09/03/2010-09-03_bell_fianceacutee_move_could_shake_up_qns_council_race.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;One thing that Tom White did tell me sitting in his office is the only way you can make change is getting involved, so I&apos;ll keep that in mind.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The News notes that while as many as a dozen people might be vying for the seat, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054919/http://gothamist.com/tags/nicolepaultrebell">Bell</a> &quot;brings name recognition and a heart-stopping personal story.&quot; However, &quot;She lives outside the district in Far Rockaway, and is still registered to vote at her mother&apos;s house in Suffolk County. Under state election law, however, Bell would have to move into the district by Election Day - and get 899 signatures from registered voters on her nominating petitions.&quot;  </p>

<p>In July, the city agreed to pay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054919/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/29/sean_bells_family_friends_discuss_p.php">Sean Bell&apos;s family $3.25 million to settle</a> the wrongful death suit. The money goes to his and Nicole Paultre Bell&apos;s two daughters.</p>
