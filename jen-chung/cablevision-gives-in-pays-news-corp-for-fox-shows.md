										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_10_fireed.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214454im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_10_fireed.jpg" width="240" height="171" class="image-left"> </span>Last night, over three million Cablevision customers were able to watch Fox programming once again&#x2014;right before Game 3 of the World Series&#x2014;after Cablevision ended its dispute with News Corp. over transmission fees.  According to Cablevision, it conceded because News Corp. is really mean and greedy and the FCC didn&apos;t do anything!  Well, at least folks will be able to see today&apos;s Jets-Packers games on WNYW Fox 5, right?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214454/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/fox-returns-to-cablevision/">terms of the deal weren&apos;t disclosed</a>, but Cablevision previously said that News Corp. was demanding $150 million for Fox programming, up from $70 million and <em>much</em> more than other channels.  (News Corp. yanked its programming from Cablevision <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214454/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/16/news_corp_yanks_channels_5_9_from_c.php">starting on October 16</a>.) A statement from Cablevision read:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;In the absence of any meaningful action from the FCC, Cablevision has agreed to pay Fox an unfair price for multiple channels of its programming including many in which our customers have little or no interest.  Cablevision conceded because it does not think its customers should any longer be denied the Fox programs they wish to see.<br>
 <br>
Cablevision thanks its customers for understanding the reasons for the dispute and for staying with us.  We are also grateful to the 175 government leaders who raised their voices to urge government intervention and binding arbitration to prevent this blackout.  It is clear the retransmission consent system is badly broken and needs to be fixed.<br>
 <br>
In the end, our customers will pay more than they should for Fox programming, but less than they would have if we had accepted the unprecedented rates News Corp. was demanding when they pulled their channels off Cablevision.&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
The channels returning to Cablevision are Fox 5 (WNYW), Fox 29 (WTXF), My9, Fox Business Network, National Geographic Wild and Fox Deportes. </blockquote><p></p>
