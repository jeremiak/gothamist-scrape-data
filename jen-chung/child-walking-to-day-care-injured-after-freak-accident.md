<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406190930/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2010/03/23/2010-03-23_prayers__tears_for_bx_boy_hit_by_pole.html">According to the Daily News</a>, which calls it a &quot;freak accident,&quot; the livery cab driver blamed his crash on a city DEP truck: &quot;He said the city truck, which was heading north on Broadway, made a left turn onto W. 230th St. and cut him off, forcing him to swerve out of the way.&quot; The livery cab driver said, &quot;He was not supposed to turn left. He was supposed to wait for me - I was going straight,&quot; adding, &quot;The sign hit the child. Not my car.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, the DEP truck driver said the cabbie &quot;had enough time to stop.&quot;  Both men stayed at the scene and neither driver was charged. But residents tell NY1 it&apos;s a dangerous intersection, &quot;I almost got hit myself many times, many times,&quot; and &quot;These people they don&apos;t care. They don&apos;t read. They don&apos;t look. They just want to drive through.&quot;  Joshua is in critical condition at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia while his mother suffered cuts and bruises.</p>
