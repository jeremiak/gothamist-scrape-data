<p>Donald Trump&apos;s disgusting behavior towards women has ranged from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/mr_misogyny.php">fat-shaming</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/14/donald_trump_is_a_disgusting_sexist.php">allegations of sexual harassment</a>, and, as we heard in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">infamous &quot;hot mic&quot; audio </a>from a 2005 Access Hollywood segment, even sexual assault: &quot;You know I&#x2019;m automatically attracted to beautiful&#x2014;I just start kissing them. It&#x2019;s like a magnet... And when you&apos;re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything. Grab &apos;em by the pussy.&quot; Unsurprisingly, allegations are flying about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://laist.com/2016/10/10/trump_go_fund_me.php">much more dirty laundry</a> yet to be aired, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/785237042611511296">reporters chasing down</a> possibly damaging evidence and looking for other victims. </p>

<p>Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer who takes on high-profile targets, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://www.phillyvoice.com/allred-v-cosby-clash-philly-titans/">Bill Cosby</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/fashion/20ALLRED.html">Roman Polanski</a> and, yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/12/when-trump-confronted-a-transgender-beauty/">Trump</a>, confirmed to us that since the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape&apos;s release, she has been  &quot;contacted by women who allege inappropriate contact by Mr. Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>More to the point, Allred discussed how Trump&apos;s words suggest criminal behavior. &quot;If there is an unwanted or unconsented to touching of a person&#x2019;s intimate parts such as the genital areas or a woman&#x2019;s breasts, that could constitute a sexual assault or a sexual battery,&quot; she explained yesterday. She added that &quot;when Rudy Giuliani was asked&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/09/someones_doing_the_rape_defending.php">on Sunday&apos;s political programs</a> &quot;if Donald Trump was describing a sexual assault  on the recently released 2005 video, he responded, &apos;That&#x2019;s what he was talking about.&apos;&quot; Allred said, &quot;I am disgusted by what Donald Trump said and admitted that he had done on that video. An apology is not enough.&quot; </p>

<p>The <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape was discovered after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/pervy_trump_sexist_pig.php">AP&apos;s report</a> featuring former crew members on Trump&apos;s reality show, <em>The Apprentice</em>, describing his demeaning behavior towards women; in one example, he allegedly judges female contestants&apos; breast sizes and discusses which women he&apos;d want to have sex with. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://www.gloriaallred.com/Gloria-s-Videos-and-Statements/#Expando182">Allred released a statement</a> last week, citing the numerous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/09/trumps-lawsuits-include-20-involving-allegations-mistreating-women-president-republican/91832012/">sexual harassment lawsuits</a> and his lecherous behavior: &quot;If Mr. Trump were to be elected president he would be the employer of the largest workforce in the country, federal government employees. Mr. Trump in that role would be sending a message through his past words and actions that sexual harassment of women in the workplace is acceptable and this could lead to other employers believing that they can follow Mr. Trump&#x2019;s lead and openly sexually harass their female employees, thereby creating and condoning a hostile workplace for working women.&quot;</p><blockquote>We need a President who respects the rights of women in the workplace not someone who creates a hostile and sexist environment for women who work and not someone like Mr. Trump who believes pregnancy is an inconvenience for employers; and who enables sexism.<p></p>

<p>I call on Donald Trump to release all of his employees and former employees from their non-disclosure clauses so that they can tell the public what they suffered when they had the unfortunate experience of working for Donald Trump, and I urge him to promise not to retaliate against them if they tell the truth.</p>

<p>Donald Trump once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/03/donald-trump-no-apology-transgender-miss-universe/">made a remark to TMZ </a>about me. He said &quot;Gloria would be very very impressed&quot; which TMZ suggested in the context of the interview with him meant that I would be impressed with his penis.</p>

<p>No Donald, I wouldn&#x2019;t. What would impress me would be having Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White House, not a man who blatantly denigrates women in the workplace.</p></blockquote>Allred, a Clinton supporter, was a delegate at the Democratic National Convention. She successfully fought Trump and the Miss Universe pageant to allow transgender contestant Jenna Talackova to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/19/showbiz/canada-miss-universe-transgender/">compete in the Miss Universe Canada event.</a> During the DNC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011102/http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/gloria-allred-democratic-convention-1201822058/">Allred told Variety,</a> &quot;I know the only way to beat Trump is to confront him, head on and to refuse to let him get away with his bullying behavior. I think people want someone to stand up and confront him. I think a strong approach with Trump is warranted and that Hillary is more than capable of fighting back and winning this battle.&quot;<p></p>
