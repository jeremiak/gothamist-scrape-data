<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140725003458/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/sneak_peek_at_kara_walkers_domino_i.php#photo-1">massive Kara Walker installation</a>, &quot;A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby,&quot; inside the Domino Sugar Factory is a stunning sight. Sculpted from tons of sugar covering polystyrene, a 75.5-feet long, 35.5 feet high, and 26 feet wide sphinx-like figure is at the center of the 30,000-square foot space, with fifteen 5-foot-tall sugar sculptures of young boys around her. </p>

<p>While you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140725003458/http://creativetime.org/projects/karawalker/">can admire the melting sculptures in person through July 6</a>, now you can see the process that went into creating them, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140725003458/http://www.art21.org/videos/short-kara-walker-a-subtlety-or-the-marvelous-sugar-baby">thanks to this exclusive video from Art21</a>. </p>

<p>The video shows how Walker and her team constructed the pieces, as well as a jovial Walker revealing that &quot;it&apos;s the most fun I&apos;ve had making art since kindergarten.&quot; </p>
