---

	
										<p>After an annoying 2, 3 train signal issue at West 72nd Street on Tuesday (it&apos;s not so fun being stuck between 42nd and 72nd Street on a 2 train for 25 minutes!), folks who take the 2,3 uptown should know this: NYCT Subway Scoop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160740/http://twitter.com/nyctsubwayscoop">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Due to NYPD investigation of a customer injury @ 110th St, 3 suspended; downtown 2 via 5 Mott Ave (149th St) to Nevins St (BK),&quot; followed by &quot;Due to NYPD investigation @ 110th St, Uptown 2 &amp; 3 terminating 2 Times Sq &amp; 96th St. Expect delays,&quot; and now &quot;Update: injured customer @ 110th St removed by EMS/NYPD, regular 2 &amp; 3 service restored w/residual delays.&quot;</p>
