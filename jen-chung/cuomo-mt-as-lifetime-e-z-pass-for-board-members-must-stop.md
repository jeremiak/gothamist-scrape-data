His office&apos;s letter to the MTA was even titled, &quot;Illegal Compensation of Board Members.&quot;</p>

<p>Revelations about the MTA&apos;s generous E-ZPass policy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729084224/http://wcbstv.com/local/mta.ez.pass.2.569988.html">started last year</a>, and among the beneficiaries were, according to WCBS 2, &quot;nearly 1,000 retired bridge and tunnel workers,&quot; 52 former board members and 34 current board members.  And the board members can have as many of the special orange E-ZPass tags they want--former chairman and wealthy real estate developer Peter Kalikow (pictured) has eight, because of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729084224/http://www.tomyang.net/cars/ferrari.html?http://www.tomyang.net/cars/ferrari203.htm">extensive car collection</a>.</p>

<p>While the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729084224/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/05/27/2008-05-27_kalikow__mta_cronies_get_passes_for_life.html">told the Daily News</a> yesterday the policy was a thank you, since many board members serve without compensation, the Straphangers Campaign&apos;s Gene Russianoff said, &quot;If participation on the MTA board is uncompensated and motivated by public service, then it should be uncompensated.&quot; </p>

<p>Other perks board members get: Travel passes on the LIRR, Metro-North, and NYC Transit as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729084224/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/08/beatle_babes_mt.php">parking permits</a>.</p>
