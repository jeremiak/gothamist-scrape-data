</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, Mayor Bloomberg officiated the wedding of two of his staffers&#x2014;his chief policy adviser, John Feinblatt, and Jonathan Mintz, the city&#x2019;s commissioner for consumer affairs&#x2014;at Gracie Mansion. It was only his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020071307/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/08/mayor_bloomberg_will_officiate_one.php">third wedding ever</a> (past weddings: Rudy Giuliani&apos;s marriage to Judith Nathan and his daughter Emma&apos;s marriage to Chris Frissora), which he referred to during the ceremony and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020071307/http://www.politickerny.com/2011/07/24/bloomberg-officiates-first-same-sex-marriage-by-a-nyc-mayor/">asked Feinblatt&apos;s and Mintz&apos;s two young daughters for help</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m going to do my best - but if I slip up, Maeve and Georgia, feel free to step in and tell me what I&#x2019;m doing wrong.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Bloomberg said, &quot;John, Jonathan, usually when the three of us are together, we are discussing the finer points of illegal guns or consumer fraud. I can&#x2019;t tell you how nice this is for a change. And I can&#x2019;t tell you how pleased I am that this day has finally come.&quot;  He also joked that the two men better not be partying late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020071307/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mike_does_the_honors_for_aides_KwDI4vjBFYdtkf45f3LNHN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">because they had work today</a>. You can read Bloomberg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020071307/http://www.politickerny.com/2011/07/24/bloomberg-officiates-first-same-sex-marriage-by-a-nyc-mayor/">entire wedding remarks here</a> (and you might want some tissues handy!).  <br>
  <br>
Mintz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020071307/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/25/2011-07-25_mayor_michael_bloomberg_officiates_at_samesex_wedding_of_two_of_his_top_aides.html">said</a>, &quot;This is a great day for New York. This is a great day for love. I know it sounds a little bit trite, but you&apos;ll have to forgive me I just got married a minute and a half ago.&quot;  </p>
