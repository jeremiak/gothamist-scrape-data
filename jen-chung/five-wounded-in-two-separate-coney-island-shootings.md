<p>Police are investigating multiple shootings that took place within hours of each other in the same neighborhood yesterday: First, a bystander <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131642/http://nypost.com/2016/06/05/bystander-shot-in-the-back-in-coney-island/">was hit by a stray bullet</a> on W. 16th Street in Coney Island around 4:30 a.m. Then, around 2:40 p.m., four men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131642/http://abc7ny.com/news/violent-sunday-police-determining-whether-2-coney-island-shootings-connected-/1372496/">were injured when gunfire broke out</a> on Mermaid Avenue and W. 16th Street. </p>

<p>The Post reports that the first incident unfolded when &quot;[a] man and a woman were arguing on a residential block of West 16th Street when one of them pulled out a pistol... The person who pulled the gun fired one round, hitting a 38-year-old man in the back, the sources said.&quot; The victim, who was apparently walking from a friend&apos;s house, is expected to survive.</p>

<p>In the afternoon shooting, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131642/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/shot-coney-island-street-corner-ten-hours-article-1.2662262">witnesses told the Daily News</a> that &quot;it appeared the suspects pulled up in a car, got out and opened fire,&quot; with one saying, &quot;It was mayhem... They were young guys, in their 20s. One of the guys was running from Mermaid to Neptune (Ave.) yelling, &#x2018;I got hit! I got hit!&#x2019; He lifted his shirt and was bleeding from the stomach.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131642/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/05/nypd-4-people-shot-in-coney-island/?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fcolumn%2Fny-today-daily-briefings&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click">13 shots were fired</a>. Two men, a 26-year-old who was shot in the shoulder and a 31-year-old who was shot in the hand, were taken to Lutheran Medical Center, while two 21-year-old men, one shot in the thigh and the other shot in the hand, went to Coney Island Hospital on their own. </p>

The shooting took place around 2:40 Sunday. Half a block down, there is a second crime scene. Under a car, police recovered a handgun.&quot;</p>

<p>An alarmed resident told WABC 7, &quot;I saw maybe like five &apos;boom boom boom boom&apos; - I&apos;m thinking about &apos;let&apos;s get out of here - run&apos;. Me and my son ran to the living room and closed all the windows. We just ran - my son and I just ran to the living room, we just hid. They&apos;re running all over here, you know.&quot;</p>
