<p>After NJ Governor Chris Christie&apos;s announcement that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171444/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/chris_christie_got_secret_stomach_s.php">underwent lap band surgery</a> to help him lose weight, one notable Democrat has stepped up to offer his help: The Reverend Al Sharpton.</p>

<p>Sharpton has lost over 120 pounds through diet and exercise. In 2005, the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171444/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/08/nyregion/08ink.html">profiled his weight loss effort</a>, which included a trainer (&quot;For the longest time, the only part of the Rev. Al Sharpton&apos;s body that got any exercise was his mouth&quot;). Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171444/http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_rezd44kz/">TMZ caught up with Sharpton</a>, who said he&apos;d be Christie&apos;s &quot;maintenance man.&quot; </p>

<p>Sharpton is a vegetarian, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171444/http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2011/12/22/Al-Sharpton-Does-a-Bill-Clinton.aspx">explained to PETA in 2011</a>, &quot;I overhauled my diet after a 40-day hunger strike when I was in jail for the Vieques [military bombing practice] protest. I dabbled with weight loss ideas, wanting to keep off the pounds I lost. First, I gave up red meat, then chicken. I ran into Bill Clinton, who told me how he has more energy, needs less sleep, and can think more clearly since going vegan, and I can tell you the same thing happened to me. I also kept in mind the words of another vegetarian friend&#x2014;Coretta Scott King&#x2014;who always spoke of the ethical reasons to give up meat.&quot;</p>
