The e-mail explains there are three things that need to be done: Get concessions from drivers, cut non-union staff via buyouts and get concessions from the mailers&apos; union.  As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113707/http://www.nj.com/business/ledger/index.ssf?/base/business-10/1221625564297340.xml&amp;coll=1">Star-Ledger itself reports</a>, while the paper&apos;s dire situation was known, &quot;yesterday was the first time a Jan. 5 closure date has been mentioned.&quot;  The president of S-L&apos;s parent company Donald Newhouse said, &quot;We strongly believe that if we can achieve the three objectives we set for ourselves ... then we will be able to produce a viable newspaper.&quot;</p>
