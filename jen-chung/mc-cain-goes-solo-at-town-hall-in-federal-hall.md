<p>While plans for a joint John McCain-Barack Obama town hall forum at Federal Hall in lower Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051837/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/08/bloomberg_abc_n.php">fell through</a>, McCain still appeared and took advantage of being the only presidential candidate there, saying, &quot;It would have been a little more interesting tonight if Senator Obama had accepted my request.&quot;</p>

<p>Obama&apos;s excuse was that the town hall happened too soon after Obama clinched the nomination, and about 200 people gathered for the just-McCain not-open-to-the-public event.  Though the event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051837/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/06/12/mccains-night-on-the-town-hall/?mod=googlenews_wsj">was billed as bipartisan</a>, it turns out that tickets were distributed by &quot;supporters, &apos;independent groups,&apos; and Mayor Bloomberg&quot; though it&apos;s unclear how that broke down. McCain, who does well with town halls (he&apos;s had over 100!) appeared to have a pretty easy time, discussing a variety of topics and even getting a chance to respond to one question with, &quot;I don&apos;t consider myself a hero.&quot;  </p>

<p>At one point, McCain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051837/http://www.nysun.com/national/mccain-on-wall-street-angry-about-oil/79981/">spoke out against the oil industry</a>, &quot;I am very angry, frankly, at the oil companies not only because of the obscene profits they&apos;ve made but at their failure to invest in alternate energy to help us eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.&quot;  At another, he said that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051837/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06132008/news/nationalnews/mac_says_dems_up_to_old_tricks_115308.htm">Democrats were being ageist</a> and used his appearance on Saturday Night Live as some youth street cred--on the show, &quot;I said the primary qualification to be president of the United States is to be very, very, very old.&quot;</p>

<p>McCain has asked Obama to appear at 10 town hall appearances during the summer.  The AP has some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051837/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gXCJ5_8sT62W945_nP15sEkGmiwgD918S7G00">pros and con of town halls for both candidates</a>.</p>
