<p>Dear readers,</p>

<p>We have some big and exciting news: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630103328/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neighborhood-news-and-information-leader-dnainfo-to-acquire-gothamist-and-its-network-of-five-city-sites-300420062.html">Gothamist LLC has been acquired by DNAinfo</a>!  We&apos;re going to work together to bring readers neighborhood and city-wide news in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.&#x2014;and more cities in the future.</p>

<p>When we founded Gothamist 14 years ago, we had no idea that we&apos;d be able to turn our fun hobby into a business. We&apos;ve been doing this on our own, independently and without outside investment, but lately we&apos;ve been thinking about how to take our growth to the next level. DNAinfo offers us that opportunity.</p>

<p>While our politics and backgrounds may differ a bit from those of DNAinfo founder Joe Ricketts (he, for example, is a Cubs fan, while Mr. Met is our favorite baseball figure), we are all committed to building a news organization that offers quality journalism to our readers. We all believe that unbiased reporting is important for our democracy, especially in these times. And we all think that the best way to cover contentious issues is to offer opinions from both sides.</p>

<p>What this means for all Gothamist LLC sites: they will continue doing what they do best&#x2014;providing excellent coverage of city-wide events, food and arts. </p>

<p>What this means for Gothamist and Chicagoist: Gothamist will become the official blog for DNAinfo New York and Chicagoist will be the official blog for DNAinfo Chicago. We&apos;re going to maintain our URLs and will tap into DNAinfo&apos;s rich reporting and integrate their stories into our sites. This is the plan for now, and the approach may evolve as we figure out how to best serve our audience. </p>

<p>What this means for DCist, LAist and SFist: DNAinfo has been interested in expanding more cities, and these sites are the perfect way to help launch that next phase.</p>

<p>We have appreciated all your support over the years and look forward to continuing to deliver you even more great work. </p>

Founders, Gothamist LLC</p>
