<p>The former police officer whose plans to kidnap, torture, kill and then eat women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022141752/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/01/raw_deal_cannibal_cop_conviction_ov.php">were deemed &quot;fantasy role-play&quot; by a judge</a> walked out of court a free man today. Gilberto Valle is out on $100,000 bond and will have to live with his mother. </p>

<p>Valle&apos;s conviction of kidnapping conspiracy was overturned by federal judge Paul G. Gardephe. (His misdemeanor conviction was upheld, but given that Valle&apos;s already served a year in prison, he was freed.) Gardephe felt there wasn&apos;t enough evidence for the conspiracy conviction, and his defense lawyer praised the decision; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022141752/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/conviction-cannibal-nypd-overturned-article-1.1850334">Julia Gatto said</a>, &#x201C;The judge&#x2019;s well-reasoned decision validates what we have said since the beginning: there was no crime. Gil Valle is innocent of any conspiracy. Gil is guilty of nothing more than having unconventional thoughts. But we don&#x2019;t convict people, take away their liberty and imprison them for their thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p>Gatto added, &quot;He has served his time and then some&#x200B;. He is guilty of nothing more than very unprofessional thoughts.&quot; Valle used his position as a police officer to access  law enforcement databases for information about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022141752/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/27/women_freaked-out_over_inclusion_on.php">women he was targeting</a>. However, prosecutor Hadassa Waxman said, &quot;The government certainly respects the court&#x2019;s decision, but believes the jury got it right, and it&#x2019;s our intention to appeal.&quot;</p>

<p>Valle will have to wear an ankle monitor and isn&apos;t allowed to use the Internet (he apparently met others interested in kidnapping, raping, killing and then eating women on DarkFetishNet.com). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022141752/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/conviction-cannibal-nypd-overturned-article-1.1850334">The News reports</a>:</p><blockquote>His mother said she planned to cook him up some pastellas &#x2014; Spanish meat pies wrapped in banana &#x2014; to welcome him home. Elizabeth Valle said she&#x2019;s been keeping the delicacy &#x2014; one of her son&#x2019;s favorites &#x2014; on ice for him in her freezer since Christmas.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;This is like a dream. My prayers were answered,&#x201D; the joyful mom said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m rejoicing.&#x201D;</p>

<p>...&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a good kid,&#x201D; she told The News. &#x201C;The only thing he&#x2019;s guilty of is being stupid enough to be on that website.&#x201D;Neighbors of Valle&apos;s mother aren&apos;t sure how they should take the news; one man said that he has his kids for the summer, but now his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022141752/http://nypost.com/2014/07/01/cannibal-cop-freed-on-100k-bond-after-judge-vacates-conviction/">estranged wife wants him to live in a hotel</a>, away from Valle.</p>
