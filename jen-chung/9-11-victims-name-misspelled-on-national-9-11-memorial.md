<p>The thoughtful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122824/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/12/opening_day_at_the_national_911_mem.php#photo-1">National 9/11 Memorial opened to the public today</a>, but one area was restricted because a 9/11 victim&apos;s family found that their loved one&apos;s name was misspelled.  Janice Hart, whose brother Jeffrey Schreier worked in the mailroom of Cantor Fitzgerald, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122824/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Name-Misspelled-on-9-11-Memorial-129687468.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe it&quot; when seeing his first name was spelled &quot;Jeffery.&quot;  </p>

<p>Schreier&apos;s remains were never found; Hart continued, &quot;This is the only place we could go to have some solace, and to see his name engraved incorrectly was very distressing to us.&quot;  Her husband David Hart added, &quot;You feel as though Jeffrey&apos;s soul is now looking down and saying, &apos;Can&apos;t you get my name right?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>National 9/11 Memorial spokesman Michael Frazier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122824/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/name-misspelled-on-911-memorial/">explained that the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;E&quot; were transposed</a>, &quot;We are extremely sorry for the pain this mistake has caused Jeffrey&#x2019;s family. As soon as we found out about this error, we began working on how to make it right, and we&#x2019;re engaged with our fabricators, contractors and the architect to do so.&quot;</p>
