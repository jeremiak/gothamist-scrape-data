title: Con Ed Maps Its Power Outages
---

	
										<p>Con Ed has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://wcbstv.com/national/Heavy.Rains.thunderstorms.2.748627.html">working to restore power</a> to customers in Brooklyn, Queens and Westchester County who are still without power after last night&apos;s storms (thousands <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://www.wnbc.com/news/16612086/detail.html?dl=mainclick">were without power all over the region</a>, served by various utilities).  And recently, Con Ed has been sharing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://apps.coned.com/weboutageinfo/stormcenter/default.aspx">website that maps power outages</a> with the public.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/nyregion/13coned.htm">to the NY Times</a>, the map is &quot;updated every 30 minutes&quot; and &quot;based on information called in by customers, emergency workers and Con Edison employees, among others.&quot;  To reach the map, you can either check this link--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://apps.coned.com/weboutageinfo/stormcenter/default.aspx">Con Ed Outage Locations Map</a>--or look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://coned.com/sm/default.asp">Con Ed&apos;s Storm Central page</a>, which include a link to the map plus other options, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://www.coned.com/reportoutage">reporting an outage</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://www.coned.com/reportoutage">checking the status of an outage</a>.  Two years ago, Con Ed was criticized for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/13/con_ed_blames_q.php">underestimating the extent of a blackout</a> that hit many Queens neighborhoods and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508003946/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/24/queens.php">lingered for over a week</a>.  </p>

<p>Con Ed executive John F. Miksad told the Times it was a deliberate decision not to show street addresses on the map, &quot;Maybe we&#x2019;re paranoid New Yorkers, but we didn&#x2019;t want potential burglars to say, &#x2018;Oh, all the alarms are out, let&#x2019;s go there.&apos;&quot;  </p>
