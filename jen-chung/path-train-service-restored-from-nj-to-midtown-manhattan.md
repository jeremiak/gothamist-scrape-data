<p>Yesterday&apos;s PATH nightmare, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013450/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/23/path_train_suspended.php">which saw service suspended </a>between the Jersey City and Hoboken stations and midtown Manhattan, is over. Service came back a couple hours ago:</p>

<p>There had been a fire in one of the tubes, on the Manhattan side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013450/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/09/path_nj_transit_train_new_jersey_new_york_port_authority_tracks_suspended.html">on Sunday afternoon</a>, and smoke was detected in the same area yesterday afternoon. The fire ate up one of the electrical cable lines, which was replaced, but yesterday&apos;s smoke condition once again affected part of the cable. PATH workers replaced a larger length of the cable yesterday.  </p>

<p>The suspension was announced before the evening rush hour. And this is what it looked like at 11:15 p.m. last night:</p>
