The source claims, &quot;Derek has girls stay with him at his apartment in New York, and then he gets them a car to take them home the next day. Waiting in his car is a gift basket containing signed Jeter memorabilia, usually a signed baseball.&quot;</p>

<p>The source goes on, &quot;This summer, he ended up hooking up with a girl who he had hooked up with once before, but Jeter seemed to have forgotten about the first time and gave her the same identical parting gift, a gift basket with a signed Derek Jeter baseball. He basically gave her the same gift twice because he&#x2019;d forgotten hooking up with her the first time!&quot; FYI: a signed DJ-baseball <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512224833/https://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=derek+jeter+baseball#q=derek+jeter+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsuo&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PHLnTumYIaPf0QGWxLWJCg&amp;ved=0CJIBEK0E&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;fp=e0f7ed75ce37ea0c&amp;biw=1131&amp;bih=618">is about $400-500</a>.</p>

<p>There&apos;s some more insight into Jeter&apos;s personality and dating habits: </p><blockquote>&#x201C;He normally doesn&#x2019;t go out with girls. He will have them come to his house. He&#x2019;ll have cocktail parties. His friends invite girls they think he&#x2019;ll be interested in. He&#x2019;s very shy,&#x201D; another friend explained.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;ll occasionally take girls to a restaurant. He has a couple of restaurants that he goes to that aren&#x2019;t trendy,&#x201D; the friend said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He goes to Nino&#x2019;s in New York. He used to go to Mustang Grill on the Upper East Side. I know he&#x2019;s been dating multiple girls. He likes a hole in the wall, or he likes a place that his friends own. He&#x2019;s very cautious. He&#x2019;ll only go out on off-nights,&#x201D; the friend said.</p></blockquote>Sigh, Jeter: So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512224833/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/23/a-rods_batting_average_by_blonde.php">boring compared to A-Rod</a>.<p></p>
