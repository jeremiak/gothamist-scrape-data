Matthew Francis claims he had no idea he was in the bar that is considered the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. Plus, &quot;<strong>My sister&apos;s a full-blown lesbian... I don&apos;t discriminate against gay people.&quot;</strong><p></p>

<p>Francis and  his friend Christopher Orlando, 17, who also faces assault as a hate crime charge, were also charged with attempted robbery in the early Sunday scuffle that left D.C. resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529123109/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/05/stonewall_beating_victim_we_must_be.php">Ben Carver banged up</a>. However, in his jailhouse interview from the Manhattan House of Detention, the 21-year-old Francis said he was just breaking up a fight, &quot;I&apos;m not going to say sorry, because I don&apos;t know what I should be sorry for. I don&apos;t hate gay people. I don&apos;t hate anybody,&quot; and added, &quot;If it had happened somewhere else I wouldn&apos;t be here.&quot; </p>

<p>Orlando&apos;s father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529123109/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/06/2010-10-06_father_of_accused_stonewall_gay_basher_my_son_is_no_bigot.html#ixzz11gJ3zvvr">also spoke to the Daily News</a>, &quot;We are a working class family. We don&apos;t hate anyone here.... I&apos;m not going to sugarcoat what happened. It was a bar fight, but I swear on my life it&apos;s not about Gays or race or any of that. We don&apos;t care about any of that stuff in this family.&quot;  Don Orlando also said he wanted to apologize to Carver in person.  </p>

<p>Carver seems skeptical of Francis&apos;s claims, &quot;[Francis] was the one who was hitting me, and then the other young man was the one who pinned me.&quot; (Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529123109/http://www.bencarveronline.com/post/1249351318/its-been-a-rough-few-days-im-currently">in Carver&apos;s account</a>, before being attacked, one of the two told him, &quot;Don&#x2019;t pee next to me, Faggot,&quot; and the other demanded $20 from him.) </p>
