<p>To close out the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, there was a pretty incredible gathering: The cast of <em>The Godfather</em>&#x2014;Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert De Niro&#x2014;appeared along with Francis Ford Coppola to recall making the 1972 film. Coppola confessed that while he was intrigued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215857/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/the-godfather-reunion-francis-ford-coppola-al-pacino-robert-de-niro-1202403937/">about adapting Mario Puzo&apos;s bestseller</a>, &quot;I was disappointed in the book when I first read it because it&#x2019;s very long. Much of the book &#x2014; about a third &#x2014; is about Lucy Mancini&#x2019;s anatomy.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The actors and Coppola spoke during a panel, which followed back-to-back screenings of both <em>The Godfather</em> and its sequel. Director Taylor Hackford moderated, and he noted that legendary producer Robert Evans didn&apos;t want Pacino to play Michael Corleone, because he thought Pacino was too short. &quot;That&apos;s sorta true,&quot; Pacino said.</p>

<p>Coppola really wanted to cast Pacino&#x2014;&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215857/http://pagesix.com/2017/04/30/coppola-and-godfather-cast-reunite-at-tribeca-film-fest/">Everywhere we went, all the girls lit up for Al, for some reason</a>&quot;&#x2014;but Pacino was constantly doing screen tests for the role. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215857/http://deadline.com/2017/04/pacino-copolla-godfather-cast-tribeca-film-festival-1202079761/">The director said</a>, &quot;I remember calling him after he&#x2019;d tested six times to beg him to do just one more, and his girlfriend got on the phone and said, &#x2018;what are you doing to him? You&#x2019;re torturing him!&apos;&apos;</p>

<p>It turns out that Pacino was dubious about playing Michael and thought he&apos;d be better at playing Sonny Corleone. After he and Diane Keaton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215857/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoVgcEsrGjU">filmed the wedding scene</a>, Pacino recalled they &quot;got so loaded... A lot of chaos going on there... We got back, and we started drinking and we were just talking about &apos;where do we go from here?&apos; &apos;we&apos;re done&apos; &apos;it&apos;s the worst film ever made.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>And the wedding scene definitely seemed chaotic&#x2014;Robert Duvall said, &quot;We all were mooning each other. Some woman turned to me said said, &#x2018;Mr. Duvall, you&#x2019;re fine.&#x2019; She turned to her friend and then said, &#x2018;But did you catch the balls on that Brando?&#x2019;&quot;</p>
