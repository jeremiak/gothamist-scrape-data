<p>Street illusionist-stunt fiend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815035721/http://davidblaine.com/">David Blaine</a> embarked on his 60-hour project to hang upside over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815035721/http://www.wollmanskatingrink.com/main_wollman.htm">Wollman Rink</a> in Central Park.  While doctors say his head <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815035721/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/16/blaine_2.php">won&apos;t explode</a> from doing The Dive of Death (as it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815035721/http://abc.go.com/specials/davidblaine/index">called for his ABC special</a>), he could very well <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815035721/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/21/extra_extra_1008.php">go blind</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, at a press conference with Donald Trump (Trump operates Wollman Rink), Blaine demonstrated his upside-down hanging skills.  He told reporters he stopped eating a week ago, &quot;I dropped twenty pounds, which makes it easier on the body and I don&apos;t have to go to the bathroom number two.&quot;  Like his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160815035721/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/01/the_david_blain.php">Lincoln Center fishbowl</a> stunt, he will be using a catheter.  As for the reason why, he said, &quot;The point of all these things is I think we can endure much more than we think we can. <strong>Like, I think we can take everything &#x2013; we can turn our world upside down, but we can still endure because human beings are amazing.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>The Donald agreed, &quot;I have learned from David. You would really think that some of the things he&#x2019;s done are not physically or mentally possible. You can do things in your own mind that you don&#x2019;t think you can do.&#x201D;</p>
