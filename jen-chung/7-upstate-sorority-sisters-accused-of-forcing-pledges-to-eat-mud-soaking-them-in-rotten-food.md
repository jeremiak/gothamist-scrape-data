<p>Seven students at SUNY Albany are facing charges of first-degree hazing after police discovered members of a sorority conducting an apparent hazing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012926/http://wnyt.com/news/ualbany-hazing-arrests-hamilton-street-pine-hills-albany/4314771/">A police officer said</a>, &quot;We actually got a call for a noise complaint. When the officers arrived on the scene, they observed what appeared to be initiation of sorts for a sorority.&quot;</p>

<p>The alleged hazing occurred at 468 Hamilton Street in Albany. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012926/http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/7-UAlbany-students-arrested-on-hazing-charges-10606777.php#photo-11787273">According to the Times Union</a>, &quot;they allegedly blindfolded recruits, made them eat mud and drenched them in a scuzzy bath of rotten eggs, rotten milk and a liquid that smelled like urine.&quot; One of the victims was hospitalized after &quot;an allergic reaction in which she suffered a shortness of breath, redness to her face, chest burning and swelling to her eyes, city police said.&quot;</p>

The Alpha Omicron Pi sisters arrested were Jessica Raynor, 21; Nicole Johnson, 21; Chinazo Ezekwem, 21; Tereyza Martin, 20; Katrina Bergvoy, 19; Heaven Guanco, 19; and Monica Vitagliano, 19. Apparently the Albany chapter of the sorority was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012926/http://wnyt.com/news/ualbany-hazing-arrests-hamilton-street-pine-hills-albany/4314771/">shut down years ago</a> and is not recognized by the school.</p>

<p>SUNY Albany said, &quot;The University at Albany has a zero tolerance policy on hazing. While we cannot discuss individual students due to federal privacy laws, any student involved in hazing is violating rules of the University&apos;s Student Code of Conduct. If the university is made aware of allegations of hazing, it will initiate an investigation and if it is determined violations of the conduct policies have taken place, the university will work quickly to implement the appropriate administrative disciplinary measures.&quot;<br>
