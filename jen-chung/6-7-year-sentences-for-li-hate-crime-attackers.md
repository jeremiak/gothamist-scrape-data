The teens said they had gone &quot;beaner hopping,&quot; and the incident highlighted racial tensions in Patchogue and Suffolk County.

Pacheco said to Lucero&apos;s family, &quot;I shouldn&apos;t ask for mercy. God knows what I did was wrong.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062310/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/li_hate_crime_killer_sentenced_to_2.php">In May</a>, Jeffrey Conroy was sentenced to 25 years for manslaughter as a hate crime for killing Lucero.<br>
