Ute Linhart hit the train and then the impact threw her back onto the uptown platform; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016190849/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/gal_hit_by_train_in_shove_horror_xvyNT7Y5K8xt70uL6sWplM">she told the Post</a>, &quot;As the impact happened, I&apos;m thinking, &apos;I&apos;m going to be dead.&apos;  Then I realized that I was in so much pain, I couldn&apos;t possibly be dead.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The incident occurred around 8:00 p.m. when Linhart was waiting for an uptown train. According to the Post, Jose Rojas, a cook at Cipriani, was &quot;on the platform pointing in a menacing gun-like gesture at several other straphangers when he made a beeline for the victim.&quot;  She says, &quot;He stood next to me for a few seconds and stared at my face. He looked insane.&quot; Then he allegedly pushed her into the train&apos;s path.  When she was thrown back onto the platform&#x2014;suffering suffering ribs, a broken left arm, and right cheek&#x2014;another person waiting for a train grabbed her, softening her blow.  <br>
Others stopped Rojas from leaving the station.  </p>

<p>When the cops asked Rojas his name, he allegedly answered, &quot;My name is Osama bin Laden, f--k you!&quot; and was taken to Bellevue because he was so drunk.  He was charged with attempted murder and assault, though his lawyer argued that the attempted murder charge was too much, &quot;At no point is my client actually identified as the individual who pushed this woman into the train.&quot;</p>

<p>Linhart, who is still at Bellevue, told the Post, &quot;I&apos;m never going to go down [to the subway] there again. I&apos;d rather pay for a cab or walk or take the bus. I wasn&apos;t even standing near the edge. I was a few feet away.&quot;</p>
