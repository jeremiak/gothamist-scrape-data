<p>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108080307/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/29/say_good-bye_to_ny_state_sales_tax.php">mentioned earlier</a>, today&apos;s the day to go shopping for clothes and shoes (if they&apos;re under $110):  NY State is restoring its sales tax exemption today!   The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108080307/http://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/st/sales_tax_clothing_exemption.htm">state explains</a>, &quot;Sales of eligible clothing and footwear costing less than $110 per item or pair are exempt from the state&apos;s 4% sales tax and local tax in those localities that enacted the exemption.&quot;</p>

<p>Which means for anyone buying clothes and/or shoes (under $110) in NYC, there&apos;s no 4.5% city, 4% state, or 0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District tax.</p>
