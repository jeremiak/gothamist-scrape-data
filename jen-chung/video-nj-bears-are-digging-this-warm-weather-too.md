<p>Vernon, NJ resident Arne Bruhns filmed the bears in his backyard. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013850/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Bears-Hibernation-Yard-Vernon-New-Jersey-Yard--414797353.html">According to NBC New York</a>, he &quot;said it&apos;s not unusual to see bears in his Vernon yard in the summer, but this is the first time he&apos;s seen them in February.&quot;</p><blockquote> Bruhns said his kids were playing outside on Saturday when they saw the bears from a distance. They came inside and 10 minutes later, five bears were in his yard. <p></p>

<p>The bears pawed against a tree and several of them used the trunk to scratch their backs before running off. </p></blockquote>In 2015, Dave Chanda, director of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013850/http://nj1015.com/nj-black-bears-dont-hibernate/">told NJ 101.5 FM</a>, &#x201C;Black bears in New Jersey aren&#x2019;t true hibernators. They will stay active all winter long if there&#x2019;s abundant food available and we have quite a few bears that you&#x2019;ll see active in January, February and even with the winter that we had last year.&quot; <p></p>
