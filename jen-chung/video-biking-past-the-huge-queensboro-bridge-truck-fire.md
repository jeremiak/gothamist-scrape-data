<p>Yesterday, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023945/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/16/photos_truck_fire_on_queensboro_bri.php#photo-1">truck caught fire on the Queensboro Bridge</a> (well, the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge), snarling traffic and requiring dozens of firefighters to put out the blaze. A bike messenger, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023945/http://instagram.com/diablonyc">diablonyc on Instagram</a>, shared his <em>terrifying view of the fire while biking over the bridge.</em></p><em>

<p>The driver and the two passengers in the truck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023945/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=resources/traffic&amp;id=9208564">which was carrying clothes hangers</a>, escaped. The Department of Transportation will be repairing the bridge&#x2014;WABC 7 reports that it is &quot;specifically looking at a beam that was in the flames. Electrical cables that stretch under the bridge are also being checked.&quot; Yikes!</p>

<p>The inspections/repairs are taking place today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023945/https://www.facebook.com/NYCDOT/posts/10151609427967887">The DOT said</a>, &quot;Traffic is open in both directions on the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge using the span&#x2019;s westbound roadways (upper level: Manhattan-bound; lower level: Queens-bound). All but one lane on the bridge are expected to re-open by Sunday morning. The pedestrian and bike path is open.&quot;</p>
