<p>Police officers responding to a robbery in progress at a Brooklyn deli ended up killing the allegedly armed suspect, who turned out the to be holding an &quot;imitation pistol.&quot;</p>

<p>NYPD Chief of Patrol Terence A. Monahan said that around 12:40 a.m. today, &quot;A three person anti-crime unit consisting of one sergeant and two police officers from the 83rd precinct responded to a 911 call of a gunpoint robbery in progress at 185 Starr Street, the Garden Deli.&quot;</p>

<p>The male suspect was reportedly demanding &quot;five bottles of Corona and one Heineken&quot; while holding what looked like a gun, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313122214/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/cops-fire-shots-brooklyn-deli-wounded-article-1.2976505">according to the Daily News</a>. </p>

<p>By the time the police arrived, Monahan said, the suspect was gone but the cops took information about him and later &quot;observed the suspect walking west on Starr Street.</p>

<p>&quot;The officers gave verbal commands and engaged the suspect in front of 169 Starr Street. The suspect had a black firearm in his hand and raised it towards the officers. The officers fired at the suspect and struck him multiple times,&quot; Monahan explained.</p>

<p>The suspect, who has not been identified, was pronounced dead at Woodhull Hospital. Police found, what Monahan called &quot;a black firearm that appears to be an imitation pistol&quot; at the scene. </p>

The NYPD also released a surveillance image of the suspect holding the fake gun at the Garden Deli&apos;s clerk. The frightened worker, Mohamed Ali, thought the gun was real and that the suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313122214/http://abc7ny.com/news/suspected-armed-robber-fatally-shot-by-police-in-brooklyn/1762247/">would use it</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313122214/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/19/bushwick-police-shooting/">He told WCBS 2</a>, &#x201C;He put a gun next to my face, and he wanted to try to kill me, and he bought the four six-pack beer on top of counter&#x2026; and he said, &apos;Bag it up, please, I&#x2019;m going to shoot you right now.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>In an interview with the News, Ali said, &quot;I don&apos;t want to die for no reason, for the beer. These young guys, they do this stuff. It&apos;s not even worth it, for the beer.&quot;<br>
 <br>
This is the second fatal police involved shooting in the past few days; a 17-year-old alleged gang member was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313122214/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/17/brooklyn_police_shooting.php">killed after allegedly firing at anti-crime officers</a> in Cypress Hills. </p>
