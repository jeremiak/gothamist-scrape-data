</div></div>					<p>The summer storm that rolled into town a couple hours ago was brief but powerful: There are a number of incidents about downed trees all over Manhattan (see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404135322/http://gothamist.com/map/">Gothamist Newsmap</a>), such as &quot;Trees down at West Side Hwy &amp; 70th St,&quot; a &quot;downed tree on a taxi&quot; on E 86th St, and &quot;Tree down on a car&quot; at Riverside Dr &amp; 101st St (a tipster writes, &quot;Man was stuck under car for 20 minutes after an entire tree fell on him while he was driving in Riverside Park on 101 st)&#x2014;some even have requests for &quot;additional chain saws&quot;&#x2014;we hope no one was hurt.  </p>

<p>Plus, there was a &quot;sidewalk shed collapse&quot; at Madison Ave &amp; 99th St and &quot;storm damage&quot; at Central Park. (We&apos;re not sure if a &quot;partial building collapse&quot; at  Dupont St &amp; Oakpoint Ave in the Bronx is due to the storm.)  </p>

<p>Above are some photographs from readers of last night&apos;s display.  </p>
