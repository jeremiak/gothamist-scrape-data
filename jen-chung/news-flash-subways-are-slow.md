<p>New data from NYC Transit reveals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071059/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10062008/news/regionalnews/subways_slowing_to_a_crawl_132292.htm">subway commuters are getting slower</a> in recent years.  The NY Post reels off the depressing numbers: &quot;<strong>Through June, the number of delayed trains is up an average 24 percent from two years earlier, and 71 percent from three years earlier.</strong> And the distance trains travel without breaking down was down 7 percent in July from two years earlier, and 17 percent from three years earlier.&quot;  And the areas of blame are lack of money for maintenance, higher ridership, additional track work to keep the 104-year-old system running.</p>

<p>As it happens, the news comes on a morning where there were a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071059/http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/7.train.delays.2.833345.html">number of delays in the system</a>.  Reader Dorian writes, &quot;<strong>Spent 45 minutes in a subway tunnel, B train, between W. 4 and 34th, heading north, about 8:15-9:00 this a.m.</strong> Due to what conductor called &apos;smoke condition at 59th street station&apos; and brakeman added there was a sick person at 7th Avenue stop.&quot;  Also, a person was hit by a train in Queens, affecting 7, A and D service, and there are signal problems at Bowling Green.  Straphangers--bring your patience!</p>
