A dozen racers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209091321/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/race_final_heat_LwNJPXQZU2uMpGgGSRRJIN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">suffered heat exhaustion</a>, including a British man who collapsed at 5.9 miles into the 6.2 mile final leg.

His family is with him. According to his brother, he is doing better.&quot;</p>

<p>One triathlete, 50-year-old Grace Tejada Martinez, told the Daily News, &quot;The heat was good until we got to Central Park and then it got brutal. After the third mile, I was dying. I was like, &apos;Oh, God, give me water now!&apos;&quot; A volunteer doctor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209091321/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/race_final_heat_LwNJPXQZU2uMpGgGSRRJIN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;These are highly trained athletes. And they train really well... We&apos;re mostly dealing with a lot of dehydration and cramping.&quot;</p>

<p>Burke said the dozen people hospitalized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209091321/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/sports/19triathlon.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">were fewer than anticipated</a> (there were 17 ambulances <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209091321/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/122287/heat-takes-its-toll-on-city-triathletes">on standby</a>).
