The view from the space was unveiled today, with Port Authority chairman David Samson saying, &quot;Just like the rejuvenation of lower Manhattan after 9/11, this building will rise and be a symbol to the world of New York City&#x2019;s might and capabilities.&quot;</p>

<p>The observatory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105418/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2013/03/19/port-authority-expected-to-tap-legends-to-run-wtc-observation-deck/">will be run by Legends</a>, which operates luxury boxes for the New York Yankees and Dallas Cowboys. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105418/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/view-top-world-trade-center-article-1.1305432">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Visitors will be whisked from the lobby to the 100th floor in 60 seconds, then enter a lobby where they will hear the voices of construction workers who built the original Twin Towers and their symbolic replacement. Then, one floor up, tourists will enter a theater called &#x201C;See Forever&#x201D; to watch a movie about New York history. At the end of the movie, the screen itself will rise, giving visitors the full northerly view. The observatory itself is one floor up.&quot;</p>
