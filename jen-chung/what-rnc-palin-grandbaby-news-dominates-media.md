<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165418/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02vetting.html?hp">NY Times says</a> that the disclosure of Bristol Palin&apos;s pregnancy is &quot;one of several revelations that called into question how well John McCain had screened her&quot; (the others being her Troopergate incident, her husband&apos;s DWI decades ago, and her membership in Alaska&apos;s independence party).  Some feel that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165418/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13062.html">pregnancy will resonate</a> with Americans who have had to deal with similar situations, while others question Palin&apos;s opposition to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165418/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090102305.html">programs that teach teenagers anything about contraception</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The McCain camp suggested the announcement was made because of liberal blog&apos;s gossiping--and even that Barack Obama&apos;s campaign was behind it.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165418/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02words.html?ref=politics">Obama said</a>:</p><blockquote>I&#x2019;ve heard some of the news on this, and so let me be as clear as possible. I have said before and I will repeat again: I think people&#x2019;s families are off limits. And people&#x2019;s children are especially off limits. This shouldn&#x2019;t be part of our politics. It has no relevance to Governor Palin&#x2019;s performance as a governor or her potential performance as a vice president. And so I would strongly urge people to back off of these kinds of stories.<p></p>

<p>You know, my mother had me when she was 18. And so how family deals with issues and, you know, teenage children, that shouldn&#x2019;t be the topic of our politics. And I hope that anybody who&#x2019;s supporting me understands that&#x2019;s off limits.</p></blockquote>As for Bristol Palin, the father was revealed to be Levi Johnston, an 18-year-old ice hockey player at her high school.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165418/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/republican_race/2008/09/01/2008-09-01_bristol_palins_pregnancy_was_an_open_sec.html">Daily News describes</a> the pregnancy as an &quot;open secret,&quot; and his coach said,  &quot;He was a good kid to be around, with lots of friends. He was well-liked.&quot;  The media flocked to Johnston&apos;s MySpace page (which was taken down), where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165418/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09022008/news/nationalnews/palin_teen_has_baby_on_board_127096.htm">he called himself</a> a &quot;f-----&apos; redneck&quot; and someone who doesn&apos;t want to have kids.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165418/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/09/were_sorry_but_palin_babydaddy.html#hp">Daily Intel thinks</a> Johnston is &quot;sex on skates,&quot; a hot &quot;baby daddy,&quot; and &quot;basically the quintessential example of that guy who you are constantly worried is going to impregnate your daughter (and occasionally does).&quot;<p></p>
