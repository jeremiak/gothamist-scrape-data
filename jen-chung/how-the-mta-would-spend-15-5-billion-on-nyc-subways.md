<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031065125/http://www.mta.info/news-capital-plan-five-year-plan-east-side-access-second-avenue-subway-lirr-metro-north-new-york">MTA presented</a> its 2015-2019 Capital Program, a proposal (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031065125/http://web.mta.info/capital/pdf/Board_2015-2019_Capital_Program.pdf">PDF</a>) that, as the agency puts it, &quot;details its plan to ensure safe and reliable service for a growing region by investing in the subway, bus, commuter railroad, bridge and tunnel network.&quot; And half of it is for the subways.</p>

<p>The total Capital Program is $32 billion, and the MTA outlined how it would spend $15.5 billion on its lines and stations over the five years, noting, &quot;This Program will continue the revitalization of our subway system by purchasing 940 subway cars, modernizing 11 signal interlockings, replacing more than 80 miles of track, and many other critical investments. New cars will improve customer communication with electronic strip maps, automated announcements, and two-way customer intercoms. Station repairs will improve customer comfort and safety throughout the system, while new elevators make 13 more stations fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Signal improvements&#x2014;including Communications-Based Train Control&#x2014;will boost capacity and reliability.&quot; In other words, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031065125/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/23/brit_trolls_nyc_subway.php">the MTA is working on it</a>!</p>

Here&apos;s a fun fact from the MTA to generate enough public support for that expenditure: &quot;NYC Transit&#x2019;s Lexington Avenue subway is the only north-south route serving the East Side. Carrying more passengers than any other subway line in the United States, the &#x201C;Lex&#x201D; alone carries 1.3 million riders each weekday, which is greater than the ridership of the entire transit systems in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston combined.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The entire plan is being presented to the MTA&apos;s board. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031065125/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140923/BLOGS04/140929958">Crain&apos;s reports</a>, &quot;The approved plan will be submitted to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state Legislature by Oct. 1. Funding for roughly half the plan has not been identified.&quot;</p>
