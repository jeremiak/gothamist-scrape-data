</div></div>					<p>Clarence Clemons, the beloved saxophonist for the E Street Band and called &quot;one of the key influences in Bruce Springsteen&apos;s life and music through four decades&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152543/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/street_sax_man_clemons_dies_dTV4TAIwqzLxVsA2bZtbkM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">by the AP</a>, died today in Florida.  He had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152543/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/13/clarence_clemons_e-street_band_sax.php">suffered a stroke about a week ago</a>, and Springsteen&apos;s spokesman said that Clemons&apos; death was due to complications from the stroke.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152543/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/arts/music/clarence-clemons-e-street-band-saxophonist-dies-at-69.html?hp">NY Times&apos; obituary notes</a> that Clemons&apos; &quot;jovial onstage manner, soul-rooted style and brotherly relationship with Mr. Springsteen made him one of rock&#x2019;s most beloved sidemen&quot; and:</p><blockquote>From the beginnings of the E Street Band in 1972, Mr. Clemons played a central part in Mr. Springsteen&#x2019;s music, complementing the group&#x2019;s electric guitar and driving rhythms in songs like &#x201C;Born to Run&#x201D; and &#x201C;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&#x201D; with muscular, melodic saxophone hooks that echoed doo-wop, soul and early rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll.<p></p>

<p>But equally important to the group&#x2019;s image was the sense of affection and unbreakable camaraderie between Mr. Springsteen and his sax man. Few E Street Band shows were complete without a shaggy-dog story about the stormy night the two men met at a bar in Asbury Park, N.J., or a long bear hug between them at the end of the night.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152543/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/e-street-bands-clarence-clemons-dies-at-69-20110618">Rolling Stone&apos;s obituary declares</a>, &quot;Clemons - known affectionately to fan and friends as the Big Man&quot;&#x2014;Clemons was 6&apos;4&quot; and 250 pounds&#x2014;&quot;- was the heart and soul of the E Street Band. His playing on tracks like &apos;Born To Run,&apos; &apos;Thunder Road,&apos; &apos;Jungleland,&apos; &apos;Dancing In The Dark&apos; and countless more represent some of the most famous sax work in the history of rock &amp; roll.&quot;  Springsteen himself wrote in the introduction to Clemons&apos; memoir, &quot;The story I have told throughout my work life I could not have told as well without Clarence.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Here are a few videos of Clemons&apos; beautiful playing&#x2014;he was recently on American Idol with Lady Gaga (he plays the sax in &quot;Edge of Glory&quot;):</p>
