<p>It&apos;s been a week and a half since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060842/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/01/new_bike_racks_may_take_some_gettin.php">bike rack prototypes have been unveiled</a> and already one of the models is broken!  Reader Mick sent in a photograph (above, on the right) of the &quot;cable rack&quot; style prototype looking pretty unsecured.</p>

<p>Designer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060842/http://www.nps-architects.com/home.swf">Next Phase Studios</a> describes the Cable Rack as &quot;a grand cable lock click into its Anchors on the street, rather than &apos;stiff&apos; street furniture like other racks.&quot;  However, some bicyclists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060842/http://nycityracks.wordpress.com/comment-on-the-finalists/next-phase-studios/">expressed concern over the flexible form</a> and one commented on the broken rack yesterday:</p><blockquote>So I went to see this bike rack at Astor place today and it&#x2019;s already broken. One of the ends popped out of the mount and the cable is sticking in the air. Aside from that, this is not a very good concept for a bike rack. You can&#x2019;t even lean your bike on this thing. I&#x2019;m paranoid about my bike getting knocked over and run over by a car when it&#x2019;s tied to a signpost, and this design seems to be worse than a signpost. I appreciate the wit involved with it looking like a cable lock except that cable locks are not good locks. If it&#x2019;s meant to be ironic, then it should be especially sturdy, but it&#x2019;s not. If it&#x2019;s a prank, then good prank.</blockquote>The Department of Transportation&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060842/http://nycityracks.wordpress.com/">bike rack design competition</a> has nine other finalists.<p></p>
