<p>Always check your credit card statements&#x2014;because some unlucky customers at gas stations in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406044940/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_109.shtml">109th</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406044940/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_111.shtml">111th</a> Precincts had their accounts hacked into by three men who set up credit card skimmers at various locations. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, thirty-nine (!) grand larcenies have taken place between Sunday, June 21, 2015 and Wednesday, September 23, 2015: &quot;The suspects install skimmer card-reading devices inside gas station pumps, and subsequently produce fraudulent debit cards allowing them to make withdrawals from victims&apos; bank accounts.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The authorities also released images of the suspects withdrawing from accounts. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto Crime Stoppers&apos; website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406044940/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">www.nypdcrimestoppers.com</a> or by texting their tips to CRIMES (274637), then enter TIP577.<br>
