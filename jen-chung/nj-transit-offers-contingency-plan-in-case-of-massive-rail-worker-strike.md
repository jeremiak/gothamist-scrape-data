<p>With a rail workers strike on the horizon for mid-month, NJ Transit officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609083054/http://www.njtransit.com/var/var_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=RailStopTo">unveiled their plans for handling the crisis</a> today. Interim executive director Dennis Martin said, &quot;We&apos;ve reached out to employers/businesses in NJ &amp; NY to encourage them to allow employees to telecommute/work from alternate locations.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609083054/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/nyregion/possible-nj-transit-train-strike-raises-anxiety-among-commuters.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;After months of tense negotiations, both sides are meeting again with federal officials in Washington on Friday to try to secure a deal. A closing could force hordes of commuters onto buses and roads that are already packed.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, Martin emphasized that sharing strike contingency details was &quot;not meant to thwart those efforts but in the event of a work stoppage, we must provide contingency plan details to customers... NJ Transit continues to negotiate in good faith w/ reps from the rail union to achieve a fair &amp; affordable resolution to contact talks.&quot;</p>

<p>The big plan is to set up five park-ride lots where rail commuters can take buses that will take them to ferries, the PATH or to Manhattan. Here&apos;s the map (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609083054/http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/NJT_Contingency_Bus_Park_Ride_Locations.pdf">PDF</a>) and here are the locations:<br>
- MetLife Stadium to Port Authority Bus Terminal, New York<br>
- PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel to New York City (Academy Bus)<br>
- Hamilton Rail Station to Newark Penn Station for PATH service<br>
- Metropark Rail Station to Harrison PATH Station<br>
- Ramsey/Route 17 Rail Station to Lincoln Harbor Ferry, Weehawken</p>

<p>NJ Transit will also increase bus service along certain lines. </p>

<p>A federal panel backed the union&apos;s demands that NJ Transit should give an annual 2.6% salary increase for six and a half years, but the transit agency says its costs are too high. Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609083054/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/dead-eyed_christie_drumpf.php">sad hype man</a> Chris Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609083054/http://nj1015.com/christie-on-possible-transit-strike-every-extra-dollar-i-give-them-comes-from-fares-taxpayers/">said earlier this week</a>, &quot;My job is to let my negotiators negotiate. No one&#x2019;s goal is to have a strike here. Every extra dollar I give them comes from taxpayers. There&#x2019;s no magic money tree that we take this money off of. It&#x2019;s gonna come from fares and taxes.&quot;</p>
