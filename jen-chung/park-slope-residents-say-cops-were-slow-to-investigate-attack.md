<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_psattack.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111025175246im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_psattack.jpg" width="365" height="183" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, a video of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111025175246/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/video_woman_narrowly_escapes_park_s_1.php">woman being attacked on a Park Slope street was made public</a>, showing how her screams attracted the attention of neighbors, which then scared the man into releasing her.  The attack occurred on March 20th, and residents say that the police didn&apos;t seem very interested in investigating the crime: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111025175246/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/22/shocking-video-park-slope-attack-caught-on-tape/">One told WCBS 2</a>, &#x201C;Basically there&#x2019;s a sense that the police aren&#x2019;t going to do anything. And that encourages this kind of crime.&quot;  </p>

<p>The attack occurred on 16th Street (the cross streets have not been disclosed) around 11:30 p.m.; the video is from a resident&apos;s surveillance camera. Another neighbor told WCBS 2, &quot;The first time I heard about it was this morning when I actually asked your cameraman why you were here. Then, half an hour later, there&#x2019;s a cop knocking on my door.&quot; </p>

<p>Women in the neighborhood were startled by the video&#x2014;&#x201C;I totally take my safety for granted in this neighborhood.  And it&#x2019;s very disturbing that this could happen right next to my door&quot;&#x2014;and a self-defense expert said that the victim in the video did the right thing by screaming, &quot;Doing anything is doing the right thing. The fact that she was yelling was very effective,&#x201D; but also gave other suggestions like, &quot;a head butt, a fist to the groin, a stomp on the foot, a kick [to the groin]&quot; and saying &quot;fire,&quot; explaining, &quot;That could be my car, that could be my apartment, that could be whatever, so people are definitely more affected by the word &#x2018;fire,&#x2019; than the word &#x2018;help,&#x2019; unfortunately.&quot;<br>
