<p>The CBP officers stopped the man who was arriving from the Dominican Republican for a &quot;routine baggage inspection&quot; and &quot;The checked bags Mr. Ortega was in possession of six pairs of shoes with unusually thick soles. A more intrusive inspection of the shoes revealed a white powdery substance concealed within the soles that field tested positive for cocaine.&quot;  All in all, the drugs had a street value of over $200,000.</p>

<p>The CBP&apos;s New York field office director Robert Perez said, &quot;CBP employs some of the most dedicated professional law enforcement officers in the country. These highly skilled officers are committed to intercepting any threat or illicit activity before it adversely affects our nation&apos;s communities.&quot; </p>
