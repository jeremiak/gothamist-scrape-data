</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/30/heavy_rain_expected_tonight_as_stor.php">Yesterday&apos;s torrential downpour</a> saw 4.97&quot; of rain recorded in Central Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/https://twitter.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/461832027458007040">According to the National Weather Service</a>, that made it the &quot;10th highest daily total ever recorded there. (Record: 8.28&quot; from 9/23/1882).&quot;</p>

<p>As of 6:14 a.m., the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/https://nwschat.weather.gov/p.php?pid=201405011059-KOKX-NOUS41-PNSOKX">NWS recorded 5.12&quot; of rain</a> in Central Park; many areas outside of the city got around five inches of rain as well&#x2014;5.43&quot; was recorded at JFK Airport and 5.36&quot; at Newark Airport. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Rain-Wednesday-Weather-New-York-City-Tri-State-Flooding-Storm-257127521.html">NBC New York adds</a>, &quot;Forecasters said another 1 to 2 inches were possible before the storm system finally leaves the region on Thursday morning.&quot; </p>

<p>The rain caused lots of flooding, so many major roadways were closed. The 106th NYPD Precinct in Queens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/https://twitter.com/NYPD106Pct/status/461731233035476993/photo/1">Tweeted a photograph of a submerged car</a>, &quot;We&apos;re hip deep in it! The worst flooded #106Pct #Lindenwood location: 78 St bet 155 Av and 156 Av. We need waders!&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=weather&amp;id=9522439">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;In the Lindenwood section of Howard Beach, Queens, dozens of basements were flooded due to a combination of the heavy rains and sewer problems. Some first-floor apartments also flooded as residents pumped out their homes. About 10 blocks and 100 homes were affected. Residents believe sludge and debris left behind by Superstorm Sandy may still be clogging local drains.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/05/6_inches_of_rain_leaves_nj_awash_rivers_peaking.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Rivers peaked in NJ</a>, which saw some areas with 6 inches of rain. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=weather&amp;id=9522439">A driver in NJ was stuck in the water</a> and later told ABC 7, &quot;Black smoke was coming from the tail pipe.&quot; He recalled thinking, &quot;I&apos;m too young to die. Please someone help me.&quot;</p>

<p>And up in Yonkers, part of a retaining wall by the Metro-North tracks collapsed, causing a mudslide onto the tracks. MTA workers have been trying to clear the mud, but commuters on the Hudson Line <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/https://twitter.com/MetroNorth/status/461824356247949312">&quot;should anticipate delays of up to 30 minutes in both directions.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Florida has experienced record-breaking rain (&quot;5.68 inches in a single hour&quot; in Pensacola, 24 inches in a day)&#x2014;Slate&apos;s Eric Holthaus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040908/http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/30/record_rains_and_extreme_weather_florida_s_floods_are_linked_to_climate.html">explained how it&apos;s connected to climate change</a>: &quot;The science is here is relatively straightforward: As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more water vapor. You can see this effect for yourself on muggy summer days when droplets of condensation form on the windows of air-conditioned buildings. There&#x2019;s now more moisture available that can turn into rain. Warmer days lead to more evaporation, and more evaporation leads to heavier rainfall.&quot;<br>
