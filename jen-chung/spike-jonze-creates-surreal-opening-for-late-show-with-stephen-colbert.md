<p>If Stephen Colbert&apos;s Late Show opening is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062231/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/12/watch_colberts_extended_late_night.php">too upbeat for you</a>, don&apos;t worry. Here&apos;s a new option, which gives you the opportunity to dwell on the meaning of your life and possible lack of connection with other humans, courtesy director Spike Jonze.</p>

<p>Jonze, who was on the talk show to promote the new all-Vice, all-the-time cable channel, Viceland, directed this version with Colbert waking up in Central Park and gazing at the mega-skyscrapers. And before he can hop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062231/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZdl2FFp0eA">on a train to Montauk</a>, a friendly, furry blue face is there to help:</p>

<p>During the show, Colbert and Jonze discussed filming the segment last Friday (Jonze also offered to shoot one every Friday) and how Colbert almost got run over by a school bus:</p>

<p>If you need something else to ponder, Late Show posted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062231/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSO1T6AcAAA">second part of Colbert&apos;s interview</a> with Casey Affleck, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062231/http://jezebel.com/casey-affleck-has-terrible-interview-with-stephen-colbe-1760890900">extremely awkward</a>. </p>
