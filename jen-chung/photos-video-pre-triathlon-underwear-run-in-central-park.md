</div></div>					<p>Tomorrow, thousands of people will participate in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104349/http://www.nyctri.com/">Nautica Triathlon</a>, a 32-mile race involving swimming the Hudson River from 98th Street to 79th Street, biking on the Henry Hudson Parkway and then running in Central Park&#x2014;a test of steely endurance.  However, last night was a more light-hearted pre-triathlon event: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104349/http://www.nyctri.com/Jamaica_Underwear_Run.htm">Jamaica Underwear Run</a> in Central Park, a 1.7 mile run while in costume.  </p>
