Of course, Silverstein is suing.<p></p>

<p>Silverstein, a consultant who lives on the Upper East Side, claims that Kendra Platt-Lee owes him almost $50,000 for bailing on their planned September 22nd wedding on Long Island.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231003800/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jilted-groom-steven-silverstein-flame-kendra-platt-lee-owes-50g-unpaid-bills-article-1.1083021?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News,</a> he&apos;s &quot;even going after Platt-Lee for her split of the rent on two apartments they shared during their off-and-on engagement dating back to 2009. He says he paid her share of the rent on their most recent $3,945-a-month love nest because they were going to get married.&quot; </p>

<p>He believes her share of the rent is $28,000, and then splitting refundable deposits for wedding festivities would be about $13,500. Silverstein also claims Platt-Lee took $54,367.87 from their joint checking account, but only $35,000 was hers to take. However, Platt-Lee, who is described as a former Hooters employee and flight attendant, did return the $32,000 engagement ring, &quot;after dumping him by phone in April.&quot;  Ouch, but at least he doesn&apos;t need to sue for that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231003800/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/19/jilted_fiancee_sues_to_get_his_enga.php">like some other guys</a>!</p>

<p>Platt-Lee told the Daily News, &quot;I haven&#x2019;t been served with anything yet,&quot; but thought they ended things &quot;amicably... We settled this. I don&#x2019;t owe him any money.&quot;  And Platt-Lee&apos;s lawyer says they&apos;ll file a counterclaim &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231003800/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/aisle_see_you_in_court_ZfLdtSqYSuV8nXESL7nldO?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">since Silverstein failed to return some of her possessions, including her makeup.</a>&quot;  Platt-Lee&apos;s lawyer also says that because the engagement ring was returned, it was believed the matter was settled.</p>
