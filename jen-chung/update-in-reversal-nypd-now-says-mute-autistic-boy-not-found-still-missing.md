                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_09_avotenq.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002637im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_avotenq.jpg" width="200" height="257" class="image-right"> </span><strong>[UPDATE BELOW] </strong>The police are continuing to search for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002637/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/07/nypd_searches_for_missing_mute_auti.php">14-year-old Avonte Oquendo</a> of Queens. The boy has been missing since last Friday and his family is especially frantic because he&apos;s autistic and cannot verbally communicate.</p>

<p>Avonte was last seen leaving the Center Boulevard School on 51st Avenue in Queens. His family says he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002637/http://nypost.com/2013/10/08/autistic-teenage-boy-missing-since-friday/">understands the subway system</a>. He&apos;s run away three times before&#x2014;and each time he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002637/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9276035">found on the subway tracks</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002637/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/urgent-subway-tunnel-search-underway-missing-autistic-boy-cops-article-1.1478829">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Power was cut from about 1 p.m. to about 1:25 p.m. on the No. 7 line between Grand Central station and Vernon/Jackson in Long Island City, Queens, sources said. Service was restored about 30 minutes later and power was cut to part of the G line between Bedford/Nostrand and Court Square from about 1:50 to 2:15 p.m.&quot;</p>

<p>His worried mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002637/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9276035">spoke to WABC 7</a>, saying &quot;that Avonte is supposed to be given one-on-one supervision at all times. She wants to know where his teacher was and what happened to the guard at the door, but for now, the family says those questions can wait until Avonte is found safe.&quot;</p>

<p>And his father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002637/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Search-Continues-Missing-Queens-Teen-Long-Island-City-Autistic-Mute-226676711.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;We&apos;re going on all these leads and nothing has turned up. It&apos;s tough. t&apos;s tough because we don&apos;t know where he&apos;s at or if something is happening to him.&quot;</p>

<p>Avonte was last seen wearing a grey striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He&apos;s 5&apos;3&quot; and about 125 pounds. </p>

<p><strong>Update 3:45 p.m.:</strong> NYPD spokesman Martin Speechley tells us Avonte was found at approximately 3:20 this afternoon in Harlem, at the intersection of 123rd Street and Lexington avenue. He appears to be in good condition, but he&apos;s currently being taken to the hospital for evaluation.<br>
<strong><br>
Update 4:22 p.m.:</strong> The NYPD press office now says officers were mistaken in reporting that Avonte was found. A spokesman tells us a different boy was found in Harlem earlier today, but it was NOT Avonte. That boy has not yet been publicly identified, and an NYPD spokesman would not say why the previous announcement was erroneous.</p>
