The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140412070749/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/09/18/2009-09-18_susps_bribed_by_fried_chicken__atty.html">Daily News reports</a> that Laguerre Payen&apos;s lawyer said,  &quot;You can&apos;t watch the tapes that you don&apos;t see eating going on. The [confidential informant] is paying for all these meals,&quot; and claimed that the &quot;informant had a charge account at a Crown Chicken on Broadway and let Payen eat for free.&quot; Naturally, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office said they would look into the matter&#x2014;&quot;I&apos;m going to inquire as to whether there was a Crown Chicken relationship.&quot;  In the mean time, let&apos;s ponder the possibility of deciding to blow up buildings and military bases because you&apos;re getting free food, because even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140412070749/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/06/kfcs_denial_of_grilled_chicken_give.php">free <em>grilled</em> chicken can cause a frenzy</a>.</p>
