<p>Yesterday, candidates for citywide office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120109/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/best_photo_of_nyc_2013_candidate_wi.php">were bragging about how many petitions</a> they got to get onto the ballot. But the politician that everyone wants to talk about&#x2014;disgraced former Governor Eliot Spitzer&#x2014;is scrambling to get signatures in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120109/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/ho_yes_client_no_9_is_back_eliot_sp.php">his bid to run for NYC Comptroller</a> because the filing deadline is tomorrow. How desperate is he? Well, he&apos;s paying $800 a day to the brave souls who will gather signatures on his behalf.</p>

<p>Spitzer needs 3,750 signatures to get on the ballot, but those John Hancocks have to be valid&#x2014;from registered Democrats who haven&apos;t signed any other Comptroller candidate&apos;s petition. The Love Gov said he hoped to gather 7,500 signatures, but there seemed to be way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120109/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/spitzer_heckled_at_first_petitionin.php">more press than potential signers</a> to his petition at his first petitioning event. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120109/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/nyregion/as-spitzer-seeks-new-political-life-his-first-challenge-is-collecting-signatures.html?pagewanted=2&amp;smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;[T]here were signs of desperation. On Monday, the campaign posted an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120109/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/npo/3922034373.html">ad on Craigslist</a> and other job sites, offering to pay canvassers $12 an hour, a standard rate. By Tuesday, the campaign was reportedly willing to pay $800 a day. On Wednesday night, the Spitzer campaign plans to hold a &apos;petitioning party&apos; at a Manhattan restaurant.&quot;</p>

<p>Hunter College Political Science Professor Kenneth Sherrill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120109/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/best_photo_of_nyc_2013_candidate_wi.php">explained earlier this week</a>, &quot;Spitzer has to be very careful about petitioning. <strong>The rule of thumb is that you need two or three times the minimum number to get the required number of signatures. </strong>Trying to get 10,000 signatures in four days will mean a lot of work for unemployed actors and college students, but it also will mean a lot of errors.&quot; And Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, the other Democratic candidate for Comtproller, has collected 100,000 signatures.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120109/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/eliot-spitzer-spending-big-money-controller-campaign-article-1.1394433?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News also confirmed</a> the $800 figure as well, and a Spitzer insider told the News, &quot;It&#x2019;s a jump ball whether or not he&#x2019;ll be getting on&quot; the ballot.</p>

<p>Who knows&#x2014;money buys lots of things.</p>
