<p>Police officers assigned to the Times Square subway station arrested a man who they spotted &quot;repeatedly thrusting and gyrating his hips&quot; against a woman on a train last week. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926130648/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/19/subway_groping_felony.php">subway grinding is indeed a crime</a>.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident happened during the evening rush hour commute on Thursday, April 21st, around 5:40 p.m.: &quot;Lieutenant Luis Almonte and Police Officer Leslie Friday, assigned to Transit District 1, were conducting pickpocket and sex abuse train patrol inside of the Times Square 1/2/3, station when they recognized a man known to prey on female passengers.&quot;</p>

<blockquote> The lieutenant and officer, both in plainclothes, followed the man onto a northbound &quot;3&quot; express train where they saw him board the train closely behind a female passenger. After the train door closed, the man positioned himself behind the 24 year-old female victim. The two officers observed the man press himself against the back of the woman; repeatedly thrusting and gyrating his hips against the victim. When the train arrived at the 72 Street station, both the victim and the man walked off the train.</blockquote>

<p>Authorities say that after Officer Friday introduced herself to the victim, the victim said the man had been rubbing against her, and Lieutenant Almonte arrested 59-year-old Wilson Bradley.</p>

<p>Bradley was charged with forcible touching and persistent sexual abuse. The NYPD adds, &quot;Upon further investigation it was revealed that [Bradley&apos;s] a registered level 3 sex offender.&quot; </p>

<p>Forcible touching is a misdemeanor, but the maximum sentence was recently raised to a year in prison or three years probation. The NY appeals court doesn&apos;t think that this is felony material, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926130648/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/19/subway_pervert_grinding_ejaculating.php">even if the grinder ends up ejaculating on his victim</a>.</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926130648/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/16/upskirt_awareness.php">having someone photograph up your skirt</a> etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926130648/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. Don&apos;t let the perverts win.</p>
