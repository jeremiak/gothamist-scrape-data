Marisa Cortright, a Barnard sophomore from Oregon, was jogging in the park near 120th Street at 6 a.m. when a person grabbed her iPod and attacked her&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223438/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/shock_at_park_attack_jL6Z5qgIxlUb83lxy6kgOK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">according to the Post</a>, she &quot;was grabbed from behind, punched in the face and had her head slammed into a wall by the thug.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Cortright, who has been working as a resident advisor to summer students, lost consciousness and suffered bleeding on the brain, a fractured cheekbone and cuts to her face, head and neck.  She was found by another parkgoer who then called 911. Cortright is recovering at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital and has been able to talk to police.  While the Post and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223438/http://dnainfo.com/20100707/morningside-heights/riverside-park-jogger-bouncing-back-from-brutal-attack-family-says">DNAinfo</a> say that the man in the sketch&#x2014;a 6-foot-2, heavyset black man in his mid-40s wearing a bright blue, long-sleeved shirt and black pants who was seen leaving the park&#x2014;is a &quot;person of interest,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223438/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/07/08/2010-07-08_help_bust_mug_thug_victim_of_vicious_riverside_park_attack_awake__talking_to_cop.html">Daily News says</a> the man is a suspect.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223438/http://wcbstv.com/local/barnard.college.attack.2.1792827.html">WCBS 2 also says</a> the man is a person of interest:</p><blockquote>Police said after being attacked, the woman slumped onto a nearby bench and lost consciousness. That&apos;s when someone found her later. <p></p>

<p>That person was about to play tennis with a friend when he saw the woman bleeding profusely from the face. Now [Police Commissioner] Kelly said police want to talk to this man who they describe as a black male in his 40s, between 6&apos;2 and 6&apos;4, about 235 pounds with a heavy build. He was wearing a long-sleeved bright blue t-shirt, and black pants.</p></blockquote><br>
A friend told the News, &quot;She&apos;s a great girl, and this is awful something like this happened to her. It wasn&apos;t even like she was running at night or in a dangerous place,&quot; while another said, &quot;I know that I&apos;ve walked in Riverside Park, in that area, alone, although not as early as she did.&quot;  Still, Barnard Director of Security Dianna Pennetti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223438/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/07/06/university-affiliate-assaulted-riverside-park">emailed students</a>, &quot;In light of this and other incidents in the neighborhood, I urge you to take your personal safety into consideration at all times. In particular, when entering the park in the early morning, around dusk, and after dark, always go with a friend and be aware of your surroundings.&quot;<p></p>
