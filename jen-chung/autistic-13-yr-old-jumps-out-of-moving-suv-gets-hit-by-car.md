                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_07_siexp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082228im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_siexp.jpg" width="365" height="236"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Staten Island Expressway (Google Maps)</i></div> Yesterday, during the evening commute, a 13-year-old girl jumped out of her mother&apos;s SUV and was struck by another vehicle on the Staten Island Expressway. The teen is reportedly autistic.<p></p>

<p>The girl jumped into the HOV lane after 6 p.m. as her mother&apos;s car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082228/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teen-injured-leaping-car-middle-staten-island-expressway-article-1.1393550?localLinksEnabled=false">was going 40 mph</a>. According to the Staten Island Advance, &quot;One vehicle traveling in the HOV stopped short to avoid the girl, but another vehicle behind the first, a 2010 Honda Element, swerved to avoid the first, and hit her, sources said.&quot; (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082228/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/girl_leaps_from_suv_on_si_xIxl4fUt8h2AxLhlxfwYcO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=">Post says</a> the car ran over her.) A police source added, &quot;They were not involved in an accident. She exited the vehicle of her own volition.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl, who suffered internal injuries and a broken leg, is in critical condition at Staten Island University North Hospital.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: It seems that the girl didn&apos;t want to go to her father&apos;s house. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082228/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/s-girl-leapt-car-dad-article-1.1393999">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;McKailla Callender, who is autistic, was in the back seat of her mother&apos;s 2011 Nissan at 6 p.m. Monday, arguing about being dropped off at her father&apos;s house when she opened the door of the moving car door and jumped out.&quot;</p>
