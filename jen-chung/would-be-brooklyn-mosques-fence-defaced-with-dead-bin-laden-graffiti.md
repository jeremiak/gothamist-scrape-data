<p>Osama bin Laden&apos;s death roused up strong feelings of patriotism and jingoistic drink recipes&#x2014;and it also inspired someone to inform a proposed Brooklyn mosque of the Al Qaeda leader&apos;s death by way of graffiti.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011354/http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2011/05/mosque-fence-vandalized-after-bin-ladens-death/">Sheepshead Bites reports</a> that &quot;He is dead&quot; and smiley faces were spray painted onto the fence outside a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011354/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/24/sheepshead_bay_mosque_is_re-approve.php">controversial mosque site</a>.  The mosque&apos;s organizers called it a &quot;hateful act.&quot; </p>

<p>Ibrahim Anse, who is part of the group overseeing construction of the Voorhies Avenue mosque and cultural center, told Sheepshead Bites, &quot;That was graffiti from a person who looks at the world in the wrong way. Osama bin Laden is dead, and we as Muslim Americans suffered from him and his act [as much as anyone else]... It is a relief for us as Muslims [that bin Laden has been] killed, which he deserves.&quot; </p>

<p>The mosque&apos;s developer has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011354/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/anti-mosque_fever_from_sheepshead_b.php#photo-1">previously emphasized &quot;we will denounce terrorism&quot; of course</a>, but the mosque&apos;s opponents think otherwise.</p>
