One gas station on the border of New York and Connecticut has now taken an ingenious approach: Put an ice cream truck selling smokes on the Connecticut part of its property. <p></p>

<p>The Port Chester, NY Sunoco station has its pumps in Greenwich, CT.  And though the cigarette tax is $3 in Connecticut, the 4th highest in the country, it&apos;s easier to stomach than NY&apos;c $4.35 cigarette tax.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412130110/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/119331604.html">Stamford resident knowingly told NBC Connecticut</a>, &quot;In Connecticut they&apos;re greatly cheaper than in New York. In New York, it&apos;s like $11.50 in the city for a pack of cigarettes. That&apos;s kind of ridiculous.&quot; </p>

<p>While the addicts are happy, kids hoping for some Choco Tacos are not!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412130110/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/default/article/Gas-station-rips-ice-cream-ads-from-cigarette-1327991.php">A customer said,</a> &quot;The first week it was there, there were little kids running up to it thinking it was an ice cream truck.&quot; The gas station has now  taken down the signs advertising ice cream from the truck&#x2014;and let&apos;s face it, it&apos;s not like it&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412130110/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/million_dollar_oxy_drug_ring_allege.php">oxy ring is being operated from it</a>.</p>
