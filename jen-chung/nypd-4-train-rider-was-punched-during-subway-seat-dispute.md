Police are looking for a person who punched a fellow 4 train rider in the Bronx.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred just before 1 a.m. on Monday, March 7: &quot;The victim, a 58-year-old male was onboard the south bound 4 train approaching the Mount Eden Avenue subway station, when a male individual started a verbal dispute with him over a seat. As the victim was sitting in a seat the male individual pushed the victim to the floor and punched him several times about the face causing a laceration to his upper lip.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim exited at the Mount Eden Avenue station and refused medical attention. </p>

<p>The suspect remained on the train and is described as last wearing blue jeans, black hooded sweater, a blue jean jacket and a black baseball cap and carrying a black book bag. Police released an image of him aboard the train.<br>
