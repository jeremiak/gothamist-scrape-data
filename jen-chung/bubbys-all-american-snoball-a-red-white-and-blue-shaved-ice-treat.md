<p>Today, we celebrate the 238th anniversary of our independence from Britain&#x2014;as well as enjoy summer holiday food! To get into the spirit of July 4th as well as the summer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707134006/http://www.bubbys.com/briefs/bubbys-high-line-what-is-this-location/">Bubby&apos;s High Line</a> is debuting a special dessert&#x2014;a limited-edition red, white, and blue shaved ice treat called the &quot;All American Snowball.&quot;</p>

<p>The $5 shaved ice confection is, according to press details, &quot;drizzled with fresh, homemade raspberry, blueberry, and lemon syrup.&quot; And it looks incredible! It&apos;ll be available from July 4th through Labor Day. The restaurant says, &quot;Chef Ron Silver just returned from a research trip to Japan, the birthplace of the Snowball, where he perfected his recipe and technique through extensive shaved ice study (and tasting!).&quot;</p>
