<p>While the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132400/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/photos_hell_is_other_people_trying.php">commuting hell continues</a> for riders along Metro-North&apos;s New Haven line, help is sort of on the way: Three transformers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132400/http://www.wtnh.com/traffic/trains/gov-malloy-updates-metro-north-service">being brought in for partial power</a>.</p>

<p>According to WTNH, &quot;A Con Ed spokesman says the high-voltage feeder line can carry 138,000 volts and requires 27,000 volts to power a train. He says the transformers will take power from residential lines. Officials will test the transformers to see whether trains can run on their power.&quot; Fingers crossed! Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy said, &quot;I&apos;m the governor of 125,000 pretty unhappy commuters right now.&quot;</p>

Power was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132400/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/con_ed_feeder_loss_suspends_metro_n.php">knocked out on Wednesday morning</a> when a high-voltage feeder cable failed. A second feeder cable that acts as a backup had been taken out of service to facilitate work on the Mount Vernon substation. </p>
