(Which turned out to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153201/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/japanese_artist_accused_of_planting.php">an art project</a>?) Well, yesterday the bomb squad visited Scholes Street for another suspicious package. As the Post puts it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153201/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/bomb_squad_rushes_to_investigate_H9IQTuPwnCHVeoZgSblQwM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">&quot;They should have called in Billy Joel.&quot;</a><p></p>

<p>Apparently someone called 911 around 1:45 p.m. because there was a suspicious bag on the street&#x2014;and &quot;it was beeping ominously.&quot; Some buildings were evacuated but when all was said and done, &quot;Inside the bag, was nothing but a harmless electronic keyboard, which happened to be beeping for some reason. It was not clear who left it there.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153201/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/nypd_arrest_artist_who_installed_i.php">Whoever it was better lay low</a>!<br>

<p>But there was some excitement: The bomb squad officer &quot;threw [the keyboard] into the air and smashed it into pieces.&quot; </p>
