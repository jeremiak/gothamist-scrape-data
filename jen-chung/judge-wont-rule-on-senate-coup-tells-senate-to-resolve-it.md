<p>A State Supreme Court judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164154/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/06/16/2009-06-16_judge_gives_albany_lawmakers_more_time_to_work_out_agreement.html">refused to rule on the State Senate&apos;s state of ridiculousness</a> and instead urged (again!) the Senators to work out the matter. State Supreme Court Justice Thomas McNamara dismissed <em>Smith vs. Espada</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164154/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/15617/the-ruling-pdf/">read the decision</a>) and wrote, &quot;A judicially imposed resolution would be an improvident intrusion into the inner workings of a coequal branch of government. The practical effect of having a court decide this issue would be that its decision, if only by perception, would have an influence on the internal workings of the Senate. &#x2026; To have a court do so would be improper... <strong>The failure of the Senate to resolve this issue in an appropriate manner will make them answerable to the electorate</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, we can only hope that the Senators will be made more answerable to the electorate, because right now it&apos;s a serious&#x2014;pardon our French&#x2014;clusterfuck, with a 31-31 tie in the Senate and Governor Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164154/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06162009/news/regionalnews/judge_delays_decision_on_albany_power_st_174543.htm">stepping in to offer run the chamber</a> (the Republicans have declined that offer).  The Republicans are claiming victory and taking time to slam the 31 Democrats who don&apos;t want them in power. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164154/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/15626/gop-take-on-court-case/">From a GOP press release with quotes</a> from defected Democrat Pedro Espada Jr. and majority leader Dean Skelos:</p><blockquote> &#x201C;I am pleased the judge recognized that Senator Smith&#x2019;s lawsuit was baseless. He made it clear that the vote for my election as Temporary President Pro Tempore and the election of Senator Skelos as Majority Leader, is legal,&#x201D; Senator Espada said. &#x201C;This should bring to an end to Senator Smith&#x2019;s fruitless attempts to undo a legal vote and turn back the clock on the historic rules reforms we enacted.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;There is no longer any excuse for 31 Senate Democrats to boycott session and refuse to come to the Senate Chamber today and do their jobs,&#x201D; Senator Skelos said. &#x201C;We have a lot of work that needs to be done; we have lost a week&#x2019;s time, but we are prepared to move ahead quickly.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>However, Democratic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164154/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/06/16/2009-06-16_judge_gives_albany_lawmakers_more_time_to_work_out_agreement.html">lawyer Andrew Celli explained</a>, &quot;The court simply ruled that it wasn&apos;t going to decide and it was going to leave it up to the Senate. We intend to appeal that. We think it was a proper constitutional matter.&quot;<p></p>
