<p>Here&apos;s something to brighten up your day&#x2014;or dare we say, &quot;sweeping the clouds away&quot;: An adorable version of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003020419/http://www.sesamestreet.org/">Sesame Street</a> theme song performed by Jimmy Fallon, The Roots and Big Bird, Snuffalupagus, Murray, Zoe, Count von Count, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Abby Cadabby and GROVER:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s Black Thought&apos;s rap in the middle of it (thank you to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003020419/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/jimmy-fallon-joins-sesame-street-gang-to-sing-shows-theme-song-on-classroom-instruments_n_3993133.html">HuffPo for the transcription</a>!):</p>

<blockquote>OK, you heard about, through word of mouth<br>
Big Bird is out, he&apos;s in the house<br>
He&apos;s turnin&apos; up, with Snuffleup<br>
They&apos;re really gettin&apos; their hustle up<br>
They stick together like Velcro<br>
There Grover go, there&apos;s Elmo<br>
And Cookie Monster there, look he likes<br> 
To take selfies with his cell phone<br>
They got a homegirl named Abby<br>
Her last name is Cadabby<br>
I showed her my report card<br>
She said, [Abby: Not too shabby!]<br>
They got all types of cool kids there<br>
It&apos;s lots of fun if you live there<br>
One thing I keep forgettin&apos; about Sesame Street...<br>
How do you get there?</blockquote>Fallon has been on Sesame Street numerous times&#x2014;he played a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003020419/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWAlOpF-ijU">Wild Nature Survival Guy</a> and once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003020419/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIRaxwQmOpg">discussed the word &quot;inspect&quot; with Elmo</a>.
