<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2012_01_scream3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130414im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_01_scream3.jpg" width="300" height="400"> <br> <i>The 1895 version by Edvard Munch</i></div> Today, the auction house Sotheby&apos;s announced that it would be sellin Edvard Munch&apos;s 1895 masterpiece, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130414/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream">The Scream</a>, as part of its Impressionist &amp;  Modern Art Evening Sale in New York on May 2. Sotheby&apos;s said in a statement,  &quot;The iconic work is one of the most instantly recognizable images  in both art history and popular culture, perhaps second only  to the Mona Lisa. The present version of The Scream, which dates from 1895, is one of four versions of the composition  and the only version still in private hands.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Simon Shaw, Sotheby&apos;s senior VP, said, &quot;Instantly recognizable, this is one  of very few images which transcends art  history and reaches a global consciousness.  The Scream arguably  embodies even greater power today than when it was conceived. At a time of great critical interest in the artist,  and with the 150th   anniversary of  his birth  in 2013,  this  spring  is  a particularly  compelling  time  for The Scream to appear on the market. For collectors and institutions, the opportunity to acquire such a singularly-influential <br>
masterpiece is unprecedented in recent times.&quot; He added, &quot;Given  how  rarely  true  icons  come  to  the  market  it  is  difficult  to  predict The Scream&#x2019;s value. The recent success of masterpieces at Sotheby&#x2019;s suggests that the price could exceed $80 million.&quot;</p>

<p>The work will go on display in New York for the first time ever on April 27 ahead of the sale.  The piece, which is one of two pastel versions (the other two are painted; the Guardian says this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130414/http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/feb/21/edvard-munch-the-scream-auction">one is the &quot;most vibrant&quot;</a>) is being sold by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen, whose father Thomas was a friend, neighbor and patron of Munch. Olsen said, &quot;I feel the moment has come to offer the rest of the world a chance to own and appreciate this remarkable work, which is the only version of  The Scream not in the collection of a Norwegian museum. My father Thomas Olsen was a friend of Munch, and acquired The Scream as well as many other works by the artist. He hoped  that his collection would further Munch&#x2019;s international  renown by lending to exhibitions abroad. In that tradition, proceeds from this sale will go toward the  establishment of a new museum, art centre and hotel on my farm Ramme Gaard at Hvitsten, Norway. It will open next year in connection with the Munch 150th anniversary, and will be dedicated to the artist&#x2019;s work and time there. We are restoring his house and studio, and guests can stay in his home.&quot;</p>
