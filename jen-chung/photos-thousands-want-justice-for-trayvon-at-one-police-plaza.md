</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, Sybrina Fulton spoke to New Yorkers about the killing of her son Trayvon Martin at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171435/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/20/beyonce_jay_z_join_trayvon_martins.php">&quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; vigil</a> outside One Police Plaza, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171435/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jay-z-beyonce-justice-trayvon-martin-vigil-manhattan-slain-teen-mother-article-1.1404385">telling them</a>, &quot;He was a child. Don&#x2019;t take my word for it. He had a drink and candy.&quot;</p>

<p>Her appearance comes a week after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171435/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/george_zimmerman_found_not_guilty_i.php#photo-1">acquittal of George Zimmerman</a>, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot her son last year. Trayvon, 17, had been returning to his father&apos;s girlfriend&apos;s home in Sanford, Florida after buying Skittles and iced tea when Zimmerman, who felt the teen was suspicious, decided to follow him, and eventually killed him.</p>

<p>Fulton continued to say, &quot;Trayvon was a child, and I think sometimes it gets lost in the shuffle, because as I sat in the courtroom, it made me think that they were talking about another man. And it wasn&#x2019;t. It was a child.&quot; Here are some of her remarks from before the vigil, &quot;Of course we&#x2019;re hurting. Of course we&#x2019;re shocked and disappointed, but that just means that we have to roll up our sleeves and continue to fight&quot;:</p>

<p>She also reminded, &quot;Today it was my son. Tomorrow it might be yours.&quot;</p>

<p>The Reverend Al Sharpton, who organized vigils across the country through his National Action Network, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171435/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/20/travyon-martin-protests">said</a>, &quot;Racial profiling is not as bad as segregation, but you don&apos;t know the humiliation of being followed in a department store,&quot; a nod to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171435/http://dcist.com/2013/07/video_obama_says_travyon_martin_cou.php">President Obama&apos;s remarks on Friday</a>. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171435/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/20/travyon-martin-protests">added</a>, &quot;I&apos;d never heard of Sanford. But I heard too many times of stories where people are killed and treated like they are worthless, and it was a sense of justice that we said that this man should not be let go.&quot; </p>

<p>Protesters made their way from One Police Plaza across the Brooklyn Bridge towards the Barclays Center, with motorists honking their horns and yelling their support. Sharpton also announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171435/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/demonstrations-across-the-country-commemorate-trayvon-martin.html">he would organize a protest</a> in Washington D.C. next month, &quot;to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous &apos;I Have a Dream&apos; speech.&quot;</p>
