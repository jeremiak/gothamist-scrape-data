<p>She wants to buy her parents a home!  Garvey and her family were kicked out of their home during the holidays when her teacher wanted to tell her she was a semi-finalist, Garvey and the family were in a homeless shelter.  Her story prompted Suffolk County officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118051818/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/homeless_teen_scholar_inspires_outp.php">to find a home for them</a> and Rep. Steve Israel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118051818/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/homeless_teen_scholar_invited_to_st.php">invited her to the President&apos;s State of the Union on Monday</a>.  Garvey told DeGeneres that thinking about succeeding and concentrating on science has been a way she&apos;s dealt with adversity.  And then the talk show host had a surprise:</p><blockquote>Ellen: I know you want to continue your education. You want to go to either Yale or Brown University. Well, we wanted to help you with that. So our friends at AT&amp;T; heard about your story and because of their commitment to the &#x201C;Aspire&#x201D; program to education. They want to help you achieve your dreams. So they are going to give you a $50,000 scholarship to go to the school of your choice.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118051818/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/tv-zone-1.811968/ellen-gives-samantha-garvey-50g-scholarship-but-1.3462707">Newsday&apos;s Verne Gay adds</a>, &quot;Samantha and family also got a $1,000 gift card to Whole Foods and $5,000 to J.C. Penney.&quot; Father Leo Garvey tears up in the video!<p></p>
