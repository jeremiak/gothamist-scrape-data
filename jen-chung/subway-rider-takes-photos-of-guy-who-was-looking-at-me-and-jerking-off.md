<p>A reader emailed us this morning with an account of what sounds like a horrible morning commute: While awaiting her train at 8:30 a.m. today, she says she saw a man pleasuring himself about 20 feet away.</p>

<blockquote>I was on the uptown R Platform at Whitehall Street and it was just me and this perv.  I was looking at my phone and looking to see if the train was coming, and I could just feel something wasn&apos;t right.  I look over and he&apos;s in the corner looking at me and jerking off. 
 
I get out my phone and take his photo.  Then a man and a woman are now with me on the subway platform, I take two more photos of him and say to the man and woman, &quot;this man just exposed himself to me, I took his photo, he&apos;s a pervert,&quot; then he approaches me and says, &quot;why you take my photo, what are you talking about, what did I do?&quot;  The man gets in between me and the perv and tells him to back off.  At this point the train has arrived and the lady says to me, &quot;get on the train.&quot;  The three of us get on the train and the perv stays on the platform.  Attached are the photos I took.</blockquote>The tipster says she&apos;s considering contacting the police, but we&apos;ve asked the NYPD what&apos;s best way to do that if a police officer isn&apos;t on the platform and if you&apos;re trying to get the hell away.  Of course, sometimes, even if you find a cop near the station, they&apos;ll tell you that you can&apos;t do anything <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150930214555/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/cops_man_groped_woman_at_union_squa.php#comment-352823170">because the pervert didn&apos;t even touch you</a>. And, back in 2005, a cop even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150930214555/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/24/saw_something_said_something.php">refused a photograph of a subway masturbator</a>, who was eventually caught because his photograph was publicized through the media.

<p>Even the police think subway perverts are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150930214555/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/11/the_subway_is_full_of_pervs.php">number 1 quality-of-life problem on the trains</a>.</p>
