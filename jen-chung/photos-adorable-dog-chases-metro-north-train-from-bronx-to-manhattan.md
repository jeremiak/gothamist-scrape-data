</div></div>					<p>A dog with a need for speed decided to &quot;race&quot; a Metro-North train yesterday. The train&apos;s engineer was amazed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411204829/http://nypost.com/2014/04/09/dog-races-and-chases-metro-north-train/">telling the Post</a>, &quot;She was just running like she didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411204829/http://nypost.com/2014/04/09/dog-races-and-chases-metro-north-train/">According to the Post</a>, the puppy started to chase the 10:38 train at the Mott Haven station at 149th Street in the Bronx. </p><blockquote>Running on a parallel track, she got past the lead car while the train was at a red signal, and found herself racing to keep ahead of it. Twice, she fell between the ties, and [engineer Joseph] Delia hit the brakes.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;The dog was in front of me, running in front,&#x201D; said Delia, an avid dog lover who alerted the rail command center and MTA Police. &#x201C;Oh, my God, I was going real slow.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Delia was worried she would hit the third rail.</p>

<p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s not a very big dog. I was worried she wouldn&#x2019;t make it and get electrocuted,&#x201D; he said.</p></blockquote>The conductor told passengers what was happening: &quot;[R]iders flocked to the front to see the courageous canine.&quot; When MTA police officers picked up the dog at the 125th Street station in Harlem, passengers cheered. <p></p>

<p>The dog has been named &quot;Tie&quot;&#x2014;for the railroad ties she crossed&#x2014;and will be reunited with the MTA police officers who found her at an event at Animal Care &amp; Control this morning. AC&amp;C; will work to find her owners and if they can&apos;t, they&apos;ll find a home for her. </p>
