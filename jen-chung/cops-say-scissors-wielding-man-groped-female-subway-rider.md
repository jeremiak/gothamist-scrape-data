<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at the Ralph Avenue subway station on June 7, at 4:40 a.m. Police say a 23-year-old woman was walking into the station when a man grabbed her and tried to remove her shirt&#x2014;while threatening her with a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>The victim struggled and screamed, which apparently scared off the suspect who then fled from the station. She was not injured. </p>

<p>Police release surveillance stills of the suspect, who is described as being around 25 years old, 5&apos;7&quot; tall and 130 pounds, wearing a pink shirt, gray slacks and black shoes.<br>
