</div></div>					<p>Two people involved in an apparent dog fighting operation were arrested by the NYPD earlier this week. Also, nearly two dozen &quot;emaciated and scarred&quot; pit-bulls were found in their residence. </p>

<p>According to police, on Thursday, July 31st around 3 p.m., members of the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015147/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/29/aspca_reviews_three_times_as_many_a.php#photo-1">NYPD Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad</a> and 113th Precinct Anti-Crime Team executed a search warrant inside of 117-30 196th Street in connection with an investigation into dog fighting inside of the location. They found the 20 pit bulls, who were immediately removed and taken to the ASPCA for medical care. </p>

<p>The police, assisted by the ASPCA Forensic Investigative Team, have charged two suspects, Addison Holder, 44, and Keisha Hall, 33, with Animal Cruelty, Animal Fighting and Criminal Possession of Controlled Substance (Methamphetamine).</p>
