One is to use a system of warning lights (sort of like traffic lights) that will change color to let pilots know when runways can cross--the near hits at JFK occurred on its perpendicular runways--and will be installed at JFK and LaGuardia.  The FAA is also offering a $100K salary incentive for veterans air traffic controllers to work at NYC-area airports.</p>
