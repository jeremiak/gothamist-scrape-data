<p>While Conde Nast will be moving from Times Square for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030643/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/its_official_conde_nast_will_move_t.php">a million square feet</a>, they might be the only private tenants (not including the government) for a while. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030643/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303903304579586270070420060?mod=rss_newyork_main&amp;mg=reno64-wsj">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;The owners of the tallest tower at the World Trade Center are cutting office rents just months before it opens because of slow leasing activity. <strong>No private office tenant has signed a lease at One World Trade Center in nearly three years.</strong> The 3.1-million-square-foot skyscraper, formerly named the Freedom Tower, is 55% leased.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, The Post&apos;s Steve Cuozzo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030643/http://nypost.com/2014/05/12/office-glut-fears-dim-in-dynamic-downtown/">wrote about the downtown real estate market</a>, &quot;[L]eases being negotiated with at least two unidentified tenants would considerably reduce current 45 percent availability at the Port Authority and Douglas Durst&#x2019;s 3 million-square-foot 1 World Trade Center, future home of Cond&#xE9; Nast.&quot; But we guess that&apos;s not the case, since developer Douglas Durst told the WSJ, &quot;The market&apos;s not there... When we started in 2011, everybody expected the economy to take off, and obviously that hasn&apos;t happened.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, actually, other downtown buildings are offering rent in the mid-$50/square foot, which Durst says is problematic, since the 1 WTC rents are higher. Hence dropping rents for middle floors from $75/square foot to $69/square foot. He added, &quot;We have a lot of people looking at the space, but because of the asking rent, we are not able to really put anything over the finish line.&quot; </p>

<p>As for its potential as a terrorist target, the WSJ reports, &quot;Mr. Durst said he doesn&apos;t believe safety concerns are an issue. &apos;We really have not seen that,&apos; he said, calling it &apos;the safest building in the U.S.&apos;&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030643/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/video_watch_wtc_base_jumpers_dive_o.php#photo-1">excellent for BASE jumping</a>.</p>
