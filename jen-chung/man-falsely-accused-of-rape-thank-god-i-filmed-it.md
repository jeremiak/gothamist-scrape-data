While Arvin Rivera, an 18-year-old senior at Harry S. Truman HS in The Bronx, was not arrested, he tells the paper, &quot;<strong>I was so afraid. Words cannot even begin to describe how I was feeling inside. Thank God I was there. And thank God I filmed it.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Rivera&apos;s cousin Stalin Felipe, 19, was arrested, along with three other men, after Hostra freshman Danmell Ndonye made up a harrowing story about being tied up and gang raped in a Hofstra dorm bathroom stall.  Felipe, who is also on the Post&apos;s cover, said, &quot;Anytime anyone Googles my name, rape is going to be right there beside it. My name is forever tarnished. What if I am applying for a job or whatever in the future? I feel like I am always going to have to offer some explanation... We went to Hofstra just to have some fun, and it turned out to be a nightmare. Cops were telling us, &apos;<strong>You are going to rot in jail.</strong>&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The aunt of falsely accused Kevin Taveras told the Post that when Ndonye was split up from her boyfriend at an on-campus party, she and her nephew &quot;started making out, and she said to him, &apos;Do you want to come back to my dorm?&apos; <strong>He said, &apos;I have friends here with me,&apos; and she said, &apos;Bring &apos;em along. It&apos;ll be hot.&apos;</strong> It started from there. The point is she knew what she was doing... Stalin said to her, &apos;Are you sure about this?&apos; She said, &apos;Yeah, sure, I want to.&apos;&quot;  </p>
