<p>A 28-year-old man is dead after an encounter with the police early this morning in Queens. According to the NYPD he had been threatening his mother with a screwdriver and, after struggling with the police, who initially used a Taser to try to subdue him, he was shot and killed by two cops.</p>

<p>NYPD Chief of Patrol Terence Monahan said that the officers from the 113th Precinct responded to a 911 call about a &quot;a woman screaming near 137-64 Westgate Street.&quot; The cops, who were in uniform, heard the screams from the rear of the house,  and found &quot;a male suspect holding a female with a screwdriver, threatening her, in a small stairwell leading to the rear basement apartment.&quot; According to Monahan: </p><blockquote>Officers ordered the suspect to drop the weapon. The suspect refused. The officers attempted to disarm the suspect and were able to free the female during the struggle. During that struggle, officers deployed a taser. The taser did not strike the suspect. The struggle continued to ensue with the suspect who was still armed with a weapon. During the struggle, two officers discharge one round each striking the suspect. The suspect was transported to Jamaica Hospital where he was later pronounced deceased.  </blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014905/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/cops-fatally-shoot-man-attack-mother-queens-article-1.2946338">The Daily News reports</a> that Monahan also said that a witness &quot;heard the mother repeatedly yelling &apos;he&apos;s going to kill me.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>The police released an image of the screwdriver. </p>
