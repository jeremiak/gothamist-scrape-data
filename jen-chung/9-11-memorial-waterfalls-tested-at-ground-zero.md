</div></div>					<p>The waterfalls at the National 9/11 Memorial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013345/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/05/13/water-flows-at-the-sept-11th-memorial/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=WSJ_NY_NY_Blog">were tested yesterday</a>, as work continues in preparation for the Memorial&apos;s opening on September 11, 2011.  </p>

<p>The memorial, &quot;Reflecting Absence,&quot; based on architect Michael Arad design and revised by Arad and landscape designer Peter Walker, features two pools in the footprints of the WTC&apos;s towers, with waterfalls cascading down their sides.  Around the pools, engraved in bronze, are the names of the nearly 3,000 victims of the 9/11 attacks, as well as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing at the North Tower.  The National 9/11 Memorial and Museum also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013345/http://names.911memorial.org/">recently released the placement of names on the Memorial</a>.  </p>

<p>Arad&apos;s design <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013345/http://gothamist.com/2004/01/07/wtc_memorial_design_selected.php">was selected in January 2004</a>; he told us in 2009, &quot;It&apos;s definitely not a sprint, it&apos;s a marathon, so we had to be very dedicated to the project and persevere with a lot of difficulties. I&apos;m happy with where we are today, and it&apos;s in no small part due to the leadership of Mayor Bloomberg, who took control of the project and pushed us along and made it possible for us to be as far along as we are now.&quot;</p>
