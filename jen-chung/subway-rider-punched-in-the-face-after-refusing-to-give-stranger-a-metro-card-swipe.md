<p>The NYPD is hoping the public can help them identify a man accused of attacking a person at a Brooklyn subway station last week. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2015_10_metrocardswipe.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301155515im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_metrocardswipe.jpg" width="315" height="240" class="image-right"> </span>According the police, the incident occurred at 5 a.m. at the 8th Avenue subway station along the N line. Police say the victim was entering the station when the man asked to be &quot;swiped in.&quot; The victim tried to steer clear of the suspect by walking to a different turnstile, but the suspect punched him in the face and ran away. The victim refused medical attention.<br>
 <br>
The police released images of the suspect, describing him as being in his 30s, 6&apos;2&quot; and 180 pounds, with &quot;long dread lock hair and a dark complexion.&quot;</p>
