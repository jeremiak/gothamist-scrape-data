<p>According to the NYPD, last Friday, June 6, at around 4:20 a.m., a 30-year-old woman was walking near Greenwich and Horatio Streets when a man approached her. Then, police say, he grabbed her and sexually assaulted her before fleeing. The victim was taken to a hospital where she was treated and released.</p>

<p>The police say the suspect is &quot;a 25 to 35-year-old white male, 5&apos;6&quot; to 5&apos;7&quot; tall, weighing 135 to 145 pounds wearing a black blazer, black dress pants, black shoes and a light colored dress shirt.&quot; However, the surveillance image seems to suggest the suspect was wearing a teal blazer. <b>Update</b>: A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140615154946/https://twitter.com/inForm_meGB/status/477431867873193984">reader pointed out</a> that the blazer may be turned inside out, with the teal being the lining. <br>
