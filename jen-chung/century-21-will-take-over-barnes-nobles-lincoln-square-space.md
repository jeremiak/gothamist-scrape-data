<p>The hunch about Barnes and Noble&apos;s Lincoln Square location at West 66th Street and Broadway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728042036/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/barnes_and_noble.php">succumbing to the neighborhood&apos;s &quot;fashion corridor&quot; status</a> was right: Discount retailer Century 21 confirmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728042036/http://ny.racked.com/archives/2010/08/31/barnes_noble_lincoln_center_to_be_replaced_by_century_21.php">the rumor</a> that it will take over the 60,000 square foot space.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728042036/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20100901/REAL_ESTATE/100909979?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+crainsnewyork%2Flatestnews+(Crain&apos;s+New+York+Business+-+Breaking+News+Feed)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">According to Crain&apos;s NY</a>, Century 21&apos;s uptown store (it&apos;s other Manhattan location is across from the World Trade Center site) would open in the fall of next year.  Barnes &amp; Noble said that rents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728042036/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/barnes_and_nobles_closing_lincoln_c.php">were too high for it to stay</a> and it would close its door in January 2011  The building&apos;s owner,  Millennium Partners, said, &quot;We have been searching for a tenant who has the ability to drive a large volume of shoppers to the area. We believe that having Century 21 as an anchor in Lincoln Square will help drive a level of pedestrian traffic that our other retail tenants will benefit from.&quot; It&apos;ll be interesting to see if Century 21 will be as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728042036/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/barnes_and_noble.php">&quot;community-minded&quot;</a> as Barnes and Noble as been.</p>

<p>There are a number of clothing retailers, both boutique and chain, in the neighborhood: There&apos;s Banana Republic next door, Gap a block away, Zara across the street, Burberry Brit around the corner&#x2014;not to mention Lucky Brand, Reiss, Theory, Wink, Olive &amp; Bette&apos;s and more. Plus, there are big discount retailers: Seven blocks north, there&apos;s a Loehmann&apos;s in the Ansonia Building (between 73rd an 74th Streets), and at Broadway and West 79th Street, there&apos;s a Filene&apos;s Basement.  </p>
