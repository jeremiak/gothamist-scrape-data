I had nothing to do with this murder. I didn&apos;t kill anybody.</strong>&quot;  Borukhova was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725171408/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/10/queens_woman_found_guilty_of_killin.php">found guilty</a> of killing dentist Daniel Malakov (pictured, far right) last month. A jury believed she conspired to have her cousin by marriage kill Malakov so she could regain custody of their daughter.
