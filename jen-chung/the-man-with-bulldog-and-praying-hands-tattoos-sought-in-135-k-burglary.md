<p>The police are hoping the public can help them spot a man with some unusual tattoos who is wanted in connection to a burglary in Brooklyn back in August.</p>

<p>The police say that on Saturday, August 31, at 9:30 p.m., a man entered a home at Avenue Z and East 27th Street by breaking a back window. Then the suspect removed an iPhone and several pieces of jewelry and watches&#x2014;the items are worth about $135,000. </p>

<p>However, the suspect didn&apos;t realize there was a camera taping him. The surveillance footage captured him <strike>smoking</strike> with a flashlight in his mouth, plus his tattoos, including a bulldog tattoo on his right shoulder and a praying hands tattoo on his right forearm. Finally, he realizes there might be a camera and pushes it away.</p>
