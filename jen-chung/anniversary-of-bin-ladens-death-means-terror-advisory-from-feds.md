<p>Move over, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002901/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/may_day_flashback_why_union_square.php#photo-1">Occupy May Day actions</a>, there&apos;s actually a federal advisory about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002901/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/president_obama_about_to_make_annou.php">May 1st anniversary of Osama bin Laden&apos;s death</a>. Newsday reports, &quot;The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Northern Command issued an internal intelligence bulletin late Wednesday stating terrorists would consider an attack on the May 1 anniversary as &apos;a symbolic victory.&apos;&quot;  </p>

<p>Rep. Peter King (R-NY) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002901/http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/king-no-specific-terror-threat-vigilance-urged-1.3683439">told Newsday</a> that &quot;There are no specific threats&quot; against NYC but we shouldn&apos;t be &quot;cavalier.&quot; (In other words, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002901/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/left-wing_rumor_mongers.php#photo-1">screw civil liberties and profile away</a>.) King added, &quot;There might be more [potential threats] over the next few weeks... It could be any of these groups&quot; as well as &quot;lone wolf acts... What it amounts to is that we should stay alert.&quot;  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002901/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BIN_LADEN_WARNING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">AP got a hold of the bulletin and reports</a>:</p><blockquote>[Feds are] concerned about violence from al-Qaida&apos;s affiliate in Yemen because of increased intelligence chatter in the past six months, The Associated Press has learned.<p></p>

<p>The Yemen group, known as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, has been a persistent concern since 2009, when one of its adherents nearly brought down a jetliner over Detroit on Christmas. In the past six months, counterterrorism officials have seen what they consider an increase in intelligence about potential threats from the group, according to an intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.</p>

<p>Officials are worried that the terror group &quot;intends to advance plots along multiple fronts, including renewed efforts to target Western aviation,&quot; according to a joint intelligence bulletin circulated Wednesday from U.S. Northern Command, the FBI and Homeland Security Department. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the bulletin.</p></blockquote>And NYPD spokesman Paul Browne says, &quot;There&apos;s no known specific threat to the city because of the anniversary, but the NYPD continues to maintain a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002901/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/18/nypd_spied_on_muslims_at_yale_sent.php">robust counterterrorism posture</a> regardless of anniversaries because of past and repeated interest demonstrated by terrorists in returning here to kill New Yorkers.&quot; <p></p>
