But while you celebrate, please remain vigilant also, because a reader tells us he was attacked on the 2/3 from Christopher Street late yesterday afternoon, after volunteering at a pride event:</p><blockquote> &quot;The guy kept asking us to move because he didn&apos;t like us and that we made him sick. There was no place else for us to go. He started hitting me and then his girlfriend started clawing me with her nails...<strong>I took a cab to St. Vincents, filed a police report and got two black eyes, 7 stitches, multiple chipped teeth, broken glasses.</strong>&quot;</blockquote>He suggests people be careful, perhaps travel in groups on the subway, because he doesn&apos;t think the police caught his attackers yet.  <p></p>
