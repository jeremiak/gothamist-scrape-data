<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151629/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/kazakh_columbia_con_job_Rzm2pW72MO90nyHRMCyctL?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">According to the Post</a>, Bolat Nazarbayev married Daniyar Nazarbayev&apos;s mother Maira in 2001. Maira Nazarbayev apparently decided to change her son&apos;s last name from Kesikbayev to Nazarbayev (because it&apos;s handy to have the same last name as the president).  However, her marriage was annulled last year and the lawsuit also names her: Bolat Nazarbayev &quot;has accused them of taking advantage of his trust to swipe the Plaza pad and help themselves to two other multimillion-dollar apartments on Wall Street. Bolat says he has discovered that Maira has had several aliases &#x2014; and that she&#x2019;s wanted by Interpol and Kazakh authorities for crimes including kidnapping and extortion.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, sources say that Daniyar Nazarbayev, who graduated from Columbia in 2010, never graduated from high school.  Well, for someone who never graduated high school, he and his mother allegedly had a great grift: The court papers say that Bolat Nazarbayev wanted to buy an apartment in NYC, so the mother and son got him to give them power of attorney: &quot;Daniyar was supposed to put the apartment in his stepdad&#x2019;s name but added his mom&#x2019;s. About eight months later, she sold it to Daniyar for $1, court papers say.&quot; </p>

<p>Daniyar Nazarbayev is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151629/http://keehuachee.blogspot.com/2011/06/datuk-douglas-cheng-married-charlene.html">supposedly engaged</a> to the daughter of Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. It&apos;s believed he&apos;s in hiding in Malaysia.</p>
