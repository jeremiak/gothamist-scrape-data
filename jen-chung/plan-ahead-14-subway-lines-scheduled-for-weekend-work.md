The MTA explains, &quot;Because of capital construction work on the NYC Transit subway system, the following changes will be in place over the weekend.  This work is part of NYC Transit&#x2019;s ongoing $11.2 billion Capital Rebuilding Program aimed at upgrading and maintaining our tracks, stations and signal systems in order to continue to provide our customers with safe and reliable service.&quot;  The work affects the 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, A, C, D, F, G, J, Q, and S (the Rockaway Park shuttle) this weekend.
