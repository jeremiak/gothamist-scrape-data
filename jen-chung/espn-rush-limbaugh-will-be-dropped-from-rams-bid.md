<p>Further, &quot;Dave Checketts, chairman of the NHL&apos;s St. Louis Blues and the point man in the Limbaugh group attempting to buy the Rams, realizes he must remove the controversial conservative radio host from his potential role as a minority member in the group in order to get approval from other NFL owners, the sources said.&quot;  (Twenty-eight of the league&apos;s 32 owners would have support Checketts&apos; bid.) </p>

<p>However, Limbaugh said on his radio show today, &quot;I&apos;m not even thinking of exiting. I&apos;m not even thinking of caving. I am not a caver. None of us are. We have been betrayed by too many who have caved. Pioneers take the arrows. We are pioneers. It&apos;s a sad thing but our country over 200 years old now needs pioneers all over again, but we do.&quot;</p>

<p>A few people have come out against Limbaugh&apos;s inclusion in the bid, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923170224/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/12/sharpton_doesnt_want_limbaugh_invol.php">Sharpton</a> to Indianapolis Colts owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923170224/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/14/AR2009101400268.html">Jim Irsay</a>.  Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923170224/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/2009/10/13/2009-10-13_nfl_commissioner_roger_goodell.html">said of Limbaugh&apos;s past divisive comments</a>, &quot;I think divisive comments are not what the NFL is all about. I would not want to see those kind of comments from people who are in a responsible position within the NFL. No. Absolutely not.&quot;</p>
