<p>A Jewish man and two Jewish teenagers were pelted with eggs on Friday night and early Saturday&#x2014;and now the cops are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406053009/http://abc7ny.com/news/police-search-for-suspects-who-threw-eggs-at-jewish-men-in-brooklyn/1086273/">probing the incidents</a> as a hate crime.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406053009/http://jpupdates.com/2015/11/14/nypd-eggs-thrown-shabbos-on-two-jewish-teens-in-borough-park/">According to JP Updates</a>, &quot;[T]he first incident occurred at 1:55 a.m. when a 23-year-old man walking at Fort Hamilton Parkway and 49th street was approached by a group of 4-6 males who proceeded to throw eggs at him.  The second incident happened a few minutes later when two teens, aged 17 and 14, were walking at the intersection of 13th Avenue and 46th Street and a group of 4-6 males threw eggs at the boys and then stated, &apos;F&#x2026;n Jews&apos; and then also threatened &apos;we will shoot and kill you Jews&apos;.  The group then fled the scene in a Silver BMW.&quot;</p>

<p>The teens apparently got the license plate number of the car.</p>
