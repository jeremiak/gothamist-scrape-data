<p>The incident occurred last week, on February 28th, around 1:10 a.m. at the Park Avenue hotel. According to the NYPD, a man &quot;removed the dedication plaque for the Waldorf Astoria Clock in the location&apos;s lobby.&quot; Investigators say he was in the company of two women, and the group left the scene after hailing a taxi.  </p>
