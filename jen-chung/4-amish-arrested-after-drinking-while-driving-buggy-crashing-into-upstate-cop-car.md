<p>The bucolic town of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313152135/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ix=sea&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1077&amp;bih=582&amp;q=sherman+new+york&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x882d59b8e3dff331:0xed8af8634bed9240,Sherman,+NY&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=0T5eT-z4LaHl0QGSnLy5Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEcQ8gEwAg">Sherman, New York</a> was shattered by a collision between a county police car and... an Amish buggy carrying four people.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313152135/http://www.post-journal.com/page/content.detail/id/600490/Four-Charged-Following-Amish-Bug---.html">According to the Post-Journal</a>, Chautauqua County Police &quot;were responding to a report of an underage drinking party on Heslink Hollow Road and en route to the location, deputies encountered several Amish buggies traveling north and taking up both lanes of traffic on Clymer Hill Road.&quot; Buggies gone wild!</p>

<p>The Post-Journal continues, &quot;When a buggy in the southbound lane moved into the northbound lane, a second buggy moved from the northbound lane into the southbound lane occupied by the Sheriff&apos;s patrol car. The buggy and the vehicle collided causing the buggy to flip onto its side and a horse to become disconnected from the buggy.&quot; </p>

<p>The flipped buggy&apos;s driver, Marty Troyer, 20, admitted that the party had been at his house. His buggy had two passengers, one of whom had a minor injury, while the other&apos;s buggy&apos;s driver was uninjured.  Alcoholic beverages were found in both buggies and all four individuals&#x2014;ages 18 to 20&#x2014;were found to be drinking alcohol, so they were hit with underage possession of alcohol.  Rumspringa?</p>

<p>Oh, and the horse that was disconnected from the buggy was found in a neighboring barn.</p>
