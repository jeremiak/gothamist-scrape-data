Her doctor confirmed the births of baby boy Knox Leon (5.03 pounds) and baby girl Vivienne Marcheline (5 pounds), saying, &quot;The babies are doing well&quot; and that the Cesarean section &quot;went just perfectly...The mother and father are very, very happy.&quot;  The paparazzi have been camped outside the Lenval Hospital, and one celebrity photo agency owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172446/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jFviF_M-cyaEmEjcTAdpcKxnCY3AD91T075G0">told the AP</a> photos of the fifth and sixth Jolie-Pitt children could go for between $15 and $20 million and the only thing that &quot;would possibly come that close is <strong>Britney Spears giving birth to an alien</strong>.&quot;</p>
