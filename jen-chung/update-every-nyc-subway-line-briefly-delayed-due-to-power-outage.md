<p>Ruh-roh: The MTA just announced for all NYC subways, &quot;Due to a temporary power loss system wide, expect delays on all lines. Allow additional travel time.&quot; <b>Update 10:30 a.m.</b>: Everything is back to normal(ish)! See update below.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The power is back! The MTA said that around 9:35 a.m., Con Ed lost two high tension power feeders, which then caused a power outage to the whole city. Power was restored by 9:41 a.m. </p>

<p>We&apos;re inquiring With Con Ed about where the feeders were located.</p>

<p><b>Update 11 a.m.</b>: Con Ed spokesperson  Sidney Alvarez said the power feeders (which are not &quot;high tension&quot; power feeders) run from Westchester through the Bronx and into Manhattan. It&apos;s unclear where the exact issue was, as Con Ed is currently investigating. Alvarez also explained that &quot;it wasn&apos;t a power outage or a power failure&#x2014;it was a system voltage dip.&quot; Con Ed never lost actual power. </p>
