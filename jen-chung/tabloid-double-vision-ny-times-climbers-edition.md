<p>The Post and Daily News gleefully put the old Gray Lady on their covers with the same headline--&quot;The New York Climbs&quot;--in the Times&apos; headline font.  The NY Times tucks mention of the pair of unrelated climbers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120181210/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/breaking_someon.php">Alain Robert</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120181210/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/encore_ny_times.php">Ray Clark</a>, who scaled its building to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120181210/http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html">bottom of the front page</a>.  </p>

<p>A year ago, the Post and Daily News didn&apos;t use the same headlines, but they did use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120181210/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/29/attack_of_tablo.php">same cover and back cover images</a>.</p>
