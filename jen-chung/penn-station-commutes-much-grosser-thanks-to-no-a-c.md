<p>Everyone complains about Penn Station: From its looks (RIP, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144045/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/flashback_madison_square_garden.php#photo-2">old Penn Station</a>) to its &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144045/http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-york-penn-station-new-york#hrid:k1T4MqaiYZ6BU04b5HsSpg">stuffy, urine-scented atmosphere</a>.&quot; Making things worse: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144045/http://www.njtransit.com/sa/sa_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TravelAlertsTo&amp;rel=Rail&amp;selLine=NEC">air-conditioning is broken</a>, making many commuters&apos; trek to and from work more harrowing than usual!</p>

<p>The problem started yesterday, and it was so oppressive for NJ Transit travelers that the transit agency allowed them to use PATH service.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144045/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/nj_transit_to_offer_path_train.html">spokesman told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;Temperatures have eclipsed 90 degrees in New York Penn, and certain portions are even warmer... This is a precautionary, yet proactive, measure to safeguard the interests of our customers.&quot;</p>

<p>The A.C. is still out&#x2014;Amtrak is supposedly fixing it, so NJ Transit is continuing to allow riders to use PATH&#x2014;but as one customer put it, &quot;It&apos;s two billion degrees. Why do that when I have a Plan B?&quot;  If only they could somehow funnel some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144045/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/open_door_air_conditioning.php">cool, sweet chain-store air from Soho</a>.</p>
