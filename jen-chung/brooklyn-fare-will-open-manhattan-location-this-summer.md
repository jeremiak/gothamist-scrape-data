The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165853/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204781804577271824117569112.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal reports</a>  owner Moe Issa &quot;has signed a lease for a space on 39th Street between Ninth and 10th avenues and aims to open by June or July.&quot;</p>

<p>Issa says that brokers have been trying to tempt him with spaces in Manhattan, &quot;People keep on calling and they keep offering things. I thought it was the right thing. I love the space and I love the view from the back.&quot;  The space, which is 11,000 square feet, will have an outdoor terrace plus 7,000 square feet in the basement.  According to the WSJ, &quot;The majority of space will be a grocery store. The 60-seat restaurant will be &#xE0; la carte, feature small plates and have a no-reservation policy.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165853/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/28/cesar_ramirez_c.php">Chef Cesar Ramirez</a> will split his time between the locations.  &quot;We&apos;re going to have seafood. We&apos;re going to have a lot. It will be a little bigger menu than we have now,&quot; revealed Issa. There will be a chef&apos;s table, but it&apos;ll be 0 seats with fewer courses than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165853/http://www.brooklynfare.com/chefs-table/">20+ offered in Brooklyn</a>.  The Brooklyn Chef&apos;s Table costs $225, but the Manhattan prices are not worked out yet.<br>
