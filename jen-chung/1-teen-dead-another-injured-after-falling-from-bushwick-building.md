<p>A 13-year-old boy is dead and another teenager is critically injured after they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327214357/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/boy-15-plunges-death-jumping-brooklyn-rooftops-article-1.3008548">fell 40</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327214357/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/24/bushwick-teens-fall/">50 feet</a> from a Brooklyn rooftop on Friday. It&apos;s believed they were trying to jump from building to building.</p>

<p>The Daily News reports that the teens &quot;tried to leap the 7-foot gap between two buildings.&quot;</p>

<p>Officers arrived at 57 Grove Street in Bushwick around 5:30 p.m. on March 24, and found the two teen boys behind the building. The 13-year-old was unconscious and unresponsive with &quot;severe head and body trauma&quot; while a 15-year-old was found with injuries to his pelvis. &quot;One witness said it appeared the 15-year-old boy landed on top of the younger one,&quot; according to the Daily News.</p>

<p>The 13-year-old was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital while the older boy is in critical condition there.</p>

<p>Neighbors say that teens, who don&apos;t even live in the building, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327214357/http://pix11.com/2017/03/24/2-teens-in-critical-condition-after-falling-3-stories-from-brooklyn-building/">find ways to access to the roof</a>, allegedly throwing parties. </p>

I was talking to my roommate and out of nowhere just loud thuds. No screams, no conversations, no loud voices. Just thuds. Just the impacts.&quot;</p>
