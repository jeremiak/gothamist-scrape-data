<p>While the scenes at the opening of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142920/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/29/uplifting_photos_of_happy_gamblers.php#photo-1">new Resorts World racino in Queens</a> may seem depressing to some, having people throw away their hard-earned money has one upside: More aid for schools!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142920/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/slot_more_state_school_aid_from_CsBDkcpfzWfW1YSl0yeOWJ">According to the Post</a>, &quot;New York&#x2019;s nine &apos;racinos&apos; generated $667 million in aid for schools last year &#x2014; an increase of 28 percent.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the Resorts World at the Aqueduct generated $100 million in its first five months while the &quot;Yonkers Raceway&#x2019;s Empire City racino generated $315 million for education during the 2011-12 fiscal year that ended on March 31.&quot;  All racinos must &quot;dedicate nearly half of the &#x201C;net win&#x201D; to the New York Lottery Division to fund schools. In addition, racino revenues also help finance the horse-racing industry and assist local governments.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142920/http://www.newyorkgaming.org/Home.aspx">New York Gaming Association</a> president James Featherstonhaugh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142920/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/racino-revenues-jump-30-percent-previous-year-article-1.1058925">said to the Daily News</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think (legalizing casinos) will be easy under any circumstance, but the revenue numbers support everything we&#x2019;ve been saying about the industry and about our projections.&quot; And a spokesman for Genting, which operates Resorts World, said, &quot;New York has been losing billions in revenue to other states until now.&quot; Well, we&apos;re still not getting one in Manhattan (as long as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142920/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/16/legal_gambling_or_no_manhattan_casi.php">Assembly Speaker Silver has his formidable way</a>).</p>
