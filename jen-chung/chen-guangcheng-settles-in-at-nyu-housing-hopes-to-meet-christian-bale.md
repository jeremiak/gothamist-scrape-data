<p>Yesterday was blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng&apos;s first day in New York City.  Chen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/chinese_dissident_arrives_in_nyc_i.php">arrived on Saturday</a>, after seven years of abuse from Chinese officials, a daring escape and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/03/blind_chinese_dissident_now_wants_t.php">sudden uncertainty over</a> whether he and his family would be able to leave.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/21/chen-guangcheng-s-new-life-in-america-a-day-in-greenwich-village.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29">According to The Daily Beast</a>, he &quot;relaxed in an outdoor playground with his family Sunday, basking in perfect spring weather&#x2014;and not having to worry about being beaten or harassed for the first time in years.&quot;</p>

<p>Chen, his wife, their 10-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter are now living at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/explore-the-residencehalls/Washington-Square-Village.html">Washington Square Village</a>, NYU&apos;s graduate housing. Chen, a self-taught lawyer who advocated for the poor and women (he exposed family planning corruption), was given a fellowship to study law at NYU Law School, and he and his family were given one apartment at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://nyunews.com/2010/02/18/19wsv/">ideally located (but expensive)</a> graduate residence hall. However, probably unlike other grad students, Chen has another apartment&#x2014;for his security.  Time finds it&apos;s ironic that Chen is living at WSV, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2012/05/20/chen-guangchengs-new-york-home-a-soviet-style-complex-in-greenwich-village/">since it&apos;s so &quot;Stalinist&quot; in its design</a>.</p>

<p>According to the Daily Beast:</p><blockquote>A TV-satellite truck has materialized outside Chen&#x2019;s apartment block, which has also been staked out by reporters and photographers who scrambled when he appeared in the playground. (&#x201C;It&#x2019;s exciting. I&#x2019;ve never heard so many police sirens as I did last night,&#x201D; said one of Chen&#x2019;s new neighbors about his arrival in the building.) But Chen didn&#x2019;t want to grant media interviews on their first day in America. He and his wife are especially concerned about protecting the privacy of their 10-year-old son, Chen Kerui&#x2014;who&#x2019;d lived separately from his parents for several years so his father&#x2019;s imprisonment and harassment wouldn&#x2019;t disrupt his schooling&#x2014;and their vivacious 6-year-old daughter, Chen Kesi, who succumbed to her jet lag by early evening. &#x201C;She was fast asleep on the couch when I first arrived,&#x201D; said one visitor, &#x201C;but then she woke up and greeted me full of giggles.&#x201D;</blockquote>Other challenges Chen (and his family) have include learning English, maneuvering around&#x2014;his left foot was broken during his escape&#x2014;and figuring out how to keep up his campaigns in China from the other side of the world. Also, Chen&apos;s other relatives, like his mother, are still in China and his nephew has been targeted by the government.<p></p>

<p>Aside from his future studies, Chen does look forward to when he can meet movie star Christian Bale.  Bale was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://shanghaiist.com/2011/12/16/watch_batman_star_christian_bale_ro.php">roughed up by Chinese authorities when he attempted to see Chen,</a> who was under house arrest, last December. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190322/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/christian_visit_activist_chen_hope_zElvTSbmbWxvWWE2HCh8hJ">Bale told CNN</a>, &quot;Please shake Chen&apos;s hand, and give him and his family a hug from me upon their arrival in the US. They must be overwhelmed with relief at being ... safe. I would love to meet with Chen when he has the time.&quot;<br>
