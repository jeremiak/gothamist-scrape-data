<p>The second night of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060939/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/seinfeld_residency_beacon.php">Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s Beacon Theatre residency</a> kicked off with a big surprise last night, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060939/http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/steve-martin-performed-stand-up-last-night.html?mid=full-rss-vulture">announcer declaring,</a> &quot;Good evening, New York City, and welcome to the 2016 Jerry Seinfeld show, please welcome Jerry&apos;s very special guest ... Mr. Steve Martin.&quot;</p>

<p>Vulture&apos;s Jesse David Fox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060939/http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/steve-martin-performed-stand-up-last-night.html?mid=full-rss-vulture">recounted the experience</a>, saying he thought the opener would be Seinfeld&apos;s good friend Tom Papa or maybe Paul Simon after seeing the guitar mic:</p><blockquote>I lost all of my shit. This was a very special guest. In 1981, Steve Martin was the biggest stand-up in the country. He was arguably the biggest stand-up ever up until that point, regularly selling out amphitheaters when other top names were still playing clubs. And then he just stopped. He played a show and, after the show, decided not to do stand-up anymore. &quot;My act was conceptual. Once the concept was stated, and everybody understood it, it was done,&quot; Martin wrote in his classic 2007 memoir <em>Born Standing Up</em>. &quot;It was about coming to the end of the road. There was no way to live on in that persona. I had to take that fabulous luck of not being remembered as that, exclusively. You know, I didn&apos;t announce that I was stopping. I just stopped.&quot; It would be like if, 25 years from now, you realized that Kevin Hart&apos;s last tour &#x2014; the one that sold out basketball arenas across the country &#x2014; was really the last tour. It&apos;s the story of legends, one frequently discussed among comedians. He just stopped.</blockquote>Martin told the audience, &quot;Thank you. Jerry couldn&apos;t make it tonight... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060939/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/steve-martin-if-you-see-this-on-a-toilet-seat-dont-sit-down">Have a safe ride home!</a> Actually, I&apos;m here tonight because of that old showbiz saying: Never lose a bet to Jerry.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Martin did bring his trusty banjo, and when he began strumming Seinfeld came out with an open banjo case and declared, &quot;Okay, wrap it up.&quot;</p>
