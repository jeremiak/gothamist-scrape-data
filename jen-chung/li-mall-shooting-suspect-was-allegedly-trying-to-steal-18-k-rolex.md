<p>The man accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505004310/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/22/shooting_at_roosevelt_mall.php">shooting a worker</a> at the Roosevelt Field mall on Tuesday is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505004310/http://abc7ny.com/news/suspect-in-roosevelt-field-mall-shooting-held-on-bond/1133495/">being held on $750,000 bail</a>. Oliver Lee, a 21-year-old Queens resident, was charged with robbery, assault and weapons charges.</p>

<p>Lee was allegedly trying to steal a $18,000 Rolex from the Tourneau store&#x2014;WABC 7 reports he was &quot;flashing a gun and demanding watches from the clerk&quot;&#x2014; when he was stopped by a security guard, Kenneth Krug. During the struggle, a shot was fired from Lee&apos;s handgun, hitting a 67-year-old mall worker who suffered minor injuries.</p>

<p>Authorities say that Krug managed to jam the gun and prevent others from being hurt. Krug, who is a retired NYPD sergeant, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505004310/http://nypost.com/2015/12/24/long-island-mall-shooter-is-a-jobless-pill-popping-degenerate/">described as a hero</a> by acting Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter: &quot;Think about a violent struggle for 90 seconds over life and death, and that&#x2019;s what it was about. The defendant was trying to gain control of his firearm while the store security was attempting to safeguard the weapon.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Other security guards help contain Lee until the police arrested him. Once he was in custody, police found 10 Oxycodone pills.</p>

<p>The suspect was described as a loner; neighbors of Lee&apos;s parents (he lives at home) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505004310/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/queens-man-faces-multiple-charges-failed-mall-heist-article-1.2474954">told the Daily News</a>: &quot;Doesn&#x2019;t have a car. Doesn&#x2019;t have a girlfriend. He said he wasn&#x2019;t going to school or working.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Lee apparently posted a photograph of the handgun to his Facebook page earlier in the week. Krumpter said, &quot;The gun was purchased I believe about 11 years ago down South.&quot; </p>

<p>Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano said that the public should be alert when they look at their Facebook and other social media pages, &quot;If you see something that is not right or alarms you, you could simply take a screenshot of that and send it right to the Crime Stoppers app.&quot;</p>
