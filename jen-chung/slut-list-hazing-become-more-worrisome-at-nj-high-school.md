										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="2009_09_dcon.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141012004551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_dcon.jpg" width="200" height="257"> <br> <i>The senior girls of Dazed and Confused; Air Raid video after the jump</i></div> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141012004551/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/nyregion/19hazing.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times spotlights</a> the worries of some parents whose daughters are freshmen at NJ&apos;s well-regarded Millburn High School.  Specifically, how senior girls&apos; hazing of the frosh include a slut list (&quot;A dozen or more names are written on a piece of notebook paper, with crass descriptions, and copies are passed around &#x2014; hundreds this year, some say&quot;) and senior girls &quot;blow[ing] whistles in some girls&#x2019; faces&quot; and shoving &quot;them into lockers.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The school&apos;s principal says of the slut list, &quot;<strong>We&#x2019;ve had girls &#x2014; which is one of the bad things &#x2014; obsessed that their names are on it, and girls who were upset that they didn&#x2019;t make the list.</strong>&quot; Parents are upset that no one has been reprimanded, especially when their daughters are afraid to return to school.  </p>

<p>But one senior girl reasoned, &quot;Hazing has always been a tradition at Millburn. It&#x2019;s never really a personal attack. As a freshman you get pushed on the first day, and it reinforces the fact that they&#x2019;re seniors.&quot; And, yes, she was pushed when she entered the school and this year, she did push newbies but &quot;Not more than anyone else.&quot; FWIW, famous alums include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141012004551/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millburn_High_School">Anne Hathaway and stylist Rachel Zoe</a>&#x2014;and a part of <em>Dazed and Confused</em>&apos;s Air Raid scene is after the jump.</p>
