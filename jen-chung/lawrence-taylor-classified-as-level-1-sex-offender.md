He will be a Level 1 sex offender, which is the lowest level; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413000121/http://www.lohud.com/article/20110412/NEWS03/104120371/Lawrence-Taylor-classified-level-1-low-risk-sex-offender?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage">Journal News explains</a>, &quot;This means his name, photo, and criminal history will not appear on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413000121/http://criminaljustice.state.ny.us/nsor/">sex offender registry in New York</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Rockland County prosecutors had wanted Taylor to be classified as a Level 2, because the victim was just 16-years-old, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413000121/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/12/2011-04-12_lawrence_taylor_hit_with_lowestlevel_sex_offender_status_for_romp_with_16yearold.html">Judge William Kelly said</a>, &quot;The issue is whether or not he is going to find himself in this position again ...I think it&apos;s highly unlikely,&quot; and pointed out that everyone knows LT committed a crime, &quot;The difference between Level 1 and 2 is almost minuscule because of the notification that has already gone out to the world.&quot; </p>

<p>Taylor was not present for the sentencing and remained in Florida.</p>
