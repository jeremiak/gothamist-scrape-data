<p>Last April, a trader at JPMorgan Chase&apos;s London branch made a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161930/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/2_billion_of_grievous_self-inflicte.php">series of &quot;grievous&quot; trades</a> that ended up costing the bank, oh, over $6 billion. A top executive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161930/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/14/top_jp_morgan_chase_exec_resigns_ov.php">resigned over it</a> and there&apos;s been a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161930/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/15/jamie_dimon_meets_with_shareholders.php">hand-wringing about it</a>. Now the investment bank has agreed to pay nearly $1 billion as a fine for its naughty deeds.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161930/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324807704579084912809151456.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the U.K.&apos;s Financial Conduct Authority charged the company civilly with poor controls surrounding the giant bet, which ultimately cost the company more than $6 billion. The announcement of the settlements, which had been expected, marks one of the largest fines a bank has had to pay over a single trading strategy.&quot;</p>

<p>The WSJ adds, &quot;In an unusual step that reflects regulators&apos; recent push to hold Wall Street firms more accountable, <strong>J.P. Morgan admitted wrongdoing as part of the settlement, acknowledging poor internal controls.</strong>&quot; So it took a colossally unsuccessful hedge fund-type move AND two governments to get JPMorgan to admit it screwed up. (Firms usually don&apos;t admit wrongdoing.)</p>

<p>What happened? Well, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161930/http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/easy-street/jp-morgans-loss-explainer">The Explainer explained</a>, &quot;A JP Morgan trader, Bruno Iksil, [accumulated] a giant bet on U.S. corporate bonds. He used derivatives to do it, and he messed up the bet and lost $2 billion for the bank. He could end up losing $1 billion more if the market doesn&apos;t cooperate.&quot; Then he and others tried to hide the losses. Many executives knew about it, but Iksil managed to avoid criminal charges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161930/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/two_jp_morgan_scapegoats_are_thrown.php">by testifying against colleagues/scapegoats</a> Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, who were charged with criminal wire fraud, falsifying bank records, and contributing to false regulatory claims.</p>

<p>The SEC&apos;s co-director of enforcement George Canellos<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161930/http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370539819965#.UjsyAWRAQdI"> said in a statement today</a>, &quot;While grappling with how to fix its internal control breakdowns, JPMorgan&#x2019;s senior management broke a cardinal rule of corporate governance and deprived its board of critical information.&quot;</p>
