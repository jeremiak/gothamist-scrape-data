Because he missed out on rookie hazing last year, Smith must wear a pink Hello Kitty backpack every time he walks from the dugout to the bullpen.  Mets closer Billy Wagner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811082847/http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080618&amp;content_id=2955939&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym">presented him with the bag  on June 19</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811082847/http://blogs.nypost.com/sports/mets/archives/2008/06/smith_having_to.html">proclaimed</a>, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s not Hello Kitty, it&apos;s Hello Smitty -- mee-oww</strong>!&quot; </p>

While possibly embarrassing, it might be less embarrassing than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811082847/http://shop.sanrio.com/Hello%20Kitty%20Rolling%20Backpack%3a%20Boutique/86819-200701,default,pd.html">rolling Hello Kitty backpack</a>.</p>
