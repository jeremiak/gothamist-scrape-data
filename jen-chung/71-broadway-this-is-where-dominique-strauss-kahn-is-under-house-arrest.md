</div></div>					<p>Ex-IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn was released on bail yesterday afternoon, hours later than he expected to leave, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316001629/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/20/dominique_strauss-kahn_has_no_place.php#photo-1">there were problems</a> with where he&apos;d be spending his extra-supervised house arrest. After Bristol Plaza, an Upper East Side building on East 65th Street found out that Strauss-Kahn&apos;s wife rented an apartment for him, they said no deal because residents didn&apos;t want an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316001629/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/imf_head_to_plead_not_guilty_to_sex.php">alleged sex attacker</a> and media circus. So the security company overseeing the house arrest has installed him at 71 Broadway, which made prosecutors upset.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316001629/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ex_imf_big_leaves_rikers_for_posh_A0E0D9epoFiGvXBCE6cgdP">Assistant DA Artie McConnell pointed out</a>, &quot;This location is in downtown Manhattan it&apos;s one or at most two lanes of traffic there. It&apos;s near Ground Zero, and near transit hubs and construction sites. It&apos;s an extremely problematic area for the police to control... To throw what has become a very large media presence into the mix in that part of town is really potentially crippling to downtown Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316001629/http://www.equityapartments.com/new-york/new-york-city-apartments/financial-district/71-broadway.aspx">71 Broadway</a> is an upscale rental building, with studios starting at $2765/month&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316001629/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/20/2011-05-20_dominique_strausskahn_accused_sex_predator_will_leave_jail_but_wont_go_home_to_w.html?r=news">Daily News notes</a> there are &quot;corporate apartments [with] gleaming white kitchens, floor-to-ceiling windows and walk-in closets. Two-bedrooms rent for more than $4,000 a month, and guests have use of a fitness center and a billiards room.&quot; However, Strauss-Kahn, who has to pay for the $200,000/month security, is allegedly &quot;locked in.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, while 71 Broadway is nice, the NY Times reports that Strauss-Kahn was expecting the &quot;deluxe&quot; UES accommodations at The Bristol Plaza (the website says it&apos;s &quot;better than a hotel&quot; and there&apos;s daily maid service). But one person staying there said, &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t seem quite right for him to be put here with the rest of us, enjoy our hospitality, after what he&#x2019;s been accused of doing. The discrepancy between Rikers and here is probably very great, and it doesn&#x2019;t seem quite right.&quot;  A lawyer for Strauss-Kahn explained, &quot;Last night there was an effort by the media to invade the building. That is why the tenants in the building will not accept his living there,&quot; claiming that Strauss-Kahn family decided not to reside there &quot;out of respect&quot; for everyone else.  (71 Broadway doesn&apos;t get that respect!)</p>

<p>The Times adds, &quot;The Bristol Plaza was not the only building that objected to the possibility that Mr. Strauss-Kahn might move in. Lawyers for Columbia University alerted the district attorney&#x2019;s office that they did not want Mr. Strauss-Kahn to stay with his daughter, who lives in graduate housing on 112th Street, according to a lawyer briefed on Columbia&#x2019;s position.&quot; </p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn was indicted on charges of two counts of a first-degree criminal sexual act, and one count each of attempted rape, sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment, sexual abuse and forcible touching.</p>
