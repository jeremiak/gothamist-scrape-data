										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_12_andmadoff.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305205955im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_12_andmadoff.jpg" width="200" height="190" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305205955/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/madoff_son_of_gun_LDcUvEw9PXY0rS1oNFfl1J">Post reports</a> that Andrew Madoff, the 43-year-old son of Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, &quot;applied for a license to keep a handgun in his swanky Upper East Side pad more than six months ago -- and his name appears on NYPD and state police lists of approved permit holders.&quot;  Is he trying to keep up with those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305205955/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/01/goldman_sachs_bankers_ready_to_open.php">alleged Goldman Sachs employees</a> who are packing heat these days?</p>

<p>The Post questions this decision, because Madoff got into an argument with a former employee of his father&apos;s firm and the two men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305205955/http://dealbreaker.com/2009/05/madoff-son-bitch-slapped-into.php">ended up in an &quot;entertaining&quot; &quot;bitch fight&quot;</a> on a Upper East Side street earlier this year. A Post source says, &quot;I would think that if the license division knew about that, they would suspend his permit immediately&quot;&#x2014;because the NYPD  &quot;commonly gives them to those with clean records and no history of mental or substance problems&quot;&#x2014; but, hey, no one was arrested!  </p>

<p>The NYPD claims Madoff&apos;s application wasn&apos;t approved, but the State Police, which gets its info from NYC, says that he appears on the &quot;roster of license holders.&quot;  Well, at any rate, he is being sued for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305205955/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/finally_madoffs_sons_brother_niece.php">taking $60 million in ill-gotten gains </a>and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305205955/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/10/boo_hoo_madoffs_sons_cant_find_work.php">can&apos;t find work</a>, so this gun kerfuffle is the least of his worries.</p>
