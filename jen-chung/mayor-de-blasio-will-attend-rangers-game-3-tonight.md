<p>Tonight at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers will face off against the Los Angeles Kings in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals. And Mayor de Blasio will be there&#x2014;though it&apos;s unclear if he&apos;ll really get into the spirit of things.</p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s press office just updated his schedule to reflect his attendance. Of course, if the Rangers lose&#x2014;and they are down 2 games&#x2014;the Mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140611004928/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/04/de_blasio_rangers.php">will have to sing &quot;I Love LA&quot; on Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140611004928/http://espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/11052295/new-york-rangers-learn-other-teams-2-0-rallies">ESPN handily compiled instances</a> of 0-2 Stanley Cup comebacks, most recently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140611004928/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Stanley_Cup_Finals">2010 Chicago Blackhawks</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140611004928/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Stanley_Cup_Finals">2011 Boston Bruins</a>. From ESPN:</p><blockquote>If there is hope for the Rangers from this series, it&apos;s that Lundqvist has those kinds of heroics in him in his first Stanley Cup finals. He was devastated after the Game 2 loss, so it will be interesting to see how he rebounds for a must-win session in Game 3 on Monday night. The other factor in this 2009 series was the play of the Penguins&apos; centers, especially Jordan Staal and Talbot, who provided key performances late. The Rangers need more from their pivots if they are going to get back in this current series.</blockquote>And Mark Messier, who led the Rangers to the 1994 victory, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140611004928/http://nypost.com/2014/06/09/comeback-expert-messier-encouraged-by-where-rangers-stand/">told the Post the Blueshirts can do it</a>, &quot;There&#x2019;s no question they can still win it... Whether they will or not, will remain to be determined, but watching the game from the outside as a fan, if I&#x2019;m sitting on the plane, I&#x2019;m disappointed we&#x2019;re down two because we had our opportunities, but I would be pretty encouraged once the disappointment of losing a double overtime wanes &#x2026; If I was the Rangers coming home on that plane [Sunday] and talking to each other, I wouldn&#x2019;t be dejected one bit. I would be more inspired and more determined than ever because of the opportunity that awaits.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Ahh, flashbacks to Game 6 of the 1994 playoffs between the Rangers and Devils:</p>
