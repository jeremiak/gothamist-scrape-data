<p>The Anti-Defamation League announced that it received an anonymous bomb threat called into its national headquarters in Midtown Manhattan today. The threat, which was found to be not credible, is now the focus of a law enforcement investigation.</p>

<p>&quot;The anonymous bomb threat to the Anti-Defamation League&apos;s national headquarters this morning is unacceptable, un-American and&#x2014;disturbingly&#x2014;increasingly common,&quot; said Governor Andrew Cuomo, who announced that he was directing the NY State Police to work with the NYPD and federal authorities on the case. &quot;This despicable act of anti-Semitism completely contradicts the values we hold dear as New Yorkers.  This is now a national crisis as a troubling pattern of recent anti-Semitic threats have been directed at Jewish Community Centers on a regular basis, including Buffalo, New York City, Albany, and Syracuse.&quot;</p>

<p>There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508193408/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/21/516422832/another-wave-of-bomb-threats-targets-jewish-community-centers">dozens of threats on Jewish community centers</a> across the country and Canada in recent months. And, this week, nearly 200 headstones were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508193408/http://chicagoist.com/2017/02/21/nearly_200_headstones_vandalized_at.php">vandalized at a historic Jewish cemetery</a> in St. Louis.</p>

<p>Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, said:</p><blockquote>Today, our national headquarters in New York received an anonymous bomb threat. While there is no information at this time to indicate that this is more than a threat, we are taking it very seriously and working closely with law enforcement officials to determine if it is connected to similar threats against Jewish institutions across the country.<p></p>

<p>            This is not the first time that ADL has been targeted, and it will not deter us in our efforts to combat anti-Semitism and hate against people of all races and religions. </p></blockquote>Cuomo also said, &quot;We as New Yorkers stand with the Anti-Defamation League, an organization for over a century whose mission has been to stand up for the Jewish people and fight back the ugly divisive forces of bigotry and defamation.  We stand with all Jewish people here in New York and across the country to say loud and clear - enough is enough.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The governor urged New Yorkers &quot;who have experienced bias or discrimination are encouraged to call the New York State Division of Human Right&#x2019;s toll-free hotline at (888) 392-3644 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday - Friday. If you want to report a crime or fear for your safety, call 911 immediately.&quot;</p>
