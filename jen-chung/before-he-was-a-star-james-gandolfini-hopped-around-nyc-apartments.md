He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231220545/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/arts/television/james-gandolfini-sopranos-star-dies-at-51.html?hp">told Newsweek in 2001</a>, &quot;I thought it was a wonderful script. I thought, &#x2018;I can do this.&#x2019; But I thought they would hire someone a little more debonair, shall we say. A little more appealing to the eye.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Before that, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231220545/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/videos_james_gandolfini_in_the_sopr.php#photo-1">was a character actor</a>, playing a stunt man-turned-henchman in <em>Get Shorty</em> and another henchman in <em>True Romance</em>. He also played the landlord in the 1992 Broadway production of <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> with Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange. And those were big breaks!</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231220545/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/realestate/the-apartment-gypsies-of-manhattan.html">1988 NY Times article</a> about young New Yorkers moving from cheap apartment to cheap apartment, many times sharing space, features an aspiring actor named Jim Gandolfini: </p><blockquote>For most, the process of lugging bed, books and boxes from one neighborhood to another is exasperating. &apos;&apos;Let&apos;s not even talk about physically moving - packing everything in boxes and hiring a moving van,&apos;&apos; said Ms. Jimenz, who is now sharing a two-bedroom on 106th Street off Amsterdam Avenue with two others. &apos;&apos;It&apos;s being unsettled that bothers me most. It takes so much out of you. I just want to be in one place and build an identity.&apos;&apos;<p></p>

<p>Then there is Jim Gandolfini, who seems to thrive on the apartment-hopping life. Since moving to New York City four years ago, Mr. Gandolfini, 26 years old, has never had his name on a lease, never paid more than $400 a month in rent and never lived in one place more than 10 months. His wanderer&apos;s existence has given him sojourns, some as brief as two months, in Hoboken, N.J.; Astoria, Queens; Clinton and the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and Park Slope and Flatbush in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>&apos;&apos;MOVING, to me, is no big deal,&apos;&apos; said Mr. Gandolfini, whose calling is the theater but whose living comes mostly from bartending and construction. &apos;&apos;I have a system down. I throw everything in plastic garbage bags and can be situated in my new place in minutes. Without my name on a lease, I&apos;m in and out. I have no responsibilities.&apos;&apos;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231220545/http://blog.nj.com/njv_mark_diionno/2013/06/james_gandolfini_dead_rutgers.html#/0">The Star-Ledger columnist Mark DiIonno knew</a> Gandolfini from his first year at Rutgers, and recalls, &quot;The kid from Park Ridge called himself &apos;Buck&apos; when we first met him on the freshman floor of the Tinsley dorm at Rutgers in New Brunswick. He was &#x2014; believe it or not &#x2014; thin in the waist, but broad-shouldered with a head of sandy-colored hair that swept across his forehead, &#x2019;70s style. He was a good-looking kid, with a little too much swagger.&quot;<blockquote>There was a time he got drunk and broke a parking gate. I went and got him out of the police station. I was a Navy veteran and still technically in the service, so I put on my uniform to go vouch for him...<p></p>

<p>Then there was the time we were having a dart-gun fight and I kicked in the metal door to the room where he was hiding just as he was coming out.</p>

<p>When he came to, I took him to St. Peter&#x2019;s Hospital in New Brunswick to get his forehead stitched up and paid the bill. It was $25, and worth it just to see the scar on his head during all those close-ups on HBO.</p></blockquote>DiIonno adds, &quot;A lot of time passed, and our lives took divergent paths, so for me to pretend I know him, or anything about his life now, would be disingenuous,&quot; but recalls seeing him at the second season premiere of <em>The Sopranos</em>, &quot;He knew how lucky he was. He knew he was good, but he understood there&#x2019;s a lot of good actors out there who don&#x2019;t get the breaks. Gandolfini worked hard for his, playing bit parts all the way up to &apos;The Sopranos.&apos; He brought his natural Jerseyness to the role and the authenticity won him awards and accolades. He became the star he wanted to be. More important, to him, a respected, workaday actor.&quot;<p></p>
