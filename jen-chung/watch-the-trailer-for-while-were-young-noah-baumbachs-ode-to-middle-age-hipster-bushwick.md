</div></div>					<p>To lull you out of the haze of Oscar prestige movies, here&apos;s a taste of what awaits us next March: Noah Baumbach&apos;s fantastic new film, <em>While We&apos;re Young</em>, about a couple in their 40s who find inspiration in a younger couple who live in a Bushwick loft, use typewriters and watch movies on VHS. <em>While We&apos;re Young</em> also makes cinematic history, with a scene showing a Beastie Boy wearing a baby in a sling.</p>

<p>Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts play a content but complacent older couple, whose best friends (Maria Dizzia and Adam &quot;Ad-Rock&quot; Horovitz) have a new baby. Then Stiller&apos;s and Watts&apos;s characters become entranced by the lives of a pair of happy-go-lucky hipsters (Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried) and are suddenly thrown into the world of sidewalk beach parties, hip-hop dance classes and fedoras.</p>
