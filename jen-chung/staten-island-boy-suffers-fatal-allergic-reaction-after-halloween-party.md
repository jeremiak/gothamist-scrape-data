<p>A Staten Island family is mourning the sudden death of a seven-year-old boy who went into anaphylactic shock on Halloween. Joseph DeNicola subsequently went into cardiac arrest and died on Tuesday at Staten Island University Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012041/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/father_devastated_as_he_goes_f.html#incart_story_package">His father said</a>, &quot;I was out trick-or-treating with Joseph on Friday and now I&apos;m at the hospital planning his funeral.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy&apos;s father, Anthony DeNicola, said that Joseph had asthma and other allergies and, on Friday, October 31st, the second grader was given an asthma treatment by the school nurse. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012041/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/father_devastated_as_he_goes_f.html#incart_story_package">The Staten Island Advance reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Joseph and his father went trick-or-treating with friends and relatives on Friday and then continued on to a Halloween party at a relative&apos;s house. His father said that Joseph didn&apos;t eat anything that would have triggered an attack. Joseph wasn&apos;t feeling well and he started coughing, so DeNicola took the youngster home and treated him with various medications prescribed for treating allergic reactions.<p></p>

<p>Joseph seemed &quot;like he couldn&apos;t breathe, he was gasping for air,&quot; so DeNicola grabbed his son and alerted a neighbor. The three rushed in DeNicola&apos;s car a short distance to Staten Island University Hospital in Prince&apos;s Bay.</p>

<p>Doctors told DeNicola that Joseph went into anaphylactic shock and had a heart attack, the father said.</p>

<p>&quot;They started working on him and all of a sudden he went into cardiac arrest,&quot; DeNicola said. &quot;His heart stopped for about 20 minutes to a half hour.&quot;</p></blockquote>DeNicola <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012041/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/joseph_denicola_7_died_after_s.html#incart_m-rpt-1">decided to donate his son&apos;s organs</a> and family friends are rallying together to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012041/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/donations_accepted_for_the_fam.html#incart_most-comments">raise money for burial expenses</a>. A cousin told the Advance, &quot;Joseph was the sweetest, purest kid I ever met in my life.&quot;<p></p>
