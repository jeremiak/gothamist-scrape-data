<p>After telling the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414235912/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/anthony-weiner-and-huma-abedins-post-scandal-playbook.html?ref=magazine&amp;_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all">NY Times Magazine</a> that he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414235912/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/its_official_anthony_weiner_wants_t.php">considering running for mayor</a>, former Congressman Anthony &quot;Here&apos;s My&quot; Weiner&apos;s intentions are being debated all around. But Stephen Colbert may have been the most incisive to examine the issue, saying last night, &quot;<strong>After withdrawing from public life, Weiner&apos;s ready to stick it back in. That takes balls. Sadly, we know he has them.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert wondered, &quot;Will [voters] actually forgive him? The only way to know for sure is to revisit the scandal that forced him out of office&#x2014;sit back, relax, grab yourself a box of popcorn and make sure there&apos;s no hole in the bottom,&quot; and decided, &quot;I think Weiner would be a great NYC mayor. For one thing, we wouldn&apos;t have to worry about a soda ban because we&apos;ve all seen how Weiner puts more than 16 ounces in his cup&#x2026; HEY-O!&quot;</p>

<p>He also liked Weiner&apos;s brother&apos;s statement, &quot;No one has been harder on him than he has been himself&quot;&#x2014;Colbert cracked, &quot;<strong>We all know how hard he can be on himself.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>As for Jon Stewart, a friend of Weiner&apos;s who was also quoted in the Weiner Times story (&quot;I may have been impeached by some sort of comedy board if I hadn&#x2019;t made all those Weiner jokes&quot;), he didn&apos;t really address his pal&apos;s rising ambitions on The Daily Show. Except during an interview with documentarian Ken Burns. Burns has been promoting his film, The Central Park Five, about the unjust imprisonment of five teens for the rape of a Central Park jogger in 1989. (The real rapist later confessed.)</p>

<p>Stewart was shocked that NYC is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414235912/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/nyregion/citys-failure-to-settle-central-park-five-suit-draws-ire.html?_r=0">trying to avoid paying the teens</a>&#x2014;now grown men&#x2014;any kind of settlement, saying we should do it now. Burns said, &quot;Jon Stewart for mayor!&quot; to which Stewart replied that he coudln&apos;t run, &quot;Here&apos;s why, I just don&apos;t have time to send pictures of my junk everybody. I just don&apos;t have time for that kind of campaigning.&quot;</p>
