The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328034859/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303836404577472912716249878.html?KEYWORDS=LIANE+MEMBIS">story now has this note</a>: &quot;Note to Readers: &quot;Bridging a Local Divide,&quot; published online on June 17, has been removed from the Journal&apos;s web sites. Many of the names contained in the article about the re-opening of the 103rd Street Pedestrian Bridge in Manhattan were fabricated by reporting intern Liane Membis, and the quotes couldn&apos;t be independently verified. Ms. Membis is no longer working at The Wall Street Journal. (A version of this article appeared June 26, 2012, on page A15 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Bridging a Local Divide.)&quot; Membis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328034859/http://twitter.com/limembo/status/214676483355062272">had Tweeted about the bridge story on June 18</a>, &quot;Front paging today for Greater New York section of WSJ.&quot;  <p></p>
