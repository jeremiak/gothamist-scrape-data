<p>According to the NYPD, at 11 p.m. on July 10, a 41-year-old woman was entering her apartment building when she saw a man trying to get buzzed in. She let the man in and went to check her mail&#x2014;as he went inside and hid in the stairwell. Police say, &quot;The victim then entered the building and, once in the stairwell, was confronted by the suspect. The suspect asked the victim to perform a criminal sex act on him and when she refused grabbed her. When the victim began to scream the suspect released her, removed her pocketbook and emptied the contents on the floor.&quot; The suspect fled after stealing her wallet and cell phone. The victim refused medical attention. </p>
