<p>Cameron Booth, the graphic designer behind &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917172257/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/16/amtrak_subway_map.php">Amtrak routes as a subway map,&quot;</a> has now created a NYC subway map that&apos;s in the style of the London Tube map.</p>

<p>Booth writes:</p><blockquote>All of the subway trunk lines have been adapted to use their closest matching colour from the Tube Map: the BMT Broadway uses the Circle line&#x2019;s yellow, the IND 6th Avenue uses the Overground&#x2019;s orange, and so on. The IRT Flushing line&#x2019;s purple gets substantially darker to use the Metropolitan line&#x2019;s maroon, as does the IND 8th Avenue&#x2019;s blue with the Piccadilly&#x2019;s dark navy. I used the Waterloo &amp; City line&#x2019;s sea green for New York&#x2019;s three shuttle lines, as the W&amp;C; is the only shuttle-like line on the Underground, and it looked much nicer than using the Northern line&#x2019;s heavy black. One notable thing is how terrible the IRT 7th Avenue (red) and IRT Lexington Avenue (green) lines are for colour-blind users when they run adjacent to each other.<p></p>

<p>The other thing to note is that - in true Tube Map style - service patterns generally aren&#x2019;t shown. This, of course, makes this map next to useless for actually navigating the subway - there&#x2019;s literally no distinction made on the map between the J and the Z, for example - but that&#x2019;s the way things roll in London! I did make one tiny concession to New York&#x2019;s complexity by adding route designation bullets at the terminus stations of each service, but you&#x2019;re completely on your own after that. Express services, turnbacks, skipping stations at certain times: these are all trifling details that London does not even attempt to convey - so neither does this map.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>He adds, &quot;The other departure from the true Tube Map style was the requirement to adhere to Manhattan&#x2019;s street grid as closely as possible, rather than evenly spacing the stations out along a line. As can be seen above, this mostly works pretty well, although occasionally the density of labelling required a street to be pushed slightly out of alignment. Once the map reaches the outer boroughs, a more diagrammatic and evenly-spaced approach could be used successfully. The section of the map into Coney Island works particularly well, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>The merits of the NYC subway system versus the London Underground will forever be debated, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917172257/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/23/brit_trolls_nyc_subway.php">we all know NYC is best</a>. </p>
