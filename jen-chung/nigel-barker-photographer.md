But Barker, who has had a photography studio in New York City for over a decade, is also spokesperson for The Humane Society of the United States&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308221856/http://www.hsus.org/protect_seals.html">Protect Seals</a> program and visited the Canadian seal hunt earlier this year.  </i></p><i>

</i><p><i>On Friday, an exhibit including his photographs and a documentary from the hunt, &quot;A Sealed Fate?,&quot; will open at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308221856/http://401projects.com/">401 Projects</a> (running through Sunday, July 27th).  Barker will also be on hand to give a few guided tours each day.  We spoke to him about the Humane Society of the United States, other causes, his hopes for his children and more last week:</i></p>

<p><b>Tell us how you became involved with the Humane Society of the United States.</b> The Humane Society started in England many years ago, as you may know, and it&apos;s a huge organization here in the States--they&apos;ve really made it into something massive.  And as a kid, I was always a big supporter of what the Humane Society did.  England is sort of a nation of animal lovers, and I grew up in a family that had dozens of dogs and was a big fan of looking after animals.  That said, it wasn&apos;t as if we were vegetarians or anything, it was just about treating animals with respect and the farms I grew up around, all the farms knew their cows and horses by name, even the pigs and chickens</p>

<p>And that was just my mentality.  When I went to the big cities, went to America and came to New York, people were sort of very separated from that.  You have people going shopping up and down the meat aisle and have really no idea about where it came from.  And I found that very strange, if you actually what it was or how it got there, and if you did, you&apos;d terrify them or freak them out or they just wouldn&apos;t want to know.</p>

<p>And that&apos;s like the seal hunt: People love seals, they love them at the zoo, to watch them perform...but when you discuss what&apos;s happening to them on the ice, most people say, &quot;Oh, is that still happening?  I don&apos;t want to know about it.&quot;  It&apos;s out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<p><b>So, tell us what <i>is</i> happening with seals on the ice?</b> The way the seals are killed, and this is a fact, not a fiction, is that they are clubbed to death with a very blunt instrument or a hakapik, which is an extremely sharp spike at the end of a club.  It&apos;s very, very brutal.  Now, if you were to take the seal, put it on land and kill it in this matter, you&apos;d be arrested.  But because it&apos;s on the ice, the law doesn&apos;t apply in the same manner, so you can get away with all sorts of things.  There are some regulations, but they are very outdated. People just have to realize the manner of killing them has been banned in a number of countries, but the Canadian government...when it comes animal rights, hasn&apos;t been very good.</p>
