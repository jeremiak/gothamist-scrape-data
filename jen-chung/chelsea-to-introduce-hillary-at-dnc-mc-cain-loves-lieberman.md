The former First Daughter was active in campaigning for her mother, winning kudos for her poise. And apparently it was Hillary&apos;s idea--a source said, &quot;<b>[Barack Obama] has a problem with Hillary&apos;s more fanatical women supporters, and this is a way to help with that</b>.&quot;  And in other campaign news, the a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105902/http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/6383">Financial Times source claims</a> McCain has added <strong>Joe Lieberman to the VP shortlist</strong>, &quot;[McCain] loves Lieberman. And he is on the [short]list because Lieberman has never embarrassed anyone, never misspoken. The first rule is, don&apos;t take anyone who costs you votes.&quot;</p>
