<p>Why worry? Well, the Post points out that Bistricer&apos;s company, Clipper Equities, is a junior partner in the Chelsea Hotel, where many tenants claim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160340/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/hotel_chelsea_residents.php">dangerous conditions and harsh tactics</a> from landlord (and primary owner) Joseph Chetrit. Bistricer&apos;s attempt to buy Starett City was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160340/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/17/cuomo_and_hud_a.php">blocked by then-Attorney General Andrew Cuomo</a> and HUD.  And the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses organization, The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, that owns the building has been known from its &quot;impeccable&quot; upkeep (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160340/http://www.masseyknakal.com/news/pdf/BKs_Hotel_Bossert_Bk_Eagle.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Heights Association is taking a &quot;wait and see approach.&quot;  A public hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160340/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/40255">is being held tonight</a>.</p>
