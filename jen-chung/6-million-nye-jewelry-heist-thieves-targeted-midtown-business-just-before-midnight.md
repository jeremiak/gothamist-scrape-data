<p>A midtown jewelry wholesaler was hit by burglars over the New Year&apos;s Eve weekend&#x2014;and it&apos;s believed the suspects<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105213145/http://nypost.com/2017/01/02/thieves-steal-6m-in-jewels-while-ball-drops-on-new-years-eve/"> deliberately struck</a> because police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105213145/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/29/party_time_dump_trucks.php">would be focused</a> on Times Square. A source told the Post, &quot;They laid in wait until the ball dropped.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The burglary occurred at KGK Holdings, located at 70 West 36th Street. Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105213145/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Thieves-Make-Off-With-6-Million-in-Gems-From-Jewelry-Store-in-Korea-Town-NYPD-409386185.html">told NBC New York</a> the burglars hid out inside the building for hours leading up to midnight, entering through a freight entrance.  </p>

<p>Two of the three male suspects can been seen on surveillance video using a pry bar and hammer to enter the business&#x2014;one even looks up at the camera&#x2014;and police say they stole jewelry valued at approximately $6,000,000 from two safes. No one was injured, and they fled via the stairs.  </p>

The footage shows one of the suspects talking on a cell phone while he is opening the safe, perhaps receiving the combination from a fourth person.&quot;</p>

<p>A building worker said, &quot;It&#x2019;s weird to me that they randomly tried that floor in this building. How would somebody know to come here? That&#x2019;s real fishy... It definitely seems like an inside job.&quot;</p>
