The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075450/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05202009/news/regionalnews/poor_tony_gets_nasty_son_burn_170122.htm">Post said during testimony</a>, Marshall, 84, &quot;hunched forward at the defense table&quot; and &quot;held his forehead in his trembling right hand&quot; while, during a break, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075450/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/20/nyregion/20astor.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times saw</a> him and his third wife, Charlene Marshall, &quot;<strong>sat red-faced on a bench in the hallway. Tears trickled from their eyes.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Sons Philip and Alexander (also known as Alec) Marshall, 56, both described their father as distant and formal.  Alexander Marshall said Astor asked him if he&apos;d like her Westchester estate, Holly Hill, but declined, believing she wasn&apos;t in the best mental state.  Philip Marshall, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075450/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/26/astors_scary_pl.php">accused his father of elder abuse</a> when he caught wind of his grandmother&apos;s condition and surroundings in 2006, mentioned how his father and stepmother gave him the cold shoulder, angry that he had visited Astor without his father&apos;s permission.  He also mentioned how when he saw Astor in 2004, she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075450/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/05/19/2009-05-19_the_brooke_astor_trial_goes_to_the_dogsdroppings.html">seemed &quot;very disoriented and appeared terrified.&quot;</a> Philip Marshall said he reminded her of his and his family&apos;s names, &quot;she still looked terrified and I started massaging her b<strong>ack. I said, &apos;We&apos;re family. We love you.&apos; And she relaxed, and just squeezed my hand, and started crying.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>When the jury was out of the courtroom, prosecutors and lawyers for Marshall and lawyer Francis Morrissey argued over whether <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075450/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/05/19/2009-05-19_the_brooke_astor_trial_goes_to_the_dogsdroppings.html">jurors could hear how dog poop piled up in Astor&apos;s apartment</a>.  The judge decided it would not be allowed, but Philip Marshall, who made the claim, did tell the jury, &quot;<strong>The apartment was dirty.  And I&apos;m trying to be polite. Very, very, dirty.</strong>&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075450/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/05/20/2009-05-20_grim_drama_out_of_shakespeare.html">Daily News&apos; Joanna Molly says that after hearing his testimony</a>, &quot;I&apos;d drive Anthony Marshall up to Sing Sing myself.&quot;</p>
