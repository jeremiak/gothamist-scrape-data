										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_07_dtrump1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171322im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_07_dtrump1.jpg" width="640" height="449"> <br> <i> Donald Trump really is Cheeto-colored (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171322/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/business/media/donald-trump-apprentice.html?_r=1">NY Times has an article examining</a> how Donald Trump&apos;s time as a reality TV star in the NBC show <em>The Apprentice</em> &quot;served as a prequel of sorts for his improbable next act as a presidential nominee, who next week will return to prime time as the ringmaster of the Republican National Convention.&quot; </p>

<p>There&apos;s mention of Trump&apos;s love of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171322/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/03/trumps_anti-semitic_hillary_meme_wa.php">Jewish stereotypes</a> (&quot;Don&#x2019;t you think I should get a Jewish agent, so he can negotiate better for me?&quot;) and some good backstory about his famous catchphrase, too:</p><blockquote> Producers went so far as to test out sympathetic lines for Mr. Trump to use in the boardroom, including, &#x201C;We need to let you go,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Unfortunately, your time here is over.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>But Mr. Trump seemed to grasp instantly what the camera wanted. He ad-libbed the &#x201C;You&#x2019;re fired&#x201D; line in the very first episode, along with its accompanying, air-slicing hand jab &#x2014; which came to be known among producers as &#x201C;the Cobra.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The line was a sensation on set, from the executives in the control room to the union men working the cameras. &#x201C;What other person in America could make getting fired a popular thing?&#x201D; said Jim Dowd, NBC&#x2019;s former publicity chief.</p></blockquote>Of course, some of his other ideas weren&apos;t so popular, including one scheme to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171322/http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2005/07/19/can_trump_spark_useful_debate_on_race/">have all-black and all-white teams square off against one another</a>, though a Boston Globe reporter thought in 2005, &quot;[S]uch a gimmick would be invaluable because it would prompt viewers to examine their own feelings about race and racial attitudes in the workplace.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Jeff Gaspin, a former NBC executive, praised Trump&apos;s understanding of how to promote the show by marketing himself but admits that helping lay the groundwork for the Republican presidential nominee&apos;s mainstream appeal has some consequences: &quot;My son has said it to me, &#x2018;<strong>This is your fault, Dad</strong>.&apos;&quot; (Gaspin himself was fired from NBC for, among other things, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171322/http://www.thewrap.com/jeff-gaspin-steve-burke-and-200000-bathroom-24043/">a $200,000 private bathroom</a> that would make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171322/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYVBRQ7t46g">George Costanza weep</a>.)</p>

<p>Trump&apos;s ready-for-prime-time attitude can be seen in this perfect Tweet heralding his running mate Mike Pence. The Trumps are glossy and styled while the Pences look... like they are from Indiana:</p>
