The boy was eventually found, but police recovered a toddler girl&apos;s body in the lake.<p></p>

Eyewitnesses say she had just taken her eyes off the kids to check on the food when they walked away.&quot; When the parents realized they were missing, they asked others in the park to help them find the children.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092053/http://nypost.com/2014/07/05/police-search-for-missing-toddler-in-nyc-park/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;One of the dozens of park-goers who joined in the desperate search for the kids found the little boy, soaked and covered in algae, in a wooded area. He was unhurt.&quot;</p>

<blockquote> A woman helping in the search, who declined to give her name, saw the family being reunited with the 3-year-old boy.

<p>The searchers who found him &#x201C;kept asking people, &#x2018;Is this your son?&#x2019; Then someone in the family said, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s my son,&#x2019; &#x2019;&#x2019; one of the searchers said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Then [the family] asked if they found a little girl with him,&#x201D; said the woman. When they answered no, &#x201C;The news spread like wildfire,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;More families left their barbecues to help look for the girl.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>According to police, they responded to a call about the missing girl at 1 p.m. and were told that Ruhshona Kurbnova may have gone into the lake. The police say, &quot;The NYPD Scuba Unit responded to the scene and deployed divers into the lake where they recovered the 2 year old female unconscious and unresponsive.&quot; The girl, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was pulled out at 6 p.m.  </p>

Right now, her child is gone.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl&apos;s mother was taken from the scene on a stretcher and to a hospital for observation. The News reports, &quot;Though investigators plan to question the mother and consult with the Brooklyn district attorney, criminal charges in the tragedy were highly unlikely, police sources said.&quot; The parents, who left Uzbekistan in 2010 and have two other children, are planning to go back to their native country for a funeral.<br>
