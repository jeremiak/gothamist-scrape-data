<p>While the Macy&apos;s 4th of July Fireworks Spectacular was definitely spectacular (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704225031/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/05/fireworks_gallery.php">see the photos</a>), the show&apos;s organizers moved the displays further south, closer to the Williamsburg Bridge, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704225031/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/nyregion/04fourth.html?_r=2&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">order for more of the NYC skyline to be seen in the TV broadcast</a>. Not only did NBC broadcast from Brooklyn, but NBC also added a chyron (graphic) noting that the fireworks were taking place near <i>Stuyvesant Town</i> at least seven times during the half-hour show.  </p>

<p>The only other graphics were to note what songs were being played--no graphics about the fireworks being over the East River or how the crowd shots were in Brooklyn. Is it a mere coincidence that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704225031/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/17/stuytown_sold_t.php">Stuyvesant Town owner is Tishman Speyer</a>, which happens to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704225031/http://www.tishmanspeyer.com/Properties/Property.aspx?id=24">own and operate Rockefeller Center</a>, which is where NBC&apos;s headquarters are?  After all, Tishman has wanted to bring in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704225031/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/05/stuyvesant_town_1.php">more market-rate tenants to Stuy Town</a> and what better free advertising than implying the fireworks are right near by?</p>
