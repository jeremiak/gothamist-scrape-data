<p>Earlier this morning, 4 and 6 train service was suspended for a couple hours between Brooklyn Bridge and 42nd Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163623/https://twitter.com/#!/NotifyNYC/status/173369401209393152">due to an investigation</a>.  It turns out that a man was struck and killed by a train near Spring Street before 6 a.m.</p>

<p>A tipster told us, &quot;Apparently a guy was walking the 6 tracks and got hit and killed this morning. He was allegedly stuck under the train. But the train didn&apos;t look like a passenger train, it only had on car in front and what looked like several flat bed cars/trailers behind it.&quot;  The MTA says that the matter is under investigation and that the train involved was a garbage train.</p>
