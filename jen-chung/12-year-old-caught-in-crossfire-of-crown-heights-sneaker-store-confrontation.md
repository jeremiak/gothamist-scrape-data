<p>A 12-year-old boy was inside a sneaker store with his father last night when a violent confrontation erupted between a Rugged Sole employee and another man.  According to the store&apos;s owner, surveillance video shows the employee, apparently a security worker, pulling out a gun after an armed man showed his gun. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605083930/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/12-year-old-boy-shot-leg-brooklyn-sneaker-shop-article-1.1082315"> Sang Han told the Daily News,</a> &quot;They both had guns and the boy got caught in the crossfire. The kid was just an innocent bystander.&quot;</p>

<p>A 34-year-old man was also wounded in the 7:30 p.m. shooting. While  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605083930/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/boy_shot_by_mistake_ZYGjmsGS2Sb86NdkckUfRI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">the Post describes</a> him as one of the armed men (&quot;The guard blasted [the boy] in the leg and shot his target in the arm&quot;), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605083930/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/22/boy-12-hit-by-stray-bullet-in-brooklyn/">WCBS 2</a>  and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605083930/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Crown-Heights-Shooting-Two-Victims-Eastern-Parkway-Utica-Avenue-Brooklyn-152399895.html">NBC New York</a> say that the 34-year-old man was another unintended target.</p>

<p>A witness told the News, &quot;<strong>I heard four shots. I turned around and saw a little boy. He was trying to get up, but couldn&#x2019;t. He had blood all over his waist and thighs.</strong>&quot;  The police tell us that both victims are in stable condition.</p>

<p>The News adds that the other man, whom Han described as a regular (&quot;We know him, he comes ten times a day &#x2014; he&#x2019;s a young guy with a hot temper&quot;), fled the scene while the guard&#x2014;identified as Kenneth Meeks&#x2014;may have been taken in for police questioning.  There are many conflicting reports: Police just told us that no arrests have been made, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605083930/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8671267&amp;rss=rss-wabc-article-8671267&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;a 45-year-old man has been charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment&quot;; NBC New York reports that the alleged gunman, who is still at large, is around 21 years old.</p>

<p>The owner of a nearby beauty salon<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605083930/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120521/crown-heights/11-year-old-boy-shot-leg-crown-heights"> told DNAinfo</a>, &quot;A lady came by and told us to close the door. This happens a lot. Last year, there were three of them.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605083930/http://www.soscrownheights.org/p/contact.html"> Save Our Streets Crown Heights</a>, a group formed to end gun violence in the neighborhood, had just celebrated an &quot;Art to End Violence&quot; festival this past weekend.</p>
