<p>A high school teacher in Albany gave students an assignment that incorporated some history into it, instructing his class, &quot;You must argue that Jews are evil, and use solid rationale from government propaganda to convince me of your loyalty to the Third Reich!&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505145714/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_persuasivereading.jpg"> <img alt="2013_04_persuasivereading.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505145714im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/04/2013_04_persuasivereading-thumb-640x343-784529.jpg" width="400" height="214" class="image-right"> </a> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505145714/http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/School-apologizes-for-Nazi-writing-assignment-4428669.php#photo-4366034">According to the Times-Union</a>, students at Albany High School were &quot;asked to watch and read Nazi propaganda, then pretend their teacher was a Nazi government official who needed to be convinced of their loyalty. In five paragraphs, they were required to prove that Jews were the source of Germany&apos;s problems.&quot; </p>

<p>Albany Superintendent Marguerite Vanden Wyngaard says that three classes were given the assignment and a third of the students refused to complete the assignment, &quot;I would apologize to our families. I don&apos;t believe there was malice or intent to cause any insensitivities to our families of Jewish faith.&quot; Apparently the school is getting ready for the new Common Core tests, which are more sophisticated. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505145714/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/bad_nyc_teacher_asks_how_many_times.php">Manhattan teacher gave students</a> word problems about slavery: &quot;One slave got whipped five times a day. How many times did he get whipped in a month (31 days)?&quot;</p>
