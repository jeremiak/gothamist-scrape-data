Human Resources Administration Deputy Commissioner Patricia Smith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101847/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/city-welfare-agency-hiring-give-benefits-article-1.1015036">told the City Council</a>, &quot;The alleviation of crowding at our office is a high priority.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101847/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204740904577195452419649954.html">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, City Council member Gale Brewer said &quot;the council has received reports of a food-stamp center in the Bronx with an average applicant wait time of four to five hours. At a center in Brooklyn, people stand in line for seven hours a day.&quot;  And one advocacy group said that 46% of food stamp applicants don&apos;t even get them because of the long lines. Smith says over 100 people have been hired to help address the situation.</p>

<p>The city does offer automated benefits, but applicants must be fingerprinted at centers (leading to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101847/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/bloomberg_cuomo_battle_over_food_st.php">battle over whether recipients</a> should be fingerprinted at all).</p>

<p>To <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101847/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/08/food_stamp_usage_up_70_from_when_th.php">qualify for food stamps in NY State</a>, one must be single and make less than $14,088 a year, or $26,668 for a family of four.</p>
