</div></div>					<p>The St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade has banned groups identifying themselves as LGBT for years, prompting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013947/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/04/de_blasio_wont_march_st_patricks_da.php">Mayor de Blasio</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013947/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/city_council_joins_boycott_of_st_pa.php">some City Council members</a> to boycott the event. But now the parade&apos;s organizers say they are allowing a LGBT group to march in the 2015 parade.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013947/http://nypost.com/2014/09/03/st-patricks-day-parade-ending-ban-on-gay-group/">The AP reports</a>:</p><blockquote>The parade committee, in a statement made available to The Associated Press, said on Wednesday that OUT@NBCUniversal, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender support group at the company that broadcasts the parade, would be marching up Manhattan&#x2019;s Fifth Avenue on March 17 under an identifying banner.<p></p>

<p>It&#x2019;s unclear how the group was chosen: whether OUT@NBCUniversal, which is described on its website as &#x201C;the affinity group for LGBT &amp; Straight Ally employees at NBCUniversal,&#x201D; was invited by the organizers or applied. Parade directors voted unanimously to include the group, the statement said.</p></blockquote>A parade spokesperson said other gay groups can apply to march in the parade in the future. The move may help the parade win back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013947/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/17/guinness_st_patricks_day.php">some sponsors, like Guinness, which dropped out</a> of the parade due its previous stance. Still, the parade&apos;s organizers blamed activists, &quot;Organizers have diligently worked to keep politics &#x2014; of any kind &#x2014; out of the parade in order to preserve it as a single and unified cultural event. Paradoxically, that ended up politicizing the parade.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Earlier this year, Hilary Beirne, of the NYC St. Patricks&apos; Day Parade organization, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013947/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303442704579362874239637970">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that the parade isn&apos;t discriminatory and that it is a &quot;celebration of Irish heritage and culture&#x2014;nothing more, nothing less.&quot; Beirne said gays and lesbians can march&#x2014;they just can&apos;t identify themselves as gay with signs. Beirne said, &quot;There&apos;s another parade in New York City that celebrates being gay and being lesbian, and that&apos;s the Gay Pride Parade. Our parade is specifically for a celebration of our Irish heritage and our culture.&quot;</p>

<p>During this year&apos;s march, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013947/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/17/while_mayor_bill_de_blasio.php#photo-1">protestors along the parade route shouted</a>, &quot;We&apos;re Irish, we&apos;re queer, we have the right to be here!&quot; and &quot;Why can&apos;t queers march in New York? Queers can march in Dublin, why not in New York?&quot;<br>
