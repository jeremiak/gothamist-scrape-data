<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_01_agems.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103735im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_01_agems.jpg" width="144" height="128" class="image-right"> </span>Last month, the Department of Aging&apos;s commissioner Edgar Mendez-Santiago resigned, and now, the city is paying $225,000 to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103735/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/nyregion/01elder.html">settle a lawsuit from a city employee</a> who accuses Mendez-Santiago of sexual harassment.  Apparently former secretary Aurelita Santos accused him of coming onto her: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103735/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/12/23/2008-12-23_sexual_harassment_suit_alleges_former_ci.html">Her lawsuit claimed</a>, &quot;Mendez-Santiago put his hands down the pants of a subordinate female employee in plaintiff&apos;s presence,&quot; as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103735/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01012009/news/regionalnews/sex_suit_costs_city_225g_146757.htm">bragged about his &quot;gypsy&quot; blood&quot;</a> and sent her threatening e-mails when she refused him. The lawsuit had been filed in February (Santos resigned in 2007), but the Times reports, &quot;went unnoticed until Mr. M&#xE9;ndez-Santiago&#x2019;s unexpected resignation, which occurred amid strong opposition to plans to overhaul programs for the elderly...  <strong>The accusations against Mr. M&#xE9;ndez-Santiago tainted the Bloomberg administration&#x2019;s near sparkling record of hiring strong administrators; nearly all of the administration&#x2019;s senior officials have avoided scandal since Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002.</strong>&quot;  The settlement, which states the city and Mendez-Santiago do not admit to wrongdoing, includes back pay, legal fees, and damages.</p>
