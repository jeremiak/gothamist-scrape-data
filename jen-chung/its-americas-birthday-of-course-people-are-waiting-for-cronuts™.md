                            <p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/the_longest_ever_cronut_line_in_the.php">Cronut&#x2122; line was insane</a> yesterday, partially due to the still relatively new flavor: Blackberry. And things aren&apos;t slowing down for America&apos;s birthday&#x2014;if you happened to get over to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/http://dominiqueansel.com/">Dominique Ansel Bakery</a> at around 5:30 a.m. today, and were willing to wait nearly <em>three hours,</em> then you could have gotten in on the Cronut&#x2122; craze action.</p>

<p>Reader Kate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/https://twitter.com/misspinkkate/status/352753629960237056">tipped us off to the line</a> at 7:39 a.m., which she had been waiting on for hours&#x2014;she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/https://twitter.com/misspinkkate/status/352732009140989955">previously Tweeted</a>, &quot;It&apos;s #cronut day! Been here since 5:45, already about 50 people in line. We&apos;re 28 &amp; 29.&quot; Context: She has a baby so she was up anyway! Apparently others in line were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/https://twitter.com/misspinkkate/status/352754528556298240">catching up</a> on Paul Giamatti-Thomas Haden Church boozy buddy movies.</p>

<p>Kate made it in to the bakery to purchase the Cronuts&#x2122; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/https://twitter.com/misspinkkate/status/352764776188870657">just before 8:30 a.m.</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/https://twitter.com/misspinkkate/status/352765389459038208">delivered a positive verdict</a>: &quot;buttery, crispy, flaky, love the blackberry flavor.&quot; (Note: When our Cronut expert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813074020/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/i_waited_on_line_for_cronuts_and_ha.php">waited on line for them last week</a>, he observed, &quot;By 9:10 a.m., the Cronut&#x2122; line had all but disappeared, like nothing but a whisper in the wind, threatening briefly to take us all with it.&quot;</p>
