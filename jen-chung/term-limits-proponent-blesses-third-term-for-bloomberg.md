Because of the unprecedented times, this is welcome news. <strong>To me, Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s brilliance in the financial sector, particularly Wall Street, would be invaluable.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>He also said, &quot;If it wasn&apos;t for the fact of what&apos;s happening today in the world, particularly Wall Street, it would be a different story. But we need [Bloomberg&apos;s] expertise in New York.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015524/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09302008/news/columnists/hes_likely_to_be_hizzoner_4_more_years_131430.htm">Post&apos;s David Seifman thinks</a> this means Bloomberg will return for the trifecta--and could be unstoppable, given his $20 billion in resources.  </p>

<p>Lauder, who says he has not spoken to Bloomberg, would support an additional term but also called it a &quot;one time-event&quot; (he says term limits should revert to two terms in 2013 and then be decided in a voter referendum), explaining, &quot;I was born and bred in this great city. I am a passionate supporter of two terms placed on elected officials. Term limits allowed many new people to be elected to the City Council.<strong> Without term limits there was almost no turnover.  Mayor Bloomberg would not have been able to become mayor if not for term limits.</strong>&quot;  And voters like term limits too--a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015524/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09302008/news/regionalnews/voters_cool_to_terms_change_131377.htm">poll suggests voters will need convincing</a> if Bloomberg runs again next year.</p>
