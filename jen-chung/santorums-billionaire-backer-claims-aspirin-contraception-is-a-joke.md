<p>Foster Friess, who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210433/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/08/foster-friess-rick-santorum">bankrolling the biggest PAC</a> supporting Rick &quot;Google Me&quot; Santorum, <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210433/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/women_used_aspirin_between_their_kn.php">made waves yesterday</a> when he told journalist Andrea Mitchell that he was tired of the focus on free birth control when the economy is not where it should be: &quot;On this contraceptive thing, my Gosh it&#x2019;s such [sic] inexpensive. You know, back in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraception.<strong> The gals put it between their knees, and it wasn&#x2019;t that costly</strong>.&quot;  Hours later, on Lawrence O&apos;Donnell&apos;s MSNBC program, Friess tried to explain his position: &quot;Obviously a lot of people who are younger than 71 didn&#x2019;t get the context of that joke.&quot;</p>

<p>Friess said, &quot;I love the expression. It&#x2019;s not so much what people say, it&#x2019;s what people hear, and obviously a lot of people who are younger than 71 didn&#x2019;t get the context of that joke... ;Back in my days, they didn&#x2019;t have the birth control pill, so to suggest that Bayer Aspirin could be a birth control was considered pretty ridiculous and quite funny. So I think that was the gist of that story, but what&#x2019;s been nice, it gives an opportunity to really look at what this contraceptive issue is all about.&quot;  He explained he didn&apos;t want to make religious organizations fund birth control, &quot;I have been blessed by contraceptives. It&#x2019;s an important thing for many women. it&#x2019;s allowed them to advance their careers and make their own choices. That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s special about America. People can choose. That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s so annoying about this idea that President Obama forcing people to do something that is against their religious beliefs and that&#x2019;s what the issue&#x2019;s about, where Rick Santorum, as I said earlier, you know what his position is, but yet he&#x2019;s never had any attempts, in fact, has even funded contraceptives to fight aids in Africa.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, actually, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210433/http://gop12.thehill.com/2012/02/flashback-santorum-claims-that-birth.html">Santorum has previously said</a>, &quot;I think it&apos;s harmful to our society to have a society that says that sex outside of marriage is something that should be encouraged or tolerated, particularly among the young and it has I think we&apos;ve seen very, very harmful long-term consequences to the society. Birth control to me enables that and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a healthy thing for our country.&quot; So the Republican presidential candidate has taken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210433/http://gop12.thehill.com/2012/02/flashback-santorum-claims-that-birth.html">to disavowing Friess&apos; comments</a>.</p>

<p>Friess has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210433/http://fosterfriess.com/campfire-blog/2012/02/17/for-those-who-misunderstood-my-joke-today-heres-my-quest-for-forgiveness&#x85;/">posted an apology on his blog</a>: &quot;After listening to the segment tonight, I can understand how I confused people with the way I worded the joke and their taking offense is very understandable. To all those who took my joke as modern day approach I deeply apologize and seek your forgiveness. My wife constantly tells me I need new material&#x2014;she understood the joke but didn&#x2019;t like it anyway&#x2014;so I will keep that old one in the past where it belongs.&quot;</p></center>
