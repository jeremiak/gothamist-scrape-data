<p>Another neighbor, William Morales, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104002/http://abc7ny.com/news/huge-drug-bust-inside-bushwick-candy-shop/1399323/">told ABC 7</a>, &quot;I didn&apos;t know they were selling drugs there, you know paraphernalia bag for weed, that I knew, but as for drugs, no.&quot;</p>

<p>Morales also said he &quot;saw a lot of expensive cars stopping off to allegedly buy &apos;candy&apos; late at night, and he said the food inside the store wasn&#x2019;t very appetizing.&quot; He explained, &quot;They don&#x2019;t have anything there fresh, or anything that I&#x2019;ve seen. You know, I went there once and everything was old.&quot;</p>

<p>Two men are in custody. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
