<p>Multiple people were stabbed this morning shortly before 8 a.m. in Riverside Park, near Riverside Park South and West 63rd Street. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128043059/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/01/at-least-four-people-stabbed-on-upper-west-side/">a preliminary report</a>, one of the victims was a two-year-old child. An FDNY spokesman tells us five people were stabbed, and two victims in their 30s were rushed to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital in serious condition. </p>

<p><strong>Update 9:23 a.m.: </strong>An NYPD spokesman says there are four victims in total, not five. Three victims were slashed and are being treated for non-life threatening injuries, including the young male child. One female victim in her 30s was stabbed and is in serious condition. The spokesman said a male EDP (Emotionally Disturbed Person) is currently in custody. </p>

<p>Construction worker Carlos Ferrer says he eats breakfast by that part of the park every morning by 62nd and Riverside Boulevard. He told us he saw a black man wearing a black sweatshirt in a scuffle with people down at park level near the river. At first he thought it was a dog fighting the man, but then realized it was what appeared to be adults protecting a child from a man with &quot;a sharp object in his hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Shortly after the attack, another construction worker told a dog walker that a homeless man took a pair of scissors apart and was stabbing people with one half of the scissor in each hand. The suspect is reportedly under arrest.</p>

According to DNAinfo:</p>

<blockquote>The man, armed with scissors, carried out his rampage between West 63rd and 64th streets starting just before 8 a.m., stabbing a 35-year old man in the stomach while he was pushing his 2-year-old son in a stroller, sources said. The attacker then lunged at the child, slashing him on the arm, sources said.</blockquote>
