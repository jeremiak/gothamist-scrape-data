The NY Times reports that, according to the Vatican, &quot;Susanna Maiolo, 25, a Swiss and Italian citizen with a history of mental problems...tried to leap at the pope after Midnight Mass last year, before security guards stopped her.&quot;  This year, she was successful, leaping over barriers to the shocked gasps of others gathered:</p>

<p>The pope, 82, was unscathed but Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, 87, who was koncked down during the incident, broke his hip.  Currently Maiolo is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118125959/http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/12/25/vatican.christmas.pope/index.html">in a mental institution</a> for observation. The Times adds that Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi &quot;said he did not know whether there would be legal consequences. The Vatican is an independent state and must make a formal request to Italian authorities to take judicial action.&quot; </p>

<p>Pope Benedict gave his Christmas message today and didn&apos;t mention the assault. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118125959/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8430508.stm">According to BBC News</a>, &quot;The Vatican is trying its best to play down the incident. But [correspondent David Wiley] says the Pope&apos;s security is a very difficult issue as the pontiff has to interact with the congregation and many Catholics would be angry if he was only ever seen from behind a screen.&quot;  Father Lombardi said, &quot;If the pope wants to be among people, it is impossible to have total security.&quot; How about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118125959/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/20/nyers_show_up_i.php">Popemobile for inside St. Peter&apos;s</a>?</p>
