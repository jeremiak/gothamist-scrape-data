<p>This Saturday, January 28, is the start of the Lunar New Year 4714. It&apos;s the Chinese Year of the Rooster, and celebrations getting into high gear (there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021653/https://twitter.com/NotifyNYC/status/824346201629872131">fireworks over the Hudson River tonigh</a>t!) and you should start eating a lot of food.</p>

<p>Seriously&#x2014;a big part of Lunar New Year celebrations is about bringing family and friends together, while you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021653/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/07/8_auspicious_foods_lunar_new_year.php">eat auspicious items</a>&#x2014;like fried dumplings, which look like old-fashioned Chinese ingots, or fish, because the Chinese word for fish &quot;<em>yu</em>&quot; sounds like &quot;more fortune.&quot;</p>

<p>Fung Tu (22 Orchard St, Chinatown) has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130021653/http://www.fungtu.com/menu-1/">two Chinese New Year prix-fixe menus</a> on January 27 and January 28: The $68/person &quot;Cockerel&quot; menu has dishes like &quot;Kohlrabi Noodles, Sesame Peanut Dressing, Anchovies&quot; or &quot;Fava Bean Terrine, Mustard Cabbage, Bacon&quot; while the $88/person &quot;Rooster&quot; menu has items like &quot;Fried Oyster Lettuce Cups, Black Moss&quot; and &quot;Porgy, Fennel, Tangerine Peel, Chili Oil.&quot; </p>
