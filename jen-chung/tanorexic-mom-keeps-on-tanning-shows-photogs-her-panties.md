<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_04_pkrentcil.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_pkrentcil.jpg" width="365" height="278" class="image-left"> </span>Patrcia Krentcil, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/nj_tanorexic_mom_accused_of_taking.php">NJ mother who puts the &quot;tan&quot; in &quot;tanorexic,&quot;</a> is out on $25,000 bail after pleading not guilty to child endangerment&#x2014;the 44-year-old is accused of taking her 6-year-old daughter tanning at a tanning salon in Nutley, NJ&#x2014;and she&apos;s been busy.  Busy buying tanning cream and saying that is Snooki &quot;fake&quot; and &quot;fat,&quot; that is. Oh, and flashing photographers.</p>

<p>Krentcil has denied taking her fair-skinned child tanning and she says the severe sunburn spotted by a school nurse was from playing outside on a sunny day.  While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://www.northjersey.com/news/crime_courts/crime_courts_news/050312_Tanning_booth_used_by_charged_Nutley_woman_appears_too_small_for_two.html">evidence suggests she&apos;s telling the truth</a>, her extreme appearance has turned her into a meme and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-tanning-mom-patricia-krentcil-320410">late night punchline</a> (Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;Is she tanning or did she fall down the chimney? She looks looks Wile E. Coyote after the dynamite stick blows up. She&apos;s so tan it&apos;s actually racist.&quot;).</p>

<p>Tan fan Snooki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/03/snooki_discusses_tanorexic_mom_that.php">said of Krentcil</a>, &quot;That b**** is crazy&#x2026;you are not supposed to take kids there. Everyone knows you are NOT supposed to take kids there,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/tanorexic_burned_mRarJWtOFl9opevTFv00WN"> prompting her to respond that Snooki</a> is &quot;<strong>the biggest a-hole in the world. She&#x2019;s fake, she&#x2019;s fat, her [breasts] are fake &#x2014; she&#x2019;s disgusting! When this is all said and done, I&#x2019;d like to meet up with &#x2018;Snoopy.&apos;</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>And in case you were wondering: A high school classmate of Krencil&apos;s told the Post that she was a big tanner back in the day. And a former liquor store clerk claims that Krentcil is a &quot;real nutjob&quot; (and reveals that she and her husband buy three-gallon jugs of wine a few times a week). </p>

<p>With all the hubbub, Krentcil has been tailed by reporters, and she told them yesterday she was buying more tanning cream. Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/05/tanning-mom-burned-daughter-flashes-panties-photos">Radar tells the world</a>, &quot;Krentcil, who spent the morning shopping at her local Target store, let it all hang out by going braless under a tight tank top and wearing an incredibly short skirt that exposed her matching white panties, while she tended to her shrubbery.&quot; Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/05/tanning-mom-burned-daughter-flashes-panties-photos">there are pictures</a>.</p>

<p>The owner of the tanning salon that Krentcil visits believes that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505232134/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/tanorexic_nj_mom_tans_about_20_days.php">she&apos;s been using self-tanner</a>&#x2014;and denies that his salon would let a child in.</p>
