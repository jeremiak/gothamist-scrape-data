Because a constituent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523031930/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2012/01/jersey_city_assemblyman_apolog.html">noticed that his Facebook status said</a>, &quot;We are not going to just lay down, we come to play. Who the hell do you think we are the DALLAS COWGIRLS OR THOSE GAYBIRDS FROM PHILLY...NO WE ARE THE NEW YORK GIANTS.&quot;</p>

<p>Mainor told the Jersey Journal that he was watching the game with friends; while he had written the beginning half of the post, a friend wrote the rest.  &quot;I have to take full responsibility because it was under my name,&quot; he said. &quot;I have no excuse, other than me not looking before he did send the post.&quot; And the head of Garden State Equality, Steven Goldstein, told the Journal that the comments were &quot;inadvisable&quot; but &quot;I don&#x2019;t believe, from what I know of Assemblyman Mainor, that they reflect any deep prejudice on his part. He is a good and decent man who made an unfortunate misstep here.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, we thought politicians were going to be more careful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523031930/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php">with social networking</a>.</p>
