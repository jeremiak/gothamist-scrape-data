<p>The police released surveillance video taken at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141416/http://www.yelp.com/biz/caselnova-brooklyn">Caselnova</a> (located at 215 Columbia Street) on July 9th. The break-in happened at 11 a.m.&#x2014;the NYPD says that the suspect, 50-year-old Johnny Valentin, removed a window pane and then unlocked the front door to enter. &quot;Once inside, the suspect removed a bottle of tequila and an undetermined amount of money.&quot;</p>
