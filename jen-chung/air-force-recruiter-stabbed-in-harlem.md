Sara Charles (pictured) was &quot;walking from the recruiting center on 125th Street...when she was approached by Lashawn Linton, 28.&quot;  Apparently Linton&#x2014;who had &quot;just lefther therapist&apos;s office&quot;&#x2014;&quot;didn&apos;t like the way Charles looked at her and the two began to exchange words,&quot; culminating in Linton allegedly &quot;whipp[ing] out a knife and plung[ing] it into the eight-year veteran&apos;s chest, stomach and leg.&quot; A vendor, Aboubacar Lah, who saw Charles running and then tried to shield her from Linton was also slashed when he grabbed the knife.
