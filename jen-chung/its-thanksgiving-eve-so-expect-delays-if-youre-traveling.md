<p>If there was ever a time for the gritted teeth &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_9MglZrhs">Serenity Now</a>&quot; mantra, it&apos;s this Thanksgiving. And with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://newsroom.aaa.com/2016/11/aaa-48-7-million-americans-travel-thanksgiving/">48.7 million Americans expected</a> to hit the trains, planes and automobiles (89% of them by car) to feast on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/turducken_tsa_psa.php">Turducken</a>, we&apos;re all going to have to remember that patience is its own reward:</p>

<p>The AAA says that there are one million more Thanksgiving travelers this year than last, which makes it &quot;the most Thanksgiving travelers since 2007.&quot; And for every person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=worried%20about%20thanksgiving%20politics">worried about wading into politics</a> at a gathering when you&apos;re supposed to be thankful for friends and family, there are many more who are getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/22/health/thanksgiving-holiday-conversation-survival-guide-trnd/">ready to throw down</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://sfist.com/2016/11/19/zuckerberg_walks_back_his_dismissal.php">shatter the Facebook echo chamber</a> with some <em>real talk.</em> In the end, hopefully we can all set aside our differences for a few minutes and just share some damn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://www.glennbeck.com/2016/11/18/piecaken-raspberry-pie-nestled-in-a-flourless-dark-chocolate-cake/">Piecaken</a>.</p>

<p>Another reason why so many people are traveling this year: Cheap gas prices! &quot;Thanksgiving gas prices second-cheapest in nearly a decade...Most U.S. drivers will pay the second-cheapest Thanksgiving gas prices since 2008, when the national average was $1.85,&quot; according to the AAA. </p>

<p>Also, those flying shouldn&apos;t experience those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/tsa_lines_eternal_damnation.php">insane TSA security lines</a> we had earlier this year; CBS News&apos; travel editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/23/thanksgiving-travel/">Peter Greenberg explains</a>, &quot;[The TSA is] more ready then they were last May, they&#x2019;ve gotten their act together, they&#x2019;ve staffed better, they&#x2019;ve had budget help from Congress to do that.&quot;</p>

<p>If your travels are closer to home, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://www.mta.info/news-thanksgiving-holiday-subways-buses-lirr-metro-north/2016/11/21/additional-service-parade-well">MTA</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&amp;PRESS_RELEASE_ID=3095">NJ Transit </a>have added extra service for today.</p>

<p>And don&apos;t forget to take a moment to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021854/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/22/thanksgiving_advice.php">be thankful for all the good and love in your life</a> and that you see in others. </p>
