<p>Police officers responding to a 911 call about a burglary fatally shot a suspect in Brooklyn last night. Chief James O&apos;Neill said that while officers were pursuing the alleged burglar, &quot;The suspect pointed a revolver at the sergeant. Both the sergeant and another uniformed member of the service discharged their service weapons.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident unfolded at 2271 78th Street, a three-story home in the Bensonhurst, when two men allegedly held up a family of eight, including an infant, in a home invasion robbery. The suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111513/http://abc7ny.com/news/1-still-at-large-after-home-invasion-police-involved-shooting-in-brooklyn/1423192/">posed as construction workers</a>, wearing uniforms and hard hats. WABC 7 reports, &quot;When they got inside, they pulled their guns and rounded up the residents of the home including seven adults and a baby, then started robbing the place.&quot;</p>

<p>Police arrived at 6:30 p.m., and apparently saw one of the men heading to the third floor. The alleged home invader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111513/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/nyregion/man-killed-by-officers-responding-to-burglary-report-in-brooklyn.html?_r=0">shoved the air-conditioning unit</a> out of a window, Chief O&apos;Neill said, and headed down a fire escape. </p>

<p>&quot;After scaling a fence onto Stillwell Avenue, the suspect was confronted by a uniformed sergeant,&quot; O&apos;Neill explained. &quot;The suspect pointed a revolver at the sergeant. Both the sergeant and another uniformed member of the service discharged their service weapons.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_07_homeinvi.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111513im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_07_homeinvi.jpg" width="640" height="447"> <br> <i> 78th Street in Bensonhurst (Google Maps)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The 39-year-old suspect, who was shot twice, was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital. O&apos;Neill also said that the sergeant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111513/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/11/suspect-brooklyn-police-shooting/">was very close to the suspect</a>: &quot;It was close. As the suspect came over the wall, the sergeant was right there, so he had to actually push his arm away. So it was close, real close.&quot;</p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111513/https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/752652274028150784">noted they found a revolver at the scene</a>. None of the residents in the home were injured.</p>

<p>A second suspect, described as a heavy-set man in his 30s,  is still at large; he was possibly wearing a yellow construction hat when he fled. </p>

<p>The news of the home invasion shocked the neighborhood as police flooded the area. One resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111513/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/11/suspect-brooklyn-police-shooting/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;You never hear of anything like this happening around here. This is a very safe neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the second police-involved shooting in two days; on Sunday morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111513/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/10/1_injured_during_police-involved_sh.php">a man who allegedly waved his gun</a> at cops in Prospect Lefferts Gardens was shot and wounded by an officer. </p>
