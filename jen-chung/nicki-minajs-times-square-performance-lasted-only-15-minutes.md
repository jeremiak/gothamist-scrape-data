</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, a huge blue box was constructed in Times Square&apos;s Duffy Square for a special free musical performance&#x2014;which turned out to be for Nicki Minaj, who was helping Nokia launch its new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://www.nokia.com/us-en/products/phone/lumia900/">Lumia 900</a>. Fans had been waiting hours before Minaj showed up at 7:30 p.m. and she performed for ... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/minaj-15-minutes-times-square-article-1.1057825?localLinksEnabled=false">15 minutes</a>.  Well, it <em>was</em> free! And it wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/worlds_most_depressing_video_featur.php">in the basement of Loehmann&apos;s</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682689/nicki-minaj-starships-remix.jhtml">Minaj told MTV that footage from the show</a> would be used in the &quot;Starships Remix&quot; video that&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://www.youtube.com/user/nokia/videos">on Nokia&apos;s Youtube page</a> sometime today, &quot;All the fans that were in Times Square tonight will get to be in the video, which is gonna be super exciting for them to see themselves. I&apos;m actually really interested in seeing it; I didn&apos;t really know how they were going to make it all happen.&quot;  Come on, Nicki&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/catholic_league_on_nicki_minajs_gra.php">you know the Pope</a>.</p>

<p>As for the performance itself, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://www.billboard.com/column/the-juice/nicki-minaj-lights-up-times-square-1006699352.story#/column/the-juice/nicki-minaj-lights-up-times-square-1006699352.story">Billboard reports</a>, &quot;Through out her 15-minute set, Minaj switched from the rapping fist-pumper to an adlibbing hypewoman -- few singing in between. But it turns out her vocal chords weren&apos;t needed much as thousands of wigged out Barbz and middle class tourists belt out all the lyrics to &apos;Starships,&apos; &apos;Right By My Side&apos; and Nicki&apos;s cross-over blessing, &apos;Super Bass.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Minaj&apos;s new album, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://mypinkfriday.com/">Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</a>, was released on Tuesday; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110060929/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/04/03/nicki-minajs-new-album-pink-friday-roman-reloaded-review-revue/">reviews seem poor to mixed</a>.  She was also on the Today Show yesterday:</p>
