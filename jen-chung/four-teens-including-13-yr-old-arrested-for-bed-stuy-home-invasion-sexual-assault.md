<p>The suspects wore ski masks and apparently followed a 24-year-old man to the Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment he shares with his 22-year-old girlfriend and a roommate.  Cops says they made their way in by showing a gun and tied up the boyfriend before sexually assaulting the woman (they allegedly tied her down, too). The suspects were in the apartment for an hour before taking cash and credit cards, three laptops, jewelry, and a cell phone, say police.  The roommate came back, discovered the couple, and called 911.</p>
