<p>The Russian tourist who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/24/video_man_arrested_for_mid-day_stro.php">decided to climb the Brooklyn Bridge</a>, all the way up to the tower on the Brooklyn side, was in court Sunday to face charges.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://nypost.com/2014/08/25/tourist-who-climbed-brooklyn-bridge-i-did-it-for-fun/"> A prosecutor said,</a> &quot;The defendant stated in sum and substance that he did it for fun.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, the NYPD and Mayor de Blasio aren&apos;t having any fun. In fact, after the July 22 incident where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/nypd_flag_bridge_germans.php">German artists took the American flags off</a> both Brooklyn Bridge towers and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/surrender_brooklyn_mysterious_white.php">swapped them out with white flags</a>, Police Commissioner Bratton was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/brooklyn_bridge_white_flags.php">upset that the security breach occurred</a> and promised that patrols would be stepped up. </p>

<p>The climber, Yaroslav Kolchin, 24, was part of a tour group from Russia. His lawyer said that he had recently graduated from a university there and worked in advertising. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/nyregion/tourist-is-held-after-climb-on-brooklyn-bridge-cable.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>Mayor de Blasio said Mr. Kolchin had entered the bridge on the public walkway that runs down its center, but then made his way past a security gate and onto a cable, which is off limits to the public but has guide wires for bridge workers.<p></p>

<p>The police sergeant who spotted him called in helicopters, police boats and emergency service officers. Mr. Kolchin made it to the tower&#x2019;s platform, walked back and forth and took several photos with his iPhone, as a crowd gathered below, the police said. Then, with a helicopter next to him, he walked back down the cable toward Brooklyn and was arrested.</p></blockquote>However, he did not post those photographs to his social media yet&#x2014;where&apos;s the fun in that?! <p></p>

This individual should have known better, it&apos;s quite obvious this was not a place for an individual citizen to go.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/25/tourist-in-custody-passport-surrendered-in-brooklyn-bridge-climb/">He added</a>, &quot;You can hold me accountable and Commissioner (William) Bratton accountable.&#x201D; Still, de Blasio pointed out that the police response was fast.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_08_kolchin2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_08_kolchin2.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Yaroslav Kolchin in court today (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Kolchin, who was charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass, was required to turn in his Russian passport and was held on $5000 bail. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014157/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/25/tourist-in-custody-passport-surrendered-in-brooklyn-bridge-climb/">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, Kolchin&apos;s lawyer said he has been staying at the Globetrotters Hotel in Bed-Stuy and wanted to cooperate: &quot;The judge...said the defendant could potentially get a new passport at the Russian consulate and set bail at $5,000 cash or bond. But, in a nod to Mr. Kolchin&#x2019;s circumstances, he also urged the district attorney&#x2019;s office to press ahead with the case swiftly. &apos;You should have some kind of offer for him this Friday; this is not a complicated case,&apos; the judge said.&quot;</p>
