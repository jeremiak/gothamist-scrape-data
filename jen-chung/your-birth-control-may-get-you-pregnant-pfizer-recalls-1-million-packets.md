<p>Uh-oh: Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is r<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202061039/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/pfizer-recalls-28-lots-birth-control-pills-15483046#.TylIjeNAYU8">ecalling 1 million packets of birth controls pills</a> &quot;because of a packaging error that could leave women with an inadequate dose of the hormone-based drugs and raise the risk that they will get pregnant accidentally,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202061039/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/pfizer-recalls-28-lots-birth-control-pills-15483046#.TylIjeNAYU8">reports the AP</a>.  </p>

<p>The affected pills are 14 lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of generic Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol tablets, all of which are marketed under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202061039/http://www.akrimax.com/">Akrimax Pharmaceuticals brand</a>. See, what happened was that some of the packets had too many active tablets, while some had too few. The FDA says, &quot; As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, and at risk for unintended pregnancy. These packaging defects do not pose any immediate health risks. However, consumers exposed to affected packaging should begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately. Patients who have the affected product (lot numbers are provided below) should notify their physician and return the product to the pharmacy. &quot; </p>
