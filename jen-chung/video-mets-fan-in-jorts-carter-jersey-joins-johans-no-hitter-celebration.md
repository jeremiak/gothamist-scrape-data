</div></div>					<p>Last night, in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/amazin_johan_santana_pitches_first.php#photo-1">thrill of his no-hitter</a>&#x2014;the first in Mets history&#x2014;Johan Santana was swarmed by his teammates...and one really ballsy fan.  A man, wearing a Gary Carter &quot;8&quot; jersey and a pair of jean shorts (jorts), joined the ecstatic players for a few brief moments until being tackled by stadium security.  Let&apos;s watch it!</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/vyrIeE9Ubq8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, he was arrested.  The NYPD tells us that two individuals were arrested at CitiField last night: Rafael Diaz, 32, of Massapequa and John Ries, 25, of Ronkokoma. Both were charged with interfering with a sporting event (there&apos;s no information about which is the one was in the huddle).  </p>

<p>The city&apos;s law <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/02/getting_between.php">prohibiting interfering with sporting events</a> is thanks to fashion designer Calvin Klein, who famously got up from his courtside seat at Madison Square Garden to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432/http://gothamist.com/2003/04/05/calvin_klein_checks_into_hazelden.php">talk to Latrell Sprewell during a Knicks game in 2003</a>.</p>

<p>When CitiField opened in 2009, a man<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/12/essentially_naked_man_almost_ran_on.php"> wearing a thong&#x2014;and a stuffed animal monkey</a>&#x2014; ran onto the field.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/13/video_of_mets_streaker_from_his_bes.php">Craig Coakley was arrested</a> (though his base running was lauded by the Post), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/11/citi_field_streaker_gets_community.php">fined $3,000</a> and sentenced to 20 days of community service&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150432/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/citi_field_streaker_so_sad_hell_nev.php">banned FOR LIFE from City Field, Key Span Park, and any other Mets venue</a>. So, Raphael and John&#x2014;hope it was worth it!</p>
