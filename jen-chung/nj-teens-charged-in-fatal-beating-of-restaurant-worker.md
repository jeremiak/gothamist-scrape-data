Last Saturday, Mazeriego stopped to sit on a park bench after his shift as a restaurant dishwasher and took off his shirt.  A teen sat next to him, while another teen behind the bench took the shirt and put it over the 47-year-old&apos;s head. That&apos;s when the seated teen got up and starting punching Mazeriego in the face&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180259/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7567547">all caught on video and circulated </a>amongst the town&apos;s teens. </p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180259/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/at_least_a_dozen_witnesses_wer.html">told the Star-Ledger</a> that at least a dozen people watched the ultimately deadly beating, &quot;We never thought the guy would die.&quot; Mazeriego, who was married with four children, was an immigrant from El Salvador who had been in the U.S. for 13 years.  Summit Mayor Jordan Giatt said, &quot;I&#x2019;m shocked. I&#x2019;m saddened. It&#x2019;s not at all the character of our community. It&#x2019;s a wake-up call to the world we live in. I just can&#x2019;t get my head around it,&quot; but some are wondering if it&apos;s a hate crime.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old teen who administered the beating and an 18-year-old were charged with manslaughter. And, last month, five teens, four 17-year-olds and one 16-year-old, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180259/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/two_more_teenagers_are_charged.html">allegedly beat 49-year-old Divyendu Sinha</a> to death outside of Sinha&apos;s Old Bridge, NJ home.  Police believe the attack was unprovoked: Sinha, a former professor and scientist, was walking with his wife and two sons when the teen got out of a car.  The suspects face charges including murder.</p>
