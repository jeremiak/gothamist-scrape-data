<p>At least two people used a Brooklyn woman&apos;s personal information to buy Rolex watches and $10,000 of items at Saks Fifth Avenue last fall, and police are still searching for the suspects. Today the NYPD released photographs of two alleged perpetrators, in hopes the public can help identify the grand larceny suspects.</p>

<p>The victim, 34, contacted the police on November 28th, 2016 when her creditors &quot;notified her&quot; about unusual activity. According to the NYPD, &quot;A subsequent and ongoing investigation revealed that the victim&apos;s personal information was used to make unauthorized purchases on existing lines of credit and to open new lines of credit in order to make additional unauthorized purchases, all together in excess of $30,000.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say a female suspect (pictured above, right) bought two Rolex watches, totaling $18,889.81, at the midtown Tourneau store on East 57th Street on November 22nd, 2016.
