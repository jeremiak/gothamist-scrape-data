</div></div><p>It is traditional that the winner of the Westminster Dog Show dines on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/13/top_dog_the_num.php">celebratory meal at Sardi&apos;s</a>, but now the Department of the Health tightening its leash on the practice: Starting next year, Westminster champions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bloomberg_kicks_dog_F4vrzab86MMiSVyjgx87jK">will no longer be allowed to dine at Sardi&apos;s or ANY OTHER RESTAURANT</a>.</p>

<p>DOH spokesman John Kelly punned it up, &quot;We can&#x2019;t be expected to just roll over for the champ. Our primary concern is making sure people and pets follow the doggone rules &#x2014; ideally without whining or begging.&quot;  Which means<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/heres_the_imperial_pekingese_toy_do.php"> this year&apos;s winner, Pekingese Malachy</a>, is the last one to enjoy the spoils of victory&#x2014;Malachy chowed on chicken and rice yesterday.</p>

<p>While Sardi&apos;s pointed out that Malachy was in a private room, it&apos;s reassuring to know that the DOH is just being as nannying as it is towards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/23/matilda.php">fancy hotel cats</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/video_exotic_bodega_cats_caught_on.php">bodega cats</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  Now the Health Department has found a way to make sure Westminster dogs have their day: CityRoom reports the Westminster champion can eat at Sardi&apos;s with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/for-champion-dogs-the-traditional-sardis-feast-will-continue/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">waiver from the Health Commissioner</a>.  Now, if only the Health Department would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/the_doh_photoshopped_an_ad_who_care.php">create some scaremongering</a> ads <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217080719/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/21/fat_pets_are_getting_fatter_thanks.php">about obese pets</a>.</p>
