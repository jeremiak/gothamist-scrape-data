										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_piggbank.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161011045015im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_piggbank.jpg" width="170" height="209" class="image-left"> </span>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161011045015/http://www.cssny.org/research/unheard_third/">survey</a> of low-income New Yorkers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161011045015/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20091006/FREE/910069985">Crain&apos;s reports</a> that &quot;two-thirds have less than $1,000 in savings to fall back on should even tougher times hit, while one-third have no savings at all.&quot;</p>

<p>The Community Service Society, which conducted the survey, points out that one-third of all New York voters is a low-income New Yorker. (Low-income is defined as &quot;those earning less than 200% of the federal poverty level, or less than $36,000 for a family of three.&quot;) Other findings: 59% of those low-income respondents are worried that a household member will lose a job, the number of workers receiving health insurance dropped, as well as the number of those receiving prescription drug coverage and paid sick leave.</p>

<p>CSS president David Jones told Crain&apos;s, &#x201C;New Yorkers who are living in poverty are really frantic, scrambling to make ends meet.&quot;   </p>
