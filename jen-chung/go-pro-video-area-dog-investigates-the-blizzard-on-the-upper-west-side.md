<p>When it was clear that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063201/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/23/hey_i_think_its_snowing_outside.php">snow storm was no joke</a>, I decided to take my brother&apos;s dog Fozzie out to Riverside Park&#x2014;and then added another level of difficulty to the whole endeavor by attaching a GoPro to his chest.</p>

<p>My cinematographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063201/https://www.instagram.com/p/BA46Ef6Nl43/?taken-by=chungjen">may have been pretty reluctant</a> at first, but he was thrilled by the snow. He thinks he&apos;s human, so I&apos;m sure he was wondering why he couldn&apos;t sled down the hills at West 69th Street. (He also managed to shake the GoPro <em>off</em> his harness at one point.) Then we ran (into the winds and rapidly falling snow) to West 72nd Street, where all the cool dogs were hanging out at the dog run. </p>

<p>Have fun and enjoy today&apos;s sunny day!</p>
