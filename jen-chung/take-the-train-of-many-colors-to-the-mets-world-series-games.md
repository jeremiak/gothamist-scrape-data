</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171453/http://gothamist.com/tags/mets">Ya gotta believe</a>&#x2014;and take mass transit to Games 4 and 5 of the World Series. The MTA has a lot of options so you can start your pre-game with other Mets fans on the 7 train, bus or LIRR.</p>

<p>The Train of Many Colors, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171453/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/18/7_train_of_many_colors_takes_mets_f.php">rolled out during the NLCS</a>, will be on the tracks again tonight and tomorrow night. According to the MTA, the train &quot;will leave 34-Hudson Yards at 6:30 p.m., making express stops to Flushing-Main Street.  The strictly old-school, 11-car Flushing Line train is made up of IRT cars manufactured between 1948 and 1964.  The varying color schemes represent several different eras in subway history, including the redbirds and the striking two-tone robin&#x2019;s egg blue and cream World&#x2019;s Fair colors.&quot;</p>

<p>The regular 7 train is in service of course, and after the game, there will be &quot;special super-express 7 trains timed to depart after the last out. After leaving the game, these trains stop at 61 St-Woodside, Queensboro Plaza, Court Square, and all stops in Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171453/http://bustime.mta.info/#Q48">Q48</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171453/http://bustime.mta.info/#Q19">Q19</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171453/http://bustime.mta.info/#Q66">Q66</a> also go to Citi Field. And let&apos;s  not forget about the LIRR.</p>

<p>The MTA says, &quot;The LIRR&#x2019;s Mets-Willets Point station is just 19 minutes from Penn Station and 27 minutes from Port Washington. Fans traveling from Long Island on other branches can reach Citi Field by changing to Port Washington Branch trains at Woodside, just a five-minute ride... Ten trains will depart Penn Station during rush hour, between 4-8 p.m.  Returning from the game, and going to and from games on Saturday and Sunday, trains will run every 30 minutes. The LIRR recommends customers buy round-trip tickets in advance to avoid waiting on lines after the game.&quot; (More <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171453/http://web.mta.info/lirr/Timetable/Branch/Mets-Willets.pdf">LIRR details here</a>.)</p>
