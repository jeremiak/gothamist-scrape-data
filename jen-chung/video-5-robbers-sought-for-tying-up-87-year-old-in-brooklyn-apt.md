<p>According to the police, four men and one woman were involved in the June 15 incident, which occurred in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815033100/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_071.shtml">71st Precinct</a>, which covers the southern end of Crown Heights. At around 6:25 p.m., the woman rang the elderly woman&apos;s doorbell and when she answered, the four men forced their way into the apartment with a firearm. They tied up the victim and took her jewelry before fleeing.</p>

<p>The police released video of all five suspects as well as a sketch of the female suspect. The men are described as being 5&apos;7&quot; to 6&apos;2&quot; tall while the female suspect was 5&apos;1&quot;.</p>
