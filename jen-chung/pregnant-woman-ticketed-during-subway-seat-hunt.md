										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_04_pregnansub.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020045544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_pregnansub.jpg" width="220" height="255" class="image-left"> </span>An eight-months pregnant woman was recently given a $75 summons for traveling between subway cars. And why, given her condition, was she traveling between subway cars? Because she couldn&apos;t find a seat on the 1 train!  Nora Hsu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020045544/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/pregger_gal_told_tough_sit_hX2p9kQh6iaVBOQlMMhcNN">told the NY Post</a>, &quot;I told the cop, &apos;Cut me some slack. I&apos;m 32 weeks pregnant, and I&apos;m just trying to get home.&apos; I was out of breath.&quot; But the officer allegedly told her, &quot;<strong>It doesn&apos;t matter... You know what you did was illegal ... You&apos;ll have to come with me.</strong>&quot;  Hear that everyone: Pregnant ladies <em>are just like regular people</em>.  </p>

<p>The NYPD has been cracking down on violations to the subway &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020045544/http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/index.html">rules of conduct</a>,&quot; for offenses like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020045544/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/21/cops_really_are_cracking_down_on_su.php">taking another seat</a> (even if the subway is otherwise empty) and, yes, traveling between cars. Hsu explained that no one offered her a seat (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020045544/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/30/pregnant_women_find_subway_seats_ha.php">figures!</a>) and she didn&apos;t ask anyone on her initial train car for a seat, &quot;I just walk in, and if someone offers, great.&quot;</p>

<p>She added that she&apos;d fight the ticket, &quot;If I pay it, I&apos;m a sucker.&quot;</p>
