Most recently, he hit an HSBC location on the Upper East Side.</p>

<p>The suspect has a beard and wears sunglasses during his heists. Sometimes he also wears some sort of headgear&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015146/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/10/this_man_loves_wearing_hats_and_als.php">bicycle helmet, cap, fedora, knit hat</a>. On Monday, August 15th, police say that around 12:52 p.m., the serial robber &quot;entered HSBC bank located at 45 East 89 Street... where he passed a note to the bank teller demanding money. The teller complied and the unidentified male fled with an undetermined sum of cash.&quot; </p>

<p>Police release a image from that incident (right); here are descriptions of the first eight reported robberies, plus images from them. The banks are located in Murray Hill, the Upper East Side (he&apos;s been to that HSBC before), and the West Village, and sometimes he says he&apos;s armed:</p>
