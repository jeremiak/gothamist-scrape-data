<p>Someone, probably an idiot, left an unattended Dodge Durango in the <em>middle</em> of the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday afternoon, forcing the police to shut down the bridge to pedestrian and vehicular traffic while they examined it.</p>

<p>Not only was the car left in the road, the SUV didn&apos;t have any license plates!</p>
