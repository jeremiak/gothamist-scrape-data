<p>The man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215935/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/08/nyc_rape_lewdness_suspect.php">accused of raping and sexually assaulting unconscious women</a> in New York City apartments was held without bail. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215935/http://nypost.com/2017/06/08/preppy-trust-fund-kid-accused-of-sickening-sex-crimes/">Justice Mark Dwyer said</a> of the 200-count indictment against Cameron McDermott, &quot;[A] sane person would want to flee the country, and I certainly think there is enough of a chance of that.&quot;</p>

<p>The Manhattan District Attorney&apos;s office revealed that McDermott&apos;s alleged assaults were discovered while Long Island detectives were investigating a series of public lewdness incidents. Between September 2016 and January 2017, five women and a 15-year-old girl reported that a man exposed himself in separate incidents in Garden City; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215935/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/nyregion/videos-at-exposure-suspects-home-lead-to-rape-and-sex-assault-charges.html?_r=0">in one</a>, &quot;he wore a wig, yoga pants and lipstick and urinated on the victim.&quot;</p>

<p>Garden City police arrested McDermott for the indecent exposure incidents in January and reportedly found kiddie porn on his phone. Police then received a search warrant for his Hempstead home and found numerous videos and photographs on his computer and USB drives.</p>

<p>Ms. Kleidman said Mr. Cameron had videotaped himself raping and sodomizing the second victim in an Upper East Side apartment on several occasions in 2013, sometimes slapping her face to show she was unconscious. &#x201C;He meticulously records each of his actions,&#x201D; the prosecutor said.</p></blockquote>The Post adds, &quot;The prosecutor said the child porn was &apos;meticulously marked by age, like &apos;2 years old&apos; and the actions the children are being forced to engage in, such as &#x2018;daddy and daughter.&apos;&apos;&quot; <p></p>

<p>McDermott&apos;s LinkedIn profile notes that he attended private high schools like the Lawrenceville School and graduated from Elon University and that he worked at a Long Island surgical device firm until January. His father, Richard G. McDermott, Jr., the Times reports, &quot;was for years the chief executive and president of Chapdelaine &amp; Company, a bond brokerage.&quot; </p>

<p>He pleaded not guilty to charges including rape, predatory sexual assault and unlawful surveillance. </p>
