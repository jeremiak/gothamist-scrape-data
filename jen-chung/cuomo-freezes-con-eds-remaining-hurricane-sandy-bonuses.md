<p>Last week, it was reported that Con Edison <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160722/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/con_ed_did_so_great_last_year_execu.php">gave four executives $614,000 in bonus pay</a> for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160722/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/08/cuomo_they_failed_the_utility_compa.php">&quot;awesome&quot; job</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160722/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/08/cuomo_they_failed_the_utility_compa.php">sucking</a>) during Hurricane Sandy. Now Governor Cuomo is intervening in an attempt to bogart the bonuses!</p>

<p>Cuomo issued a statement, &quot;In light of the ongoing Moreland Commission investigation into utility performance in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, I have asked Con Edison to freeze the remaining executive bonuses until the Public Service Commission review is complete. I also urge Con Ed to fully cooperate with the Public Service Commission&#x2019;s review so we can ensure ratepayers are protected.&quot; </p>

<p>Apparently Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160722/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gov_con_ed_hock_7YcaMosD073jpJgzEep96L?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">sent a letter to Con Ed CEO Kevin Burke</a> (who got a $315,000 bonus) saying that the Public Service Commission would be checking out all documents related to the bonuses, &quot;Six months ago today, Superstorm Sandy hit New York, and in its aftermath we witnessed a complete failure by many of our state&#x2019;s utilities to provide adequate service to the rate payers they serve.&quot; </p>

<p>Burke then decided to give his bonus back, &quot;After careful consideration, I have decided to return the special bonus granted by our compensation committee, and funded by shareholders, for handling very challenging events in 2012. I continue to commend the work of all of our employees.&quot; But it&apos;s okay&#x2014;Burke still made $1.2 million last year!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160722/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gov_con_ed_hock_7YcaMosD073jpJgzEep96L?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">According to the Post</a>, &quot;The other three execs didn&#x2019;t immediately join Burke in returning their bonuses, as of late yesterday. Craig Ivey, president of the Con Ed subsidiary that provides gas and power to New York and Westchester, got a $146,100 bonus, bringing his pay up to $830,183. Chief Financial Officer Robert Hoglund got an $82,900 bonus that boosted his pay to $721,300. The utility&#x2019;s general counsel, Elizabeth Moore, got a $70,000 bonus that took her pay to $609,142.&quot;</p>
