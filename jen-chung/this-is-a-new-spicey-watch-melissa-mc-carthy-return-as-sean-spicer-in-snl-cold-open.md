</div></div>					<p>Everyone hoping to see Melissa McCarthy reprise her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415091742/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/05/melissa_mccarthy_plays_sean_spicer.php">breathtaking <em>Saturday Night Live</em> appearance</a> as tortured and torturesome White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer got their wish. The show opened with a press briefing segment, and McCarthy, in Spicer drag, bellowed, &quot;I&apos;m calm now and I will remain calm! This is a new Spicey!&quot;</p>

<p>She even took some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415091742/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/06/sean_spicer_snl_notes.php">real Spicer&apos;s notes about her performance</a> and only had one piece a gum&#x2014;a huge, novelty-size piece&#x2014;before tearing into various topics: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415091742/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/kellyanne_conway_never_forge_it.php">various terrorist attacks</a> the media refuses to report on; how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415091742/http://sfist.com/2017/02/09/9th_circuit_decision_trump_washingt.php">President Trump will take the immigration ban</a> to the People&apos;s Court; and Nordstrom&apos;s terrible decision to drop Ivanka Trump&apos;s clothing line. </p>

<p>&quot;Spicer&quot; then showed off a wrist, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s Nordstrom&#x2019;s loss, because these are high, high-quality products. In fact, I&#x2019;m wearing one of her bangles right now. It&#x2019;s beautiful, it&#x2019;s shimmery, it&#x2019;s elegant. And it&#x2019;s $39.99? It&#x2019;s unbelievably affordable. OK?&#x201D; Then McCarthy-as-Spicer yanked up her foot, showing off a women&apos;s pump, &quot;And don&#x2019;t get me started on her shoes, because these babies are a real head turner.&#x201D;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415091742if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbhz3XcNzGU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>We have to think having McCarthy wear Ivanka Trump accessories is a pointed dig at her father&apos;s apparent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415091742/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/trump_spicer_mccarthy_snl.php">unhappiness that Spicer was portrayed by a woman</a>. To wit: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415091742/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/kkk_cool_pot_evil_justice_for_some.php">New Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> was played by Kate McKinnon, who said, &quot;There are two kinds of crime: Regular and black.&quot; </p>

<p>SNL&apos;s &quot;New Spicey&quot; also had more demos with dolls, this time showing what happens with TSA with the immigration ban: Showing a Barbie doll, &quot;We know she&apos;s OK because she&apos;s blonde,&quot; but with a Moana doll, &quot;Uh oh, slow your rolll. We&apos;re gonna pat her down...and then we&apos;re going to read her emails and if we don&apos;t like the answers &#x2014;which we won&apos;t &#x2014;boom, Guantanamo Bay!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spicer&quot; also had a leaf blower to terrorize a reporter and a new, weaponized lectern: </p>
