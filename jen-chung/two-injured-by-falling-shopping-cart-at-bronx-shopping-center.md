The cart was dropped from a parking garage near the Home Depot around 5 p.m. NY1 reports, &quot;Police say a 52-year-old man is now in critical condition and a 30-year-old man who was sent to Lincoln Hospital is now in stable condition.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The two men are deliverymen and one of their friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201194919/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/01/30/two-injured-one-critically-by-falling-shopping-cart-at-bronx-shopping-center/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m standing right here and when we see the cart coming down &#x2014; the shopping cart &#x2014; It crashed on my friend.  Two of my friends.&quot; Another witness spoke to NY1, &quot;I just ran in, grabbed his hand, tried to comfort him as much as I can, but the second one was not conscious at all. We had to actually wake him up. It was just, wow. One cart that hit both of them at the head.&quot;</p>
