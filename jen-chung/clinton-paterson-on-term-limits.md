According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062501/http://blogs.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/8918">the Times Union&apos;s Capitol Confidential</a>, Paterson said, &quot;I don&apos;t really have an opinion on term limits,&quot;  (aside from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062501/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/paterson-on-bloombergs-third-term-a-great-idea/">loving the idea of a third Bloomberg term</a>) but added, &quot;What we&apos;ve got to be in government is consistent.&quot;  And Clinton &quot;said she agrees with her governor by that she&apos;s never been a fan of term limits,&quot; &quot;In a democracy, I think elections determine term limits.  I have no opinion as to how this is going to be worked out in the city.&quot;</p>
