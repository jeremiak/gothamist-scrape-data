<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/anderson-cooper-matt-lauer-today-job-approached/">Deadline reported</a> that the Today Show reached out to Anderson Cooper&#x2014;currently on CNN&#x2014;to replaced beleaguered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://gothamist.com/tags/mattlauer">Matt Lauer</a>. And so goes Matt Lauer&apos;s terrible week, which started with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://nymag.com/news/features/today-show-hosts-2013-4/">NY Magazine feature</a> that depicts him pretty much as the asshole in the whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/ann_curry_leaves_today_not_how_i_ex.php">Ann Curry debacle</a>!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/business/media/nbc-is-said-to-offer-lauers-job-to-cooper.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">NY Times supported the Deadline scoop</a>, &quot;It was so surprising that some television industry executives thought the story was untrue, chalking it up to troublemaking by agents or rival networks. But three people with knowledge of the call confirmed that it happened, and said they too were taken aback by it. The people insisted on anonymity because the call was considered confidential.&quot; </p>

<p>TMZ (conveniently) had an item <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/27/matt-lauer-anderson-cooper-today-nbc-replacement-meeting/">claiming the Deadline item was wrong</a>, &quot;In fact, sources connected with the network and Lauer tell TMZ that Lauer is actually on board with the idea of Anderson replacing him ... and he actually planned to have a meeting with Anderson to sit down and discuss it. We&apos;re told Matt put that meeting on hold because of a negative article that appeared in a NY magazine a few days ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, don&apos;t hold your breath for Cooper&#x2014;the Times notes:</p><blockquote>On the other hand, co-hosting &#x201C;Today&#x201D; would be a drastic lifestyle change for Mr. Cooper, who is &#x201C;not a morning person,&#x201D; in the words of one friend, and is used to hosting a prime-time newscast. &#x201C;Anderson Cooper 360,&#x201D; his nightly hour on CNN, is shown live at 8 p.m. and is replayed at 10 p.m. While &#x201C;360&#x201D; is one of CNN&#x2019;s highest-rated programs, it has struggled in the ratings; it currently attracts fewer than one million viewers at 8 p.m.</blockquote>In other Today Show drama, more outlets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/nbc-wouldnt-let-ann-curry-send-robin-roberts-a-sympathy-tweet.html">have picked up</a> the NY Magazine tidbit how NBC refused to let Ann Curry Tweet &quot;get well&quot; to Good Morning America&apos;s Robin Roberts and People announced that Today Show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605050826/http://celebritybabies.people.com/2013/03/27/jenna-wolfe-stephanie-gosk-expecting-daughter/">weekend anchor Jenna Wolfe is a lesbian</a>&#x2014;and engaged to NBC correspondent Stephanie Gosk and  they are expecting a baby. However, it&apos;s going to take about a 100 lesbian couple babies to make anyone forget about Matt Lauer&apos;s troubles.<p></p>
