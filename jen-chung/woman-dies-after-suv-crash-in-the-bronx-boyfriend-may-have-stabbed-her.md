<p>Earlier this morning a woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173106/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/SUV-Flip-Death-Hutchinson-River-Parkway-Police-Suspect-Homicide-221456351.html">died after her SUV flipped</a> on a Bronx highway, before 4 a.m. The incident, which happened near the New England Thruway, is being investigated as a homicide&#x2014;and the suspect is the 20-year-old woman&apos;s boyfriend, who allegedly ran her off the road in his car.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173106/http://pix11.com/2013/08/28/bronx-female-stabbed-to-death">According to PIX 11</a>, the &quot;man pursued his girlfriend on a high speed chase at about 4 a.m down a ramp on Pelham Parkway in his green taxi onto the the Northbound New England Thruway. After ramming her SUV near Co-op City, causing it to flip, the man jumped out of his car and stabbed her to death.&quot;</p>

<p>The boyfriend, who was apparently driving a green outer borough taxi (you can see it in the above image), was taken into police custody.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Police say that when they arrived at the scene, they found the victim with &quot;multiple stab wounds to the neck and torso.&quot;</p>
