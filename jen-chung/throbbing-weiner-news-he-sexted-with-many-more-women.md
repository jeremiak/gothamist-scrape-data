Just days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004703/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/22/anthony_weiner_is_back_to_twitter.php">re-joining Twitter</a> (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004703/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/its_official_anthony_weiner_wants_t.php#photo-1">main scene of his stupidity</a>), Weiner has granted a series of interviews with various media outlets to remind New Yorkers he would like to fight for them. Oh, yeah, and he knows sexting was stupid.<p></p>

<p>In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004703/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9029302">interview with WABC 7</a>, Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004703/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/watch-weiner-hints-sexting-women-article-1.1326552">hedges about how many women</a> he actually sexted with&#x2014;the public, ultimately, found out about six&#x2014;&quot;Six is &#x2026; It&#x2019;s not 20 and it&#x2019;s not 100... I did it, with more than one person. It was wrong. I was doing it for some time, and I&#x2019;m glad it&#x2019;s behind me.&quot; And, while speaking to RNN, he revealed, &quot;If reporters want to go try to find more, I can&apos;t say that they&apos;re not going to be able to find another picture or find another ... person. The basics of the story are not going to change.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, Weiner added, &quot;I&apos;m going to spend a lot of time and a lot of days saying I&apos;m sorry to people. And say I&apos;m sorry to people watching this interview. But first and foremost I&apos;m spending a lot of time saying I&apos;m sorry to my wife still.&quot;</p>

I guess all I&#x2019;m saying is, for the time being, is just take a second look. And give me a second chance.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Weiner&apos;s multitude of interviews comes as there&apos;s a mayoral forum tonight. Political strategist Hank Sheinkopf <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004703/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/weiner_takes_center_stages_slams_mKagzcMMA6BEVWFao88cUL">breaks it down for the Post</a>, &quot;<strong>It&#x2019;s all Weiner all the time. </strong>This is a purposeful strategy to keep attention on himself and to take the oxygen away from the other candidates. And it&#x2019;s working.&quot;</p>
