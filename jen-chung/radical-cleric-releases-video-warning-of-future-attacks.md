This is the image that we need to present. These American soldiers heading to Afghanistan and Iraq will be killed. We will kill them if we can, there in Fort Hood, or we will kill them in Afghanistan and Iraq.&quot;</p>

<p>CNN reports that in the video al-Awlaki also claimed the U.S. deliberately killed women and children in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He also s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141711/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hmNQ8mg9074QGU6UJazpjgmURdEwD9FSHUH00">salls Major Nidal Hassan</a>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141711/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/09/fort_hood_shooter_had_tried_to_cont.php">went on a murderous spree</a> at Fort Hood, &quot;one of his students...What he did was heroic and great. ... I ask every Muslim serving in the U.S. Army to follow suit.&quot;  Al-Awlaki allegedly allegedly inspired Christmas Day bomber <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141711/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/29/nigerian_terror_suspects_explosive.php">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> and Times Square terror suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141711/http://gothamist.com/tags/faisalshahzad">Faisal Shahzad</a> as well; the AP says, &quot;He is of particular concern because he is one of the few English-speaking radical clerics able to explain to young Muslims in America and other Western countries the philosophy of violent jihad.&quot;</p>

<p>White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that U.S. is actively hunting al-Awlaki and the Obama Administration is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141711/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/23/AR2010052301960.html">committed to keeping the country safe</a> from &quot;murderous thugs&quot; like al-Awlaki. </p>
