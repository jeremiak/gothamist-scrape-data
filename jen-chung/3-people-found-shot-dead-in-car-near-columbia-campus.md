<p>Three men, all fatally shot, were discovered in a 2012 BMW 750LI  parked at West 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue in Morningside Heights.  Apparently a witness noticed all the blood and contacted the police. </p>

The apparent cause of death was a gunshot wound to each of their necks.&quot; All victims were black.</p>

<p>WABC reports, &quot;The car is a newly registered 2012 BMW. It was legally parked on the north side of the street, across from the  Knox Academic Building,&quot; which is where Columbia&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232616/http://www.columbia.edu/about_columbia/map/knox.html">Department of Sociology is housed</a>. Riverside Church is down the street and Union Theological Seminary is also there.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232616/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/men-found-fatally-shot-bmw-parked-columbia-article-1.1091823">Police spokesman Paul Browne says</a> that the $88,000 car&apos;s registration does not match the plates.  It appears the gunshots were fired from inside the car and the Post reports, &quot;It&apos;s believed the shooter was sitting behind the driver when he unloaded, sources added. He then calmly walked away and left the victims to die in the running car, sources said. The hood was apparently still warm when cops arrived.&quot;</p>
