In the other corner is the city, which argued, &quot;These ashes are undifferentiated dirt.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, a judge ruled that the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151326/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/08/judge_city_doesnt_need_to_sift_thro.php">did not have to sift through the debris</a>, &quot;Not every wrong can be addressed through the judicial process. The grave harm suffered by the plaintiffs in this case is undeniable. But the jurisdiction of a court is limited.&quot;  However, Norman Siegel, lawyer for the families, said yesterday, &#x201C;It comes down to this: <strong>Are we prepared to leave hundreds of body parts and human remains on top of a garbage dump?</strong>&quot; He added that, according to witnesses, Department of Sanitation workers used some of the debris to fill potholes. </p>

<p>James Tyrell, who is representing the city, says, &quot;To pick it all up and move it at the costs of hundreds of millions of dollars to taxpayers is not what is called for.&quot;  Diane Horning, whose son Matthew died in the towers and who lead the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151326/http://www.wtcfamiliesforproperburial.com/">World Trade Center Families For Proper Burial</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151326/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/12/16/2009-12-16_relatives_of_911_victims_ask_appeals_court_to_move_ground_zero_debris_from_landf.html">said she found some bone fragments</a> (though it&apos;s unclear if they were from victims) and other reminders of the WTC, &quot;There is no reason for all eternity that my son has to be in the garbage.&quot;  The sister of another victim told the Times after the hearing, &quot;I think the whole thing&#x2019;s pretty deplorable. <strong>I don&#x2019;t think there was any human compassion from the city</strong>.&quot;</p>
