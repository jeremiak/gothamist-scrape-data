Cut to present day&#x2014;Michaels and the Tonys have agreed to settle his lawsuit out of court.  And the video of the clotheslining is still as good as it was in 2009 (see below).<p></p>

<p>After the 2009 show, a Tonys spokesperson blamed Michaels for missing a cue, but the rocker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516090037/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/09/bret_michaels_denies_tony_award_hea.php">denied it was his fault</a>, posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516090037/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/11/busted_bret_michaels_shows_off_inju.php">photos of his injuries on MySpace</a> (so 2009!), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516090037/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/17/dont_worry_tony_awards_bret_michael.php">said he wouldn&apos;t sue</a> in the following days.  But then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516090037/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/25/bret_michaels_sues_tony_awards_for.php">he <em>did</em> sue the Tonys and CBS</a> (which broadcast the show) last year, blaming his brain hemorrhage on the incident, &quot;One of the most common causes of this type of hemorrhage is head trauma -- exactly like the one Michaels suffered at the hands of the Tony Awards... Through his sheer will to live, to see his children grow up, Michaels was able to survive this trauma.&quot;</p>
