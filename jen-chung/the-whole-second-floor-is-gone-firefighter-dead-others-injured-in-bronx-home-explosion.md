<p>Erik Maldonado, who lives a few blocks away from the home, said he was taking his son to school when they heard an explosion... &quot;The whole building shook.&quot; When he was outside, he saw a police officer walking away from the house &quot;bleeding from the ear.&quot; </p>

<p>The home is a two-story structure, and Maldonado said, &quot;The whole second floor is gone.&quot; Besides dozens of fire trucks and a police presence, Con Ed was also on the scene.</p>
