<p>Apparently when you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173403/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/15/nyu_graduation.php">run onto Yankee Stadium&apos;s field during NYU graduation exercises</a>, you also get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173403/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/05/16/2008-05-16_stadium_runner_banned_from_msg_party-1.html">banned from other graduation events</a>.  William Lopez, super recent NYU film school graduate, told the Daily News he couldn&apos;t attend the &quot;salute&quot; to NYU film students but was still proud of his antics, &quot;It was the best moment of my life.&quot;  Well, that&apos;s what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173403/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/nyu_tuition_to.php">pricey tuition is for</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173403/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/15/video_of_the_da_195.php">As video showed</a>, the crowd of graduates and their friends and family were cheering Lopez on.  Though one student thought the 22-year-old &quot;runs like Posada&quot; (ouch!), most were full of praise: &quot;<strong>He&apos;s going to always be remembered as the guy who ran around the bases and got tackled, which is pretty cool.</strong>&quot;  Another said, &quot;There was no need to have him tackled to the ground by four or five people and arrested on the field.&quot;  </p>

<p>Lopez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173403/http://wcbstv.com/seenon/william.lopez.nyu.2.725466.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The school taught me to be a creative person and to express myself freely and it was definitely a liberating moment.&quot;  Liberating enough to have a court date in July.  </p>
