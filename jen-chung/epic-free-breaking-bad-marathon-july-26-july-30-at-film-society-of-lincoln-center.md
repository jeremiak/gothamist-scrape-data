<p>For everyone eagerly awaiting the final episodes of Breaking Bad: You&apos;ll get the chance to binge-watch each season over five days at the Film Society of Lincoln Center later this month. The Film Society is teaming up with AMC to bring &quot;Long Cook: A Breaking Bad Marathon,&quot; from Friday, July 26 through Tuesday, July 30. And then on August 1 and August 2, creator Vince Gilligan and the cast&#x2014;including Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn&#x2014;will be on hand to discuss their favorite episodes and do a Q&amp;A; with the audience. </p>

<p>The marathon is free, but the Q&amp;A;, which will also have Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte and Bob Odenkirk, will be ticketed (more information will be available later at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014908/http://filmlinc.com/">filmlinc.com</a>). However, it will be streamed on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014908/http://filmlinc.com/">filmlinc.com</a>. Hopefully they&apos;ll talk about this scene from Season 4:</p>

<p>The Film Society&apos;s Director of Cinematheque Programming Dennis Lim said, &quot;It is often said that television is in the midst of a golden age, and there is no greater proof of that than Breaking Bad. As this most cinematic of shows draws to a close, it seemed more than appropriate for the Film Society to pay tribute to its achievements by presenting every episode to date on the big screen.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are details:</p><blockquote>Admission for &#x201C;Long Cook A Breaking Bad Marathon&#x201D; will be free to the public. Entry to watch the marathon will be throughout the day, subject to seating availability in the amphitheater. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis beginning one hour prior to the start of the first episode showing each day. Throughout the day, tickets will be distributed as seating becomes available. Anyone attending the marathon will be eligible to participate in a raffle to win a pair of tickets for a special advance premiere screening of the first of the series&#x2019; final eight episodes. Five pairs of tickets will be given away.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;The Perfect Batch: Breaking Bad Cast Favorites&#x201D; will take place on August 1 and 2 at the Film Society of Lincoln Center&#x2019;s Walter Reade Theater. Additional participants will be announced at a later date in July, as well as a complete schedule and ticket purchase information. Stay tuned to Filmlinc.com for updates.<br>
