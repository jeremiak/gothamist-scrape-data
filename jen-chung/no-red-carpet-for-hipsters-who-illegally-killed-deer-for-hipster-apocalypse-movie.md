<p>Hmm, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235908/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120417/manhattan/tribeca-film-festival-movie-crew-illegally-shot-ate-deer-on-camera#ixzz1sIXCGAjk">it was reported</a> that the Tribeca Film Festival Brooklyn hipster apocalypse movie <em>First Winter</em> included a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235908/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/17/hipsters_illegally_killed_upstate_d.php">scene with  hipsters illegally killing deer at an upstate farm</a>, the red carpet for <em>First Winter</em>, scheduled for tonight, was canceled.  Coincidence or does the festival not want to give anyone a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235908/http://laist.com/2012/03/23/kim_kardashian_flour-bombed.php">reason to flourbomb</a> the hipster stars?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235908/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120418/manhattan/tribeca-film-festival-cancels-red-carpet-for-film-where-deer-is-shot-eaten">According to DNAinfo</a>, the TFF is claiming logistical issues are to blame, &quot;We notified the film publicists last week that we were planning on cancelling the red carpet for this event. The festival has multiple premieres each night and arranges red carpet arrivals for events based on where media interest is the strongest.&quot;  Come on&#x2014;wouldn&apos;t there be media interest for a movie that includes killing starving deer outside of hunting season after practicing yoga?  And there&apos;s hipster bathing!</p>

<p>The film is scheduled to premiere at the Loews Village (Third and 11th Street) tonight; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235908/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/first_winter-film40858.html">there are rush tickets left</a>. Here&apos;s a trailer:</p>
