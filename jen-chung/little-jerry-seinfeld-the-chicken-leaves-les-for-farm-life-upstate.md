<p>Little Jerry Seinfeld, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816142757/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/23/mets_reliever_takes_trash_talking_s.php">practical joke chicken</a> that  Tim Brydak bought to rally his teammates, was purchased from a Chinatown market for just $8.  But today, he&apos;s heading to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816142757/http://farmsanctuary.org/">Farm Sanctuary</a> in Watkins Glen, NY for a life <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816142757/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/24/mets_new_chicken_mascot_gets_a_name.php">without fear of being someone&apos;s dinner</a>.</p>

<p>The chicken, originally named &quot;Little Derek Jeter,&quot; has been cared for by Lower East Side resident, Mets fan and vegan Jeff LaPadula and his wife Tisa&#x2014;the couple have been Tweeting about Little Jerry (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816142757/https://twitter.com/TisaLaPadula/status/217216257026572289/photo/1">Tisa</a>: &quot;I&apos;m no Chef Theresa, but &#x202A;#LittleJerry&#x202C; is enjoying his breakfast in the &#x202A;#LES&#x202C;! 1 day to go! @bumblelina1 @Givemethelefty pic.twitter.com/a5pfA0rL&quot; and &quot;&#x202A;#LittleJerry&#x202C; says, &quot;Let&apos;s Go &#x202A;#Mets&#x202C;! And stop eating chickens!&quot; I think he&apos;s serious. http://tryveg.com  pic.twitter.com/xSmiCvp2&quot;</p>

<p>Jeff LaPadula, who likes Citifield&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816142757/http://www.veggiehappy.com/wp/2010/03/perspectives-ny-mets-soy-happy-manager/">vegan veggie dogs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816142757/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120625/lower-east-side/little-jerry-seinfeld-taken-upstate-chicken-haven-by-les-couple">told DNAinfo</a>, &quot;It&apos;s just nice that they [the Mets] did the right thing after they bonded with this bird to save his life,&quot; and even though Little Jerry is nice and gets along with their dog, the chicken &quot;is a little bit on the messy side. He&apos;s young and shouldn&apos;t eat much, but when he does it&apos;s a little messy and a little smelly.&quot;  Wait, he sounds like lots of LES roommates!</p>
