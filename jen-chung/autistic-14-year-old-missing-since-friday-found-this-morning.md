<p>The missing autistic teen who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140522025527/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/18/nypd_searching_for_autistic_brookly.php">didn&apos;t come home from school on Friday</a> has been found in good health. Apparently Eliceo Cortez, 14, had been waiting for his usual Monday morning bus to school.</p>

<p>Eliceo, who is in the 9th grade but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140522025527/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/19/brooklyn-family-continues-search-for-missing-autistic-teen/">has the reading ability of a 2nd grader</a>, was supposed to take a bus home from Leonard M. Goldstein High School in Manhattan Beach, but he never got on the bus and the driver called his mother. School officials thought he went to get pizza with his friends, but surveillance footage showed him at the Sheepshead Bay train station Q line around 2:30 p.m. Friday.</p>

<p>His family and friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140522025527/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/19/brooklyn-family-continues-search-for-missing-autistic-teen/">spent last night distributing fliers</a> in Manhattan Beach, to alert residents that Eliceo was missing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140522025527/http://7online.com/news/missing-brookyn-autistic-teen-found-safe/65150/">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;A school counselor found him waiting for the B49 bus, his normal way to school, Monday morning.&quot;</p>

<p>His mother Nancy Reavis told WCBS 2 that she had begged school officials for an aide to help her son get home safely: &quot;I spoke to his counselor and they said &#x2018;yes, we&#x2019;re going to do something, we&#x2019;re going to do something.&apos; This is what has to happen so they can help me?&quot;</p>

<p>Last fall, autistic teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140522025527/http://gothamist.com/tags/avonteoquendo">Avonte Oquendo</a> fled his Queens school, without raising the concerns of school security, and was found dead months later. </p>
