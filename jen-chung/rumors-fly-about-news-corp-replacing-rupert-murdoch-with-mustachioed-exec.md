And all this comes as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144257/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-18/news-corp-said-to-consider-naming-chase-carey-as-ceo-suceeding-murdoch.html">Bloomberg News reports</a>, &quot;News Corp. is considering elevating Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey to chief executive officer to succeed Rupert Murdoch, people with knowledge of the situation said.&quot;</p>

Independent directors today weighed naming Carey CEO, according to a person close to the board. The independent directors, who didn&#x2019;t make a decision, discussed whether the stock market and investors would react favorably to a change, the person said.&quot; However, Reuters spoke to a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144257/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/19/newscorp-carey-idUSN1E76H1Y520110719">that says the board never met</a> and that Murdoch has the board&apos;s support.<p></p>

<p>The phone hacking scandal had until recently seemed to be a problem<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144257/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05hacking-t.html"> limited to politicians, celebrities and the royal family</a>, regular targets of the popular weekly British tabloid The News of the World.  But when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144257/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world">The Guardian reported</a> that News of the World reporters broke into murder victim Milly Dowler&apos;s phone voicemail while she was still missing and even erased messages to make room for more incoming message&#x2014;that action led her family, who was checking her voicemail, to think she was alive and it also interfered with the police investigation&#x2014;the public became outraged and suddenly a torrent of revelations spilled out: News of the World reporters allegedly hacked the phones of dead soldiers, 9/11 victims and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and paid off the police.  </p>

<p>The scandal has also<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144257/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/world/europe/19hacking.html?hp"> damaged Prime Minister David Cameron&apos;s reputation</a>, because he hired a former News of the World editor as his communications director and was friendly with News Corp. executives, including Brooks, as it has upset News Corp. shareholders, who question the lack of decisive action to deal with the allegations. Murdoch&apos;s friend and trusted employee of 52 years, Les Hinton, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144257/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/15/dow_jones_ceo_resigns_murdoch_apolo.php">resigned from his position as Dow Jones CEO</a> and Wall Street Journal publisher last Friday (he headed News International during the Dowler incident) and now it&apos;s believed that James Murdoch, who is Deputy COO of News Corp. and Chairman of News International and was once believed to be his father&apos;s successor, may be pushed out... with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144257/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/18/elisabeth-murdoch-family-phone-hacking-crisis">sister Elisabeth as a possible replacement</a>.</p>
