When it comes to the Jewish inmates, all rules are put aside.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The blame is apparently on prison chaplain Rabbi Leib Glanz, who was suspended after the bar mitzvah-in-the-Tombs gym news broke out. The Post details some of what he did:  &quot;Twice a week unloaded an SUV filled with food for the Jewish inmates, including &apos;sodas, salmon, roast chicken, roast beef, mash potatoes, vegetables, cakes, condiments&apos;&quot;&#x2014;just like in Goodfellas, though that was Italian food (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013626/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQhBfRDd6G">video</a>)&#x2014;and held a summer picnic where &quot;<strong>Jewish inmates are allowed to cook and serve the food [at a summer picnic], and then they are allowed to sit at the table and eat like invited guests. [When the picnic is over] other inmate workers... come and clean up the place, which usually consist of the black or Hispanic inmates.</strong>&quot; He also gave Christmas presents to various Tombs employees, which helped people defend him when complaints arose. The city is investigating the blowout&#x2014;and Mayor Bloomberg is pissed too!</p>

<p>The inmate who held the bar mitzvah, Tuvia Stern, was in February <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013626/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/12/nyregion/12jail.html?ref=nyregion">convicted of grand larceny</a> related to a $1.7 million financial scam.  And Stern, who is now at a state prison, apparently <em>also</em> held his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013626/http://www.1010wins.com/AUDIO--Bloomberg-Says-Oy-Vey-to-Jailhouse-Bar-Mitz/4580984">daughter&apos;s engagement party at the Tombs</a> right before getting transferred to state prison because the bar mitzvah was so great!  </p>
