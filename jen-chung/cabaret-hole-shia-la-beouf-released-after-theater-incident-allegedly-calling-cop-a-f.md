LaBeouf was reportedly smoking inside the theater, as well as grabbing actors&apos; butt. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114141922/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/06/26/sources-to-cbs-2-police-take-actor-shia-labeouf-into-custody-at-cabaret-performance/">One witness said</a>, &quot;If we didn&#x2019;t know who he was, we&#x2019;d assume he was a bum, literally, from how he looked and how he was acting.&#x201D;</p>

<p>LaBeouf, 27, pleaded not guilt to charges of disorderly conduct, harassment and criminal trespass charges. He was in court with a public defender.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114141922/http://laist.com/2013/12/17/shia_labeouf_responds_to_plagiarism.php">troubled</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114141922/http://laist.com/2014/02/11/shia_labeouf_sets_up_shop_at_galler.php">apologetic</a> actor, was escorted out of the theater in handcuffs last night during Act 1 of the Kander and Ebb revival. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114141922/http://pagesix.com/2014/06/26/shia-labeouf-arrested-for-disorderly-conduct/">According to the Post</a>, LaBeouf was &quot;very agitated&quot; and &quot;incoherent when the police arrived and fell when he tried to get away. </p><blockquote> At the Midtown-North station house, he allegedly became belligerent, demanding the cuffs be removed.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;F-k you. I&#x2019;ll f-k you up!&#x201D; the 28-year-old LaBeouf said, according to the sources.</p>

<p>Cops decided to not take the cuffs off the agitated &#x201C;Transformers&#x201D; star, and he allegedly started spitting, prompting officers to put a face mask on him.</p>

<p>LaBeouf then unloaded on the arresting officer and used a &#xAD;homophobic slur.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I have millions and millions of dollars and attorneys,&#x201D; the &#xAD;unhinged actor said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to ruin your career,&#x201D; he added, then allegedly called the cop a &#x201C;f-g.&#x201D;</p>

<p>One police source said the actor smelled terrible and lied about &#xAD;being in the Army.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114141922/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/shia-labeouf-police-custody-cabaret-show-article-1.1846072">A police source told the Daily News</a>, &quot;He&#x2019;s cursing. He&#x2019;s jabbering away. He won&#x2019;t shut up.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The News reports, &quot;LaBeouf started his rowdy night tossing back cocktails at the Iguana Club &#x2014; just two doors from Studio 54 on W. 54th St. &#x2014; a witness and sources said.&quot; A witness said, &quot;He was sitting there s----faced. He had been drinking all day. I thought he was acting for some bizarre YouTube video. There was a guy sitting directly across from him filming him on his phone.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114141922/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/06/26/sources-to-cbs-2-police-take-actor-shia-labeouf-into-custody-at-cabaret-performance/">Other witnesses told WCBS 2</a> that, on the street, they saw LaBeouf chasing a man who looked homeless. Tina Marie Miller said, &quot;Honestly, I wasn&#x2019;t thinking of drunk or drugs. I was thinking he was working on a role, because it was that extreme.&quot; <b>Update</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114141922/http://pagesix.com/2014/06/27/shia-labeouf-released-after-arrest/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=P6Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">Page Six has video of LaBeouf chasing the man</a>&#x2014;an onlooker thought LaBeouf was hungry for whatever was in the man&apos;s bag.</p>

<p>He did pose with fans though:</p>
