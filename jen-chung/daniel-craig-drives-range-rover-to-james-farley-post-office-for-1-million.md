                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_03_dcraig.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131227152418im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_03_dcraig.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Daniel Craig at the NY Auto Show yesterday (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The New York Auto Show opens to the public tomorrow and various car companies are fighting for attention. Land Rover decided to make a splash by having James Bond/Daniel Craig drive a new Range Rover vehicle into an event at the James Farley Post Office building (okay, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131227152418/http://www.skylightnyc.com/moynihan/moynihan.html">event space there</a>) yesterday. But some of the people who attended were pissed off by his drive-by! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131227152418/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/in_mins_f6CYmEpiv1zSUTRByKiLfL">One person complained to the Post</a>, which claims &quot;He didn&#x2019;t even give a speech!&quot; The Post says Craig was paid $1 million for the appearance that &quot;barely lasted 007 minutes.&quot; Well, he did drive it into the space!</p>

<p>According to a press release, &quot;The film starts at the Land Rover manufacturing plant in Solihull, UK, and details the car&apos;s journey to Manhattan, where actor Daniel Craig expertly drives through the streets of the city, over Manhattan Bridge and through a closed off tunnel to get it to the launch venue on time.&quot; Streets were actually shut down for Craig to drive in Manhattan!  </p>

<p>Still, another attendee moaned, &quot;I couldn&#x2019;t even tell if he was actually here.&quot; A spokesperson for Range Rover said, &quot;We won&#x2019;t comment on our relationship with Mr. Craig beyond confirming that Land Rover supports the charity S.A.F.E., of which the actor is a patron, and will continue its charitable efforts with a vehicle donation later this year.&quot; </p>
