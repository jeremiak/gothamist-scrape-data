<p>Two men were attacked on a J train on Friday night and now the police are looking for six to seven people who might have been involved in the attack. </p>

<p>The incident occurred around 9:05 p.m. on a northbound train on April 7. According to the NYPD, the &quot;6 to 7 individuals punched and kicked the two male victims (a 29 year-old and a 53 year-old) following a dispute. In addition, one of the individuals struck the 29 year-old victim on the head with a hammer multiple times.&quot;</p>

<p>The seat hog complied but that didn&#x2019;t stop the 30-year-old man from getting into an argument with him and six friends he was riding the train with, sparking a fight.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The suspects fled the train at the Bowery Street stop. The victim who was beaten with the hammer suffered contusions to his head and was taken to a hospital in serious but stable condition.</p>

<p>Police shared images of four suspects, all males in their 20s. One was described as slim, last seen wearing a gray coat and black pants; a second was described as having a medium build and last seen wearing a black jacket, black pants and yellow boots; a third was described as heavyset and was last seen wearing a black hooded sweater; and a fourth was described as slim and was last seen wearing a black and brown coat and a black du-rag on his head. The police did not have images of the other suspects, but said they were males in their 20s as well. <br>
