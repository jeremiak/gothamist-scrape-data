<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54811.html">right wing furor</a> over the White House&apos;s invitation to rapper Common to perform last week got the Jon Stewart vs. Bill O&apos;Reilly treatment, as O&apos;Reilly invited the Daily Show host onto his Fox News program to discuss the issue.  Stewart offered his thoughts, as well as his &quot;mad love&quot; for O&apos;Reilly.</p>

<p>In this clip, O&apos;Reilly brings up Rev. Wright and Bill Ayers too!</p>

<p>Last week, Stewart had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-may-11-2011/tone-def-poetry-jam">mocking conservative</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-may-11-2011/tone-def-poetry-jam---lyrics-controversy">&#x2014;read, Fox News&#x2014;anger</a>, pointing out that while critics were pointing to Common&apos;s lyrics supporting cop killers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assata_Shakur">Joanne Chesimard</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumia_Abu-Jamal">Mumia Abu-Jamal</a>, other musicians who have espoused violence against, oh, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama (Ted Nugent) are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/jon-stewart-fox-news-common-outrage_n_860956.html">totally fine with the right</a>, prompting him to say, &quot;This two-time Grammy-winning vegetarian&apos;s invite to the White House has the Twitterverse very upset and by TV I don&apos;t mean people on Twitter, I mean twits, who took the time to ignore Common&apos;s entire body of work save for one poem he wrote in 2007 that they appear to misunderstand,&quot; and even rap, &quot;The truth that you&apos;re stretching leaves me retching.&quot;  </p>

<p>Last night, Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/17/jon-stewart-bill-oreilly-common_n_862885.html">reiterated that point</a>, &quot;Why are you drawing the line at Common? There is a selective outrage machine here at Fox that pettifogs only when it suits the narrative that suits them. This guy is in the crosshairs in a way that he shouldn&apos;t be,&quot; noting that Bono had been at the White House even though he wrote about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Peltier">Leonard Peltier</a>, who killed two federal agents at Wounded Knee.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407122311/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/oreilly-and-stewart-debate-a-rappers-white-house-invitation/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Arts Beat says</a>, &quot;Watching Mr. Stewart debate Mr. O&#x2019;Reilly can be a bit like watch a dictionary argue with a chainsaw (again, we&#x2019;ll leave you to decide which is which), and while the two hosts never quite arrive at a consensus, they certainly seem to have a good time exchanging rhetorical barbs.&quot;  </p>
