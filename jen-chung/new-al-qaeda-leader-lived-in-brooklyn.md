His father preached at Brooklyn&apos;s al-Farouq Mosque until he moved the family to Florida in 1995. Shukrijumah, who sold used cars and held other odd jobs, managed to obtain a green card by lying on his application.&quot;  He went to Afghanistan in the late 1990s for &quot;terror training,&quot; and came back for a few years.  LeBlanc said that Shukrijumah&apos;s knowledge of everyday American life was alarming, &quot;He knows how to get a driver&apos;s license. He knows how to get a passport.&quot; The FBI<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150751/http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/elshukrijumah.htm"> has been looking for him</a> since 2003.</p>
