<p>A livery cab driver illegally seeking fares at JFK Airport was arrested after he struck a Port Authority police officer and dragged the cop.</p>

<p>According to the Port Authority Police Department, Surjit Dhillon, 31, was trying to get customers outside of Terminal 7 on October 7th&#x2014;without being properly licensed. When a PAPD cop approached him and asked for his vehicle paperwork and driver&apos;s license, Dhillon allegedly &quot;sped off striking the officer, running over the officer&apos;s foot and dragging the officer 75 feet.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Dhillon&apos;s Lincoln town car mounted the sidewalk, where he continued to drag the cop, and to the Van Wyck Expressway, where he was finally stopped and arrested. The police officer is recovering from road rash, an injured foot and an injured ankle. </p>

<p>Dhillon, a Queens resident, was charged with felony assault, reckless endangerment, resisting arrest, reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident. He&apos;s being held on $50,000 bail. </p>
