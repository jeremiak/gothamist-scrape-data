<p>The sister of the Boston bombing suspects was described as being &quot;very nice,&quot; while waiting at a Harlem police precinct during her arrest, a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014052/http://nypost.com/2014/08/29/woman-freaked-out-by-alleged-threat-by-boston-bombers-sister/">tells the NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Ailina Tsarnaeva was charged with aggravated harassment after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014052/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/28/boston_bombing_suspects_sister_arre.php">allegedly threatening the mother of her boyfriend&apos;s children</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014052/http://nypost.com/2014/08/29/woman-freaked-out-by-alleged-threat-by-boston-bombers-sister/">From the Post</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;[The ex] was freaked out,&#x201D; said a pal of Roslyn Betances, 23, who was allegedly told by her ex-boyfriend&#x2019;s new squeeze, Ailina Tsarnaeva, that &#x201C;I know people who can put a bomb on you.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;She got into a panic attack and she wasn&#x2019;t even talking,&#x201D; the friend said. &#x201C;She wasn&#x2019;t responding at all.&#x201D; In addition to being speechless, the terrorized Betances&#x2019; face went flush, said the friend, who would only identify herself as Rachel. &#x201C;She was scared. I mean anybody would be, especially with the person knowing where you live here.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Betances has three children with George Briones, who is now involved with Tsarnaeva.<p></p>

<p>Tsarnaeva reportedly denies using the word &quot;bomb.&quot; A source tells the tabloid, &quot;She was very nice. She was crying for a little while while waiting to be interviewed, because she was frustrated being there.&quot;</p>

<p>Tsarnaeva&apos;s brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014052/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/21/officials_believe_boston_bombers_li.php">allegedly carried out a plot to bomb the finish line</a> of the Boston Marathon, which killed three people and injured hundreds more. A MIT security guard was killed in gun fight that claimed Tamerlan Tsarnaev&apos;s life; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was on the run but was later found hiding in a boat. </p>

<p>Tsarnaeva&apos;s neighbors in North Bergen, NJ had no idea she or Tamerlan Tsarnaev&apos;s widow lived in a three-family home there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014052/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/08/residents_react_to_sister_of_boston_marathon_bombers_sister_living_in_neighborhood.html">One man told the Jersey Journal</a>, &quot;\We don&#x2019;t know anything about it. We saw the television people come. It&#x2019;s a surprise,&quot; while another woman said, &quot;Oh wow! That&#x2019;s a shocking thing. Now that I know they live here I am always going to feel a certain way, you know?&quot;</p>
