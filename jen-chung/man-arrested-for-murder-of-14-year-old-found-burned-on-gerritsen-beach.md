Christian Ferdinand, a 20-year-old Maine resident, was charged with second-degree murder. <p></p>

<p>The police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143831/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/07/womans_naked_burned_corpse_found_on.php">received a 911 call</a> on January 6th about a female body found on the beach. A few days later, it was identified as Shaniesha Forbes, a student at the Academy for Young Writers in East New York. Her family had said she ran away from home before and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143831/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/bullying_tragedy_lPY40MLOl5fIa6IghmeWxJ?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">classmate said she was bullied</a>, &quot;Almost every day in science class, they would ask her the same questions... like why she would wear the same weave over and over again.&quot; </p>

<p>Earlier this month, the police announced a $12,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the person(s) responsible for her murder. Her family had also been trying to track down more clues to aid the investigation, and a cousin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143831/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/16/police-suspect-from-maine-charged-in-death-of-brooklyn-teen/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Her last Facebook said she went to the movies, went with &#x2018;him&#x2019; and we don&#x2019;t know who &#x2018;him&#x2019; is.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143831/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bust_in_teen_gal_pal_slay_WJwq1A2pmSIZPqmL8cvSgJ">According to the Post</a>, Ferdinand &quot;allegedly admitted to killing Forbes after coming to believe she was pregnant. Sources said Ferdinand suffocated the aspiring nurse &#x2014; who was, in fact, not pregnant &#x2014; in his apartment.&quot; Sources say that he left her body in his apartment for days and then dumped it at the beach and attempted to burn it. Then Ferdinand fled to Maine: &quot;Cops recovered the suitcase the killer used to transport Forbes&#x2019; body...and also took floorboards from his former Brooklyn apartment, the sources said.&quot;<br>
