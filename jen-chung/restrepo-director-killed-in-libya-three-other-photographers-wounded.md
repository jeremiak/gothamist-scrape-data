Hetherington was in Misrata when he and other photographs were &quot;caught by mortar fire on Tripoli Street, the main thoroughfare leading into the center of Misrata, the only major rebel-held town in western Libya and besieged by Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s forces for more than seven weeks,&quot; according to Reuters.  Three others photographs were also injured, two severely.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171906/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/africa/21photographers.html">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;[Chris] Hondros, an American working for the Getty photo agency, suffered a severe brain injury and was in extremely critical condition, according to Mr. Liohn. He had been revived and was clinging to life in the evening. A later update from Mr. Liohn said that Mr. Hondros was in a coma at the medical center, which is located near the front lines... [Guy] Martin, a British citizen working for the Panos photo agency, had shrapnel wounds and was undergoing vascular surgery Wednesday night, according to the same account. As the night progressed, Mr. Liohn said that Mr. Martin&#x2019;s bleeding had been stopped and that his prospects had improved.&quot;  The fourth photographer, Michael Christopher Brown, suffered shrapnel wounds to his shoulder and does not face life-threatening injuries.</p>

<p>Vanity Fair <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171906/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/04/tim-hetherington-41-killed-in-libya.html">wrote this about Hetherington</a>, who contributed to the magazine:</p><blockquote> The U.K.-born, Brooklyn-based Hetherington, 40, who had dual British and American citizenship, was best known for his work in Afghanistan, much of it shot for Vanity Fair. In 2007, he won the coveted World Press Photo of the Year Award for his coverage of American soldiers in the Korengal Valley&#x2014;one of four World Press prizes he received. Those assignments in Afghanistan served as the basis of the 2010 Oscar-nominated documentary Restrepo, which he directed with Vanity Fair contributor (and his long-time journalistic collaborator) Sebastian Junger, author of The Perfect Storm. The film was recognized for its decidedly apolitical approach to the war. Hetherington also created short films about the G.I.&#x2019;s he encountered in the Korengal and released a book of photographs, Infidel, examining the lives of the men of a battle company of the 173rd Airborne.<p></p>

<p>Hetherington was widely respected by his peers for his bravery and camaraderie. His imaginative, even artistic, approach to photojournalistic subjects led to many honors, including a fellowship from the National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts as well as grant from the Hasselbald Foundation. He released two other films, Liberia: An Uncivil War (2004) and The Devil Came on Horseback (2007).</p></blockquote>Here&apos;s the trailer for Restrepo, which is also <a href="&lt;iframe title=" youtube="" video="" player"="" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-DjqR6OucBc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&quot;&gt;available on Netflix Instant</a>:<p></p>
