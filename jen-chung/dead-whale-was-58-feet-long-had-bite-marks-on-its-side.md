<p>The whale that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012815/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/09/photos_dead_50-foot_whale_and_a_tur.php">washed up on a Long Island shore yesterday</a> was in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012815/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/dead-whale-washes-ashore-at-smith-point-county-park-1.9484268">state of &quot;advanced decomposition.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The 58-foot male finback whale was discovered around 8 a.m. at Smith County Park in Shirley, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012815/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/dead-whale-washes-ashore-at-smith-point-county-park-1.9484268">Newsday reports</a> that Kim Durham of the Riverhead Foundation said that the whale had bite marks on it, &quot;indicating that large sea animals, possibly a shark, had fed on the carcass post-mortem.&quot; She added that &quot;most of the skin is missing from the animal.&quot; In fact, the bite marks were described as being &quot;bigger than a Chihuahua.&quot;</p>

<p>Finback whales are not uncommon to the waters off New York. They are the second largest whales (after the blue whale), growing to about 75 feet in the Northern Hemisphere. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012815/http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/finwhale.htm">NOAA says</a> that there have been instances when finbacks have mated with blue whales, creating hybrids; also, &quot;Fin whales are large, fast swimmers and the killer whale (Orcinus orca) is their only non-human predator.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding the leatherback sea turtle that also washed up, it&apos;s believed the two incidents are unrelated, since the turtle actually washed up on Tuesday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012815/http://nypost.com/2014/10/09/dead-whale-washes-up-on-ny-shore/">Durham said</a>, &quot;We had a spike in sea turtle deaths. Some people will say it&#x2019;s because our water is bad but we had an amazing whale season this summer, which means the food supply is here and the water quality is good.&quot;</p>

<p>Marine biologists will perform a necropsy. </p>
