<p>Yes, because summer is just about here, it&apos;s time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220849/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/coming_this_summer_bedbugpocalypse.php">worry about the predicted Bedbug Reckoning of 2011</a>.  So, thank you, CBS Sunday Morning, a once cozy and quaint refuge from talking heads, for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220849/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/05/sunday/main20069074.shtml?tag=stack">airing a disgusting feature on bedbugs</a>, complete with video of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220849/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bedbugs</a> scurrying on pillows and mattresses&#x2014;including a female bedbug and wee little bedbugs.  Where&apos;s the barf bag?</p>

<p>Cornell University entomologist Jody Gangloff-Kaufman warns, &quot;The adult females are the ones you really have to look out for... They&apos;re visible,&quot; plus they are just waiting to hatch hundreds of eggs.  She also says, &quot;In the worst cases of bedbugs that have gone unchecked, there are probably hundreds of thousands in a home,&quot; and &quot;<strong>The little vampires consume what&apos;s known as a blood meal. They anesthetize you when they bite, so you don&apos;t even feel it, &apos;til you wake up.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Gangloff-Kaufman also runs down what many know already: Look for bites and then look for bloodstains, &quot;Bloodstains like magic marker spots on the sheets are a good indication of bedbugs feeding.&quot;  CBS Sunday Morning also tagged along with an exterminator in Manhattan:  Sam Soto works for First Rate Solutions,  which used to be called First Rate Exterminators; he explained, &quot;If it wasn&apos;t for bedbugs, we&apos;d still be known as First Rate Exterminators. The word &apos;exterminators&apos; has a stigma attached to it. When we walk into a building, people see the word &apos;exterminators,&apos; they get upset.&quot;  He also drives an unmarked car.</p>

<p>Pray for bedbug-detection via farts to be the way of the future&#x2014;and maybe for DDT come back&#x2014;because Gangloff-Kaufman says, &quot;It&apos;s conceivable that at some point, everyone that you know will have dealt with them in one way or another, &apos;cause we haven&apos;t really stopped them or slowed them yet.&quot;  Yeah, we can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220849/http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheDinnerParty.html">put a man on the moon</a>, but bedbugs are literally owning our asses.</p>
