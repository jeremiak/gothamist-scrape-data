<p>Last year, NY Times film critic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130047/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/ny_times_film_critic_to_great_googa.php">A.O. Scott complained</a> about the Great GoogaMooga food festival taking over his and many others&apos; beloved Prospect Park. This year, Scott was trying to immerse in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130047/https://twitter.com/aoscott/status/334725746440429570">defending his pan of <em>Star Trek: Into Darkness</em></a> but couldn&apos;t resist the allure of Googa-bashing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130047/https://twitter.com/aoscott/status/335509708347695104">Tweeting yesterday</a>: &quot;<b>was going to leave @GoogaMooga alone this year, but the footprint is larger and uglier than last time. Olmsted is spinning in his grave.</b>&quot;</p>

<p>The debate about using public park space for event is not new: Last year, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130047/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/extra_mooga.php">delved into the economics of the festival</a>, with the Prospect Park Alliance estimating it would receive around $100,000 for the use of the 29 acres while the concert could gross over a $1 million. City parks advocate Geoffrey Croft told us, &quot;This is a clear example of non-park purpose. While I&apos;m sure the boozefest was profitable to the organizers, the public should not be forced to go to court to ensure our public park lands are protected from this type of activity. While some tickets were given away I&apos;m certain charging $267 a day to drink alcohol in a park and listen to music was not what Frederick Law Olmsted had in mind. A lot of money was generated from this, particularly from alcohol sales. This was not a free concert in the park.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130047/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/a-curious-costbenefit-analysis-of-a-park-fund-raiser/?ref=nyregion">NY Times&apos; Michael Powell reports</a>, it turns out that the Prospect Park Alliance is <strong>only receiving $75,000</strong> for &quot;allowing...Superfly... and some tony restaurants to lay metal fences across the heart of the park, to seed it with dozens of porta-potties and a chariot fleet of golf carts.&quot; </p><blockquote>The festival last year left great muddy patches where grass had been. Paul Nelson, the park&#x2019;s spokesman, played down that damage. &#x201C;It was a couple weeks,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all stuff that is repairable. Trees weren&#x2019;t knocked down. Buildings weren&#x2019;t destroyed.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>We can agree that GoogaMooga was not as destructive as Hurricane Sandy.</p>

<p>But Mr. Nelson&#x2019;s accounting is not remotely candid. I walk my dog &#x2014; or he walks me &#x2014; through this Olmsted beauty four or five days each week. Last year, reseeding the rolling meadows of the Nethermead required roping off large swathes for the summer, which shut it down for soccer and Frisbee games.</p>

<p>Ask about other damage, and Mr. Nelson acknowledges &#x201C;a little used pathway&#x201D; was left broken and cratered, and edged by a 75-yard stretch of mud and dirt. This &#x201C;little used pathway&#x201D; is in fact the principal walking road from the park&#x2019;s lake up to the Nethermead.</p></blockquote>Last year, the festival was Saturday and Sunday&#x2014;this year, it&apos;s Friday, Saturday and Sunday.<p></p>
