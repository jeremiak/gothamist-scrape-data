<p>Now that we&apos;ve seen a glimpse of Lifetime&apos;s reality show about the Russian community in Brighton Beach, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409065911/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/24/video_brighton_beach_the_brooklyn_r.php">Russian Dolls, featuring</a> &quot;guys wearing Adidas pants, leather jackets and gold chains&quot; and &quot;a lot of hot, decked-out Russian girls&quot; (plus some of their in-laws!), what do actual Russians in Brighton Beach think?  Um, how about a community liaison&apos;s slam saying &quot;they don&#x2019;t speak this dirty language and they hate vodka.&quot;</p>

<p>Ari Kagan, who is Comptroller John Liu&apos;s liaison to the Russian community, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409065911/http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2011/07/kagan-bashes-russian-dolls-brighton-beach-reality-show/">told Sheepshead Bites</a>:</p><blockquote>There is no question in my mind that the Russian Dolls series will depict the Russian-speaking community in a distorted way, as a caricature, as a joke. Lifetime does not care about the thousands of great, beautiful, funny, smart and hard-working young Russian speaking women who attend colleges and universities, make money as paralegals, librarians, nurses, journalists and computer specialists. They are great daughters, sisters, wives and mothers. They don&#x2019;t spend most of their time in nightclubs, bars or lounges. They don&#x2019;t speak this dirty language and they hate vodka.<p></p>

<p>Of course, we do have our own bad apples, low lives and criminals, but they constitute a minority in the Russian speaking community. Lifetime wants to create a lot of fun and entertainment by throwing the reputation of Russian-speaking New Yorkers under the bus.</p></blockquote>Keep in mind, some other community members think the title is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409065911/http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2011/07/russian-leaders-brighton-beach-shows-title-synonymous-with-prostitution/">synonymous with &quot;prostitution,&quot;</a> too.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409065911/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-russian-dolls,0,675944.story">One woman told WPIX</a>, &quot;We are not about sex, we are not about drunk people, not about vodka, not about violence,&quot; but another said, &quot;I grew up around here, I&apos;m not Russian but ... I think it&apos;s a little accurate. It&apos;s ridiculous that people say it&apos;s too sexy, because Brighton Beach is a hot pot and sex sells.&quot;</p>
