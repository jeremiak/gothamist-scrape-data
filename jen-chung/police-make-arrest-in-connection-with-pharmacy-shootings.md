The Haven Drugs&apos; pharmacist and pharmacy worker, as well as two customers, were killed execution-style by a man who left with prescription drugs.  The Daily News reports, &quot;The still unidentified man was hauled out of the Medford, L.I., home by police officers who had massed in front of the residence before barging inside.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The victims&#x2014;worker Jennifer Mejia, 17; pharmacist Raymond Ferguson, 45; and customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, and Jamie Taccetta, 33&#x2014;were remembered at a vigil yesterday where residents and relatives mourned the tragedy.  Ferguson&apos;s wife of ten years <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140723000027/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/22/2011-06-22_fathers_day_favor_put_ray_ferguson_in_line_of_fire_on_day_of_long_island_pharmac.html">told the News</a> that he wasn&apos;t supposed to be working on Father&apos;s Day morning, but took the shift as a favor to the owner who wanted to go to religious services with his son.  She also said that her husband, a Queens native who attended NYU and then St. John&apos;s for his pharmacy degree, was a real gentleman, &quot;You go to school for so long to get your degree, you don&apos;t expect to be gunned down. You don&apos;t expect to go to a pharmacy and be scared... I loved his values. He was a great son, husband, uncle, pharmacist.&quot;</p>

<p>And Taccetta&apos;s family says that she will be buried in the wedding dress she would have worn at her October wedding to James Manzella.  Manzella was waiting in a car at the shopping plaza while Taccetta, who had two daughters from a previous marriage, went to Haven Drugs to pick up a thyroid medication; because it took her so long to get out, Manzella <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140723000027/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/victim_boyfriend_bares_his_anguish_jyqqISp5QbX6ysCO6ByNWO">went to the pharmacy and found the blood bath</a>.  He told the Post, &quot;This woman was the love of my life,&quot; and he&apos;s just thinking &quot;if I could have done something [to save her]... Can you imagine sitting there in air conditioning, listening to music, and then the next minute she&apos;s gone?&quot; He added that he saw the suspect, &quot;I could see the guy clearly, and now I think back if I could have done something. That&apos;s what messes with you. We were two average people trying to do the right thing, and this is what happens. It&apos;s not fair.&quot;</p>
