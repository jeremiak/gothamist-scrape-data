										<p>There may be Sex On The Beach but there&apos;s No Sex In The Ocean&#x2014;at least not in Sea Isle City, NJ. A couple from Philadelphia (<em>of course</em>) was arrested on the beach for their amorous activity on Sunday.</p>

<p>Around 4 p.m. Sea Isle City Police summer officers spotted the couple allegedly fornicating in the water near 46th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105007/http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/06/09/couple-busted-for-alleged-lewd-act-in-ocean-in-sea-isle-city/">According to CBS Philly</a>, &quot;Police say a crowd of onlookers began to form. The officers instructed the couple to stop what they were doing and exit the water. An eyewitness told CBSPhilly it took the female a long time to exit the water because she had difficulty tying up her bikini bottom... some families with kids left the beach after witnessing the lewd act.&quot;</p>

<p>The couple was arrested for lewdness in the fourth degree and released on a summons. </p>
