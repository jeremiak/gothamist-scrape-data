While he wasn&apos;t the marquee speaker&#x2014;that was Tom Brokaw&#x2014;he did get to tell the graduates a little something: &quot;I am not going to tell you right here the secrets to success, although it never hurts to be the first one into the office each morning-and the last one to leave. I am not going to tell you how to choose a career, but it doesn&apos;t hurt to pick that first job based on how much you&apos;ll learn, not how much you&apos;ll earn. <strong>I&apos;m not going to tell you how to avoid getting fired, because I have been fired, and it was the best thing that ever happened to my career.</strong> I am not I am not going to tell you how to spend your free time, but there&apos;s nothing more important than giving back to your community.&quot;</p>
