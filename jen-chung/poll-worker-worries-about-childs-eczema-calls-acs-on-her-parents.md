Schiefer brought along his five-year-old daughter to experience democracy&#x2014;and got a taste of bureaucracy when a NYC Board of Elections worker noticed little Elizabeth&apos;s rather bad case of eczema and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162109/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/17797333/skin-rash-prompts-acs-investigation">decided to call the Administration for Children&apos;s Services</a>.<p></p>

<p>The poll worker apparently believed the rash was a sign of abuse, so the worker accessed Schiefer&apos;s voter registration information and called in a tip.  On Wednesday, the Schiefers were greet by an ACS worker.  Jessica Schiefer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162109/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/ACS-Call-Eczema-Board-of-Elections-Voting-Booth-Child-Welfare-149121865.html">fumed that the poll worker</a> &quot;should have just minded her own business, because she started a whirlwind of trouble for this family.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162109/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/17797333/skin-rash-prompts-acs-investigation">Andrew Schiefer said</a>, &quot;If she would have asked me, I would have gladly told them what it was. But for them to make assumptions without speaking to me I found very offensive and uncalled for.&quot; Understandable, but how many parents admit to abusing their kids?  </p>

<p>Elizabeth explained, &quot;Some of it looks like it&apos;s bleeding, but it&apos;s not,&quot; and her mom said, &quot;It flares up and goes away. We see a dermatologist every year to renew her prescriptions and cream and make them stronger.&quot;  Jessica Schiefer added, &quot;It&apos;s ruining our reputation -- I mean, people who don&apos;t know about this situation are going to think we beat our children.&quot; </p>

<p>The family must be investigated for 60 days; Jessica Schiefer called that a nightmare, &quot;I understand there are cases that need to be investigated. But I would have thought once they found out it was eczema they would have dropped it immediately without doing a 60-day investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>ACS told NBC New York, &quot;The Administration for Children&#x2019;s Services takes any allegation of abuse or neglect that it receives through the state hotline for child abuse and maltreatment seriously. Our agency has an obligation and responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation in each case to ensure the safety of children in New York City.&quot; But Jessica Schiefer pointed out, &quot;Even five years from now, we&apos;ll have a closed ACS case on file. So if my daughter falls and breaks her arm, they&apos;ll see my history. And what&apos;s that going to turn into?&quot;</p>
