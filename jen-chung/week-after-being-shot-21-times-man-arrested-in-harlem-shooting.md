(However, it&apos;s believed that the man who did die, Luis Soto, was killed from a police officer&apos;s bullet during the chaotic scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051520/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/harlem_shooting_over_50_bullets_46.php">where 50 shots were fired</a>.)<p></p>

<p>Alvarez and Soto were reportedly fighting during a block party in the early morning hours.  One of the men apparently had a gun (it&apos;s suspected that Soto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051520/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bullet_guy_busted_gggmLEAD10cfMAO6EgbqxJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">may have had the gun</a> but Alvarez gained control of it), and the altercation attracted the attention of uniformed and plainclothes police officers, who then fired after allegedly being fired upon.  Four bullets were fired from a gun found at the scene, while police officers fired 46 others.</p>

A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney&#x2019;s office said that they had yet to determine if there was enough evidence to prosecute Mr. Alvarez on any of the charges. &apos;As in all arrests, the district attorney&#x2019;s office will determine what if any charges are appropriate at this time,&apos; the spokeswoman said.&quot;</p>
