Malia and Sasha apparently sang along to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826215640/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o4GZ6w8WKk">Love on Top</a>.&quot;</p>

They had me on the treadmill, eating lettuce.&#x201D;  Also spotted were Will and Jada Smith, Gayle King and NJ Governor Chris Christie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826215640/https://twitter.com/GovChristie/status/206598622924648448">who Tweeted</a>, &quot;Great show by Beyonce. Great energy, great dancing &amp; she was in great voice. Great night for Atlantic City--beautiful start to the summer!&quot; So, is he still mad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826215640/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/photos_nets_end_35_years_in_nj_with.php">about Jay-Z taking the Nets to Brooklyn</a>?</p>
