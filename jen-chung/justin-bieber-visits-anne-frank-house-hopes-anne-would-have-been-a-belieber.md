<p>Justin Bieber may have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121059/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/21/justin_bieber_3.php#photo-2">protected by the Hipster Cop</a> in New York, but sadly Hipster Cop wasn&apos;t around to protect Bieber from his own ego in Amsterdam yesterday. The 19-year-old pop star visited the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121059/http://www.annefrank.org/">Anne Frank House</a>, where he wrote in the guestbook, &quot;<strong>Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The Anne Frank House had posted Bieber&apos;s words <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121059/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151330276206717&amp;set=a.140434316716.124300.139219566716&amp;type=1">on its Facebook page</a>, &quot;Yesterday night Justin Bieber visited the Anne Frank House, together with his friends and guards. Fans were waiting outside to see a glimpse of him. He stayed more than an hour in the museum.&quot; BBC correspondent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121059/https://twitter.com/annaholligan">Anna Holligan</a> confirmed that Bieber did indeed write those words:</p>

<p>At least Bieber didn&apos;t write something about those f*cking Germans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121059/http://laist.com/2013/03/30/justin_bieber_tries_to_sneak_his_mo.php#photo-1">quarantining his monkey</a>, right? </p>
