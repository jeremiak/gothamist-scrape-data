<p>Whether or not you believe the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202210/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/amanda_bynes_heads_to_court_to_face.php">police who say Amanda Bynes had a bong</a> or Bynes herself who says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202210/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/_view_more_videos_at.php">she has &quot;never had a bong in her life,&quot;</a> you&apos;ll feel downright queasy after seeing this video. Hounded by paparazzi, Bynes was simply trying to enter her apartment building through the parking garage. But one photographer repeatedly invades her personal space by reaching over and removing the scarf from her head, and Bynes feels the need to retaliate with a racially-tinged remark. </p>

<p>After first telling the guy &quot;You can&apos;t touch me&quot; several times, Amanda shot back, &quot;Is it the ugly black one? Oh, there&apos;s another ugly black man.&quot;</p>

<p>When the photog tries to call her out for the racial remark, she responds, &quot;It&apos;s just your face. It&apos;s not a black thing ... There&apos;s an ugly white one. It&apos;s not racist.&quot;<br>
