Across the five boroughs New Yorkers are left to wonder, &apos;Who&apos;s next?&apos;... <strong>How many pepole have to lose their life before Con Edison changes their procedures?</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160920/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/nyregion/27coned.html?ref=nyregion">According to the NY Times</a>, Con Ed says its workers were <i>minutes away</i> from alerting Ghanwatti Boobram to check the home for gas levels when her home on 260th Street in Queens&apos; Floral Park neighborhood exploded.  Con Ed had been on the scene for about 90 minutes and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160920/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/26/con_ed_criticized_for_gas_leak_that.php">knew about high gas levels for a half hour</a>, but did not evacuate residents. Con Ed VP of gas engineering David Davidowitz said workers &quot;did what they were supposed to do&quot; by starting door-to-door inspections&#x2014;&quot;They could have been walking into the building when it happened.&quot;  The Times adds that he also suggested that if Boobram had been the one to call about the gas smell (neighbors did), &quot;her home would have been inspected sooner and she would have been evacuated, Mr. Davidowitz said.&quot;  </p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160920/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/04/27/2009-04-27_mayor_backs_con_ed_mike_sez_dont_rush_to_judge_vics_pols_rage_over_qns_blast.html">standing behind Con Ed</a> so far; the Daily News reports he said, &quot;<strong>Jumping to any conclusion - it may be just one of those things, an accident, that happens.</strong>&quot;  Keep in mind that during day 6 of the 2006 Queens blackout, Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160920/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/07/25/most_of_queens.php">said of Con Ed CEO Burke</a>, &quot;I think Kevin Burke deserves a thanks from this city. He&apos;s worked as hard as he can every single day since then, as has everybody at Con Ed,&quot; only for it to turn out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160920/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/18/rohmergirl_summ.php">Con Ed&apos;s failure to maintain its system</a> caused the blackout.</p>
