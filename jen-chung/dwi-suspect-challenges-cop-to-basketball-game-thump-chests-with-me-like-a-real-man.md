A Staten Island man arrested for drunk driving wanted to settle the score on a basketball court during his arrest.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041902/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/man_from_staten_islands_great.html#incart_river">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, Lawrence Febbraro was found driving the wrong way on Hylan Boulevard last week. The 58-year-old then allegedly told a cop, &quot;You&apos;re half the man I&apos;ll ever be. I want to see you out of your uniform when you have no gun, clown. I&apos;m playing basketball tomorrow at the YMCA. Come down and thump chests with me like a real man.&quot;</p>

<p>Some more details: &quot;Febbraro was driving a black 2013 Audi Q5 on Hylan Boulevard by William Avenue, less than a half-mile from his home, <strong>when officers spotted him going backwards on Hylan, his SUV heading north on the southbound side</strong>, police allege.&quot; Also, his blood alcohol was 0.151, nearly twice the 0.08 legal limit. SI Men Can&apos;t Drunk, amirite? (SORRY.)</p>
