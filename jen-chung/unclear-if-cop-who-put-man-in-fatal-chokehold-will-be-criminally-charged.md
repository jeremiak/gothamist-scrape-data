<p>The two police officers who were involved with trying to arrest a Staten Island man&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">killing him in the process when one put him in a chokehold</a>&#x2014;were taken off the streets. Officers Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, and Justin Damico, who has been with the NYPD for four years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/staten-island-da-man-death-nypd-chokehold-article-1.1871946">are now on desk duty</a>. </p>

<p>Police, who say that Eric Garner, 43, was selling untaxed cigarettes, attempted to handcuff him around 4:45 p.m. on Thursday outside 202 Bay Street in Tompkinsville. A disturbing video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">obtained by the Daily News</a> shows Garner arguing with the police: &quot;I was just minding my own business. Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I&#x2019;m tired of it. It stops today!&quot; When a number of cops try to subdue him, Garner, who weighed 350 pounds, is seen swatting their hands away and saying, &quot;Don&#x2019;t touch me, please.&quot; </p>

<p>One officer puts him in a chokehold as the others struggle to pull him to the ground and get his arms behind his back. Garner, an asthmatic, can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe.&quot; The NYPD says he went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at Richmond University Medical Center.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/de_blasio_eric_garner.php">At a press conference yesterday</a>, Police Commissioner Bratton said, &quot;This would appear to have been a chokehold as defined in the department&apos;s patrol guide. But the investigation will seek to confirm that.&quot; Chokeholds are explicitly prohibited in the patrol guide.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://nypost.com/2014/07/18/cops-who-put-man-in-fatal-chokehold-pulled-off-the-streets/">A source told the Post</a>, &quot;There&#x2019;s a very high chance that the officer who put him in a chokehold would lose his job.<strong> It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a chokehold.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio, who delayed his trip to Italy by a day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://nypost.com/2014/07/18/de-blasio-delays-family-trip-to-italy-after-staten-island-mans-death/">because of Garner&apos;s death</a>, said yesterday, &quot;This is a terrible tragedy no family should have to experience. Like so many New Yorkers I was very troubled by the video.&quot; But he did stress, &quot;It is too early to jump to any conclusions about this case. We must wait for all the facts and details about the incident to emerge. I assure all New Yorkers there will be a full and thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Lloyd Thompson, a lawyer and former NYPD commanding officer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2014/07/experts_say_its_too_early_to_t.html">told the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;If choking is prohibited in the (police) Patrol Guide they shouldn&apos;t have done it. But in the heat of the moment, you have to do what you have to do if someone doesn&apos;t want to be arrested. You have to take a look at the circumstances.&quot; </p>

<p>The Advance added, &quot;Thompson emphasized that the Patrol Guide, which prohibits chokeholds, is a guide and is not the law,&quot; and had more insight from Eugene O&apos;Donnell, professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, &quot;<strong>The fact that someone dies in police custody doesn&apos;t make it a crime</strong>... The bottom line is that police are authorized to use force on people, but, truthfully, the police don&apos;t have a lot of direction and training in using force. When the rubber meets the road, they sort of have to improvise in real time. Force is always ugly, it&apos;s risky.&quot;</p>

<p>Garner&apos;s family is both upset and furious. His grieving wife,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015603/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-widow-staten-island-dad-died-chokehold-remembers-husband-gentle-giant-article-1.1872618"> Esaw Garner, spoke to the News&apos; Dennis Hamill</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t watch the video of my husband being taken down last night. I was too upset. I never slept. I watched it this morning and I got even more upset.&quot;<p></p>

<p>It was clear to her what happened to her husband, Eric Garner, outside a beauty shop in Tompkinsville.</p>

<p>&#x201C;They killed him,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn&#x2019;t breathe. It was so hard to watch. He was a nonviolent gentle giant and they killed him.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton welcomed the Garner family at the National Action Network today:</p>
