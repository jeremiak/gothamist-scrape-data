					<p>Amid cries for justice after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020145402/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">Staten Island man died during an arrest</a>, the New York City Police Department announced that one of the police officers involved in the arrest had his gun and badge removed.</p>

<p>The police issued a statement, &quot;Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo has been place on Modified Assignment pending further investigation into the July 17, 2014 incident involving Eric Garner in the 120 Precinct.&quot; Previously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020145402/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/de_blasio_eric_garner.php">it was announced that Pantaleo</a>, an eight-year veteran, would be placed on desk duty along with Police Officer Justin Damico, a four-year veteran. </p>

<p>Police claim that Eric Garner, 43, was selling untaxed cigarettes and that the officers attempted to handcuff him around 4:45 p.m. on Thursday outside 202 Bay Street in Tompkinsville. A disturbing video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020145402/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">obtained by the Daily New</a>s shows Garner arguing with the police: &quot;I was just minding my own business. Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I&#x2019;m tired of it. It stops today!&quot; When a number of cops try to subdue him, Garner, who weighed 350 pounds, is seen swatting their hands away and saying, &quot;Don&#x2019;t touch me, please.&quot;</p>

<p>As Pantaleo puts him in a chokehold, other officers struggle to pull him to the ground and get his arms behind his back. Garner, an asthmatic, can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe.&quot; The NYPD says he went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at Richmond University Medical Center.</p>

<p>Pantaleo was the officer who placed Garner in the chokehold. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020145402/http://nypost.com/2014/07/19/man-in-chokehold-death-had-no-throat-damage-autopsy/">Sources tell the Post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020145402/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-chokehold-staten-island-man-eric-garner-stripped-shield-gun-article-1.1873033">Daily News</a> that the Medical Examiner has found no signs of damage to Garner&apos;s neck bones or windpipe. </p>

<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020145402/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/19/unclear_if_cop_who_put_man_in_fatal.php">unclear whether Panataleo will be criminally charged</a>, and Eugene O&apos;Donnell, professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told the Post, &quot;If you&#x2019;re the defense counsel in this case, this is very good news, because it&#x2019;s consistent with what appears to be the case &#x2014; that they didn&#x2019;t mean to hurt him&quot;</p>

<p>However, the News reports, &quot;Another source said the likely cause of death will be a heart attack, although other actions &#x2014; including the illegal takedown of Garner &#x2014; &apos;will probably go down as contributing factors.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Chokeholds are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020145402/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-city-17/nypd-patrol-guide-11302/#1199980-203-11-use-of-force-pdf">prohibited by the NYPD.</a> Another video shows that Garner was left handcuffed for minutes while apparently not breathing: </p>

<p>At a rally at his National Action Network yesterday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said, &quot;Let me tell you. This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now, and whether the change that we feel has occurred, has occurred.&quot; Garner&apos;s widow, Esaw Garner, was so overcome by emotion that she had to be carried off the stage. </p>

<p>Later, Sharpton joined Garner&apos;s relatives and others for a march in Staten Island. According to Business Insider, they shouted, &quot;How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D!&quot; &quot;No justice, no peace! No racist police!&quot; and &quot;N-Y-P-D! No more killing!&quot; </p>

<p>Sharpton also said, &apos;&quot;If you say we just out here making trouble, just go to the tape! My message to the D.A. and the federal authorities is: Go to the tape! ... The tape speaks for itself! The whole world is looking at Staten Island!&quot;</p>
