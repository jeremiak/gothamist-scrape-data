<p>The former cop who was found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/27/gunpoint_rape_cop_convicted_of_sexu.php">guilty of sexually assaulting</a> a teacher was just sentenced to 75 years to life in prison.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/manhattan_cop_sentenced_teacher_rvKzC7426e1sMUJBwt7qtK">According to the Post</a>, this means that Michael Pena &quot;must serve at least 75 years before even seeing a parole board.&quot;</p>

<p>Pena was off-duty when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/off-duty_cop_accused_of_raping_woma.php">allegedly raped the woman</a> in an Inwood apartment complex&apos;s courtyard.  In spite of hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/gunpoint_rape_cop_victim_testifies.php">harrowing testimony from the victim</a> and from building tenants who heard her anguished screams, a jury&#x2014;which included a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/gunpoint_rape_cop_juror_admits_he_s.php">lawyer who had ties to Manhattan DA Cy Vance</a> as well as one of his election opponents&#x2014;was unable to convict Pena on the rape charges. Semen was found on her underwear, but there was no proof of penetration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-nypd-michael-pena-75-life-sex-assault-article-1.1073730">besides the victim&apos;s testimony</a> and a doctor said it seemed as if she was raped.  Media reports suggested that the jury was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/the_most_outrageous_thing_said_by_a.php">fixated on weird details</a>, like wondering why the rape victim couldn&apos;t remember the color of the car near where she says she was raped).  Pena&apos;s lawyer even admitted his client <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/16/gunpoint_rape_cop_lawyer_admits_his.php">committed an &quot;unforgivable&quot; crime</a>.  </p>

<p>The victim made a brief statement to the judge before sentencing, &quot;This has impacted every single aspect of my life... He used his weapon, and basically destroyed my life. That&apos;s it. Thank you.&quot; The Post adds, &quot;The sentence for the brutal, off-duty attack left the victim collapsing in sobs of anguished triumph in the front row of Manhattan Supreme Court.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether the Manhattan DA&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161844/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/29/gunpoint_rape_cop_mistrial_fallout.php">will retry Pena on the rape charges</a>.</p>
