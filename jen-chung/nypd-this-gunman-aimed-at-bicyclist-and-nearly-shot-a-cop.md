<p>Police are searching for the person who fired a gun numerous times in Brooklyn and nearly hit a cop on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at about 2:25 pm., a male wearing a white T-shirt and red shots took out a gun and started firing from the corner of Pitkin Avenue and Wyona Street, apparently aiming at a male on a bicycle traveling westbound on Pitkin. Police say, &quot;One of the rounds almost struck a police officer that was also in the vicinity of the incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Video shows the suspect, who is wanted for reckless endangerment, walking down the street and turning to shoot into traffic.</p>
