<p>According to the NYPD, the assault took place before 6 a.m. on July 13. When officers responded to the incident at 463 Berriman Street, police say that they learned from &quot;the 60-year-old victim that an unidentified male grabbed her from behind, covered her mouth and dragged her into boiler room of the location where he repeatedly punched her in the face and raped her.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman was part of a group who collected recyclables, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021949/http://abc7ny.com/news/new-video-of-suspect-wanted-in-rape-of-60-year-old-brooklyn-woman-/1429226/">WABC 7 reports</a>: &quot;Sources say the victim had gotten separated from her friend.
