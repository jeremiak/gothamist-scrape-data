										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:180px; "> <img alt="2011_11_boyland.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141117im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_boyland.jpg" width="180" height="215"> <br> <i>William Boyland Jr.</i></div> NY Assemblyman William Boyland Jr. was his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141117/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/11/facebook_game-loving_brooklyn_pol_a.php">acquittal on corruption charges earlier this month</a>, but the party is about to end, because the feds just arrested him this morning on new corruption charges.  U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch says Boyland solicited more than $250,000 in bribes and took thousands for performing official acts for bribe players.  Boyland, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141117/http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/William-F-Boyland-Jr/">represents Brooklyn&apos;s 55th District</a>, allegedly told one undercover agent, &quot;I got a middle guy by the way ... I gotta stay clean ... I got a bag man...&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141117/http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2011/new-york-state-assemblyman-william-f.-boyland-jr.-charged-with-bribery-and-attempted-hobbs-act-extortion?utm_campaign=email-Immediate&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=new-york-press-releases&amp;utm_content=52041">According to the feds</a>, right after Boyland was indicted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141117/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/10/brooklyn_state_senator_carl_kruger.php">on corruption charges in March 2011</a> (the ones he was eventually cleared of):</p><blockquote>Boyland and a member of his staff contacted UC1 [undercover agent 1] seeking a direct, personal payment of $7,000. In a recorded telephone call, Boyland told UC1 that he needed the money to &quot;solidify some attorneys.&quot; Boyland stated that he was willing to travel to Philadelphia for the money and that he wanted the payment in cash...<p></p>

<p>At the end of meeting, UC1 gave Boyland the $7,000 in cash, and stated: &#x201C;Knowing that if you think you want to bring someone else onboard or knowing that you&#x2019;ll be there politically for us is all that we&#x2019;re looking for.&#x201D; In response, Boyland made a &#x201C;thumbs up&#x201D; sign and affirmed that &#x201C;the political thing will be fine in terms of just where we need to go because I&#x2019;m thinking environmental and I&#x2019;m thinking the two houses of the state and city. You know, the relationships are there.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Later, when trying to obtain a $250,000 bribe, in exchange for obtaining state grants for undercover agents posing as potential buyers of a Brooklyn hospital, Boyland allegedly told them that he preferred in-person meetings, &quot;I stopped talking on the phone awhile ago ... I&#x2019;m just saying there is no real conversation that you can have that, you know, especially with what we&#x2019;re talking about. You can&#x2019;t do that.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Then, during an in-person meeting, the feds say he demanded $250,000, rejecting one undercover agent&apos;s suggestion of $5,000 per introduction to people to move along the project, &quot;I&#x2019;m not talking about $5,000 folks. I&#x2019;m talking about ...people that can actually get these projects done and that&#x2019;s where we started off with. We started off, we didn&#x2019;t start off with, we can go with somebody who knows someone. We not talking about those folks . . . . <strong>We talking about the man</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>If convicted, Boyland could be sentenced to up to 30 years. As bad as these charges are, Boyland&apos;s year could be worse&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141117/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/11/embattled_assemblyman_and_son_shot.php">he was shot at, you know</a>!  </p>
