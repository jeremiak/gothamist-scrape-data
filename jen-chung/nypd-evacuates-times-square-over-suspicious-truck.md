<p>A truck with exposed wires and gas canisters prompted the police to evacuate Times Square last night. While the situation was resolved safely, it caused problems for theatergoers seeing <em>Hamilton</em>&#x2014;WHY GOD.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at around 7:51 p.m., &quot;members of the NYPD&#x2019;s Critical Response Command were patrolling the Times Square area when they observed a suspicious vehicle parked on West 46 Street, in front of the entrance to the Marriott Hotel.&quot;</p>

<blockquote> As the officers approached the vehicle, which was parked in a bus stop, they noticed that the truck listed a Brooklyn address on its side but was licensed in Georgia.  When the officers looked into the cabin portion of the truck, they observed wires extending out from the dash board towards the rear of the truck and gas canisters behind the seat.  They immediately requested the response of the Emergency Services Unit (ESU) and the Bomb Squad.  With the assistance of the Times Square Unit, Mounted Unit, the Strategic Response Group and other patrol personnel, the surrounding area was evacuated of all pedestrians and occupied vehicles pending the investigation.</blockquote>

<p>The NYPD Bomb Squad and ESU found that the gas canisters and truck were empty and gave the all-clear before 9 p.m. Police also found the driver and took him into custody for questioning.</p>

<p>Some businesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050006/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/02/times-square-evacuation/">were closed</a> and theatergoers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050006/http://nypost.com/2016/04/03/cops-evacuate-blocks-near-times-square-over-bomb-scare/">reportedly delayed 20 minutes in getting</a> into <em>Hamilton</em>, playing at the Richard Rodgers theater on West 46th Street. One of the hit show&apos;s performers, Andrew Chappelle, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050006/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-clear-part-times-square-report-wary-truck-article-1.2586555">Snapchatted about the NYPD response</a>: &quot;I know I&apos;m funny and everything, but this is actually kind of scary. The street is blocked off right now, and look, it&apos; so Miss Saigon right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Police are continue to investigate and it&apos;s unclear if the driver will be charged. In May 2010, a street vendor noticed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050006/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/01/times_square_closed_after_police_fi.php">suspicious SUV in Times Square</a> and police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050006/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/02/times_square_car_bomb_nyc_avoided_p.php#photo-1">found a crude bomb</a> including &quot;two gasoline cans, three propane tanks, electrical wires, black powder, consumer grade fireworks and two clocks.&quot;</p>
