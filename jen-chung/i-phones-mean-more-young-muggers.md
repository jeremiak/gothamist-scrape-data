<p>The News reports, &quot;Juveniles [ages 11-19] accounted for 29% of the 7,340 robbery arrests and 27% of the 4,566 grand larceny busts this year, an 8% jump in each category compared to this time last year.&quot;  Kelly said, &quot;The explosive popularity of these devices has also made them inviting targets for thefts. Teens are commonly the culprits as well as the victims.&quot;  A police source put it more bluntly, &quot;<strong>A kid taking out an iPhone and using it is like waving around $300</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>When iPods were first introduced, there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120617/http://gothamist.com/2005/04/28/subway_crime_down_cept_for_ipod_cellphone_thefts.php">huge spike in iPod-related crime</a> (even private school kids were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120617/http://gothamist.com/2005/04/26/private_school_kids_steal_ipods_too.php">stealing them</a>), even a mugging that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120617/http://gothamist.com/2005/07/06/apples_sympathy_for_ipod_murder_victims_family.php">turned into murder</a>. One social scientist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120617/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/29/gadgets_like_ip.php">likened iPods</a> to &quot;walking around with a $100 bill taped to your back or something.&quot; More recently, a sommelier was mugged at BB point, with his assailants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120617/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/07/sommelier_mugged_at_bb_gunpoint_on.php">taking his money and iPhone</a>, and some youths <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120617/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/12/iphone_fake_out_on_craigslist_leads.php">were arrested for trying to offer cheap iPhones</a> to gullible Craigslisters.</p>
