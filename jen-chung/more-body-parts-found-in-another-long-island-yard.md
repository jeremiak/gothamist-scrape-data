<p>Nassau County police were already trying to determine if the remains found on Wednesday on Webb Avenue might be related to body parts found in Bay Shore, near the Fire Island ferry parking lot. A nephew of the homeowner who lives at the Webb Avenue house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012124/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/police-probing-whether-li-remains-belong-to-chinelle-latoya-brown-missing-nyc-woman-sources-say-1.8759498?cmpid=Breaking_news_newsletter">posited a theory on</a> why the grisly discovery occurred there, &quot;I think somebody might have just dropped it because this is the only house that has like a garden that&apos;s ... sealed,&quot; referring to the fence. The yard at the Cornell Street house is also fenced.</p>

<p>Investigators are trying to determine if the remains belong to Chinelle Latoya Browne, 27, a Brooklyn woman.

The Guyanese native had several beefs with her landlord over an extension cord that powered her room, culminating in a fight, her husband, Dale Browne, told the Daily News from his home in Guyana. Browne was smacked in the fight and later disappeared.&quot;</p>
