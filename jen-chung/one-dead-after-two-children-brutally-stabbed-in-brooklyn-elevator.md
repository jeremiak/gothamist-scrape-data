<p>Last night, two children were attacked in an East New York apartment building elevator. Prince Joshua Avitto, 6, and Mikayala Capers, 7, were stabbed repeatedly by a man at 845 Schenck Avenue. Prince Joshua died at Brookdale Hospital while Mikayala, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112649/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Children-Stabbed-East-New-York-Brooklyn-Police-261456871.html">who has a collapsed lung</a>, is in critical condition after surgery. The president of the tenant&#x2019;s association <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112649/http://nypost.com/2014/06/01/1-child-dead-after-double-stabbing-in-brooklyn-elevator/">told the Post</a>, &quot;They were just coming outside to get some ice cream and ices. This is the worst thing that I&#x2019;ve ever seen in this neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p>The stabbing occurred before 5:50 p.m., and it&apos;s believed that the suspect is a heavyset man in his 20s wearing a grey sweatshirt. A butcher knife was reportedly found at the scene. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112649/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/kids-stabbed-east-ny-article-1.1813398">Daily News reports</a> he &quot;stabbed both children in the torso on the lift somewhere between the first and fourth floors after telling them to &apos;shut up,&apos; a police source said. Mikayla had enough strength to stumble out of the elevator on the first level but she soon collapsed to the floor, a trail of blood marking her attempt to flee. The boy was discovered when the elevator arrived on the fourth floor, police said.&quot;</p>

<p>A neighbor told the News, &quot;She was laying face up, they were on her chest. They (EMTs) opened up her jacket and all you could see is blood... [Prince Joshua] was covered head to toe in blood. I just seen that little boy yesterday. I&#x2019;m hurt. These are my daughter&#x2019;s friends. These are kids.&quot; </p>

<p>Prince Joshua&apos;s mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112649/http://nypost.com/2014/06/01/1-child-dead-after-double-stabbing-in-brooklyn-elevator/">was inconsolable outside the hospital</a>, &quot;His birthday was in 16 days! Lord, they done killed my baby!&quot; And Mikayala&apos;s great-grandmother told the Post, &quot;What kind of animal would do a thing like this. I have faith in the NYPD to pound the streets until they catch this bastard.&quot;</p>
