<p>The Yankees are one game away from the American League Championship Series, after last night&apos;s dramatic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172434/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/boxscore.jsp?gid=2009_10_09_minmlb_nyamlb_1">4-3 win</a> in game two of the Division Series over the Minnesota Twins.  The game went into extra innings, courtesy of Alex Rodriguez, who hit a game-tying two-run home run off All-Star closer Joe Nathan in the 9th inning, tying the game at 3-3. Then, in the 11th inning, Teixiera hit a home run&#x2014;what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172434/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/sports/baseball/10yankees.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports">NY Times called</a> &quot;a screamer down the left-field line...The ball just cleared the 318-foot sign and sent the crowd of 50,006 into sudden delirium.&quot;</p>

<p>The top of the 11th wasn&apos;t without its own drama when the Twins managed to load the bases with no outs, but didn&apos;t bring in any runs due to great pitching from rookie Dave Robinson, and a little help from a missed call by the umpires. Twins catcher Joe Mauer led the inning off with an apparent double off Damaso Marte, but the hit was ruled foul. Mauer eventually singled and Jason Kubel followed with another single off Marte before Robinson came in. After allowing a single to Michael Cuddyer, Robinson finally worked himself out of the impossible situation. First with a line drive to Teixiera, then a fielders choice to Teixiera and finally a fly ball to center to get out of the inning. </p>

<p>Yankees starting pitcher AJ Burnett gave up one run in his six innings pitcher (Twins starter Nick Blackburn also gave up a run in 5 3/4 innings).  In the eighth, the Yankees&apos; Phil Hughes gave up a RBI single from Nick Punto and Mariano Rivera (!) gave up another RBI single from Denard Span.  </p>

<p>The Yankees, who have won all nine games against the Twins this season, head to the Metrodome to face Carl Pavano on Sunday. New York will go with Andy Pettitte in the game.</p>
