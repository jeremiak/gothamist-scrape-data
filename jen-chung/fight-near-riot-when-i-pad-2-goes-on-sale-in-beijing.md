</div></div>					<p>As crazy as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170411200948/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/11/ipad_2_line_spots_going_for_almost.php">lines were when the iPad 2 was released</a> in the United States, at least there didn&apos;t seem to be any riots: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170411200948/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110508/bs_afp/chinaitcompanyinternetusappleipad">according to the AFP</a>, &quot;Four people were taken to hospital and a glass door smashed as a near-riot broke out at Beijing&apos;s top Apple store among crowds rushing to snap up the popular iPad 2 tablet computer, according to state press. Angry consumers began rushing the store on Saturday afternoon after a &apos;foreign&apos; Apple employee allegedly stepped into the crowd to push and beat people suspected of queue jumping.&quot; And it seems much of the line is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170411200948/http://shanghaiist.com/2011/05/08/photos_massive_queues_in_shanghai_a.php">made up of...scalpers</a>.</p>

<p>Scalpers, specifically Asian ones, are a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170411200948/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/asian_gang_allegedly_buying_up_ipad.php">familiar sight near New York&apos;s Apple stores</a>.  The scalpers have been reportedly able to sell the iPad 2&apos;s for twice the retail price in China.  However, now that the product is on sale in China, the markup from scalpers outside the Beijing Apple Store <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170411200948/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2384991,00.asp">is more like $30-40 </a>.</p>
