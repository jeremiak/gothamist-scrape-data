</div></div>					<p>Flights are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522021240/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8631238.stm">slowly starting to resume</a> for volcanic ash-troubled travelers to and from Europe, which has brought some hope to those stranded.  But know what was also pretty good for folks at JFK Airport&apos;s &quot;cot city&quot;?  The showers in trailers that were brought in by the Port Authority and parked outside Terminal 4!</p>

<p>Dominica Zschiesche, who had been living at JFK Airport for the past five, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522021240/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hqK0Q9Dh0uTC5RMQrnesVeX9VquwD9F6H96O0">told the AP</a> she &quot;cleaned her body with hand wipes and used a public bathroom sink to shave her legs and wash her hair&quot; for the first four days.  Enter the shower: &quot;By Day 5 at Camp Kennedy, she seemed almost at home, standing near the concourse barefoot and with her hair wrapped in a blue towel after she finally got to shower. &apos;It was wonderful. It was the best shower I ever had,&apos; said the 29-year-old art student from Frankfurt.&quot; </p>

<p>The Port Authority also set up 1,000 cots at JFK and Newark Airport, handing out some supplies like bottled water and baby wipes.  The Red Cross and other countries&apos; consulates have also handed out bedding, food, or food vouchers.  Still, some people were staving off boredom by constructing airplanes out of boxes (from pillows) and describing their areas as &quot;JFK Squatters, Yorkshire Branch.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522021240/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/20/2010-04-20_case_of_terminal_borrrredom_stranded_travelers_lived_through_own_little_hell_stu.html">Daily News has a diary</a> of what one pair of French consulate officers are doing while as &quot;Volcano Refugee Camp&quot; (aka JFK): &quot;3 a.m.: Wake up and hit the bathrooms to wash armpits, face and hair with hand soap&quot; (because &quot;It&apos;s when no one else is in the bathroom.&quot;) and then sleep.  &quot;6 a.m.: Climb out of the cot again and head to Starbucks for coffee and brownies. Breakfast is often their biggest splurge of the day at about $6. Saves and Benoit are trying to keep food expenses to about $15 a day. After breakfast, most of their meals come from vending machines. They pay for Starbucks Wi-Fi to check on flight information on their laptop. The airline is not giving them information, they say...&quot;</p>
