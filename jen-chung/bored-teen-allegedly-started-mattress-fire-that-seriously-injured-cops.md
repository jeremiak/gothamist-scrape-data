<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411225908/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/07/16-yr-old_in_custody_for_coney_isla.php">16-year-old</a> arrested for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411225908/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/06/two_cops_trapped_in_smoke-filled_el.php">Brooklyn fire</a> that critically injured two police officers on Sunday reportedly told cops that he set the blaze because he was &quot;bored.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411225908/http://nypost.com/2014/04/07/bored-teen-admits-to-setting-fire-that-nearly-killed-2-cops/">According to the Post&apos;s source</a>, Dockery said, &quot;I decided to take a lighter and light the top of the mattress because I was bored. I saw the mattress catch fire and I tried to blow out the flames. I thought the flame was out and I looked back and the mattress was in flames. I started knocking on apartment doors to alert people to the fire.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2014_04_marcelldockery.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411225908im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_04_marcelldockery.jpg" width="365" height="314"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Via Facebook</i></div> Dockery lives on the 12th floor of the NYC Housing Authority building, 2007 Surf Avenue, but allegedly set the fire on the 13th floor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411225908/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/teen-bored-set-fire-injured-2-cops-article-1.1748337">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;When the flames became too fierce, Dockery tried to stomp them out and then ran to his cousin&#x2019;s pad on the same floor for help, according to cops. They returned to the burning mattress, but the fire was burning out of control so they ran downstairs to Dockery&#x2019;s 12th floor apartment and called 911 for help, the sources said.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Police Officers Rosa Rodriguez, 36, and Dennis Guerra, 38, responded to the 911 call about the fire, but when they got out of the elevator they were overcome by smoke. A source told the News that a video shows Guerra getting hit by the toxic smoke: &quot;He&#x2019;s literally right at the door and you see this rush of blackness that comes in. You barely see him as he turns, then it&apos;s all black.&quot;</p>

<p>The cops called for help, &quot;Help! Help! We can&#x2019;t breathe. Get us out of here! We don&#x2019;t know where we are. We&#x2019;re in an elevator. We don&#x2019;t know what floor we&#x2019;re on. We can&#x2019;t breathe! We can&#x2019;t see!&quot; before they fell unconscious and unresponsive. Guerra also went into cardiac arrest. Both were revived and taken to multiple hospitals and remain in critical condition.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411225908/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/2-nypd-cops-remain-critical-after-suspicious-coney-island-blaze/">WCBS 2 had a photograph of the burned hall</a>, marked with blistered paint and smoke stains. A resident said, &quot;We couldn&#x2019;t get out. I knew enough not to run for the elevator, not to leave this door. The building is fireproof, but the paint, of course, burns.&quot;</p>

<p>Dockery was charged with two counts of assault, reckless endangerment and arson. Different sources tell the tabloids that he&apos;s a &quot;firebug,&quot; with one telling the Post, &quot;He is really obsessed with this arson thing... He was bragging about it on his Facebook page.&quot;</p>

<p>Dockery&apos;s mother might be kicked out of her home, unless she bars her son. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411225908/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/teen-bored-set-fire-injured-2-cops-article-1.1748337">A neighbor said</a>, &quot;I think he set it on purpose, it wasn&#x2019;t no accident. He likes to smoke weed all the time,&quot; but added, &quot;he&#x2019;s not a bad kid at all. He has a good mother. She goes to church all the time. Some kids just don&apos;t think, they don&apos;t pay attention to the consequences.&quot; </p>
