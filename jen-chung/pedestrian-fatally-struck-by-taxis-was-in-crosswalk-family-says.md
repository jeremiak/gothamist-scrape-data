<p>The grieving relatives of a young woman who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529051533/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/12/pedestrian_fatally_struck_on_ues_ha.php">killed by two taxi cabs on the Upper East Side last month</a> are disputing the authorities&apos; version of events. While taxi drivers supposedly had the right of way while Kelly Gordon was jaywalking, her sister insists &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529051533/http://nypost.com/2014/05/01/relatives-of-co-ed-killed-by-2-cabs-say-drivers-lied-about-jaywalking/">We were in the crosswalk. We&#x2019;re devastated</a>.&quot;</p>

A southbound cab allegedly tried to swerve out of the way, but she was struck and bounced off the hood. Then a northbound cab ran her over. Neither driver was charged, because authorities determined they had the right of way.</p>

<p>However, before a City Hall hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529051533/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/16/coopers_law_would_suspend_cabbies_w.php">about Cooper&apos;s Law</a> (which would bar taxi cab drivers from driving again if a pedestrian is killed), Gordon&apos;s family disagreed. Her aunt told the Post, &quot;The cab drivers said she was jaywalking. When she was hit, she was thrown outside the crosswalk.&quot; The investigation is reportedly ongoing.</p>

<p>Gordon had been in New York City to interview for jobs; the day she was killed, she had just interviewed at Goldman Sachs.</p>
