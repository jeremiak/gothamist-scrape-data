Matt Smith, who played the eleventh Doctor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101909/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/peter-capaldi-tapped-play-next-599324">said</a>, &quot;If I had to pick someone I&#x2019;d pick him. I&#x2019;m excited because I know what&#x2019;s coming, and he&#x2019;s going to have a blast.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>The big revealed occurred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101909/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23570354">during a live BBC One special</a>, and Capaldi himself said, &quot;It&apos;s so wonderful not to keep this secret any longer, but it&apos;s been so fantastic.&quot; Most Americans know him as Malcolm Tucker, the profane government communications director seen in the series <em>The Thick of It</em> and movie<em> In The Loop</em> (both from Armando Iannucci, who also created <em>Veep</em>). Tucker makes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101909/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/weiners_spokeswoman_trashes_ex-inte.php">Barbara Morgan look like an amateur</a> in swearing: &quot;Y&apos;know, I&apos;ve come across a lot of psychos, but none as fucking boring as you. You are a real boring fuck. Sorry, sorry, I know you disapprove of swearing so I&apos;ll sort that out. You are a boring F, star, star, CUNT!&quot;</p>

<p>Capaldi also said, &quot;Being asked to play the Doctor is an amazing privilege. Like the Doctor himself I find myself in a state of utter terror and delight. I can&apos;t wait to get started.&quot; </p>
