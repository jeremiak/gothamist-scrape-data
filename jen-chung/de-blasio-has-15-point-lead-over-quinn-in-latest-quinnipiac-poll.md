<p>Public Advocate Bill de Blasio will get to enjoy his Labor Day weekend as a frontrunner in the mayoral race, because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006174407/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=1944">latest Quinnipiac Poll shows him</a> with 36% support of likely voters. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has 21% and former Comptroller Bill Thompson has 20%. Former Congressman Anthony Weiner has 8% and Comptroller John Liu is at 6%.</p>

<p>The poll was conducted between August 22 and August 27, which was after the debate where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006174407/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/democratic_mayoral_hopefuls_gang_up.php">de Blasio was ganged up on</a> and encompasses the time that Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006174407/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/ny_post_also_wants_4th_term_of_bloo.php">locked up endorsements</a> from the NY Daily News, NY Times and NY Post. The NY Times&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006174407/https://twitter.com/davidwchen/status/372790421149069312">David Chen points out</a>, &quot;Caveats with late summer polling: A lot of people are away. One more debate &amp; who knows how many ads left. And NYers often decide late.&quot; On the other hand, the fear of a de Blasio nomination could push Mayor Bloomberg to endorse a certain someone!</p>

<p>Quinnipiac&apos;s polling director Maurice Carroll said, &quot;Talk about breaking out of the pack! Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, in fourth place just five weeks ago, is edging up on the magic 40 percent needed to avoid a Democratic primary runoff. And if there is a runoff, he clobbers Council Speaker Christine Quinn or former Comptroller and 2009 Democratic challenger William Thompson.&quot; Here are the details about the potential matchups: &quot;De Blasio tops Quinn 59 - 30 percent; De Blasio leads Thompson 52 - 36 percent; Thompson bests Quinn 57 - 33 percent.&quot;</p>

<p>Primary day is September 10th.</p>
