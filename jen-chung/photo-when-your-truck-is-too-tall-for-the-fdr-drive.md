<p>There are many signs near the East 61st Street stretch of the FDR Drive saying that the height restriction is 9 feet 6 inches. But some drivers are too in the moment to pay attention. Lee Stetson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202732/https://twitter.com/TheLeeStetson/status/372069239261126657">noticed this victim</a> parked on East 61st Street and First Avenue.</p>

<p>In 2004, a bus that was over 13 feet tall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202732/http://gothamist.com/2004/11/29/why_buses_arent_allowed_on_the_fdr.php">hit the overpass at East 61st Street</a>. Some passengers were injured but luckily no one was killed. </p>
