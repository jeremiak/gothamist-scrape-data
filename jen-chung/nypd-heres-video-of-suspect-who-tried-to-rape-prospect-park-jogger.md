That traumatization spreads throughout the entire community.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred around 5:15 a.m. in Prospect Park, near Garfield Place and Prospect Park West: Police officers responded to a 911 call and found a 23-year-old woman who said that while she was jogging, &quot;an unidentified male approached the victim from behind when he threw her to the ground, produced a knife and stated that he was going to sexually assault her. The victim resisted and a struggle ensued at which time male fled.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim suffered a cut to her right finger and was taken to Methodist Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>Police describe the suspect as being about 5&apos;10&quot; to 6&apos; and 180-190 pounds with short hair and a goatee. He was last seen wearing a black t-shirt, black pants with white lettering on one pant leg, and black sneakers with white bottoms. <br>
