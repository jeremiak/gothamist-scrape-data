<p>Night has fallen, and so have snow flurries&#x2014;but it&apos;s not at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021214524/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/19/omg_the_snow_is_coming_for_us.php">six-to-nine-inch or foot predictions yet</a>.  And New Yorkers are impatient to see some snow insanity (especially the ones that braved going to packed grocery stores to stock up!). </p>

<p>Apparently the snow will get heavier during the evening. WCBS 2&apos;s weather producer Giorgio Panetta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021214524/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/tristate.winter.storm.2.1378089.html">says</a>, &quot;We could definitely have a foot of snow out of this storm. There will be periods of blizzard-like conditions across the tri-state with gusting winds and low visibility. Especially Saturday night.&quot; </p>
