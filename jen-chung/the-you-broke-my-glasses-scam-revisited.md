title: The "You Broke My Glasses" Scam, Revisited

										<p><img alt="2008_11_brokenglass.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072719im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_11_brokenglass.jpg" width="260" height="223" class="left">Two years ago, we mentioned how Columbia students were being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072719/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/27/post_69.php">suckered by a scam artist couple</a> into giving up cash.  The &quot;broken bottle&quot; scam involved the couple bumping into a stranger and dropping a bottle--and then asking the stranger to pay them for the bottle&apos;s contents (vitamins for the &quot;pregnant&quot; wife).  </p>

<p>This is apparently based on the &quot;You Broke My Glasses&quot; scam, which follows a similar script, culminating in a pair of broken glasses and insistence that the stranger hand over cash.  (The New Yorker&apos;s Talk of the Town <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072719/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/05/15/060515ta_talk_mcgrath">also investigated the scam</a> that was preying &quot;on the liberal guilt of middle-class college kids.&quot;)</p>

<p>Over the years, many readers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072719/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/27/post_69.php#comments">chimed in to contribute their run-ins</a> with scammers.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072719/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/27/post_69.php#comment-126254">One wrote</a>, &quot;I used to work at the Metropolitan Museum, and I would leave work via the 84th street entrance, near the 86th street Central Park Transverse.<strong> For three years running, two guys worked that plush, tourist-rich intersection, claiming that their car had conked out, and they needed money to get back to NJ.</strong> Occasionally, one would carry a hubcap, or a part of a jack! Props! After a while they recognized me and stopped hitting me up. We&apos;d actually wave to one another occasionally - the local grifters.&quot;  There are also the &quot;I need some cash because I&apos;m out of gas/my car was towed&quot; lines of attack.</p>

<p>And yesterday, reader rjp <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072719/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/27/post_69.php#comment-1516726">offered a new variation</a> on &quot;You Broken My Glasses&quot; -- the &quot;I Need an Insulin Shot&quot;:</p><blockquote>I wanted to report that I was ALMOST taken by a new twist on the &quot;dropped glasses&quot; street scam today in Union Square.  Instead of glasses, it was his insulin shot, and he was a diabetic of course, and his blood sugar was too high, etc. etc.  I tried a few times to just walk away but he was very aggressive about following me. </blockquote><p></p>
