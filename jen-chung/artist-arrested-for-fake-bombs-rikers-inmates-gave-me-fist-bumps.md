</div></div>					<p>Two weeks after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/japanese_artist_accused_of_planting.php">being released from Rikers Island</a> for installing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/nypd_arrest_artist_who_installed_i.php">&quot;I Love NY&quot; bags on trees</a> in Williamsburg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/suspicious_package_taped_to_tree_sh.php">only to cause a bomb scare</a>, artist and designer Takeshi Miyakawa <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121554/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/garden/designer-takeshi-miyakawa-returns-from-rikers-island.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">spoke to the NY Times about the experience</a>.  One imposing inmate told him on his third and final night at Rikers, &quot;<strong>All these famous artists suffered before they became famous.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Miyakawa was apparently startled by his incarceration: &quot;He described the humiliation of being transported in handcuffs, the sleepless nights in the freezing cells, the challenge of the very public toilets. (He spent one night in a police precinct, and another in a group cell before being transferred to Rikers Island.)&quot; However, there was a silver lining:</p>

<blockquote>But he found the inmates kind and curious. They gave him soap and a toothbrush, taught him to play Aces, offered fist bumps and words of encouragement. They threw their arms around his shoulders and posed for mock-photographs, miming a camera; they brandished newspaper articles on his arrest, and asked him to autograph them.</blockquote>

<p>Miyakawa is due in court on June 21, and his lawyer hopes to get the charges of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/nypd_arrest_artist_who_installed_i.php">planting false bombs</a> dropped or reduced.  The tipster who contacted 311 about the bags&#x2014;311 then told him to contact 911&#x2014;told us he thought it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/bedford_bomb_scare.php">probably some sort of art project</a>.</p>

<p>But Rafael Vinoly, the famed architect who employs Miyakawa as a model maker and wrote a character reference for Miyakawa, had strong words about guerrilla/unexpected art, telling the Times, &quot;It was a stupid mistake. A piece of visceral public art is like architecture. I can&#x2019;t build a building without getting a permit.<strong> All he needed to do was ask for permission.</strong> I don&#x2019;t like people to suffer for things that aren&#x2019;t really necessary.&quot;</p>
