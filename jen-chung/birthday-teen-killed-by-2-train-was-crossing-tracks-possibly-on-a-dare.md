</div></div>					<p>Last night, a teenager celebrating his 18th birthday was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160604/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/26/teen_fatally_struck_by_2_express_tr.php">killed by an uptown 2 train</a> at the West 79th Street station during the evening rush hour. Apparently Liam Armstrong and his friends were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160604/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teen-killed-subway-train-article-1.1299864">trying to head downtown</a>, but were on the uptown local platform&#x2014;so they decided to cross the tracks. And it might have been a dare.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160604/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/train_kills_teen_di5CYntCmYe2FXBdkH4poK">Post reports</a>, &quot;Rather than cross to the southbound side above ground, they dared one another to dart across the tracks, police sources said. At least one friend succeeded in reaching the opposite platform and another was still on the northbound side when the train struck Armstrong just before 6:30 p.m., according to police.&quot; </p>

<p>Armstrong, of Nesconset, Long Island and a senior at Smithtown East High School, turned 18 yesterday; authorities reportedly found a bottle of rum in his backpack and fake IDs in his wallet. Witness said his friends, on the opposite platforms, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160604/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teen-killed-subway-train-article-1.1299864">started crying</a>. His friends and classmates have been using the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160604/https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23staystrongsmithtown&amp;src=hash">#staystrongsmithtown</a> on Twitter to convey their condolences.</p>

<p>The 2 train tried to stop but wasn&apos;t able to in time: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160604/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Teenager-Struck-Killed-Subway-Train-West-79-Street-Broadway-Number-2-Train-200139891.html">According to NBC New York</a>, &quot;The motorman saw them crossing and tried to stop the train, but not before it clipped the 18-year-old, killing him.&quot; The passengers on the stopped 2 train had to remain on board while first responders entered the tracks. </p>

<p>Passengers overheard them say they found various body parts&#x2014;and some passengers even saw part of the body. Passengers were also urged not to take any photographs or videos and, when they were being removed from the train (the MTA brought a 1 train next to the 2 train, to offload them), they were told not to look down. However, some did and one said, &quot;When we were walking out, I saw under the train&#x2014;it&apos;s not good. It&apos;s not good.&quot;</p>

<p>Subway service was suspended on the 1, 2, 3 between 42nd Street and 96th Street for over an hour. Riders who had been on the 2 train that hit the victim were scrambling to get home to relieve their baby-sitters&#x2014;and trying to figure out how to get home (some were given transfer tickets to buses; others opted to take cabs). Passenger Donald Lumpkin, who had been on the 2 train, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160604/http://pix11.com/2013/03/26/teen-killed-by-subway-train-may-have-been-playing-chicken">told reporters</a>, &quot;You could tell everybody was freaked out. You had kids crying and all of that. It&#x2019;s crazy. A lot of people are shaken up right now&#x2014;as you could see, I am.&quot; </p>
