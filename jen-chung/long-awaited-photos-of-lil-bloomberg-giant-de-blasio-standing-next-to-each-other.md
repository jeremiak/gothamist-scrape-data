<p>Jon Stewart had previously warned on The Daily Show that if de Blasio wins the election, it will be &quot;greatest incumbent-successor size discrepancy in the history of swearing-in ceremonies.&quot; That got us thinking about the discrepancy: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160226045330/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/nyregion/26tall.html">De Blasio is 6&apos;5&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160226045330/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/nyregion/25owner.html">according to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Mr. Bloomberg&#x2019;s height has been reported as being anywhere from 5-feet-6 (in news articles) to 5-feet-10 (on his driver&#x2019;s license).&quot; But there have been no photos of the two men standing next to each other... until now.</p>

<p>The pair met at a conference yesterday. The Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota was also there, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160226045330/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/nyregion/in-unlikely-turn-bloomberg-convenes-the-mayoral-rivals.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the Times says Bloomberg</a> &quot;offered lavish introductions with personal touches. He described Mr. Lhota as the first in his family to attend college and lauded his decision-making as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority during Hurricane Sandy. He played up Mr. de Blasio&#x2019;s roots in suburban Massachusetts, where Mr. Bloomberg grew up, and zeroed in on policies, like the smoking ban, on which the two have agreed... [It was] a public moment of transformation from grouchy lame duck, constantly finding fault with those running for mayor, into elder statesman, capable of convening quarrelsome rivals.&quot;</p>

<p>Whatever&#x2014;in that first picture, it looks like BDB is slouching.</p>
