One commenter asked, &quot;Does an award-winning, socially critical novelist not deserve a seat? And you call this civilization...&quot; Not to mention a novelist with a fatwa!  Back in 2000, the Observer reported on Rushdie&apos;s man-about-town ways, and one book agent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005608/http://www.observer.com/node/42832">bitterly said</a>, &quot;I was so pissed to be in the restaurant with him. I&apos;m going to be mad, and dead... We can&apos;t enjoy our meal. We don&apos;t want to die because of his fatwa. It&apos;s so passive-aggressive toward people in Manhattan. We have enough trouble here.&quot;  Rushdie has always liked NYC&#x2014;his first public appearance post-fatwa <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005608/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-defying.html">was at Columbia in 1991</a>.</p>
