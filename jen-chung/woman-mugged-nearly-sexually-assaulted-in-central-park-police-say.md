<p>A woman was attacked in Central Park on Thursday afternoon, and now police have released a sketch of the suspect who allegedly tried to sexually assault the victim after mugging her.</p>

<p>The incident occurred inside the park, near West 106th Street and West Drive. Police officers responded to a 911 call around 3:45 p.m. on January 19th, and, according to the NYPD, they found a 26-year-old woman &quot;with minor contusions to her arms.&quot; Police sau that the woman was walking in the park when &quot;at West 109th Street and Central Park West, she was approached by an unidentified male who grabbed her around the neck, took her to the ground and demanded her money. The victim claimed to have no money and the suspect took her cell phone. The suspect then pulled down his pants and demanded the victim perform a sex act on him.&quot;</p>
