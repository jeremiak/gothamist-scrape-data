The Sun reports 56% of respondents don&apos;t want term limits to be overturned (allowing Bloomberg to run), but Bloomberg&apos;s name topped the list of who NYers would want to see as mayor--followed by Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, Brooklyn Beep Marty Markowitz, Representative Anthony Weiner and, tying for the fifth position, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and City Comptroller William Thompson.

Don&apos;t worry, Governor Paterson--you&apos;d beat Giuliani in a hypothetical matchup!</p>
