The Daily News reports, &quot;Her notoriously talkative attorney Ron Kuby has been replaced by the taciturn Rick Jones.&quot;  The NYPD said that Lowery, 26, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045642/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/10/police_pot_smok.php">bludgeoned Stein</a> after the 62-year-old was rude to her and blew pot smoke in her face; investigators also point to Lowery&apos;s confession.  However, Kuby suggested the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045642/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/12/linda_stein_mur.php">coerced her confession</a>.
