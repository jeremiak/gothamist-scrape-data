<p>Yesterday, the NYPD sent out a frantic alert: a three-year-old boy, last seen on an F train in Brooklyn near the Smith and 9th Street Station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140630205149/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/27/nypd_3-yr-old_boy_is_missing_last_s.php">was missing after his grandfather fell asleep</a> and woke up in Queens. Luckily, the police later updated the media by saying the boy, Kah-yon Reynolds, was found in Newark in good health. It turns out that the boy and grandfather had been with the grandfather&apos;s friend, who took the boy home.</p>

But this time, the grandfather took the boy to Brooklyn with someone police called a &#x201C;methadone clinic&#x201D; friend, and the grandfather fell asleep on the subway, police said. Kah-yon spent the day with the grandfather&#x2019;s friend and returned to Newark, police said.&quot;</p>

<p>The grandfather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140630205149/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/28/nyregion/boy-3-found-safe-after-grandfather-falls-asleep-on-subway.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1">apparently woke up at 3 p.m. and reported</a> Kah-yon missing at 7:45 p.m. The NYPD contacted the methadone clinic and found out the grandfather had been there with a friend. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140630205149/http://www.ny1.com/content/news/211308/boy--3--found-in-good-health-in-newark-after-being-reported-missing/">NY1 says</a>, &quot;Sources say the friend didn&apos;t feel that the boy should have been in his grandfather&apos;s care.&quot;</p>
