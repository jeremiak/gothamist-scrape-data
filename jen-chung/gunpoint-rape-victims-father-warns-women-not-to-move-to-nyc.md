                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2012_02_mpena.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_mpena.jpg" width="640" height="383"> <br> <i>Surveillance video of Pena following a woman down the street (via NBC New York)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After a jury&apos;s indecision <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/mistrial_declared_in_gunpoint_rape.php">led to a mistrial on rape charges</a>, the father of the victim is speaking out.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rape_victim_dad_anguish_AijDI6pjMCd7V0VDyKM5mO">upset parent, who lives out of state, told the Post</a>, &quot;When things like this happen, it just makes you think twice&quot; about moving to NYC.  </p>

<p>Last August, police officer Michael Pena was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/off-duty_cop_accused_of_raping_woma.php"> arrested for allegedly raping&#x2014;at gunpoint</a>&#x2014;a schoolteacher in the courtyard of an Inwood apartment building. Residents of the building, roused by the noise, called the police.  During the trial last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/16/gunpoint_rape_cop_lawyer_admits_his.php">Pena&apos;s lawyer admitted</a>, &quot;He did in fact assault her,&quot; but tried to insist, &quot;This was a terrible crime, an unforgivable crime, but it does not rise to the level of the [rape] charges.&quot;</p>

<p>In spite of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/gunpoint_rape_cop.php">testimony from residents</a> and the victim herself, who said that Pena told her,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/gunpoint_rape_cop_victim_testifies.php"> &quot;Shut the f--k up or I&apos;ll shoot you,&quot;</a> the jury was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/27/gunpoint_rape_cop_convicted_of_sexu.php">only able to find Pena guilty on sexual assault charges,</a> but not rape.  It&apos;s believed that some jurors, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/29/gunpoint_rape_cop_mistrial_fallout.php">former Governor Spitzer buddy Lloyd Constantine</a> (who is a lawyer), sabotaged the deliberations by allegedly focusing on seemingly inconsequential things, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/the_most_outrageous_thing_said_by_a.php">why the victim couldn&apos;t remember the color of the car near where she was raped</a> and dismissing one witness&apos;s testimony because he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/31/gunpoint_rape_cop_jurors_dismissed.php">uses a skateboard</a>.  </p>

<p>The victim&apos;s father told the Post, &quot;She&#x2019;s very upset and she just needs her time right now,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s ready to talk to anyone. You know, it&#x2019;s not over yet,&quot; and added, &quot;I&#x2019;m an ex-cop, you know. They&#x2019;re the people you&#x2019;re supposed to be able to trust &#x2014; but I guess it&#x2019;s not like that anymore.&quot; No, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/former_nypd_officer_kenneth_moreno.php#photo-1">it&apos;s not, sadly</a>.</p>

<p>The Manhattan DA&apos;s office is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822105003/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/29/gunpoint_rape_cop_mistrial_fallout.php">deciding whether to re-try Pena</a>.</p>
