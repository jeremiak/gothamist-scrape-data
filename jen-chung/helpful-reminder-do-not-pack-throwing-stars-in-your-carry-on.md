<p>Look, we know that everyone wants to feel safe wherever they&apos;re going, but, really, do you need to bring daggers and throwing stars in your carry-on bags? A Connecticut man was arrested over the weekend when the Transportation Security Administration officers at LaGuardia Airport found a cache of &quot;several deadly martial arts weapons&quot; in his bag. </p>

<p>According to the TSA, the items were discovered when the New Haven resident was going through a security checkpoint. The forbidden objects included a &quot;dagger... three throwing knives, a traditional throwing star and an expandable throwing star.&quot; The TSA officers alerted the Port Authority Police who confiscated the items and arrested the man on weapons charges. </p>

<p>While the TSA says that airport operations were not impacted, it would probably help everyone, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160816114948/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/tsa_lines_eternal_damnation.php">since the TSA lines are already so crazy</a>, if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160816114948/https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/prohibited-items">checked the TSA list of prohibited items</a> before traveling. </p>
