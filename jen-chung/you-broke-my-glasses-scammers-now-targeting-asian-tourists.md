Now, it seems that the police are warning Asian tourists in Chinatown not to fall for a variation on it&#x2014;&quot;You broke my bottle of wine!&quot; or &quot;You broke my bottle of vodka!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522224215/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130326/midtown/scam-artists-targeting-asian-tourists-wine-bottle-ruse-police-warn">According to DNAinfo</a>, cops warned that con artists are &quot;bumping into pedestrians, dropping purportedly pricey bottles of wine to shatter on the sidewalk, then demanding compensation. The crooks often brandishing a receipt that &apos;proves&apos; the wine&apos;s value, said Inspector Timothy Beaudette, commander of Midtown North Precinct.&quot; Beaudette said &quot;They drop it and they got a receipt and they say, &apos;You broke my wine bottle. Give me $60!&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>He added, &quot;It happens to the tourists, particularly they seem to pick on Asians. I don&apos;t know why. Nine out of 10 [victims] are young Asian men.&quot; A source said, &quot;It&apos;s not a huge, huge problem&quot; and offered advice, &quot;If you say it&apos;s a scam, if you know it&apos;s a scam, they&apos;re only going to push you so hard.&quot; </p>

<p>Two years ago, a broken-glasses scammer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522224215/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/07/you_broke_my_glasses_scammer_gets_7.php">got sentenced to seven years in prison</a>&#x2014;and four years ago, Manhattan DA Cy Vance announced that another broken-glasses scammer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522224215/http://manhattanda.org/press-release/district-attorney-vance-announces-sentencing-%E2%80%9Cbroken-bottle%E2%80%9D-scam-artist-20-years-life">was sentenced to 20 years</a>!</p>
