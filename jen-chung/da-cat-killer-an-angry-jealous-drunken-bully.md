Joseph Petcka, a 205-pound former Mets draft prospect and actor, is on trial for animal cruelty after he brutally beat an 8-pound domestic, declawed tabby.</p>

<p>Petcka&apos;s lawyer argued that the cat, Norman, actually bit his client&apos;s hand, making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124348/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/16/cat_killer_continues_to_use_victim.php">Petcka&apos;s reaction justified</a>.  However, Petcka&apos;s then girlfriend Lisa Altobelli testified that she once returned home to find Petcka and and a drenched Norman.  She also said he was jealous of her feline companion, saying while drunk, &quot;You love Norman more than me.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124348/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/09/17/2008-09-17_cat_fight_in_the_courtroom_opening_argum.html">From the Daily News</a>: </p><blockquote>She eventually went to sleep and recalled hearing Petcka talking to the cat in a sing-song voice, &quot;Norman, Norman, Norman.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Altobelli said she abruptly woke up after Petcka kneed her in the side and grabbed her neck. He claimed the cat had bitten him.</p>

<p>She grabbed her purse and ran out of the apartment after warning him to leave or she would call the police.</p></blockquote>She returned to find Norman under a bedside table, dead and called Petcka, who hung up on her after she asked, &quot;What kind of monster could kill an innocent cat?&quot;<p></p>
