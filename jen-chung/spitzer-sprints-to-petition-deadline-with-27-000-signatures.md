                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_spitzersigs1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820190907im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_spitzersigs1.jpg" width="640" height="425"> <br> <i> Making the 11 p.m. WCBS 2 newscast</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Just in time for the 11 p.m. newscasts former Governor Eliot Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820190907/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/11/spitzer-facing-midnight-deadline-to-gather-enough-signatures-to-get-on-ballot/">triumphantly filed 27,000 signatures</a> to get on the Democratic ballot for NYC Comptroller last night. The number was staggering, given that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820190907/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/ho_yes_client_no_9_is_back_eliot_sp.php">parachuted into the running on Sunday night</a> and the filing deadline was last night at midnight (citywide candidates need to submit 3,750 valid signatures), and Spitzer said it was &quot;against the odds and all predictions--and in light of some who tried to thwart the effort.&quot;</p>

<p>His campaign had announced the Love Gov would be delivering his petitions to the Board of Elections at 10:30 p.m. In front of a mob of journalists, he said, &quot;I want to thank those who assisted with this effort and the New Yorkers who signed these petitions. I pledge to stand with you against the special interests and on the crucial issues.&quot; </p>

<p>As for challenging the petitions (candidates typically over-collect to show the strength of their support and because not all signees may be registered Democrats), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820190907/http://politicker.com/2013/07/eliot-spitzer-collects-27000-petition-signatures-for-comptrollers-race/">Spitzer said</a>, &quot;We have done this in the most meticulous way,&#x201D; he told reporters, making the case that any attempt to challenge him would be undemocratic. &#x201C;I would think that anybody who would challenge 27,000 signatures would be sending a statement they don&#x2019;t really believe in democracy, they don&#x2019;t believe in primaries, they don&#x2019;t believe in the fundamental notion of competition to seek the votes of the citizens of the state.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Spitzer was in his element. Politicker reports, &quot;As he waited at the deli-style counter for his boxes to be processed, Mr. Spitzer appeared elated, mugging for the doting cameras with his signature pages.&quot; And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820190907/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/nyregion/spitzer-submits-signatures-but-challenges-are-expected.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times offered this</a>:</p><blockquote>Even after fielding queries from a mob of reporters on Thursday night, Mr. Spitzer, heading off into the humid Manhattan evening, did not seem at all tired of the attention.<p></p>

<p>After climbing into the back seat of a black sedan, Mr. Spitzer kept his window rolled down as photographers snapped photos.</p>

<p>The car started to pull away. Mr Spitzer, smiling, leaned out to address a reporter: &#x201C;One last question?&#x201D; he asked expectantly.</p></blockquote>Spitzer will be going to Los Angeles to appear on The Tonight Show. Audrey Gelman, spokeswoman for his comptroller race rival Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820190907/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/eliot-spitzer-deadline-city-controller-primary-article-1.1396837">said</a>, &quot;Eliot Spitzer skipping town four days into his campaign? Scott Stringer will be right here, talking to voters. Sadly for Jay Leno, Eliot Spitzer&#x2019;s resignation from office was no laughing matter.&quot;<p></p>
