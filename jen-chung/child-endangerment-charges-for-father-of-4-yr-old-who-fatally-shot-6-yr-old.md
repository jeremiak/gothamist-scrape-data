The four-year-old&apos;s father, Anthony  Senatore, was charged last night with numerous counts of child endangerment&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075204/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/09/nj_4-yr-old_shoots_6-yr-old_head_wi.php">his son had taken his loaded .22-caliber rifle</a> and was &quot;pretend shooting&quot; at Brandon Holt, who died from being shot in the head. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075204/http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2013/05/father_of_6-year-old_who_fatally_shot_4-year-old_charged_with_endangerment.html#incart_m-rpt-1">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;Senatore was charged with five counts of second-degree endangering the welfare of children and one count of third-degree endangering the welfare of a child. He was also charged with a disorderly persons offense for enabling access by minors to a loaded firearm.&quot;  There were a total of five unsecured weapons that Senatore&apos;s children, including an eight-year-old and 12-year-old, could access; the one used in the killing had been taken from the parents&apos; bedroom. </p>

<p>Senatore made $100,000 bail. The shocking violence occurred in Toms River, NJ, which is in Ocean County, but the Atlantic County Prosecutor&apos;s Office is handling the case because Senatore&apos;s mother retired as a lieutenant in the Ocean County Prosecutor&apos;s Office. </p>

<p>Neighbors have been livid about the tragedy&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075204/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Boy-Shot-Head-Neighbor-Toms-River-New-Jersey-Rifle-202085271.html">one told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I think it&apos;s a tragedy that could have been prevented. I feel the parents need to be accountable, totally need to be accountable,&quot; while another fumed, &quot;My dad was a hunter. We had guns. Those guns were locked away. We didn&#x2019;t know where to find them.&quot;</p>
