<p>A 44-year-old Bronx resident was charged with multiple counts of forcible touching and harassment as well as sexual abuse connected to five separate groping incidents on 1 trains between 2011 and 2016. The 2011 victim was 13 years old, but only reported it recently after her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015111/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/subway_groper.php">twin sister was groped earlier this month.</a> </p>

<p>Police linked Kenneth Jacobson, whose address on Manhattan College Parkway is around the corner from the 242nd Street 1 train stop, to two more incidents after they informed the public they were looking for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015111/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/subway_groper.php">suspect who would touch</a> the inside or outside of females&apos; thighs. Here are the five incidents, as described by the police:</p>

<blockquote>Incident #1 (20 pct.): It was reported to police that on Monday September 19, 2016, at approximately 1740 hours, inside of a moving &quot;1&quot; train at the 66 Street subway station, the individual sat next to the 24 year-old female victim and rubbed the outside of her thigh.

<p>Incident #2 (Midtown North pct.): It was reported to police that on Wednesday September 9, 2016, at approximately 1845 hours, inside of a moving &quot;1&quot; train at the 42 Street subway station, the individual sat next to the 18 year-old female victim and rubbed the inside of her thigh.</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on, etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015111/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. Don&apos;t let the perverts win.</p>
