The main character&apos;s struggle mirrors Kwok&apos;s own experience: Kwok moved to New York when she was five years old and would go to a Chinatown sweatshop with her family and return back home to a rat- and roach-infested apartment. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Through her hard work, Kwok attended Hunter College High School, later attending  Harvard on scholarship and eventually earning her MFA in fiction at Columbia. We spoke to Kwok ahead of her reading at the Tribeca Barnes &amp; Noble <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806124734/http://store-locator.barnesandnoble.com/event/64400">tomorrow night</a> and asked her about growing up as an immigrant in NYC, being a professional ballroom dancer after college and more.</em></p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to write Girl in Translation?  </strong>I suppose I started by wanting to write this book for my mother.  When I was a child and we were working in the clothing factory, she stayed in the kitchen, tying sashes on skirts and tagging pants until late into the night.  And no matter how wise she was in Chinese, my mother could only manage a few words of broken English. </p>

<p>We all take the subway, and there are those foreigners on the train with the weird clothes, and they&#x2019;re holding plastic bags that smell funny, and they can hardly speak English.  Well, I&#x2019;ve been that foreign person and my mother&#x2019;s English is still non-existent.  I wanted to tell the other side of the story, to put English-speaking readers into the mind and heart of a Chinese immigrant, so that readers could experience what it was like to be on the other side of the language barrier.  I wanted them to feel how it was to have to struggle to comprehend English, and yet to understand Chinese as easily as a native speaker does.  I hoped that maybe the next time someone saw a foreign person on the train, they might realize that that person could be wise, articulate and funny in their own language.  <br>
 <br>
<strong>Can you describe some of your experience in New York after you immigrated?  For instance, did you really live in a roach- and rat-infested apartment and work in a Chinatown sweatshop?  </strong>Yes, we did.  We&#x2019;d been fairly well-off in Hong Kong but when we came to New York, we had to start all over again.  My family started working in a clothing factory in Chinatown and my father brought me there after school each day.  I started when I was five years old.  My story wasn&#x2019;t unusual - there were many children in the sweatshop.  I remember the constant layer of fabric dust that settled on my hair and arms, and the incredible heat of the factory due to the steamers.  We also lived in an apartment without central heating, where we kept the oven door open as our only source of warmth.  I really don&#x2019;t want to talk about the roaches and rats because I&#x2019;m still terrified of them! </p>

<p>The unusual part of my story is that we were lucky enough to get out of that life. <br>
 <br>
<strong>Do you think New York opened its arms to you?   </strong>New York taught me how hard you have to work to be the best that you can be.  It showed me an incredible world of art, music and culture. It introduced me to friends from many cultures and backgrounds. It gave me a tremendous amount of freedom, to succeed and to fail. </p>

<p>A friend of mine once told me, &#x201C;Living in New York City is like living on Krypton.  Once you learn how to walk in NY, you can fly everywhere else.&#x201D;   </p>
