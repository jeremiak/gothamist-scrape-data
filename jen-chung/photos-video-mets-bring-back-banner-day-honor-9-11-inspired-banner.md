</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, the Mets brought back an old tradition, Banner Day, where fans make the most Amazin&apos; banners and vie for top honors.  While many banners reference Mr. Met, the team&apos;s 50th anniversary, and its storied history&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150456/http://metspolice.com/2012/05/27/banner-day-2012/">many props to &quot;Fifty Shades of Shea&quot;!</a>&#x2014; the winning banner was from cousins Olivia Nuzzo of Bay Ridge and Stephanie Giangrande of Bensonhurst, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150456/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-mets-banner-day-winners-commemorate-mike-piazza-memorable-home-run-shea-stadium-9-11-article-1.1085473">who depicted Mike Piazza&apos;s September 21, 2001 home run</a> with a pre-9/11 skyline and the words, &quot;The homerun that helped heal NY! God Bless America! Let&apos;s Go Mets!&quot;</p>

<p>The cousins only watched the game on TV; Giangrande said the home run &quot;gave me chills.&quot; Here&apos;s the home run:</p>

<p>Banner Day was a tradition at Shea between 1963 and 1996, and it was brought back this year, with a social media twist (Facebook and Twitter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150456/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120527&amp;content_id=32349492&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;c_id=nym">helped decide the winning banner</a>).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150456/http://metspolice.com/2012/05/28/mets-banner-day-2012-recap-and-video/">According to MetsPolice</a>, there were about 300 banners there; the site also says, &quot;I&apos;d like to thank the Mets and [VP of Business Operations] Dave Howard and some other insiders who know I love them for taking a shot and bringing Banner Day back.&quot;  </p>

<p>Here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150456/http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2012/05/27/sports/baseball/SPTSBANNER0527.html">are more cute pictures</a> and some videos&#x2014;the first is from yesterday&apos;s Banner Day and the second is from a WWOR-9 broadcast of a 1984 Banner Day:</p>
