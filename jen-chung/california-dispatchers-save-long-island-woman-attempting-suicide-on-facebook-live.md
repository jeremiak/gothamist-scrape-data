<p>A 911 dispatch team in California helped stop a New York woman&apos;s suicide attempt earlier this week. While talking to dispatchers, the woman went on Facebook Live and started to cut herself.</p>

<p>The tragedy was averted on Wednesday, when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015837/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Alameda-County-dispatchers-stop-Facebook-Live-10884496.php">according to SFGate</a>, &quot;a crisis center in Idaho &#x2014; where the woman used to live &#x2014; talked to her early in the morning and were led to believe she was in Alameda County. They called the East Bay dispatch center about 6:30 a.m., said Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the sheriff&#x2019;s office. It turned out the woman was not in California or Idaho, but actually New York.&quot;</p>

<p>One dispatcher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015837/http://abc7ny.com/news/california-dispatchers-prevent-facebook-live-suicide-on-long-island/1723566/">praised a detective who spoke to her</a>: &quot;He was really smart with about it. It was about 7:40 a.m. here and he wasn&apos;t getting anywhere with her. And he said, &apos;Hey, what time is it?&apos; She goes, &apos;It&apos;s 10:40.&apos;&quot; Then they started to look at the pings they were getting from her phone signal and realized she was in Rockville Centre, Long Island. </p>

<p>&quot;The second time she went live she was actually cutting herself,&quot; another dispatcher told KGO. &quot;A couple of us were watching the video trying to freeze frames and describe the vehicle, figure out where she was in her car.&quot; </p>

<p>The dispatchers used the pings and Google Maps to figure out where she was and contacted local authorities, who got to her in time. Sgt. Kelly said, &quot;Where once people left suicide notes or messages, law enforcement is now seeing people actually recording their deaths. Obviously that&#x2019;s disturbing, but in a certain way it can be good because it&#x2019;s an immediate notification to friends and family that something bad is going on. In this case, we were able to save someone&#x2019;s life. Maybe it&#x2019;s a double-edged thing.&apos; </p>

<p>It took weeks for Facebook to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/01/15/a-12-year-old-girl-live-streamed-her-suicide-it-took-two-weeks-for-facebook-to-take-the-video-down/?utm_term=.1a1c9bb03b6f">remove a 12-year-old girl&apos;s December suicide video</a> (she had broadcast it on the social network). This past week, a man in Los Angeles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015837/http://www.kvue.com/news/local/actors-family-urges-awareness-after-facebook-live-suicide/393500234">shot himself in his car</a> while on Facebook Live and a Miami teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015837/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article128563889.html">was allegedly using Facebook Live</a> as she hanged herself with a scarf. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015837/http://nypost.com/2017/01/25/teen-broadcasts-her-suicide-on-facebook-live/">A Facebook spokeswoman</a> &quot;said Facebook aims to interrupt livestreams that go against community standards &apos;as quickly as possible... We also suggest people contact law enforcement or emergency services themselves if they become aware of something where the authorities can help.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><em>If someone you know exhibits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015837/https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/suicide-warning-signs">warning signs of suicide</a>: do not leave the person alone; remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt; and call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.</em></p>
