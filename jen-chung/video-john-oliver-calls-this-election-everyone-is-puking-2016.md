<p>John Oliver returned to the <em>Last Week Tonight</em> desk to tackle the various scandals plaguing presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (the latter who he described as &quot;an unambiguously racist scarecrow stuffed with scrunched-up copies of Juggs magazine&quot;). But first he gave this election year the description it needed: It&apos;s &quot;the electoral equivalent of seeing someone puking so you start puking and then someone else starts puking and pretty soon everyone is puking 2016.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021502/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/25/trump_invites_then_disinvites_genni.php">So true</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#x2019;ve spent several frustrating weeks trolling through all the innuendo and exaggerations surrounding Hillary&#x2019;s email and foundation scandals, and the worst thing we can say is that they both look bad. But the harder you look, the less you actually find. There&#x2019;s not nothing there, but what is there is irritating rather than grossly nefarious,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021502/https://www.rawstory.com/2016/09/john-oliver-trumps-scandals-are-way-worse-than-hillarys-and-voters-should-be-fcking-outraged/">he declared</a>. &quot;And this is where it&#x2019;s instructive to compare her to her opponent: Donald Trump, America&#x2019;s wealthiest hemorrhoid.... he&#x2019;s quantifiably worse.&quot;</p>

<p>Oliver basically found that Clinton&apos;s scandals are troubling, but overall declared it&apos;s &quot;not as bad as it looks. Which is never a satisfying thing to hear or, indeed, read about the buffet at a Golden Corral.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;You can be irritated by some of Hillary&#x2019;s [scandals] &#x2015; that is understandable &#x2015; but you should then be fucking outraged by Trump.&quot;  Oliver went on to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021502/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/26/john-oliver-dangerous-donald-trump-is-way-way-shadier-than-hillary-clinton.html">detail the mogul-turned-dog whistler&apos;s scandals</a>&#x2014;not releasing his tax returns; using money from his charitable foundation to pay for lawsuits; everything with Trump University; &quot;the alleged use of undocumented workers when building Trump Tower, to the fact that he received an illegal $3.5 million loan from his father in the form of a purchase of chips from one of Trump&#x2019;s casinos.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ethical failings in a politician are like raisins in a cookie,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021502/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-raisins-scandals_us_57e8c100e4b0e80b1ba2ced0">Oliver opined</a>. &quot;They shouldn&#x2019;t be there. They disgust people. But most politicians have at least a few raisins.&quot; So here&apos;s Clinton&apos;s cookie:</p>

<p>And then there&apos;s Trump: &quot;<strong>The man is a fucking raisin monsoon. He is ethically compromised to an almost unprecedented degree.</strong>&quot;</p>
