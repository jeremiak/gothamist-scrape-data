<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_swineflue.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141347im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_swineflue.jpg" width="160" height="247" class="image-left"> </span>President Obama officially declared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141347/http://gothamist.com/tags/swineflu">swine flu</a> a national emergency.  He signed a proclamation which, according to a White House announcement, &quot;enhances the ability of our nation&apos;s medical treatment facilities to handle a surge in H1N1 patients by allowing, as needed, the waiver of certain standard federal requirements on a case-by-case basis.&quot; </p>

<p>Obama wrote in the proclamation, &quot;As a nation, we have prepared at all levels of government, and as individuals and communities, taking unprecedented steps to counter the emerging pandemic.&quot;  However, the swine flu vaccine production has been delayed. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141347/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/10/24/health/AP-US-Obama-Swine-Flu.html?hp">AP reports</a>, &quot;The government has backed off initial, optimistic estimates that as many as 120 million doses would be available by mid-October. As of Wednesday, only 11 million doses had been shipped to health departments, doctor&apos;s offices and other providers,&quot; according to the CDC.  The government&apos;s current projections are to have &quot;about 50 million doses of swine flu vaccine out by mid-November and 150 million in December.&quot;</p>

<p>Centers for Disease Control says that swine flu is &quot;widespread&quot; in 46 states and &quot;accounts for 411 confirmed deaths since Aug. 30 and more than 8,200 hospitalizations.&quot;  CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden&#x2014;the former NYC health commissioner who was at the frontlines of dealing with the Big Apple&apos;s swine flu outbreak back in April&#x2014; told reporters yesterday that &quot;many millions&quot; of American have already had swine flu, but since not everyone is tested to confirm it, there&apos;s no exact count.
