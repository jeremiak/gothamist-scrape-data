										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_04_suvmt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123023im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_suvmt.jpg" width="120" height="72" class="image-right"> </span>An SUV plunged 30 feet onto Metro-North tracks near the Mount Vernon East Station last night after its driver, Stephanie Cacho, swerved to avoid a bicyclist. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123023/http://www.1010wins.com/Mt--Vernon-Woman-Lucky-to-Be-Alive-After-Accident/6736253">1010 WINS reports</a>, &quot;Her Jeep Cherokee crashed through an iron fence and fell onto the tracks below West First Street, narrowly missing four electrified third rails, according to MTA Spokesman Dan Brucker, who called her survival &apos;astounding.&apos;&quot; Brucker said that if the SUV hit one of the third rails, it would have exploded (!). Good Samaritan Rohan Britton pulled Cacho out of her sunroof, &quot;It was already mashed up a little bit so I just bent it open, opened it and pulled her out,&quot; and he himself was almost hit by an oncoming train. </p>
