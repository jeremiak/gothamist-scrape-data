He had been suffering from cancer of the esophagus since 2002.  The NY Times writes his &quot;gifts for finding the ominous in the everyday and the noise within silence made him the most influential and imitated dramatist of his generation.&quot; His most famous plays include The Birthday Party, The Caretaker, The Homecoming, The Servant and Betrayal, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213513/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article5397225.ece">Times of London explained</a> his work &quot;introduced a new word to the English language &#x2013; Pinteresque &#x2013; to convey an atmospheric silence.&quot; (More about Pinteresque, the adjective, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213513/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article5397449.ece">here</a>.) Kenneth Tynan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213513/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/96860.html">once wrote</a>, &quot;Mr. Pinter is a superb manipulator of language, which he sees not as a bridge that brings people together but as a barrier that keeps them apart. Ideas and emotions, in the larger sense, are not his province; he plays with words, and he plays on our nerves, and it is thus that he grips us.&quot;</p>
