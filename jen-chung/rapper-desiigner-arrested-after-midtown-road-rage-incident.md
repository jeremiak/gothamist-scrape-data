The driver of the other car called 911 and claimed Desiigner pointed a gun at him. The SUV left but the driver of the car took down the license plate number. Cops found the SUV a short time later, searched it, and found a large quantity of loose pills in the center console. Our law enforcement sources say they found Oxycontin and other drugs.&quot;</p>
