<p>Holiday shoppers on an escalator at a Brooklyn shopping center were injured when one person fell and knocked into others. One witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151412/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Target-Shopper-Falls-Escalator-Takes-Down-Other-Customers-407674665.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;We just heard a whole bunch of screams, and then we heard a whole bunch of what sounds like bodies just dropping.&quot; </p>

<p>She added, &quot;I thought honestly the whole escalator had collapsed, but apparently I think they said a bunch of people just fell down the escalator.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the busy Atlantic Terminal mall on Flatbush Avenue, on a down escalator near the Target, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151412/http://abc7ny.com/news/7-hurt-in-chain-reaction-escalator-fall-in-brooklyn/1666025/">around 6:30 p.m.</a> The escalator apparently malfunctioned: Some say that it hadn&apos;t been working, so (possibly dozens of) people were walking on it, and then it suddenly started up, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151412/http://pix11.com/2016/12/20/person-falls-on-escalator-creating-chain-reaction-at-brooklyn-mall/">causing the first person to tumble</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>One witness characterized the escalator as speeding up abruptly:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The down escalator at Atlantic Terminal Mall in Brooklyn sped up super fast &amp; then stopped suddenly throwing everyone off! So scary! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151412/https://twitter.com/hashtag/abc7NY?src=hash">#abc7NY</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151412/https://t.co/IsgFIRUNNE">pic.twitter.com/IsgFIRUNNE</a></p>&#x2014; Angela Sauv&#xE9; (@gigisauve) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151412/https://twitter.com/gigisauve/status/811359303017885696">December 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

Everybody ended up in a heap on the floor.&quot; </p>

<p>Two people were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151412/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/12/20/brooklyn-escalator-malfunction/">seriously injured</a> while five others suffered minor injuries. The escalators were taken out of service for investigation. </p>
