<p>Yesterday, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113024/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/140358/nypd--bronx-churches-team-up-for-gun-buyback">held a gun buyback at three locations</a> in the Bronx, offering $200 (for handguns) or $20 (for rifles and shotguns) bank cards in exchange for weapons, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113024/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/05/2011-06-05_great_guns_hundreds_of_weapons_turned_in.html">collected hundreds of guns</a>.  Including an Uzi submachine gun.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113024/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/uzi_does_it_at_bx_gun_buyback_nqG2D3Rv4mRPpPe9uQ2bpK#ixzz1OPHUhE9M">Post has a field day</a> with that tidbit, with the headline, &quot;Uzi does it at a Bx. gun buyback,&quot; and an article that begins, &quot;A gun owner said goodbye to his little friend. An example of Tony Montana&apos;s weapon of choice was taken off the streets yesterday when the owner of an Uzi machine gun exchanged it for $200 at a Bronx gun buyback, a source said.&quot;  Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. offered a positive quote, &quot;Any day that you get an Uzi off the streets of The Bronx is a good day.&quot;</p>

<p>A retired MTA conductor who turned in a handgun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113024/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/05/2011-06-05_great_guns_hundreds_of_weapons_turned_in.html">explained to the Daily News</a> he had it from when he took it from a gun-toting man on the subway 35 years ago and then put it in his closet, &quot;God knows I don&apos;t need the money; I just need to get rid of the handgun...We&apos;re away from home a lot, and you never know if somebody is going to come and break into your house [and steal it]. I&apos;m too old to deal with guns.&quot;</p>
