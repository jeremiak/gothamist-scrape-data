Not that H&amp;H; wanted to&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517131654/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/exclusive-legendary-bagel-maker-h-h-bagel-closes-w-46th-st-site-landlord-takes-possession-article-1.1012392">the Daily News reports</a>, &quot;A New York City Marshal has moved to take possession of the fabled bagel maker from its last existing site on W. 46th.&quot;</p>

Back in October, owner Helmer Toro had owed $600,000 in back rent.  </p>

<p>The News, though, mentions that earlier this week, &quot;Toro, 61, said he&#x2019;s in early talks with investors who might bail him out and said he believes the company will survive. Toro said he is scouting for a new site on the Upper West Side.&quot; Until H&amp;H; reopens, consider having sesame-covered dreams as you read this Thomas Beller&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517131654/http://mrbellersneighborhood.com/2004/03/portrait-of-the-bagel-as-a-young-man">account of working at the West 80th store</a>.</p>
