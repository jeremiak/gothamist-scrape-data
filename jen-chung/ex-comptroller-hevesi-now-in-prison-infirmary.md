Prison officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124052206/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/inmate_hevesi_in_infirmary_XOBrOMeEAfkfWWxUAwDPgI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">won&apos;t disclose why he&apos;s there</a>.<p></p>

<p>Hevesi, who has admitted to taking $1 million from investment firms in exchange for giving those firms the state pension fund&apos;s business, apparently has medical issues. His sentencing was delayed from March, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124052206/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/hevesi_hospitized_with_internal_ble.php">when he had internal bleeding</a>, and during the sentencing, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124052206/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/04/17/2011-04-17_hevesis_in_prison_infirmary.html">lawyer said that any prison sentence</a> could be a &quot;death sentence...citing a litany of health problems from diabetes to anxiety to heart disease that could require a pacemaker.&quot;</p>

<p>Hevesi will be at Ulster for two weeks, for health and mental screenings, and then transferred to another prison, where he&apos;ll probably be in protective custody, away from general population.  In the meantime, the News detailed the menu, &quot;Hevesi&apos;s first meal behind bars Friday night was scheduled to be stuffed shells and steamed spinach followed by a breakfast yesterday of Rice Krispies and waffles and a lunch of pan pizza.&quot; </p>
