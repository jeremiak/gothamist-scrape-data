<p>The 69th Columbus Day Parade is happening right now, but one band is missing: The West Point Military Academy&apos;s band.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the band posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003255/https://www.facebook.com/westpointband/posts/10151630758341825">on its Facebook page</a>, &quot;Unfortunately, due to the government shutdown, we will not be appearing in the Columbus Day Parade on Monday. Keep an eye out for us next year.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003255/http://nypost.com/2013/10/14/west-point-band-shut-out-of-columbus-day-parade/">Post spoke to the president</a> of the Columbus Citizens Foundation, Frank Fusaro, &quot;It is very regrettable that for reasons unrelated to their professionalism and commitment to our country that they are unable to perform on Fifth Avenue this Columbus Day.&quot; According Fusaro&apos;s statement, &quot;West Point&#x2019;s appearance was going to be underwritten entirely by the citizen&#x2019;s foundation &#x2014; which months prior to the government shutdown had agreed to pay for all costs, including transportation, tolls, and meals.&quot;</p>

<p>Fusaro added, &quot;The Band is made up of active-duty soldiers who are also virtuosos from across the United States. Historically, and for over two centuries, the Band&#x2019;s members have been ambassadors of our country.&quot; As a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003255/https://www.facebook.com/westpointband/posts/10151630758341825?comment_id=26634050&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=12">Facebook commenter said</a>, &quot;Thank goodness the congressional gym is still open so that they are not put out by this shut down.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, the West Point band was replaced by the Ohio North University Marching Band.</p>
