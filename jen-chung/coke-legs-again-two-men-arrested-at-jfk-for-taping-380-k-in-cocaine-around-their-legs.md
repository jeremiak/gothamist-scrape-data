<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426184247/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/10/coke_legs.php">two incidents</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426184247/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/17/coke_pants_two_residue_boogaloo.php">last month</a>, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have once again found cocaine-taped to travelers&apos; legs at JFK Airport. This time, two men on the same flight were arrested.</p>

<p>The arrests were made following an April 19th flight from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to JFK Airport. Customs and Border Protection says that U.S. citizen Ariel Garcia &quot;presented himself for inspection,&quot; and was taken to a private search room. During a search, officers say they discovered the packages containing a white powder taped to his legs. The powder later tested positive for cocaine; approximately 11 pounds of cocaine was confiscated, with an estimated street value of more than $180,000.</p>

<p>Fellow traveler Elvin Montilla-Sosa, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, was allegedly found with 12 pounds of cocaine packages taped to his legs and back. The coke has an estimated street value of more than $200,000.</p>

<p>Both men were turned over to Homeland Security Investigations and now face federal narcotics smuggling charges.</p>
