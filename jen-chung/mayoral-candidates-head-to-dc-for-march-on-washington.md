<p>As he announced last month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826073954/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/21/photos_thousands_want_justice_for_t.php#photo-1">at a rally for Trayvon Martin</a>, the Rev. Al Sharpton has organized a March on Washington to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&apos;s pivotal March 50 years ago. Many NYC mayoral candidates are actually in D.C. right now, too. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn Tweeted the above photograph of herself and Rev. Jesse Jackson.</p>

<p>Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, along with his wife Chirlane McCray and son Dante, are also in D.C.&#x2014;he issued a statement, &quot;Fifty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Americans came together on the Mall in Washington, called together by a common dream. They called it the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The March was a powerful statement that the inequitable status quo of the day was not reflective of the values we held as a nation... Indeed, New Yorkers today face a similar choice as Americans of the 1960s: do we accept the convenience of continuity, or do we demand progress with bold ideas that prioritize fairness for all?&quot; </p>

<p>Former Comptroller Bill Thomson is there, as are candidates for Comptroller: Eliot Spitzer Tweeted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826073954/https://twitter.com/Spitzer2013/status/371272796019896320">he was &quot;excited&quot; to be there</a> and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer is with his union supporters:</p>
