<p>David Laffer, the 33-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622161326/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/police_raid_li_home_in_connection_w.php">accused of killing four people</a> at a Medford, Long Island pharmacy before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622161326/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/li_massacre_suspect_resisted_arrest.php#photo-1">robbing the store of over 10,000 hydrocodone pills</a> and other prescription drugs, will plead guilty, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622161326/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/sources-guilty-plea-in-medford-slayings-1.3149727">according to Newsday&apos;s sources</a>. Laffer has a court date tomorrow, and Newsday reports, &quot;Laffer is expected to plead guilty as charged before Suffolk County Court Judge James Hudson. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.&quot;</p>

<p>Laffer was charged with four counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Haven Drugs worker Jennifer Mejia, 17; pharmacist Raymond Ferguson, 45; and customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, and Jamie Taccetta, 33. Suffolk County prosecutors painted a horrifying timeline: Laffer allegedly &quot;simply shot [Ferguson] after engaging the pharmacist in conversation&quot; and then went to steal the hydrocodone. Then, after spotting Mejia, ADA John Collins says Laffer shot her twice. Taccetta&apos;s fiance, who had been waiting outside in a car, was the one who discovered the carnage.  </p>

<p>Authorities say that Laffer carried out the masacre while his wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622161326/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/li_massacre_suspect_resisted_arrest.php#photo-5">Melinda Brady waited in a car</a>. Brady, who pleaded not guilty, has claimed they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622161326/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/24/li_massacre_suspects_wife_claims_th.php">only planned a robbery</a>.</p>
