Nicholas Blossom&apos;s roommate Corey Mulee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325175914/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/on_mend_from_hole_in_the_head_lJ5FSJrc0Ve8pX2UVsnPiP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a> that doctors have been surprised at Blossom&apos;s recovery so far, &quot;He&apos;s doing very well. The family is really happy.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Blossom, a musician (he plays the drums for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325175914/http://www.myspace.com/alaskaalaskatunes">Alaska Alaska</a>) who lives in Williamsburg, was reportedly drunk when he tumbled off the West 26th Street apartment building&apos;s balcony&apos;s ledge early Saturday morning.  A neighbor said, &quot;I was just getting ready for bed when I heard a boom. I heard moaning, then obscenities.... and then some screams for help. That&apos;s when I called the cops.&quot;</p>

<p>Doctors at Bellevue were able to remove the fence from his head, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325175914/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/31/2010-05-31_impaled_partygoer_rests_the_pain_away.html">his mother told the Daily News</a>, &quot;Yesterday, they did not want him to go to sleep, so he was in a lot of pain, but they upped his medication today because they decided he&apos;d improved enough that he can sleep today. He&apos;ll be in the ICU for a week.&quot; She added, &quot;It&apos;s hard, but we have been really impressed with the care he&apos;s been getting in New York City. People have really been there for him.&quot;</p>
