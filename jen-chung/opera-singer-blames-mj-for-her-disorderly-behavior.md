										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_gpochinki.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140807172643im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_gpochinki.jpg" width="220" height="229" class="image-left"> </span>Opera singer Gabriela Pochinki, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140807172643/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/opera_star_charged_with_disorderly.php">loud cellphone speakerphone conversation</a> at an Upper West Side restaurant led to a row last week, is relieved that she can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140807172643/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/24/disorderly_opera_diva_apologizes_av.php">avoid jail</a> if she stays out of trouble.  So now she&apos;s telling the Post and the Daily News why she got so carried away on the phone (<em>hint</em>, it was because of Michael Jackson!).  </p>

<p>Pochinki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140807172643/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/25/2009-10-25_opera_diva_gabriela_pochinki_says_cellphone_tussle_was_just_misunderstanding.html">tells the Daily News</a> that &quot;she and her mother had just sat down at [Nice Matin] when she got a call from organizers of the Las Vegas premiere of the Michael Jackson movie &apos;This Is It.&apos;&quot; (A call she put on speakerphone.) She said, &quot;I was so excited, happy... At the moment, I didn&apos;t even think. I was in my own world.&quot;  So much in her own world, she ignored the a server&apos;s request to pipe down.  The restaurant&apos;s manager said that they tried to ask her to leave repeatedly, only for Pochinki to push her.</p>

<p>Ponchinki, who denies pushing the manager, refused to leave.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140807172643/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jacko_made_me_do_it_gsssKp9bL0XLUBhvKM5eTM">Speaking to the Post</a>, she said, &quot;The police showed up and they didn&apos;t ask me what was going on, they just told me to come with them. I really wasn&apos;t aware what was going on. I never thought speaking on a cellphone could get someone arrested.&quot;  She was taken to the station house, serenaded cops with &quot;Somewhere&quot; from West Side Story, and got a desk appearance ticket.  And she&apos;s learned her lesson: &quot;<strong>I&apos;ll never talk on a cellphone again in a restaurant.</strong>&quot;</p>
