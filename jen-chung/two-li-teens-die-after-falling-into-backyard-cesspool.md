<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2011_05_cpcover.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130623194007im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_05_cpcover.jpg" width="300" height="203"> <br> <i>The cover for the cesspool (WABC 7)</i></div> Two people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130623194007/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=8166053">are dead after a tragic accident</a> in Farmingville, Long Island.  Eduardo Vanegas-Fuentes, 16,  and Edgar Calderon-Castro, 19, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130623194007/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/officials-2-teens-fall-into-cesspool-1.2922289">opened the cover to a backyard cesspool</a> around 8 p.m.  Vanegas-Fuentes apparently lost his footing, fell in, and lost consciousness. Then Calderon-Castro, in an attempt to save his friend, jumped in, but he too lost consciousness.  <p></p>

<p>Samuel Suarez, whose family rents the house and property where the tragedy took place, told Newsday they were planning on starting a campfire and had no idea the cover was for a cesspool, which was 16 feet deep and about half full.  Suarez had gone to call 911 when Calderon-Castro jumped in.  </p>

<p>When the fire department arrived, Newsday reports they &quot;used a 12-foot pike pole to grab the clothing of one of the victims and pull him out. Rescuers used a roof ladder with hooks to pull the other victim from the cesspool.&quot; The pair were taken to Stony Brook University Hospital, but they died this morning.</p>

<p>Last year, a teen working at a Smithtown Dunkin&apos; Donuts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130623194007/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/li_teen_falls_to_death_in_cesspool.php">was killed</a> when he fell through a cesspool manhole cover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130623194007/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/03/investigators_cesspool_cover_broke.php">that broke under him</a>. And in 2009, a worker survived after being rescued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130623194007/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/08/after_hours_man_freed_from_long_isl.php">from a LI cesspool that collapsed</a>.</p>
