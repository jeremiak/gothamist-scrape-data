										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_07-carlde.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164351im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07-carlde.jpg" width="365" height="301"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Dante Cespedes (Facebook)</i></div> On Tuesday, police in Belleville, NJ arrived at the home of Dante Cespedes to arrest him for assaulting his wife. Cespedes, a relief chef at the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan, allegedly lunged at them with knives, so the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164351/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/07/cops_shot_belleville_chef_approximately_25_times_after_domestic_dispute.html#incart_m-rpt-1">fired 30 times, hitting him with 24 shots</a>, and killing him.<p></p>

<p>Earlier, Cespedes&apos; wife went to the police station to say he was abusing her (she had brought their four children along), so police went to their home to arrest him and serve him a restraining order. It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164351/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/09/fatal-police-involved-shooting-under-investigation-in-belleville/">believed he was intoxicated</a> when they arrived. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164351/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/07/cops_shot_belleville_chef_approximately_25_times_after_domestic_dispute.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Star-Leger reports</a>, &quot;Three of the officers opened fire. It is not clear how many shots were fired by each cop... It remains unclear how much time elapsed between the assault complaint and the fatal shooting.&quot; </p>

<p>Cespedes, 40, was hit in the torso and head. Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray also said. &quot;The number of shots alone does not lead to any conclusions.&quot;</p>

<p>The Algonquin&apos;s manager said Cespedes had worked there for seven years and ended his shift at 3:30 p.m., adding the staff was &quot;shocked and saddened&quot; the death.</p>
