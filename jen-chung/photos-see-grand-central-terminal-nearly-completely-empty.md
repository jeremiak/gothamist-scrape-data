<p>The MTA just released these photographs of Grand Central after the last Metro-North trains left and the MTA police secured the station&#x2014;all part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111016103159/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/breaking_mta_shutting_down_saturday.php">agency&apos;s systemwide shutdown today</a>.  The MTA has closed the terminal, and all commuter rail, subway, and bus service has been suspended.  Only MTA bridges and tunnels are open now, and those will close if winds become very intense.  </p>
