<p>After failing to get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172247/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/29/jason_kidd_likely_leaving_brooklyn.php">promotion to team president</a>, Brooklyn Nets coach Jason Kidd is on his way to coach the Milwaukee Bucks. NBA league sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172247/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--bucks-have-hired-jason-kidd-as-coach-151228691.html">confirmed the move to Yahoo Sports&apos; Adrian Wojnarowski</a>, and in exchange the Bucks will send two second-round draft picks to Brooklyn.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172247/http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/265224671.html">According to the Journal Sentinel</a>, &quot;Kidd will replace Larry Drew, who coached just one season with the Bucks. Drew went 15-67 in his only season in Milwaukee. He had two years remaining on the deal he signed last summer, a three-year contract worth approximately $7.5 million. The Bucks new ownership team of Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens met with Kidd in New York on Friday, the day after the NBA draft... Bucks general manager John Hammond initially was not consulted on the move to hire Kidd. But a source indicated Hammond will remain as general manager and David Morway as assistant general manager, with Kidd being hired only in a coaching role.&quot;</p>

<p>Kidd is friends with Lasry and Lasry has also overseen Kidd&apos;s finances. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172247/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/sports/basketball/kidds-power-play-is-bold-if-not-out-of-character.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0">NY Times characterized the move as</a> &quot;essentially a power grab gone wrong for Kidd... Kidd&#x2019;s attempt to leapfrog [general manager Billy] King on the organizational ladder was a brazen move, albeit one that was not necessarily out of character. Kidd was a gifted point guard who led the Nets to consecutive finals appearances, but he also had a reputation for sparring with coaches and pursuing his own agenda, going so far as to publicly demand trades.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172247/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/29/jason_kidd_fined_50000_for_spilled.php">And soda spills</a>!</p>

Not to mention, he&#x2019;s taking somebody else&#x2019;s job when he already had a better one.&quot;</p>

<p>Lionel Hollins, who most recently coached the Memphis Grizzlies, is considered a lead contender to coach the Nets.</p>
