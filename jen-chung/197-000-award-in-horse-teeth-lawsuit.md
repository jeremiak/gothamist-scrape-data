Realtor Marvalyn Foster had wanted a permanent bridge to replace a false tooth and her lawyer says dentist Darren Martinez claimed he&apos;d give her a &quot;big, beautiful Hollywood celebrity smile.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405063621/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473081,00.html">three of her teeth were removed</a> and the new bridge resembled horse teeth.  Foster&apos;s lawyer also told the Connecticut Post, &quot;She now faces two to five years of expensive dental treatment to give her what he had promised her -- a beautiful smile.&quot;  In other dental news, a Westchester man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405063621/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12262008/news/regionalnews/dentist_busted_as_un_tooth_ful_145994.htm">accused of practicing dentistry without a license</a> in his home&apos;s kitchen (he apparently says he was a licensed orthdontist in Ecuador) would give his patient wine &quot;to help them cope with pain from treatments.&quot;</p>
