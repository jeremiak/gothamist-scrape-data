<p>Is the real test of presidential readiness whether or not your can imagine the Commander-in-Chief being the kind of leader President Whitmore, played by Bill Pullman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314190522/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLywiaM6PA">was in <em>Independence Day</em></a>? In last night&apos;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, the cold open offered up a scenario that had aliens from the planet Zorblatt 9 attacking the United States next year&#x2014;and Alec Baldwin portrayed President Trump once again to give a rousing speech to soldiers, &quot;Now here&#x2019;s the deal. We&#x2019;re going to beat these aliens because we&#x2019;ve got the best military, but we don&#x2019;t win anymore. And the aliens are laughing at us. They&#x2019;re killing us and they&#x2019;re laughing at us.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&apos;s just say, things don&apos;t go well: </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314190522if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/MrkJM4JUB28" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>When Kenan Thompson, playing a soldier, asks what he will do to fight the aliens, who have the edge with the latest technology, &quot;Trump&quot; says, &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re going to do. &#x201C;We are going to bring coal back, okay? We&#x2019;re going to have so much coal, you&#x2019;re going to say &#x2018;Where did all this coal come from? I never knew there could be so much coal.&#x2019;&quot; </p>

<p>Later on, Baldwin&apos;s &quot;Trump&quot; insists, &quot;Actually, I heard the aliens are already here. They&apos;ve been hiding in this country for hundred of years. They are shape-shifters. They look like regular people, but they&apos;re aliens,&quot; pointing at soldiers played by Leslie Jones and Sasheer Zamata.  And where is he getting this information? &quot;Infowars, it&apos;s a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You know he&apos;s legit because he&apos;s always taking off his shirt.&quot;</p>

<p>Some other zingers:<br>
- Upon learning that California has been destroyed, &quot;So then I won the popular vote?&quot;<br>
- When another soldier reports that NYC has been attacked and the Trump Hotel has been damaged, to the cost of $50 million, &quot;Trump&quot; clarifies, &quot;More like a billion dollars.&quot; The soldier continues that no one was hurt because &quot;no one was staying at that hotel.&quot; &quot;Trump&quot; offered, &quot;I&#x2019;m sure a bunch of top-shelf, very classy people died there!&quot;<br>
- When the alien leader (Bobby Moynihan) realizes that &quot;Trump&quot; is the leader, he proclaims, &quot;Really? This is going to be so easy!&quot;</p>

<p>This and last week&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314190522/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/05/snl_cold_open_kate_mckinnon_as_jeff.php">Jeff Sessions-as-Forest Gump cold open</a> were not as brutal (or funny) as past spoofs of the presidency. Earlier this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314190522/http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/06/alec-baldwin-wont-play-trump-much-longer-snl/">Baldwin said he wasn&apos;t sure if he&apos;d still play</a> the role, &quot;The maliciousness of this White House has people very worried. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m not going to do it much longer, the impersonation. I don&#x2019;t [know] how much more people can take it.&quot;</p>
