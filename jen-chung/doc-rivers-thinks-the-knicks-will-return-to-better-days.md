Rhoden asked him if he thought there was hope for the Knicks.  Rivers said, &quot;Absolutely.  I was a part of it when the Knicks were good. I was there. There was no better feeling as a player than playing in that city when you&#x2019;re winning. It was a phenomenal feeling, with that whole &#x2018;Go New York, go New York, go.&#x2019; The city was going nuts. That will return. <strong>I don&#x2019;t know what day, what year, but it&#x2019;s going to return.</strong>&#x201D;  Rhoden also noticed that the Celtics&apos; practice camp was all about team building, whereas the Knicks camp was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062000/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/30/marbury_willing_to_be_cut.php">all about Stephon Marbury</a> (as usual).</p>
