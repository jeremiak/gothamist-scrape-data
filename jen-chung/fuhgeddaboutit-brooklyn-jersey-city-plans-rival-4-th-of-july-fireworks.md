<p>Now that Mayor Bill de Blasio has ruined July 4th for those living along the Hudson River by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013529/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/de_blasios_new_york_fireworks_comin.php">sending the Macy&apos;s July 4th Fireworks back to the East River</a> (forever if he has his way!), Jersey City&apos;s mayor is stepping up. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013529/http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/05/jersey_city_to_host_own_july_4.html">According to the Jersey Journal</a>, &quot;Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop announced yesterday that the city is planning a Freedom and Fireworks Festival, a free concert at Liberty State Park followed by a &quot;large fireworks display.&quot; Hi email stated, &quot;I&apos;d like you to start dusting off your BBQ, get your chairs and blankets ready and invite your friends and family to Jersey City to celebrate the 4th of July in one of our nation&apos;s most culturally and ethnically diverse communities.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013529/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/nyregion/with-july-4th-fireworks-leaving-the-hudson-jersey-city-will-revive-its-own-show.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Fulop told the NY Times</a>, &quot;We&#x2019;re not in the business of competing with New York City directly,&quot; but &quot;the window of opportunity opened.&quot; The event will be sponsored by from Suntex Marinas and Budweiser&#x2014;and it may be televised, too. From the Times:</p><blockquote>Mr. Fulop said that Fox News Channel&#x2019;s morning show, &#x201C;Fox and Friends,&#x201D; planned to broadcast from the event; he added that he could not say whether Fox intended to broadcast the fireworks as well.<p></p>

<p>A spokesman for Budweiser said that the Independence Day event would be the culmination of a national campaign to raise money for the Folds of Honor Foundation, which provides assistance to the families of military personnel killed or wounded in service. He declined to comment on whether Budweiser would sponsor a broadcast of the fireworks.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Fox News said the company&#x2019;s broadcast decisions for the Fourth of July would &#x201C;be made closer to that date.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Fulop expects 100,000 to attend.<p></p>
