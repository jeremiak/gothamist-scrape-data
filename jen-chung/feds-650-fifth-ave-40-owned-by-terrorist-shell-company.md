The feds say that the 40% stake is owned by a shell company for Iranian terrorists&#x2014;the stake is owned by Iranian state bank Bank Melli, but, per the FBI, &quot;Bank Melli&apos;s ownership interest was, however, disguised.&quot; (A 1995 law prohibits &quot;any person from exporting or causing to be exported from the United States, to Iran or the Government of Iran, any goods, technology, or services without... a valid<br>
export license from the United States Department of Treasury.&quot;)  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124125704/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/nyregion/18seize.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The seizure was the latest step in the government&#x2019;s broader effort to financially suffocate Iran&#x2019;s biggest banks, several of which have been accused of funneling money to groups like Hamas and financing Iran&#x2019;s nuclear missile program.&quot;  Tenants in the building include Citibank and the Juicy flagship store.</p>
