Around 9 p.m. near East 59th Street, Ismael Guevera allegedly &quot;shoved a fake sickle in&quot; Lee Dutton&apos;s &quot;girlfriend&apos;s face&quot;.  Dutton told him, &quot;You don&apos;t need to be doing this,&quot; prompting Guevera to take out a boxcutter and slash Dutton&apos;s neck, just missing his jugular vein.  Guevera also allegedly yelled, &quot;Who&apos;s next?  Who wants to start s--- next?&quot;  Dutton and his girlfriend got out at 68th Street, and Guevera was arrested at 96th Street.  Dutton told the Post, &quot;<strong>His intentions were definitely there, he just didn&apos;t succeed too well.</strong>&quot;</p>
