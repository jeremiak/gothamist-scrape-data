<p>Last year, Mary Richardson Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075059/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/mary_kennedy_estranged_wife_of_rfk.php">hanged herself in an outbuilding</a> of her Westchester County home. While Kennedy and his family mentioned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075059/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/rfk_jr_at_estranged_wifes_funeral_i.php">her struggle with depression</a>, her friends claimed that RFK Jr.&apos;s behavior, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075059/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/mary_kennedys_friends_blame_rfk_jr.php">especially his cheating</a>, did not help. Now the Post reports that the scion of the Kennedy political dynasty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075059/http://nypost.com/2013/09/08/rfk-jr-s-sex-diary-of-adultery/">actually kept a &quot;sex diary&quot; recounting numerous affairs</a> and his guilt about being seduced by so many ladies.</p>

<p>The Post details:</p><blockquote>A copy of the 398 pages, reviewed by The Post, details RFK Jr.&#x2019;s daily activities, speeches, political activism and the lives of his six children in the year 2001. But they also record the names of women &#x2014; with numbers from 1&#x2009;to 10 next to each entry.<p></p>

<p>The codes corresponded to sexual acts, with 10 meaning intercourse, Mary told a confidant. There are 37 women named in the ledger, 16 of whom get 10s.</p>

<p>On Nov. 13, 2001, RFK Jr. records a triple play. The separate encounters &#x2014; coded 10, 3 and 2 &#x2014; occur the same day he attended a black-tie fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria for Christopher Reeve&#x2019;s charity, where he sat next to the paralyzed &#x201C;Superman&#x201D; star, magician David Blaine and comic Richard Belzer.</p>

<p>It was a hectic month for Kennedy, who traveled to &#xAD;Toronto, Louisiana and Washington, DC &#x2014; and listed at least one woman&#x2019;s name on 22 different dates, including 13 consecutive days...</p>

<p>Kennedy holds back on any detailed description of his conquests and bizarrely portrays himself as a kind of victim. He uses the word &#x201C;mugged&#x201D; as shorthand for being seduced.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team of [two women]. It was tempting but I prayed and God gave me the strength to say no,&#x201D; he writes on Feb. 6. A few days later, on Valentine&#x2019;s Day, he gives his pregnant wife orchids, he notes.</p></blockquote>When the Post asked Kennedy about the diary, there was &quot;six seconds of stunned silence&quot; before he said, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001. I don&#x2019;t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.&quot;<p></p>

<p>There&apos;s one amusing point: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075059/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/07/06/robert-f-kennedy-jr-jailed-for-vieques-protest/">RFK Jr. was jailed in July 2001</a>, after protesting in Vieques, and he had a good time, &quot;I&#x2019;m so content here. I have to say it. There&#x2019;s no women. I&#x2019;m happy! Everybody here seems happy. It&#x2019;s not &#xAD;misogyny. It&#x2019;s the opposite! I love them too much.&quot; </p>

<p>Kennedy is now dating actress Cheryl Hines.</p>
