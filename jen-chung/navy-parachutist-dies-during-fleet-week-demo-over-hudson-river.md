<p>A Navy Seal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170529172316/http://abc7ny.com/news/navy-seal-killed-in-parachute-accident-to-be-remembered-on-memorial-day/2049910/">died on Saturday afternoon</a> during a Fleet Week demonstration in Jersey City, NJ. The parachutist was supposed to land with fellow Leap Frogs in Liberty State Park, but he fell in the Hudson River.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the team members&apos; parachute malfunctioned. The Navy SEAL&apos;s parachute failed to open properly, and he landed in the water adjacent to Liberty State Park,&quot; said Rear Admiral Jack Scorby, Commander of the U.S. Navy&apos;s Mid-Atlantic Region. </p>

<p>Hundreds of people had been gathered to watch the demonstration. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170529172316/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/nyregion/fleet-week-parachute-dead-leap-frogs.html">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>With the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop, the team of parachutists descended from a helicopter around noon. Onlookers described a typical Leap Frogs demonstration, in which the parachutists join hands and twist and turn in the sky. Their yellow and blue parachutes were emblazoned with &#x201C;NAVY,&#x201D; and one parachutist carried a giant American flag that whipped in the wind.<p></p>

<p>But one parachutist peeled off from the others and slipped out of view...</p>

<p>Maria Ashley, 49, a spectator, said few people around her realized anything had happened because several tall glass towers on the New Jersey side of the water blocked a view of the parachutist as he went into the river.</p>

<p>But Ms. Ashley said she had thought something had gone awry. &#x201C;I knew it wasn&#x2019;t right because the parachute should be in an arch,&#x201D; she said.</p></blockquote>The  Leap Frogs had promoted the event on Facebook right before the jump:<br>

<p>Their Facebook page has photos of what the jump should have looked like:</p>

<p>The parachutist apparently cut the cords from his parachute, which landed in a parking lot. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170529172316/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2017/05/parachute_fails_to_open_during_fleet_week_show_off.html">According to NJ.com</a>, &quot;Freelance photographer Joe Shine said the parachutist apparently realized he was in trouble and detached the chute so he would land in the Hudson River.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170529172316/http://nypost.com/2017/05/28/navy-parachutist-injured-after-mishap-with-chute/">A boater told the Post</a> that after he saw the three Leap Frogs land, &quot;Almost the same time that they touched down in Liberty State Park, we heard a splash and turned around very quick.  saw the water splash, and apparently there was a fourth parachutist... We&#x2019;re not sure where he came from. We didn&#x2019;t see him exit the same helicopter and apparently the chute did not deploy.&quot;</p>

<p>The Navy Seal was recovered from the water and pronounced dead at 1:10 p.m. His parachute fell into a parking lot at 30 Hudson Street.</p>

<p>The incident is being investigated and the victim&apos;s name is being withheld until his family is notified.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Scorby also said, &quot;Our hearts and prayers go out to his family, and I ask for all of your prayers for the Navy SEAL community who lost a true patriot today.&quot;</p>
