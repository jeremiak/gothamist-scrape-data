<p>Last week, when NJ Governor Chris Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429074241/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/chris_christie_makes_america_great.php">endorsed real estate mogul Donald Trump</a>, it seemed like a monstrous but well-matched marriage of nasty putdowns and arrogance, one that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429074241/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/27/report_the_republican_party_is_a_be.php">Republican Party deserved</a>. But on Super Tuesday, it seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429074241/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/28/watch_chris_christies_cringeworthy.php">the honeymoon</a> is over and the reality is sinking in for Christie. His dawning realization of what President Trump really means for America was evocatively captured by these Vines. </p>
