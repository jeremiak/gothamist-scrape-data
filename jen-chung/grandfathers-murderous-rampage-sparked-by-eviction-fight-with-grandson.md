<p>The bloodshed occurred on Friday night, when police say Pagan went to the Staten Island home at 455 Virginia Avenue owned by his daughter, who is Feliciano&apos;s mother, and shot both 47-year-old Feliciano and 28-year-old Claritle Christina Huerta in the head. Huerta died at a hospital while Feliciano survived his wounds. Their four-month-old baby, who was in the house at the time of the shooting, was not injured. Pagan, 86, drove a few blocks away and then shot himself.</p>

<p>According to the News, &quot;Pagan&#x2019;s 69-year-old daughter owns the home the couple was living in, but she suffers from Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and moved back to Puerto Rico. The gun-toting grandfather was concerned that Feliciano was taking advantage of her, who is the wounded man&#x2019;s mother.&quot; However, Feliciano said his grandfather and other relatives &quot;were manipulating my mother. Telling her the right thing to do was to kick us out on the street.&quot;</p>

<p>His mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403212441/http://nypost.com/2014/03/28/grandfather-shoots-self-after-killing-granddaughter/">apparently started eviction proceedings against him</a>. Feliciano also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403212441/http://nypost.com/2014/03/28/grandfather-shoots-self-after-killing-granddaughter/">has a record of arrests</a>, for drug possession, trespassing and more. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403212441/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/man_suspected_in_murder-suicid.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Staten Island Advance reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Officers have responded to the family&apos;s Virginia Avenue home on 13 occasions over the years, a law enforcement source said.<p></p>

<p>In an incident at the home in November 2011, Pagan called police because Feliciano had arrived there looking for a place to stay and had allegedly threatened Pagan when his request was denied, the source said. During another episode, Mildred Feliciano reported that her son had taken her car, although no arrest was made.</p>

<p>Domestic disputes aside, the longtime neighbor said Pagan and Feliciano were &quot;very, very good people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Michael never caused trouble around here,&quot; he said. &quot;He had his good days and his bad days, like everybody else.&quot;</p></blockquote>Feliciano told the News that his grandfather couldn&apos;t believe he had rehabilitated himself, &quot;He wouldn&#x2019;t let go of the past. He&#x2019;s not one to forget.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Viktoriya Libster told the Advance that she saw Pagan pull up before he started shooting,  &quot;He didn&apos;t look like, &apos;Here we go. I&apos;m angry, I&apos;m drunk, I&apos;m drugged up.&apos;... It&apos;s just shocking to hear something like that,&quot; she said. &quot;I just felt bad for [Ms. Huerta]. A four-month old baby without a mother.&quot;</p>
