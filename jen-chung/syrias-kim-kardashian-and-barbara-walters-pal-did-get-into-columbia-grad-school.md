<p>Okay, is it time for Barbara Walters to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921054324/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/06/barbara_walters_couldnt_get_genocid.php">walk back her claim</a> that the former aide to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad didn&apos;t get into Columbia&apos;s School of International and Public Affairs?  Because the school has confirmed that &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921054324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9312557/Sheherazad-Jaafari-profile-of-the-brilliant-and-beautiful-Assad-aide.html">Syria&apos;s Kim Kardashian</a>&quot;&#x2014;a.k.a. Sheherazad Jaafari&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921054324/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/thanks_baba_YrcxM1TRnkgguND5HH6akK?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">has been accepted</a> into its program. FYI, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921054324/http://sipa.columbia.edu/academics/courses/searchlist.html">SIPA doesn&apos;t have classes</a> in genocide!</p>

<p>Hackers released emails from Jaafari&apos;s account, which showed a very friendly relationship the 22-year-old had with Walters where Jaafari, the daughter of Syria&apos;s ambassador to the U.N., asked her for help in landing a job at CNN.  Also, Walters asks if Jaafari is still planning on attending Columbia graduate school and offers to help her&#x2014;of course Jaafari said yes to that.</p>

<p>Thinking that Jaafari was intending on applying to the Journalism School, Walters ended up contacted Columbia J School Professor Richard Wald (Wald is a former ABC News executive about Jaafari&#x2014;&quot;She is brilliant, beautiful, speaks five languages. Anything you can do to help?&quot;&#x2014;and Wald wrote back, &quot;Through the Admissions Office network, I will get them to give her special attention. I am sure they will take her.&quot;  </p>

<p>On Tuesday, Walters apologized, &quot;I did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organization and in academia, though she didn&#x2019;t get a job or into school. In retrospect, I realize that this created a conflict and I regret that,&quot; but a Columbia spokesperson says, &quot;Ms. Jaafari was admitted based solely on the submitted application materials. We cannot comment on an individual applicant&#x2019;s materials, which are confidential.&quot;</p>

<p>Sheherazad Jaafari, who helped set up the ABC News exclusive with Assad, was fired because Assad felt blindsided by Walters&apos; questions.</p>
