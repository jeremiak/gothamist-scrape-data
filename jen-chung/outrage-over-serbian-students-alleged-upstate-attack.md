Today, the Serbian Consul General Slobodan Nenedovic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320022932/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06292008/news/regionalnews/sorry_in_serb_outrage_117770.htm">tells the Post</a>, &quot;I will think about resigning, absolutely.&quot;</p>

<p>On May 4, Miladin Kovacevic (pictured), a basketball player at 6&apos; 9&quot; and 260 pounds, allegedly beat up Bryan Steinhauer (5&apos;6&quot; and 135 pounds), thinking Steinhauer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320022932/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/06/27/2008-06-27_binghamton_university_student_at_heart_o.html">groped a friend&apos;s girlfriend at a bar</a>.  Though the girlfriend said she wasn&apos;t touched, Kovacevic reportedly attacked and Steinhauer, a Brooklyn resident, suffered shattered cheeks and a fractured skull and remains in critical condition. </p>

<p>Serbian vice consul general Igor Milosevic put up $100,000 cash bail (upstate law enforcement says they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320022932/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/06/25/2008-06-25_upstaters_thought_100g_bail_was_enough_t.html">thought it was a big amount for upstate</a>)  for Kovacevic in early June, and the 20-year-old fled the country with an emergency passport, since he had already surrendered his regular one.  Senator Charles Schumer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320022932/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06252008/news/regionalnews/schumer_plea_on_serbian_extradite_117033.htm">has asked that Kovacevic be extradited</a>, noting the U.S.&apos;s extradition treaty with Serbia and how the &quot;federal law enforcement must now step in and do everything in its power to bring justice to the Steinhauer family as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
