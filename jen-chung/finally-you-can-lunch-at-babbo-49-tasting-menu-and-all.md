<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/http://www.babbonyc.com/">Babbo</a>, Mario Batali&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/http://gothamist.com/2004/06/09/babbo_gets_three_stars_from_bruni.php">three-star restauran</a>t on Waverly Place, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/https://twitter.com/#!/BabboRistorante/status/192257960481792000">now offering lunch service</a>. It&apos;s a good thing Batali clarified his comments that sort of seemed like he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/09/bankers_bummed_mario_batali_compare.php">comparing bankers to Hitler and Stalin</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/batali_backtracks_on_bankers_being.php">he loves bankers!</a>, especially when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/https://twitter.com/#!/qualityrye/status/134329291218497536">spend $4,000 on a truffle dinner</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2012/04/babbos_first_ever_lunch_menu_revealed.php">Eater has a look at the menu</a>, which includes popular dishes like beef cheek ravioli and a $49 tasting menu (which must be ordered by the whole table): &quot;A reservationist at the restaurant tells Eater that portions may be a little smaller at lunch but that is reflected in the prices&#x2014;which appear to be slightly lower at least in the case of the secondis.&quot;</p>

<p>But the real question is: What will the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025128/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/neighbors_angry_that_popular_mario.php">neighbors think of the restaurant attracting even more, GOD FORBID, business and foot traffic </a>to the &apos;hood?</p>
