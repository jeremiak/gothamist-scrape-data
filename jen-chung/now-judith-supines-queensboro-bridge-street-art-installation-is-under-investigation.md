</div></div>					<p>On Saturday, we shared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/29/video_street_artist_scales_queensbo.php">video of street artist Judith Supine scaling the Queensboro Bridge</a> to install one of his signature oversized hanging poster work pieces. Now it appears the authorities are going after him.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://nypost.com/2014/03/31/street-artist-installs-piece-atop-queensboro-bridge/">The NY Post reports</a>, &quot;The stunt may have drummed up some publicity for the artist&#x2019;s weekend show at Mecka Gallery in Williamsburg, but he could be in trouble with police, who are are reviewing the video, sources said.&quot; Supine&apos;s stunt comes as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/21/teens_are_amazing.php">officials are already embarrassed</a> by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/video_watch_wtc_base_jumpers_dive_o.php#photo-1">WTC security breaches</a>. And Senator Charles Schumer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/30/security-concerns-grow-as-video-of-nyc-bridge-scaling-posted-to-youtube/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;These days you say who else could climb to the top of the Queensboro Bridge for a much more evil purpose? We have to be far more careful with our landmarks, with all of our entryways. Far more careful.&quot;</p>

<p>The video shows Supine and his videographer walking on the bridge and then heading up:</p>

<p>Supine has made trespassing part of his work: In 2007, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/05/judith_supine_t.php">hung a large-scare portrait of a man hanging from the Manhattan Bridge</a>; in 2009, he placed a work at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/williamsburg_bridge.php">very top of the Williamsburg Bridge</a>; and, also in 2009, he put a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/supine_takes_a_dip_in_central_park.php">piece in a lake in Central Park</a>. Supine said to WCBS 2, &quot;It&#x2019;s just something I like to do for fun. To be naughty and run around the city and put my art in places I&#x2019;m not supposed to.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;re guessing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234711/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/2_cnn_employees_arrested_for_trying.php">CNN employees</a> will be trying to scale the Brooklyn Bridge this afternoon.</p>
