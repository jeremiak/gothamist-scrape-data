<p>A SoHo coffee shop is now exhibiting one of the world&apos;s greatest portraits... as imagined by one of the most skilled forgers in recent history.</p>

<p>Mark Landis, profiled in the new documentary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013154/http://artandcraftfilm.com/">Art and Craft</a>, managed to scam dozens of museums into believing his forgeries&#x2014;from Picasso to Walt Disney&#x2014;were real. He would sometimes disguise himself (like, say, a Jesuit priest) and donate his pieces, mentioning there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013154/http://www.npr.org/2014/09/27/351738720/art-craft-explores-how-one-forger-duped-more-than-45-museums">might be more art and money to come</a>. And eager museums agreed. </p>

<p>Landis&apos; escapades <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013154/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/arts/design/12fraud.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;&amp;gwt=pay">prompted a 2011 NY Times article</a>, which then inspired the documentary.</p>

<p>Landis, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teen, was asked to create a &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;&#x2014;which is now on the wall at Think Coffee at 248 Mercer Street&#x2014;and he painted it in 90 minutes. It can be yours for $25,000. Proceeds from the painting will go to the Lauren Rogers Museum of Laurel, Mississippi, which is Landis&apos;s hometown. He said, &quot;Gee, I&apos;m terribly sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone. I just wanted something to do. And besides, I really do want to be a proper philanthropist.&quot; </p>

<p>You can also commission your own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013154/http://marklandisoriginal.com/">Mark Landis Original</a>. </p>

<p>The film, which premiered earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013154/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/07/jen_chungs_picks_for_the_2014_tribe_1.php#photo-5">at the Tribeca Film Festival</a> and opened last week in NYC, is opening in wide release this Friday. </p>
