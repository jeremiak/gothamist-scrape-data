<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025111001/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/26/paterson_wont_resign_but_wants_advi.php">growing scandal</a>, Saturday Night Live brought back Fred Armisen&apos;s Governor Paterson character is back on Weekend Update. And Armisen-as-Paterson (hereafter referred to as &quot;Paterson&quot;) relished the return, &quot;<strong>Congratulations, NY Times, you snared the elusive David Paterson. Finding something wrong with my administration is like finding a needle in the needle store. </strong> You found out I was a bad governor. Who tipped you off&#x2014;everyone?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Paterson&quot; also said, &quot;Remember how bad a governor I am already? Imagine how awful I&apos;ll be when I&apos;m not trying to impress anyone.&quot; He said apparent Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Cuomo &quot;can take&quot; Albany and that Cuomo will be &quot;eaten alive by those upstate goblins. They&apos;re going to tear that guy apart and use his blood for their cave paintings. Andrew, if you&apos;re in Albany, I can recommend a great place to go to dinner.  It&apos;s called Manhattan.  And if you need a good restroom, just use... New Jersey!&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;Paterson&quot; also revealed his plans for after his term&#x2014;sounds like he&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025111001/http://www.ildems.com/ltgovnominees.htm">applying for this job</a>. In 2008 Saturday Night Live <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025111001/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/14/governor_paterson_on_snls_weekend_u.php">introduced &quot;Paterson&quot;</a> with him proclaiming, &quot;I&apos;m a blind man who loves cocaine who was suddenly appointed governor of New York. My life is an actual plot from a Richard Pryor movie.&quot; But the real Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025111001/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/15/gov_paterson_annoyed_by_snl_skit.php">was annoyed</a>.</p>
