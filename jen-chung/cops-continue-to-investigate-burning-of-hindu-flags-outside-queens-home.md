<p>On Thanksgiving, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002535/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/29/nypd_this_person_set_fire_to_40_hin.php">someone set fire to 40 religious Hindu flags</a> in front of a home in Woodhaven. Now the police have released another video in connection with the incident, showing a person of interest.</p>

<p>According to police, the arson took place at 1:15 a.m. at a home near 89th Avenue and 80th Street: &quot;An unknown suspect entered the victims front yard and did ignite a fire to 40 religious Hindu flags before fleeing south bound on 80th Street.&quot; The suspect is described as an adult male, wearing a three quarter length jacket, baseball cap, and pulling a medium size travel bag.
