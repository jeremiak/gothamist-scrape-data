                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_prideicecream.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_prideicecream.jpg" width="640" height="478"> <br> <i> Pride ice cream from Ample Hills </i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/06/summer_in_the_city_its_going_to_be.php">stupid hot outside,</a> and while you could wait on line for a frigid museum or patronize one of those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/open_door_air_conditioning.php#photo-1">Evil, A.C.-wasting boutiques,</a> we recommend using the heat as an excuse to eat ice cream. Here are a few new flavors some local stores are selling that will help you forget how much your neck is sweating. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/http://www.amplehills.com/">Ample Hills</a>, which has a store in Prospect Heights and a kiosk at Brooklyn Bridge Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=588602227850577&amp;set=a.112739915436813.6397.109893992388072&amp;type=1&amp;theater">announced last week</a>, &quot;A Perfect Marriage (of salty and sweet): salted hazelnut ice cream with rainbow-colored, chocolate-covered sunflower seeds.&quot; Mmm!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_06_chinafactory.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_chinafactory.jpg" width="640" height="224"> <br> <i> Chocolate bacon, wild berry, and French toast are new flavors at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/https://www.facebook.com/ChinatownIceCreamFactory">Chinatown Ice Cream Factory</a>, at 65 Bayard Street in Manhattan, is celebrating National Ice Cream Month with new flavors. So far, they&apos;ve rolled out chocolate bacon, wild berry, and French toast. (FWIW, our fave is sesame&#x2014;it&apos;s a little polarizing, but if you like peanut butter, you&apos;ll probably like the nuttiness from sesame.)</p>

<p>Blue Marble Ice Cream, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/http://www.bluemarbleicecream.com/find/scoop-shops/">has three locations in Brooklyn</a>, has a new flavor: Key Lime Cookie, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10152994104240305&amp;id=415075860304">breezy, tart and packed with organic vanilla cookies.</a>&quot; </p>

<p>And for you vegans,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/http://www.vanleeuwenicecream.com/"> Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream</a> (two storefronts in Brooklyn, one in the East Village, plus trucks) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818062842/https://www.facebook.com/vanleeuwenartisanicecream/posts/10151542377604671">teased late last month</a>, &quot;whats next on the vegan menu??? Mint chip, made with organic housemade cashew nut milk.&quot;</p>

<p>So get a cone and ponder why we&apos;ve been able to put a man on the moon but haven&apos;t been able to invent slow-melting ice cream.</p>
