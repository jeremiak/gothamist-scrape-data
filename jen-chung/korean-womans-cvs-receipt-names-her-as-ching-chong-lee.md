<p>Hyun Lee, who is Korean, says that she ordered photographs from CVS online and when she went to pick them up from the Egg Harbor City branch, the receipt said, &quot;Lee, Ching Chong.&quot; She emailed CVS, saying, &quot;Do you think it&#x2019;s funny? It&#x2019;s very disturbing to me!!!!... why doesn&#x2019;t he just call me Chink! It has the same derogatory meaning!!!!!&quot;</p>

That is not her name.&quot; Yeah, didn&apos;t anyone learn anything after Rosie O&apos;Donnell reduced the Chinese people to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234438/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/14/rosie_odonnell.php"> &quot;ching chong ching chong&quot; on The View</a>?</p>

<p>CVS says, &quot;CVS/Pharmacy is committed to treating all of our customers with dignity and respect and we have a firm non-discrimination policy. We take this matter very seriously as the allegations in the complaint describe behavior that is unacceptable and not in keeping with our values or our policies. We are looking into this matter but cannot comment further due to the pending litigation.&quot;</p>
