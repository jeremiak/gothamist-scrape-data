In his signing statement, Cuomo said, &quot;It&#x2019;s not okay for people to do this. It&#x2019;s not fun; it&#x2019;s not cool. If you&#x2019;re in a car with someone whose talking the cell phone or texting, you have to let them know it&#x2019;s not okay.&quot;<p></p>

<p>If you&apos;re caught texting while driving, it&apos;ll be five points on your license (versus the previous three points; your license can be suspended or revoked with 11 or more points in an 18-month period). Further, if you&apos;re a junior or probationary driver who texts while drives, your license <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130706045936/https://www.governor.ny.gov/press/05312013-texting-while-driving">can be suspended</a>&#x2014;plus you&apos;ll get five points on your license. </p>

But there&#x2019;s something new with this generation, and that&#x2019;s an addiction to smartphones.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, a teen driver got no jail time for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130706045936/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/12/no_jail_time_for_texting_driver_who.php">fatally striking (while texting) a delivery man in Brooklyn</a>. </p>
