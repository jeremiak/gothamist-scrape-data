The bollards were installed in mid-2008&#x2014;over a year after two deaths of bicyclists along the bike path.<p></p>

<p>In June 2006, Dr. Carl &quot;Henry&quot; Nacht and his wife were on their bicycles when a NYPD tow truck making a sudden turn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102070744/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/06/23/police_tow_truc.php">struck him on the path</a> near West 38th Street, near the impound lot. Nacht, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102070744/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/27/west_side_bicyc_1.php">died from his injuries a few days later</a>, was thrown towards another tow truck; his wife claimed the tow driver didn&apos;t yield to them as he should have.  </p>

<p>And in December 2006, 22-year-old Eric Ng was riding on the bike path near Clarkson Street when a drunk driver, Eugene Cidron, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102070744/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/02/drunk_driver_ki.php">struck him head on</a>.  Cidron had attended a party at Chelsea Piers and had been speeding at 60 mph&#x2014;the plastic pylon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102070744/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/04/sentencing_of_w.php">didn&apos;t stop him</a>&#x2014; down the bike path for a mile before he fatally hit Ng.</p>

<p>Back in January 2008, before the bollards were installed, Transportation Alternatives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102070744/http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/01/04/one-year-after-eric-ngs-death-greenway-hazards-remain-unfixed/">complained about their absence and offered other suggestions</a> to make the Greenway safer. Not all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102070744/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/sharing_the_bike_path_on_the_hudson.php">have been heeded</a>!</p>
