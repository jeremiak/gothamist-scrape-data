<p>Does this get filed under &quot;Why we can&apos;t have nice things&quot;?  A day after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170655/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/photos_mccarren_park_pool_opens_wit.php">McCarren Park Pool opened to great fanfare</a>, the pool had to close early yesterday because lifeguards were attacked.  Parks Department spokeswoman Vickie Karp said, &quot;Lifeguards at McCarren pool were attacked by an unruly crowd and the pool had to close to restore order.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 6:15 p.m. (the pool usually closes at 7 p.m.), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170655/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120629/greenpoint/brawl-shuts-down-mccarren-pool-one-day-after-it-opens">DNAinfo reports</a>, &quot;Witnesses said one lifeguard who tried to break up the fight was punched in the face... The pool had been closed for nearly three decades after its condition deteriorated in the early 1980s and it became a hotspot for fights and violence, residents recalled.&quot; </p>

<p>According to some Tweets, a lifeguard was pulled into the pool:</p>
