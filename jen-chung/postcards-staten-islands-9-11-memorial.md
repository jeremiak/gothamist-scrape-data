</div></div>					<p>While there are worries about whether the National September 11 Memorial and Museum will be open by September 11, 2011, Staten Island&apos;s 9/11 Memorial, called Postcards, has been standing since September 11, 2004.  </p>

<p>The memorial is located on the St. George Esplanade, near the SI Ferry Terminal and Richmond County Bank Ballpark, and was designed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508214012/http://www.masasono.com/index.html">Masayuki Sono</a>. It&apos;s called Postcards because the two wing-like sculptures represent large postcards to loved ones; the sculptures look out onto the harbor at the the World Trade Center site. The memorial, which has 274 plaques and profiles on it, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508214012/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2004b%2Fpr242-04.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">unveiled on September 11, 2004, and cost $2.77 million</a>.</p>

<p>Tonight, in one of the many 9/11 commemoration events around the city, Mayor Bloomberg and and Staten Island Borough President James P. Molinaro will hold a ceremony to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508214012/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/tomorrows_events_honoring_stat.html">remember the Staten Island victims at 6 p.m. at Postcards</a>. There will be readings for the 274 Staten Island victims, a performance from elementary and high school students, and remarks from officials, clergy, and Sono.  </p>
