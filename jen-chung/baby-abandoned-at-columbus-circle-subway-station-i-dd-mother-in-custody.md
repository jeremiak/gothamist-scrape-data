</div></div>					<p>The baby found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151119/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/07/baby_abandoned_at_columbus_circles.php">abandoned on the northbound 1 train platform</a> at the Columbus Circle subway station has been identified&#x2014;and her 20-year-old mother is now in custody.</p>

<p>Yesterday around 12:30 p.m., a woman riding a 1 train pushed a stroller holding a 7-month baby girl onto the platform and then, according to police, departed on the same train. A Good Samaritan saw the baby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151119/http://nypost.com/2014/07/07/subway-rider-abandons-baby-on-train-platform/">and waited for 20 minutes</a>, in case the mother or caregiver returned, before taking the child to the police. </p>

<p>Police found surveillance footage of the woman and the baby entering the Times Square subway station:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151119/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Baby-Stroller-Abandoned-Subway-Columbus-Circle-266086611.html">According to NBC New York</a>, &quot;A tipster spotted the mother at a Starbucks at 71st Street and Broadway at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, about 12 hours after someone pushed her infant daughter&apos;s stroller off a [train]... Officers detained the 20-year-old mother at the Starbucks and took her back to the station, where transit police are questioning her.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed the woman is the mother of the child. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151119/http://7online.com/news/mom-found-after-baby-abandoned-on-nyc-subway-platform/164990/">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;The 20-year-old woman recently came to New York City from another state, and she apparently decided suddenly that she could no longer take care of the 10-month-old girl.&quot; Charges have not been filed yet.</p>

<p>The baby, who was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, had a slight rash on her face as well as a bandage on her hand, but is in generally good health. She is currently in custody of the Administration for Children&apos;s Services. </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Police have charged Frankea Dabbs, 20, with Abandonment of a Child and Act in manner injurious to a child under 17. Dabbs is described as homeless; she is apparently from North Carolina.</p>
