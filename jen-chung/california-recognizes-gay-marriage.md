<p>The California Supreme Court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131408/http://sfist.com/2008/05/15/court_strikes_d.php">struck down the gay marriage ban</a> and legalized gay marriage.  The decision will go into effect in 30 days.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Ronald M. George <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131408/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/us/15cnd-marriage.html?hp">wrote in the majority opinion</a>, &quot;In view of the substance and significance of the fundamental constitutional right to form a family relationship, the California Constitution properly <strong>must be interpreted to guarantee this basic civil right to all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples</strong>.&#x201D;  You can read the court&apos;s ruling (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131408/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF">PDF</a>).  </p>

<p>Where does this leave New York?  Back in 2006, a NYC judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131408/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/31/gay_marriage_ca.php">ruled gay marriage was allowed</a>, but the city argued the State Constitution didn&apos;t allow it.  The Court of Appeals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131408/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/06/ny_state_court.php">eventually rejected gay marriage</a>, much to the dismay of Chief Justice Judith Kaye, who wrote, &quot;I am confident that future generations will look back on today&apos;s decision as an unfortunate misstep.&quot;  </p>

<p>Last year, the State Assembly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131408/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/20/assembly_passes.php">voted to allow gay marriages</a> in NY, but the Senate didn&apos;t pass the bill.  More recently, in February, an appellate court found NY State <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131408/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/02/ny_courts_feeli.php">must legally recognize valid out-of-state same-sex marriages</a>, the way it does the out-of-state marriages of straight couples.  We predict the phones of events/wedding planners in California are ringing off the hook!</p>
