<p>This woman was spotted dancing on West 23rd Street with a prosthetic butt last week.  She was trying to publicize <strike>her own performance or film</strike> a Parsons art show (she was a subject in one of the photographs), but we suspect she was actually challenging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150524/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/31/the_most_powerf.php">He-Man</a> for attention in south-of-the-Naked Cowboy Flatiron/ Madison Square Park/ Union Square region.</p>

<p>Another thing a prosthetic butt has been used for:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150524/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/16/this_butt_is_ma.php">Hiding stolen goods</a>.</p>
