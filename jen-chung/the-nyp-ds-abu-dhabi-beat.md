Having NYPD officials overseas is nothing new, as they are in Montreal, Toronto, London, Madrid, Paris, Tel Aviv and other cities.  A few years ago, the New Yorker had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152447/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/07/25/050725fa_fact2">great feature on the NYPD&apos;s anti-terror work</a>.</p>
