<p>Early this morning, a US Airways plane with 34 people aboard had to land without any landing gear at Newark Airport. The turboprop plane arrived safely at 1 a.m.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161742/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9107068">According to WABC 7</a>, the flight, which had 31 passengers and three crew members, was a flight from Philadelphia operated by Piedmont Airlines: &quot;Officials say the gear came down only partially&quot;&#x2014;the Post says the pilot noticed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161742/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pilot_makes_emergency_landing_malfunctions_CpYPjoWtxLnCaxe3wAuHbM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">only one came down</a>&#x2014;&quot;and the plane circled Newark in a holding pattern while dumping fuel and working on the gear. After several failed, the pilot decided to pull the gear back and land the plane on its belly.&quot;</p>

<p>There were sparks from the landing and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161742/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/05/landing_gear_issue_leads_to_pl.html#incart_m-rpt-1">firefighters sprayed foam on the plane</a>. There were no injuries. Why belly land? The Post says the pilot wanted to &quot;[lower] the chances of the plane veering off the runway.&quot; The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.</p>
