The 69-year-old had missed her Saturday morning Sirius XM radio, so, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927205640/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/radio_lynn_samuels_dies_at_3IfblQ55n2UtWEjPd1eQWM">Post reports</a>, &quot;SiriusXM sent someone to her apartment, and that person notified police, who found her body.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927205640/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/television/wabc-host-lynn-samuels-dies-christmas-eve-69-article-1.996718">Daily News&apos; David Hinckley has a thorough obituary</a>, noting how she worked at WBAI and then WABC for 15 years, where she was fired three times and rehired twice.  </p><blockquote>On the radio, Samuels was exactly what much of the country thinks New York sounds like. She had a city accent she never tried to hide or soften, even when her bosses suggested it would prevent her from ever getting a radio job outside the city.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;This is who I am,&#x201D; she said... </p>

<p>Samuels was a self-described progressive who often threw curveballs. She was a long-standing critic of President Obama, saying she didn&#x2019;t believe he ever really had progressive credentials.</p>

<p>Her periodic unpredictability didn&#x2019;t serve her well in today&#x2019;s party-line talk radio, but helped give her a long run in the earlier, looser talk era.</p>

<p>Her criticism of conservatives often extended to her fellow radio hosts, but she would add that she liked a number of them personally. She became close friends with conservative host and writer Matt Drudge, serving for a time as his call screener.</p></blockquote>Here&apos;s an old clip of Samuels on the radio:<p></p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927205640/http://www.johnlightning.com/?p=411">listener John Lightning writes</a>, &quot;Lynn was perhaps the last real reason I had for subscribing to the Sirius/XM diminished service, particularly as they had cut her &#x2018;air time&#x2019; down from a regular shift on their &#x2018;Liberal&#x2019; channel, five days a week, to six hours on weekends. I loved Lynn, and her New Yawk accent that makes me sound like I&#x2019;m from the midwest!&quot;</p>
