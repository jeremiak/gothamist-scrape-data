Instead, they found a dead body and a bloodstained dog.  The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120446/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/13/2011-10-13_city_marshals_trying_to_evict_upper_east_side_tenant_stumble_on_dead_body_inside.html"> Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Cops collared dead man&apos;s roommate hours after he told authorities he was &apos;having a bad day,&apos; a cop source said.&quot;  Shaun Dyer, 40, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120446/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/148950/roommate-charged-after-man-is-found-dead-inside-ues-apartment">was charged with second-degree murder</a>; NY1 says that while the dog was in the apartment and covered in blood, &quot;Police say... the animal didn&apos;t appear to have anything to do with the man&apos;s death.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Witnesses say they heard Dyer and the victim, David Shahda, 47, arguing.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120446/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/man_pitbull_eyed_in_ues_death_UQHgywK7JqAvPQFJK8rhNM">According to the Post</a>, it&apos;s unclear if the argument was &quot;triggered by their imminent eviction for not paying rent,&quot; but they owed six or seven months.  The Post adds that Dyer &quot;has a record of some 20 arrests for crimes that include assault and possession of stolen property.&quot; One witness told the News, &quot;One was yelling, &apos;Give me my keys!&apos; The other guy was like, &apos;Stop it - it hurts.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The dog, reportedly a pitbull, may have mauled the victim&apos;s body after he was killed.  Neighbors had mixed experiences with the dog&#x2014;some said he was nice and simply protective of the owner while others claim the dog was menacing and bit them.  </p>
