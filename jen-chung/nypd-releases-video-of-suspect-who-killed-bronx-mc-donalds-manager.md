<p>Police are searching for the man accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504073057/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/mcdonalds_employee_fatally_stabbed.php">killing the night manager of a McDonald&apos;s</a> in the Bronx; investigators believe the suspect is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504073057/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/nyregion/police-seek-assailant-in-fatal-stabbing-of-bronx-mcdonalds-manager.html">&quot;homeless and mentally unbalanced.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Adam Garcia, 28, had stayed behind at the fast food location past his usual hours &quot;to help colleagues and possibly give a friend a ride home,&quot; the NY Times reports. One customer had apparently been there for eight hours, and Garcia asked him to leave and ended up escorting him out. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504073057/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/mcdonald-worker-stabbed-death-bronx-restaurant-article-1.2484416">The NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said</a>, &quot;He walked out with the individual and there was no problem initially.&quot; </p>

<p>Police say Garcia got into a heated exchange with the homeless customer in the restaurant parking lot, and the customer then stabbed Garcia in the neck and chest multiple times before fleeing. A surveillance video of the suspect was released:<br>
