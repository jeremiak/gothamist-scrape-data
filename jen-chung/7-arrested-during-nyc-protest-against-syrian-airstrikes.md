					<p>Hundreds of people gathered in Union Square for a protest against the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415231500/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/06/statement-president-trump-syria">United States&apos; military strike on Syria</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415231500/http://pix11.com/2017/04/07/hundreds-gather-in-union-square-to-protest-u-s-airstrike-on-syria/">One protester told PIX11</a> that, &quot;The point of this demonstration is to build an antiwar movement to pressure the U.S. government to withdraw all of American forces abroad.&quot;</p>

<p>On Thursday night, President Donald Trump announced that the strike, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415231500/http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/politics/donald-trump-syria-military/">which involved 59 Tomahawk missiles</a>, was in response to a Tuesday chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government on its people:</p><blockquote>Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians.  Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children.  It was a slow and brutal death for so many.  Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack.  No child of God should ever suffer such horror.<p></p>

<p>Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.  It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.  There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council.  </p></blockquote>The action prompted support from Republicans and Democrats alike&#x2014;Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-California) said it <a 2017="" 522312="" href="&lt;a href=" https:="" www.theatlantic.com="" politics="" archive="" 04="" syria-strike-trump-democrats-congress="" "="">&quot;appeared to be a &quot;proportional&quot; response</a>. Others believed Trump needed congressional approval for the strike. Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415231500/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/327736-rand-paul-trump-needed-congressional-authorization-for-military">said</a>, &quot;While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The protesters were intent on bringing a message of peace. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415231500/http://abc7ny.com/news/protesters-took-to-the-streets-in-nyc-against-air-strikes-in-syria/1847955/">From WABC 7</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;All of these humanitarian wars that it has waged for hundreds of years have never brought about peace and democracy,&quot; said Nina Macapimlac, a protester. &quot;So bombing other countries to bring peace is a contradiction.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;While Assad is a murderer and doesn&apos;t represent the will of the Syrian people, the United States definitely does not represent the will of the Syrian people,&quot; said Dan, a protester. &quot;And Syria is a question to be answered by the Syrians, not by American imperialists who have devastated the region for decades.&quot;</p></blockquote>They also implored Trump to end his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415231500/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-groups.html">ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries</a>.<p></p>

<p>&quot;Near 25th St. and Fifth Ave., tensions flared between NYPD officers monitoring the rally and protesters. A group of people tussled with cops and a few even threw punches. At least two people were seen being detained,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415231500/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/protesters-rally-trump-tower-syria-airstrikes-article-1.3032028">according to the News</a>.</p>
