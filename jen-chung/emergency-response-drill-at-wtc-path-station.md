</div></div>					<p>Yesterday morning, the FDNY, NYPD, Port Authority Police, Office of Emergency Management and additional agencies converged on the World Trade Center PATH station in lower Manhattan to participate in a full-scale exercise&#x2014;Operation Safe PATH 2009&#x2014; to test their response to an improvised explosive device detonation.  While PATH service was suspended and the immediate area were closed off to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, over 800 emergency responders, plus 150 volunteers who portrayed victims, participated in the drill, which involved two (simulated) explosions that occurred on a NJ-bound PATH train about 1000-1200 feet into the tunnel.</p>

<p>The Office of Emergency Management and Port Authority oversaw the exercise, which has been in the works for many months. The response was staged, so the agencies weren&apos;t being evaluated on response time. The main goal, OEM Commissioner Joseph Bruno explained, was &quot;to evaluate is the ability of all these agencies to work together,&quot; and, in the scenario, communications from the train were damaged. Additionally, the responders had to deal with two things simultaneously: The life saving operations as well as the investigation of the explosion. Indeed, police officers were interviewing the volunteers who portrayed PATH passengers and were made-up to look injured.</p>

<p>Port Authority Executive Director Christopher Ward declared, &quot;<strong>You can never be too prepared</strong>.&quot; And Deputy Mayor Ed Skyler said, &quot;If we&apos;re going to make mistakes we want to make them here, we want to learn from them, we want to build them into our plans, so when there is a real situation we respond appropriately and all the kinks in the system have been worked out.&quot;</p>
