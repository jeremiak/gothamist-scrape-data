Getting a special Giants Super Bowl XLVI victory license plate.  </p>

<p>Governor Cuomo said, &quot;I join all New York Giant fans in congratulating the team and staff, especially native-New Yorker coach Tom Coughlin, on this great Super Bowl victory. We are all very proud of the dedication, hard work and grace under pressure that enabled the Giants to bring the Vince Lombardi Trophy back to New York,&quot; while DMV Commissioner Barbara Fiala said, &quot;This has been an amazing run for the Giants. Giants fans have always worn their hearts on their sleeve. So we are very pleased to offer this commemorative Super Bowl XLVI Champions custom license plate so that they can show their &apos;Big Blue&apos; loyalty and championship pride on their vehicles.&quot; </p>

<p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote>The plate, available for both passenger and commercial vehicles registered in New York, features the NFL Giants&apos; Big Blue NY logo with the words &quot;Super Bowl XLVI Champions&quot; as well as the official Super Bowl XLVI logo....<br>
