Yesterday, a judge scolded him during the sentencing, calling him a &quot;compulsive talker.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Judge Richard Berman also said, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s a listener,&quot; and criticized D&apos;Souza constant claims that the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office had targeted him because of his (anti-Obama) political views. </p>

<p>D&apos;Souza admitted to asking people to make $20,000 in donations (and allegedly paid them back) for Senate candidate Wendy Long, who was challenging Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013448/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/us/dsouza-is-spared-prison-time-for-campaign-finance-violations.html?_r=0">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>Judge Berman played a clip from one of Mr. D&#x2019;Souza&#x2019;s interviews, with Newsmax TV, during the sentencing hearing Tuesday. While the judge said that Mr. D&#x2019;Souza had an &#x201C;absolute right&#x201D; to express his opinions, he described his claims of political persecution as &#x201C;nonsense,&#x201D; and scolded the defendant, saying that he continued to &#x201C;deflect and minimize&#x201D; the seriousness of his crime.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure, Mr. D&#x2019;Souza, that you get it,&#x201D; the judge said during the sentencing hearing, which lasted more than two hours.</p></blockquote>Still, Berman didn&apos;t think D&apos;Souza deserved to go to prison, instead <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013448/http://online.wsj.com/articles/dinesh-dsouza-gets-probation-in-campaign-contributions-case-1411496814">sentencing D&apos;Souza to eight months &quot;at a halfway house&quot;</a> plus &quot;weekly psychological therapy&quot; in addition to &quot;spend[ing] one full-day a week teaching English as a second language.&quot;<p></p>

<p>D&apos;Souza said, &quot;I&#x2019;m just happy I can pay my debt to society and get on with my work.&quot; Yes, he&apos;s working on another book and a movie for the 2016 election&#x2014;probably something about Benghazi.</p>
