<p>Xiao long bao&#x2014;also known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912074235/http://gothamist.com/tags/soupdumplings">soup dumplings</a>&#x2014;are the best dumplings around because they are made to be truly savored. When you open one, the steaming hot interior reveals a delicious broth and a succulent, tender meat filling. </p>

<p>You must proceed carefully, or else you&apos;ll lose the precious broth. However, you don&apos;t want to burn your tongue. Some people may bite off the top or break the top open to let a little steam out before taking a sip of broth. It is critical that you have a spoon and/or bowl situated beneath your dumpling before attempting to eat it.</p>

<p>Since soup dumplings are a Shanghainese dish (and many Shanghainese dishes are enhanced by adding vinegar), I think they taste best with vinegar cutting the richness of the broth. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re hankering for xiao long bao now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912074235/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/best_soup_dumplings_nyc.php">here are some excellent suggestions</a>. </p>
