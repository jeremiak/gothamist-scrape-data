<p>Artist Takashi Murakami is best known for his eye-popping characters like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523054458/http://gothamist.com/2003/09/08/mr_pointy_and_takashi_murakami_comes_to_rockefeller_center.php">Mr. Pointy</a>, KaiKai and Kiki&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523054458/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/25/kanye_kaikai_kiki_kitty_macys_thank.php#photo-2">were in the 2010 Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>&#x2014;or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523054458/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/_murakami_brook.php">provocative sculptures</a>. Now he&apos;s adding filmmaking to his repertoire, and he&apos;ll discussing his new film, <em>Jellyfish Eyes</em>, at the Film Society of Lincoln Center on June 1.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523054458/http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/takashi-murakami-jellyfish-eyes-film-society-june-1">According to the Film Society</a>, &quot;In <em>Jellyfish Eyes</em>, Murakami transforms the classic cinematic trope of the new kid on the block into a genre-defying adventure. Having recently lost his father, young Masashi moves with his mother to a small city in the Japanese countryside. But when he discovers that their new apartment is already inhabited by a pint-sized, gravity-defying creature, Masashi begins to pull back the curtain on this sleepy town and finds that very little is what it appears to be. As a connoisseur of Japanese popular culture, from children&#x2019;s manga and anime to classic monster movies, Murakami packs his film with a delirious abundance of ideas and imagery. What other coming-of-age fantasy has romance, battling CGI avatars, nuclear intrigue, rival doppelg&#xE4;ngers, and a giant monster?&quot; Seriously&#x2014;check out the trailer:</p>
