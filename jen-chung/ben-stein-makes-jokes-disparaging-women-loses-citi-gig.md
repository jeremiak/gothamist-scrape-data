But that&apos;s no match for a woman who felt his jokes at a Dallas private equity conference were sexist&#x2014;and therefore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017105130/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/citigroup-drops-ben-stein-speech-after-complaint-his-jokes-disparage-women.html">demanded that Citigroup ditch Stein as keynote speaker</a> for the banking giant&apos;s conference.   And guess what&#x2014;Citigroup agreed, &quot;We have decided to present the conference without Mr. Stein&#x2019;s participation.&quot; Yeah, probably doesn&apos;t help to have possibly sexist jokes dropped while Citigroup is dealing with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017105130/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/6-women-accuse-citigroup-of-gender-bias/">gender discrimination lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017105130/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/citigroup-drops-ben-stein-speech-after-complaint-his-jokes-disparage-women.html">According to Bloomberg News</a>, Villareal, a Dallas bank executive, contacted former White House budget director and current Citi vice chairman Peter Orszag about Stein&apos;s jokes.</p><blockquote>One joke was about a wealthy man, his wife and his mistress, she said.<p></p>

<p>Another involved a female airline passenger who, realizing the flight is about to crash, takes off her clothes and asks if there is a man aboard who will &#x201C;make me feel like a woman,&#x201D; according to Villarreal&#x2019;s e-mail, which was also sent to Bloomberg News. A cowboy in a hat removes his shirt, hands it to the woman, tells her to iron it and fetch him a beer.</p>

<p>Villarreal said the jokes she sent to Citigroup were versions found on the Internet based on her recollection of what Stein said.</p></blockquote>Orszag forwarded the email to the event&apos;s organizers, who quickly decided to lose Stein.  <p></p>

<p>Stein told Bloomberg News &quot;that the joke targeted the man, not the woman, and that in his Dallas telling the woman didn&#x2019;t remove clothing,&quot; explaining, &quot;It&#x2019;s usually a joke understood to be making fun of a kind of cloddish, dopey guy. When I was finished with this speech, dozens of women in the room came up to me and wanted their pictures taken with me, wanted autographs from me. Dozens of them. I got fan mail from women who had been at the group saying how much they liked the speech.&quot;  And he added, &quot;Every one of those jokes are thoroughly vetted with my wife... I don&#x2019;t think any woman in the world would call me a misogynist. For this woman to say this is just fantasy.&quot;</p>

<p>The speaking agency that represents Stein says that he usually gets $45,000 per engagement (plus first class airfare) and claims he&apos;ll still be paid for the Citi speech.  If this is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017105130/http://www.observer.com/2011/wall-street/peter-orszag-wins-ben-steins-money-heroic-citigroup-exec-drops-dull-speaker">sample of his humor</a>, no wonder Citigroup needed a bailout.</p>
