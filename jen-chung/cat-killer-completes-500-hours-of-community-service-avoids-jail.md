During a trial last year, Petcka had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520055139/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/20/cat_killer_7pound_cat_lunged_throwi.php">claimed Norman the orange cat attacked him</a> while he was in a drunken mood, provoking him into beating the feline to death.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520055139/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/26/hung_jury_in_cat_killer_case.php">jury was hung</a>, with 11 jurors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520055139/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/27/juror_11_to_1_in_favor_of_convictin.php">looking to convict him</a>, and the Manhattan DA&apos;s office ultimately allowed Petcka to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520055139/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/19/cat_killer_pleads_guilty_gets_500_h.php">plead guilty to aggravated animal cruelty</a> in exchange for doing 500 hours of community service. When the Post &quot;asked if he was glad to get the ugly incident behind him,&quot; Petcka said, &quot;I guess it&apos;s hard to put it into words... I guess it&apos;s just like I said. A lot of it&apos;s tough to put into words.&quot; (The Post also calls him the &quot;tongue-tied tabby terminator&quot;).</p>

<p>Petcka reportedly &quot;spent 476 hours serving the homeless at a soup kitchen, and another 33 hours singing and assisting with crafts at an arts therapy charity.&quot; </p>
