<p>Rep. Michael Grimm, eager to shift attention away <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145911/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/19/rep_grimm_dismisses_sketchy_donatio.php">from his possibly super sketchy donations</a>, is trying to convince the Empire State Building to light up in red to honor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145911/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/18/red_hat_time_archbishop_dolan_eleva.php#photo-1">newly elevated Cardinal Timothy Dolan</a>.  But if the ESB<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145911/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/27/hundreds_protest_mother_teresa_trib.php"> isn&apos;t honoring Mother Theresa</a>, why honor Dolan? </p>

<p>Grimm shared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145911/http://www.politicker.com/2012/02/23/michael-grimm-wants-the-empire-state-building-to-turn-red/">his letter to the ESB</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145911/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2012/02/esb-wont-go-cardinal-red-for-timothy-dolan">the press</a>, &quot;I am disappointed that the Empire State Building&#x2019;s Lighting Partner Committee has declined the opportunity to honor New York&#x2019;s Cardinal Dolan, and I strongly encourage them to reconsider their position. Cardinal Dolan is more than just a man of faith, he&#x2019;s a beloved leader in our community and a hometown hero... His new role is something all New Yorkers can be proud of, which is why I couldn&#x2019;t think of a better way to show our pride than by lighting the top of the Empire State Building &#x2018;cardinal red.&#x2019;&quot; Oh, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145911/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/michael_grimms_supporters_dont_beli.php">don&apos;t believe the &quot;sh*t-ass press&quot;.</a></p>

<p>After being made a Cardinal, Dolan said of his red biretta, &quot;This hat is really for New York. I want to put it on the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge.&quot;</p>
