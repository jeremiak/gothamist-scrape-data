<p>It&apos;s the most delicately delicious day of the year&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://www.macarondaynyc.com/">Macaron Day</a>! Numerous patisseries all over New York City are offering a free macaron&#x2014;and then portions of macaron sales will go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://www.cityharvest.org/">City Harvest</a>, the food rescue group, which is a worthy reason to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/is_your_office_filled_with_unhealth.php">make your coworkers fat</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://www.macarondaynyc.com/participants.html">Participants include</a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://www.butterfieldmarket.com/">Butterfield Market</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://www.fpbnyc.com/">Francois Payard Bakery</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://www.epicerieboulud.com/">Epicerie Boulud</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043144/http://bouchonbakery.com/macarons/">Bouchon Bakery</a>, which describes macarons thusly:</p><blockquote>One of the glories of the patisserie is the macaron, a textural marvel, an extraordinary design, and an incomparably satisfying confection. This classic French pastry filled with rich buttercream has been adored for centuries. Precise baking produces a cookie that has a light and crisp outside and a soft and chewy inside. These two textures are what make the macaron such a special confection. The flavors of our macarons change with the seasons.</blockquote>Of course, there are limited quantities of free macarons, so you need to pay for some of that sweet perfection, which is fine since it&apos;s going to a great cause.<p></p>
