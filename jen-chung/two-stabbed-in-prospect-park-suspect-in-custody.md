<p>Two men were stabbed in separate incidents last night in Prospect Park, and police say that the victims identified their attacker shortly after.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the first incident occurred around East Drive and Lincoln Road, at 11:32 p.m. when a jogger in his 30s came across a man who suddenly slashed at him, in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813174037/http://pix11.com/2016/03/10/man-arrested-for-stabbing-2-people-robbing-them-in-prospect-park-nypd/">possible attempted robbery</a>. While defending himself, the jogger was slashed in the hand and the suspect ran away. </p>

<p>Then, inside the park near Ocean and Parkside Avenues, police say a 43-year-old man was stabbed in the stomach and robbed of his wallet. </p>

<p>Police officers responded to the scene and found a 26-year-old man matching descriptions given by the victims. An NYPD spokesman said the victims positively identified the suspect, who was taken into custody. Charges are pending. </p>
