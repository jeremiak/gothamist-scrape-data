<p>Hooray&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410202944/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/07/bobcat_loose_new_jersey.php">38-pound &quot;domesticated&quot; bobcat that had been missing</a> for about a week was actually found on Sunday. Rocky&apos;s owner, Stafford Township resident Ginny Fine, spotted Rocky in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410202944/http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2014/04/owner_finds_missing_bobcat_near_her_stafford_home.html#incart_m-rpt-1">&quot;nearby patch of woods on Sunday&quot;</a>. Sadly, their reunion was shortlived&#x2014;The Man seized Rocky.</p>

<p>Because Rocky went missing other times, Fine had been warned that if he went AWOL again, the township would take him into their clutches. And she also signed an order agreeing to that. In this case, their clutches is  the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410202944/http://www.ahscares.org/page2.asp?page=popcornpark&amp;style=2">Popcorn Park Zoo</a>. </p>

<p>Fine explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410202944/http://www.app.com/article/20140407/NJNEWS14/304070093/Stafford-Bobcat-comes-home-only-taken-Popcorn-Park-Zoo?nclick_check=1">to the Asbury Park Press how Rocky came home</a>: &quot;He is very bonded with our house cats, so I took [one of her other cats] LC back through the woods near my house where there had been some sightings. As soon as the little cat started meowing and crying, Rocky came back.&quot;</p>

<p>She lamented, &quot;I&#x2019;m just concerned that he&#x2019;s going to end up staying at Popcorn Park Zoo. He&#x2019;s not a zoo animal. He&#x2019;s never lived in a cage. He has human contact 24-7. He lives with two cats, a dog and a bird... He was so happy to be home, to see his friends. ... He was so, so happy. It was late Sunday and we went to bed and Rocky literally was walking between us and the cats and he was so happy. It just crushed me that he came back home with his family and buddies and he had a nice meal &#x2014; then they came and took him.&quot;</p>

<p>Rocky escaped the house when he was playing with the family dog&#x2014;he managed to get the storm door open.</p>
