                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_03_rentoo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023154620im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_rentoo.jpg" width="365" height="348"> <br> <i>&quot;The Rent Is...&quot;</i></div> The NY State Court of Appeals has decided on the years-lond dispute between landlords and their rent-stabilized tenants&#x2014;the ones who pay less than $1,000/month for their apartments&#x2014;over how much rents can be increased.  And the court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023154620/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/bad-news-for-rent-stabilized-tenants-paying-under-1000/">found in favor for the landlords</a>, which means that 300,000 tenants may need to pay a lot in retroactive rent increases.<p></p>

<p>Back in 2008, the Rent Guidelines Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023154620/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/20/rent_stabilised_hikes_face_45_8_hik.php">approved hikes of 4.5% and 8.5%</a> for one- and two-year leases, noting that landlords needed to pay for increasingly expensive maintenance. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023154620/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/higher_hikes_appeals_cheap_cost_VC4iixKB4GEMLQyleO4AZI">Post notes</a>, &quot;But a minimum increase was set at $45 and $85 for the low-paying tenants in place for six years or more. Under those terms, the one-year renewal rent of someone with a $450-a-month lease would reach $495, up 10 percent.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023154620/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/17/rent_guidelines_board_sued_over_ren.php">tenants sued</a>, arguing it was a tax on low-income New Yorkers.</p>

<p>A lawyer representing landlords told City Room, &quot;There are certain tenants who, because they&#x2019;ve been in occupancy so long, pay rents that are so low that those rents don&#x2019;t cover expenses. As a result, it&#x2019;s fair to raise the rents of the lowest rent-paying tenants so that those rents start approximating what it costs owners to run them.&quot;  </p>
