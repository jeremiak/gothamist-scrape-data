										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_dwightg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144506im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_dwightg.jpg" width="170" height="170" class="image-left"> </span>Four months after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144506/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/24/dwight_gooden_busted_for_dwi.php">arrested for DUI</a> in NJ, Dwight Gooden has allegedly abandoned his wife and their 5-year-old son and 4-month-old daughter.  Monique Gooden, who is with her parents in Maryland, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144506/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/the_deadbeat_doc_FPPVugtFwCEPHFkQ1VKxeO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;He&apos;s left us with no money. When I got here to Maryland, I had to go apply for social services, food stamps and health insurance for the kids. He has offered no financial assistance to us.&quot;</p>

<p>In March, Gooden was pulled over Franklin Lakes after hitting a neighbor&apos;s car. He left the scene, saying he had to take his son to school, but was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144506/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/26/dwight_gooden_not_talking_about_dui.php">arrested as he headed there</a>, allegedly while under the influence.  At the time, his lawyer said Gooden, who has a history of drug abuse, wasn&apos;t intoxicated but he had been prescribed Ambien.</p>

<p>Monique told the Post she has no idea where Gooden is, just that he was &quot;holed up in a hotel somewhere in New Jersey back in May.&quot; They are now estranged and she &quot;said she last saw her husband on June 22 in Bergen County Family Court. The couple is due back in court in mid-August.&quot; More recently, after George Steinbrenner died, Gooden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144506/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/07/13/2010-07-13_boss_gave_darryl_and_doc_a_second_chance.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;George was like a second father for me. It&apos;s definitely been a tough day. I woke up this morning - I&apos;m like three hours behind, in Vegas with my daughters - and my cell phone started going off out here around 4 this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Gooden is scheduled to be honored during his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144506/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100721&amp;content_id=12468336&amp;vkey=pr_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym">induction to the Mets&apos; Hall of Fame</a> next weekend.</p>
