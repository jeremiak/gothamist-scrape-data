Following on the heels of Rep. Gary Ackerman&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173330/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/11/as_the_clinton_senate.php">J.Lo comment</a>, retail union head (and former DNC chief house counsel) Stuart Applebaum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173330/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12132008/news/politics/hill_ally__caroline_is_not_ready_for_sen_143945.htm">tells the Post</a>, &quot;Caroline Kennedy, although I&apos;m sure a fascinating and engaging person, simply doesn&apos;t have the experience or Washington know-how to get it done for New York.&quot;  Applebaum is also a friend of Clinton, and <a thref="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16512.html">Politico reports</a> that Kennedy&apos;s support of Obama may be seen as a betrayal to Clinton supporters.  Representative Anthoy Weiner, another friend of Hillary, said, &quot;<strong>This isn&apos;t a jihad or anything, but I&apos;d be lying to you if I said that supporters of Hillary don&apos;t remember where she was in the primary.</strong>&quot;   As for who Governor Paterson may choose to succeed HRC, a source close to him said, &quot;<strong>There is no frontrunner - period.</strong>&quot;</p>
