<p>As preparations continue for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428230333/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/whitney_houstons_livestreamed_funer.php">Whitney Houston&apos;s funeral tomorrow</a>, the music superstar&apos;s godmother Aretha Franklin shared her thoughts with the Today Show.  The Queen of Soul said that based on previews of Houston&apos;s upcoming film, <em>Sparkle</em>, she thought Houston looked &quot;fresh, she looked healthy, and she looked gorgeous. And I thought, &apos;Yes, she has conquered her challenges&apos; and was on the way.&quot;</p>

<p>Franklin revealed she was in a hotel room in North Carolina last Saturday when she heard the shocking news: &quot;I had just finished watching George Clooney in &apos;The Descendants,&apos; and I flipped back to the regular TV and maybe two minutes after I did it came across the screen. I just jumped up off the side of the bed.&quot;  Franklin recalled hearing Whitney sing for the first time in the 1970s, &quot;When she hit the soprano, I said, &apos;Oh, this little girl can sing! OK, Cissy&apos;s baby can sing!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Of fame and pressures, Franklin said, &quot;Parents have to really talk to their children before they leave home. She left home with all the right things; she just kind of lost her way along the way somewhere.&quot;  As for Houston&apos;s ex, Bobby Brown, she said he had &quot;responsibility to step up to the plate and be responsible (for daughter Bobbi).&quot; But she said, &quot;I really don&apos;t have an opinion on&quot; whether Brown could be blamed for Houston&apos;s problems.</p>

<p>Last night in Maryland, Brown was performing with New Edition: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428230333/http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/17/whitney-houston-bobby-brown-concert-video/#.Tz6bBkxSSFc">He said after thanking fans</a>, &quot;Life is life ... you have to move on sometimes.... I love [Whitney] like I love God ... my name is BAD ASS Bobby Brown.&quot; </p>
