<p>After NY State health officials said there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521101642/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/upstate_teen_girls_bizarre_tics_are.php">no known infectious or environmental causes</a> for why numerous teen girls have Tourette&apos;s-like tics, victims and their parents appeared on the Today Show to express their frustration.   Thera Sanchez, a high school cheerleader whose tics suddenly emerged last fall after taking a nap, said, &quot;I&#x2019;m very angry. I&#x2019;m very frustrated. No one&#x2019;s giving me answers.&quot; But one doctor who has treated some of the teens t<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521101642/http://todayhealth.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/18/10181277-teen-girls-mystery-illness-now-has-a-diagnosis-mass-hysteria">ells Today it&apos;s &quot;conversion disorder&quot;</a>&#x2014;a.k.a., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521101642/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001950/">mass hysteria</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521101642/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/upstate_teen_girls_bizarre_tics_are.php">&quot;mass hysteria&quot; diagnosis was mentioned last week</a>, with some experts saying that stress might have a basis in the symptoms, but parents are not convinced.  They haven&apos;t been shown any data and Sanchez&apos;s mother, Beth Miller, wants the state to turn over information that&apos;s been collected &quot;so I can proceed in finding a cure for our daughters.&quot;  Watch the segment, which features Sanchez suffering some intense sudden movement:</p>

<p>Today&apos;s psychologist Dr. Gail Saltz, who hasn&apos;t treated or examined any of the girls, said that when environmental and infectious factors are ruled out, and stress is cited, the diagnosis is usually &quot;conversion disorder.&quot; She emphasized, &quot;That&#x2019;s not faking it. They&#x2019;re real symptoms. They need a psychiatric or psychological treatment. Treatment does work.&quot; And neurologist Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, who has treated some of the girls, said, &quot;It&apos;s happened before, all around the world, in different parts of the world. It&apos;s a rare phenomena. Physicians are intrigued by it. The bottom line is these teenagers will get better.&quot;<br>
