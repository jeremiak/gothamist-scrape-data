<p>The episode is called, &quot;Basic Lupine Urology,&quot; a nod to L&amp;O; producer Dick Wolf, and the episode is described as:</p><blockquote> THE STUDY GROUP&#x2019;S SCIENCE EXPERIMENT IS SABOTAGED AND THEY GO ON THE OFFENSIVE TO EXPOSE THE CULPRIT - MICHAEL K. WILLIAMS GUEST STARS - When Annie (Alison Brie) discovers the study group&#x2019;s yam experiment smashed to smithereens on the science lab floor, the group mobilizes to expose the criminal and save their grade. Once Abed (Danny Pudi) and Troy (Donald Glover) think they have located the perpetrator, the group conducts a &#x201C;trial,&#x201D; with a reluctant Professor Kane (guest star Michael K. Williams) serving as judge. Jeff (Joel McHale) soon realizes, however, that the plot is thicker than anyone suspects. </blockquote>And there are the L&amp;O-style; titlecards between scenes and the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505192436/http://gothamist.com/2004/03/11/chung_chung.php">Chung-Chung</a>&quot; noise.
