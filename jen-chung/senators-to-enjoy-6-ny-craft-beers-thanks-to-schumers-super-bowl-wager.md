So it makes sense that his Super Bowl bet with New England Senator  Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) involved six NY craft beers.  Now that the Giants have proven victorious, Shaheen will be buying NY beer for the whole Senate!<p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s how the bet went: With a Patriots win, Schumer would have bought beer from New Hampshire&#x2019;s Smuttynose Brewery to give to fellow Senators.  But if the Giants won&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135142/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/super_bowl.php">THEY DID</a>&#x2014;Shaheen would buy beer from Brooklyn Brewery, Blue Point Brewing Company, Saranac Matt Brewing Company, Captain Lawrence Brewing Company, Ithaca Beer Company, and Brown&#x2019;s Brewing Company.</p>
