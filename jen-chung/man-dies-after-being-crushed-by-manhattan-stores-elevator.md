<p>A worker at a Washington Heights store was killed after being pinned between the store&apos;s elevator and the first floor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083408/http://nypost.com/2016/07/24/worker-killed-in-shocking-elevator-accdent/">A friend said</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s just shocking. He worked here seven days a week.&quot; </p>

<p>The 43-year-old male victim, who was not identified by police, had apparently been loading store merchandise into the elevator at 552 West 182nd Street, La Reguera Dominican before 5:45 p.m. yesterday afternoon, when, authorities say, the elevator &quot;started to ascend and pinned him to the ceiling.&quot; EMS pronounced him dead at the scene. </p>

<p>The Department of Buildings has no record of an elevator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083408/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/freight-elevator-crushes-43-year-old-nyc-worker-death-article-1.2723473">according to the Daily News</a>, which also reports, &quot;Jose Cabral, the owner of a juice bar next door, said the elevator was installed a year ago when an auto repair shop was transformed into the discount store. The lift had no doors, but Cabral said he never heard any complaints from the employees.&quot; </p>

<p>Cabral said of the victim, &quot;He would never sit down at work. He was always moving around, moving boxes around.&quot;</p>
