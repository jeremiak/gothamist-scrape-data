<p>A husband was arrested for fatally beating a stranger who allegedly broke into his Bronx building and tried to rape his wife, police say. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213234/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/31/bronx-sex-attack-fatal-beating/">A neighbor said</a>, &quot;I think any husband would do the same thing as what he did.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, police officers responded to 911 calls at 9:26 p.m., for an incident inside 1240 Washington Avenue and found a 43-year-old man &quot;unconscious and unresponsive, with severe trauma to the head and body.&quot; The man, Earl Nash, was taken to Lincoln Hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Police say Nash &quot;illegally entered&quot; the home and struck a 52-year-old woman in the head, &quot;causing contusions to her forehead.&quot; He then started forcibly removing her clothes, according to investigators. But the victim was able to break free and use a cell phone to call her husband, 61-year-old Mamadou Diallo, who was outside the building.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_05_elevatbx.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213234im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_05_elevatbx.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> (David Torres)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Diallo went inside and confronted Nash on the sixth floor hallway; police say that Diallo &quot;assaulted the perpetrator to the point where he was removed to the hospital in critical condition and later succumbed to his injuries.&quot; </p>

<p>Diallo&apos;s son said that his mother and sister were in their apartment when Nash broke in. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213234/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Husband-Beats-Would-Be-Rapist-to-Death-Assault-Wife-Apartment-381349831.html">He told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I ran upstairs and saw the guy was in the elevator and he was bleeding, and my mother was sweating, her clothes were off. I didn&apos;t know what to think.&quot; </p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213234/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/31/bronx-sex-attack-fatal-beating/">in an interview with 1010 WINS</a>, he added, &quot;I&#x2019;m mad because 20 minutes and nobody heard the commotion that was going on? Nobody came in to see what was going on. They just came at the end when my dad was fighting with the guy. It was too late.&quot;</p>

<p>Diallo was charged with manslaughter.</p>
