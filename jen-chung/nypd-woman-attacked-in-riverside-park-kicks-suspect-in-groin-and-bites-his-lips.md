<p>A woman walking her dog in a Manhattan Park managed to fight off a man who put her in a headlock and kissed her, police say. Now the police have released a sketch of the attacker in hopes the public can help them find him.</p>

<p>The incident occurred last Friday, August 5, at 5:20 a.m., and the NYPD described the incident as such:</p><blockquote>[T]he victim a 48-year-old female was walking her dog inside of Riverside Park located in the vicinity of 107 Street and Riverside Drive, when the individual approached her and asked for the time. The individual then grabbed the victim and placed her in a headlock, the victim hit the individual in the groin area causing the individual to release the victim. <p></p>

<p>The individual re-applied the headlock to the victim and tried to kiss her on the lips. The victim bit the individual on the lips causing him to release her. The individual then fled the location to parts unknown.</p></blockquote><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_06_24suspct.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103251im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_06_24suspct.jpg" width="200" height="284" class="image-right"> </span>Wow, that woman is a real awesome BADASS! Good for her for fighting this guy off. <p></p>

<p>Parkgoers also cheered the victim&apos;s quick thinking; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103251/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/11/riverside-park-attack/">one told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;That would be my gut reaction to just give him hell and hope for the best. But you know, that&#x2019;s all you can do. Fight or flight takes over.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The police say the suspect (sketch at right) is wanted for forcible touching. He is about 20-30 years old and 145-155 pounds with a medium complexion, muscular build, brown short curly hair and brown eyes. He was last seen gray shirt, khaki shorts and white sneakers.<br>
