<p>Today, Parks &amp; Recreation Commissioner Adrian Benepe released a red-tailed hawk who was rescued and rehabilitated over the summer.  The six-month-old bird of prey&apos;s nest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170720113916/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/29/baby_hawk_rescued_in_the_bronx.php">fell off an air-conditioning unit</a> (seriously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170720113916/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/wine_bar_awning_may_have_saved_viet.php">those things are dangerous</a> if magical) and some bird lovers scooped him up and took him to a licensed falconer.  The male hawk&apos;s return to the wild witnessed by Urban Park Rangers, Bobby Horvath of Wildlife in Need of Rescue and Rehabilitation (who helped care for the hawk) and first and second graders from P.S. 83 and the Dalton School.  </p>

<p>This Saturday, October 2, the Parks Department is holding its 13th Annual Raptor Fest, which will include &quot;aerial shows with 13 species of raptors, or birds of prey.&quot;  The festivities, which are free and will also include appearances from an owl and a peregrine falcon, will be held from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. in Central Park&#x2019;s Great Hill (Enter at West 106th Street and Central Park West).</p>
