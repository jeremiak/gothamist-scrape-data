One New Yorker spotted him on the R train this morning.</p>

<p>Reader David tells us that he noticed Weiner on the uptown train at 14th Street, &quot;He was chatting it up with the guy next to him and people across and had a couple of photographers with him.&quot; Weiner got off at 42nd Street&#x2014;all the better to transfer for the 2 or 3 train for his first official campaign stop in Harlem!</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103622/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/most-city-voters-say-weiner-shouldnt-run-for-mayor/?ref=nyregion">many voters have very mixed feelings</a> about Weiner trying to resurrect his political career after his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103622/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/its_official_anthony_weiner_wants_t.php">spectacular Congressional exit</a> over his crotch shot Tweet and other social media oversharing, he does have the power to unsettle the current mayoral field. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103622/http://capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/05/8530201/presenting-new-and-improved-anthony-weiner-rivals-prepare-old-versi#.UZ1m-sIjmoA.twitter">Capital New York points out</a>, &quot;Council Speaker Christine Quinn, for example, hovered over 30 percent in polls without Weiner, theoretically within reach (if just about everything broke her way) of the 40-percent threshold to avoid that run-off. With Weiner, she&apos;s mired in the mid-20s.&quot;</p>

<p>Reader David, who took the photograph, told us, &quot;I&apos;ll probably be voting for Quinn but I feel [the] picture scandal in the past makes no difference to me, and I really don&apos;t see that as an issue. He was just stupid lying about it.&quot;</p>
