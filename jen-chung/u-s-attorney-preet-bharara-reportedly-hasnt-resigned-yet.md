<p>Yesterday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked all U.S. Attorneys appointed by President Obama&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-asks-remaining-46-u-s-attorneys-appointed-by-obama-to-resign-1489186325">a total of 46&#x2014;to resign</a>. The big question is: What does this mean for Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York?</p>

<p>Bharara, described as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-tells-all-remaining-obama-administration-us-attorneys-to-resign/2017/03/10/110e3d8c-05ce-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_justice-dept-340pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.f33ed3ec5abe">the fiercely independent U.S. attorney</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-asks-remaining-46-u-s-attorneys-appointed-by-obama-to-resign-1489186325">one of the nation&#x2019;s highest-profile federal prosecutors</a>,&quot; has fought Wall Street executives, as well as New York&apos;s many corrupt politicians, from longtime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/30/sheldon_silver_verdict.php">Democratic Assembly Leader Sheldon Silver</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/12/skelos_sentence.php">Republican State Senate Leader Dean Skelos</a>. He has also circled Governor Cuomo (over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/11/no_moreland_cuomo_preet.php">his closed ethics commission</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/22/cuomos_percoco_ziti.php">managed to indict his friends</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/de-blasio-confident-meeting-u-s-attorney-article-1.2960132">Mayor de Blasio</a>.</p>

<p>After his election, President Trump told Bharara <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/preet_bharara_trump.php">that he wanted him to stay on</a>. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/10/despite-trump-bharara-won-t-resign-yet.html?via=desktop&amp;source=twitter">the Daily Beast reports</a> that Bharara hasn&apos;t resigned yet. While Bharara himself hasn&apos;t spoken to the press or his office about what he&apos;ll do, a federal law enforcement official told the website that &quot;Bharara told his section chiefs that he&#x2019;d yet to submit the requested letter and may instead challenge Sessions to fire him.&quot; The source also told the Daily Beast that Sessions told Bharara this week that he would remain in his position in a phone conversation this week. The Times&apos; Maggie Haberman also tweeted hat Bharara isn&apos;t planning on stepping down:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/us/politics/us-attorney-justice-department-trump.html">NY Times noted</a>:</p><blockquote>[T]he calls from the acting deputy attorney general arose a day after Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator who is a strong supporter of President Trump, said on his evening show that Mr. Trump needed to &#x201C;purge&#x201D; Obama holdovers from the federal government. Mr. Hannity portrayed them as &#x201C;saboteurs&#x201D; from the &#x201C;deep state&#x201D; who were leaking secrets to hurt Mr. Trump. It also came the same week that government watchdogs wrote to Mr. Bharara and urged him to investigate whether Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from taking payments from foreign governments.</blockquote>A Department of Justice spokesperson said it wasn&apos;t unusual for new administration to replace the U.S. Attorneys, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-tells-all-remaining-obama-administration-us-attorneys-to-resign/2017/03/10/110e3d8c-05ce-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_justice-dept-340pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.f33ed3ec5abe">Washington Post reported</a>, &quot;A similar step was taken at the start of the Bill Clinton administration. Sessions himself was asked to resign as the U.S. attorney in Alabama in March 1993 by Clinton&#x2019;s attorney general, Janet Reno.&quot;&#x2014;Reno asked for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/24/us/attorney-general-seeks-resignations-from-prosecutors.html">93 resignations at the time</a>&#x2014;&quot;But the George W. Bush administration eased U.S. attorneys out gradually while officials sought replacements, as did Barack Obama&#x2019;s Justice Department.&quot;<p></p>

<p>While some have resigned, like Robert Capers, U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of New York, two others, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland and Dana Boente of Virginia, were asked to stay (Rosenstein is Trump&apos;s pick for deputy attorney general while Boente is the acting attorney general). </p>

<p>Capers issued the following statement last night: &quot;It has been my greatest honor to serve my country, New York City and the people of this district for almost 14 years, with the last 17 months serving as United States Attorney.&quot; His departure now means there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/heavy-hitters-compete-brooklyn-u-s-attorney-article-1.2995097">frenzy for the job</a>. </p>

<p>More interestingly, the Daily News reports that an unemployed Bharara could be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707142523/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bharara-resignation-prompt-run-cuomo-de-blasio-article-1.2994950">as a potential opponent against de Blasio or Cuomo</a>. Anyway, Bharara, a big Springsteen fan, recently started Tweeting from his personal Twitter account:</p>
