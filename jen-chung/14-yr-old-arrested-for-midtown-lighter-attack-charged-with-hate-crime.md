<p>Police have arrested one of the individuals accused of trying to light a pedestrian&apos;s shirt on fire. A 14-year-old boy was arrested, and he&apos;s been charged with assault as a hate crime.</p>

<p>According to police, the group is connected to five incidents that took place last Saturday, September 10:</p>

<p>- At 8 p.m., outside 127 West 42nd Street,  a teen girl was walking with her mother when &quot;a male with a group of others approached the teen and attempted to set her T-shirt on fire with a lighter. The group was chased off by the victim&apos;s mother.&quot;</p>

<p>- At 8:45 p.m., outside 727 Fifth Avenue, at 8:45 p.m., a woman was approached by a group of five individuals (two females and three males), &quot;when one of the males, [who was wearing a white t-shirt]... comes up from behind and appears to ignite a lighter next to her leg. The woman, apparently uninjured, proceeds to walk north towards East 57 Street, while the group continues to walk southbound on Fifth Avenue.&quot;</p>

<p>- At 8:58 p.m., outside 693 Fifth Avenue, at 8:58 p.m., a 35-year-old woman told officers &quot;she was walking on the sidewalk when she felt something warm on her left arm and noticed her blouse was on fire. She patted out the fire and observed a male standing next to her with a lighter in his hand. The unknown male then proceeded to walk eastbound on East 54 Street.&quot; (This was the first reported incident, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014611/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/12/muslim_hate_crime_fifth_ave.php">victim in this incident was wearing Muslim clothing</a>; the Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating.)</p>

<p>- Just before 9 p.m., at the intersection of East 54 Street and Fifth Avenue, &quot;a female victim&apos;s skirt was set on fire by a group that passed by her.&quot;</p>

<p>- At 10 p.m., at the 42 Street and Bryant Park subway station, two women were walking down the stairs to the D/F train platform, &quot;when they both had a flame placed near their respective arms&quot; and saw a male, about 6&apos; and wearing a white t-shirt, &quot;holding a black back pack and a lighter.&quot; The women got on the F train while the male, along with others in his group, fled.</p>

<p>The teen was arrested for the incident outside 127 West 42nd Street; police said he is the individual seen in the headphones in this video:</p>
