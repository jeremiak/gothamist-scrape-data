<p>A young boy playing in his Brooklyn front yard died on Thursday after a concrete planter fell from the facade of the house and hit him. &quot;I saw mom was crying, screaming. She was saying, &apos;someone call 911&apos;,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428222442/http://abc7ny.com/news/8-year-old-boy-killed-by-falling-planter-box-in-brooklyn/1925745/">a neighbor said</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428222442/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170427/marine-park/child-dies-after-struck-in-head-by-concrete-flower-pot">tragedy unfolded</a> in Marine Park, at 2224 Ryder Street. Police say that officers responded to a 911 call just before 5:30 p.m.: &quot;Upon arrival, responding officers discovered an 8 year-old male unconscious and unresponsive with trauma to the head.&quot; An hour later, the NYPD announced that Kevin Reilly had been pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital.</p>

<p>Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428222442/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/heavy-flower-box-falls-brooklyn-boy-critically-injuring-article-1.3109348">told the Daily News</a> that the boy had been climbing on a metal gate covering the windows on the ground floor of the house. He reached up to grab the flower box, which is heavy and made of concrete or ceramic.</p>

<p>The planter then fell on the boy. Another neighbor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428222442/http://abc7ny.com/news/8-year-old-boy-killed-by-falling-planter-box-in-brooklyn/1925745/">Rahadel Kabir, told WABC 7</a>, &quot;What I could see from my attic she was trying to lift that piece, but that&apos;s the only view I had. She couldn&apos;t really lift it. It turned out two gentlemen ran over before I could get there tried to get there and tried CPR.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428222442/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=2&amp;vlcompdetlkey=0002108496">requested the Department of Buildings</a> to inspect the building.</p>
