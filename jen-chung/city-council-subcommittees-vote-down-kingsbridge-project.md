<p>The biggest debate about the project was about the &quot;living wage&quot;&#x2014;with critics saying that developer The Related Companies should promise that all the future permanent employees at the mall get $10/hour plus benefits.

City Councilman Joel Rivera reiterated his concern, &quot;Those who suffer the most are the low-income residents who struggle to pay their rent and pay their bills,&quot; but Councilman Robert Jackson said, &quot;I&apos;m afraid about the impact that&apos;s going to have on the future of the Bronx, as far as Kingsbridge Armory and the thousands of construction jobs that may not go forward.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement noting, &quot;Given that the national recession continues to weigh on the entire city and keep unemployment high - particularly in The Bronx - the outcome and timing couldn&#x2019;t be worse,&quot; but Councilman Tony Avella, who ran against the Mayor, called this &quot;a great day for democracy because the council has to be independent of the mayor.&quot;</p>
