<p>A fire that broke out in a Hamilton Heights apartment building yesterday afternoon grew to five-alarms and injured at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918033955/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/185920/fire-rages-through-west-harlem-apartment-building">least one civilian and 19 firefighters</a>. And it was apparently caused by an overloaded plug.</p>

<p>The super at 520 West 139th Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918033955/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/overloaded_outlet_sparks_alarm_fire_uUpGMLO5BVwQ4lIGR1wgeP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=">told the Post</a>, &quot;It started in the master bedroom on the sixth floor. There&#x2019;s only one outlet. They had the air-conditioning and all appliances plugged in, and it overheated. There was smoke everywhere.&quot; A 79-year-old man who lives there was able to escape&#x2014;his son said, &quot;He took his cane and ran.&quot;</p>

<p>The fire, which started at 3:45 p.m., spread quickly on the top floor and destroyed seven apartments, leaving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918033955/http://pix11.com/2013/07/22/more-than-150-homeless-after-hamilton-heights-apartment-building-fire/#axzz2Zs8bIbp4">40 people homeless</a>. Neighboring buildings were evacuated as well. The Red Cross assisted with shelter, food water and support.</p>

<p>About 200 firefighters responded to the blaze. Assistant Fire Chief James Manahan explained, &quot;They wear their full gear&quot;&#x2014;which is about 130 pounds&#x2014;&quot;which keeps all that heat in there and the firefighters can&#x2019;t last as long due to those conditions. The greatest challenge is the weather, with the humidity, the size of the building.&quot;</p>
