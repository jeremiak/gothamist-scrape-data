<p>On May 4, President Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/26/president_trump_nyc_visit.php">will return to New York City for the first time</a> since becoming President&#x2014;and the reason why he&apos;s been such a stranger is that he&apos;s just really feels bad about the stress it puts on the Big Apple.</p>

<p>Trump discussed the massive security measures around Trump Tower, aka White House North, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/29/trump-says-trips-to-new-york-city-cost-us-too-much.html">during an interview with Fox News</a>: &quot;President Donald Trump says he hasn&#x2019;t returned to his New York City home because &apos;going back is very expensive for the country.&apos; .... he feels &apos;guilty&apos; when he returns to Trump Tower because authorities close surrounding streets and &apos;I hate to see the New Yorkers with streets closed.&apos; He says he goes to his clubs instead because they have &apos;hundreds of acres&apos; and streets stay open.&quot;</p>

<p>In Bedminster, NJ, where the 600-acre Trump National Golf Course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/nyregion/sleepy-new-jersey-town-wakes-to-a-new-identity-trumps-camp-david-north.html">may become &quot;Camp David North,</a>&quot; some residents are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://www.newjerseyhills.com/bernardsville_news/news/trump-security-costs-feared-in-bedminster/article_9822f55e-43cf-57d2-bad3-150e0eb03afd.html">also worried about security costs</a>.</p>

<p>Still, First Lady Melania Trump and son Barron Trump reside at the Trump Tower triplex&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://people.com/politics/melania-trump-barron-moving-white-house-summer/">will for at least a couple more months</a>&#x2014;and that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/23/trump_tower_security_bill.php">been costing NYC a lot</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-nyc-idUSKBN16203Q">NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill said </a>it costs about $127,000 and $145,000 per day to secure Trump Tower for the First Lady and Barron Trump, and then when the President is in NYC, that number jumps to $308,000 a day.</p>

<p>New York lawmakers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://www.silive.com/news/2017/02/donovan_asks_congress_to_fund.html">have asked Congress to reimburse the city</a> for securing Trump Tower, but that money still hasn&apos;t come in. Mayor Bill de Blasio said during his budget presentation on Wednesday, &quot;The continuing resolution will hopefully address, at minimum, the period between the election and the inaugural&quot;&#x2014;which cost $25 million, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429195558/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/23/trump_tower_security_bill.php">per Commissioner O&apos;Neill&apos;s estimate</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe this is an absolute federal responsibility, and, I have to say, I&#x2019;m pleased, having talked to a number of Republicans in the Congress - I haven&#x2019;t talked to every one of them, to say the least - but the ones I&#x2019;ve talked to - no one disagrees in principle that this is the kind of thing the federal government should cover. So, we&#x2019;re going to remain at least mostly hopeful,&quot; de Blasio added.</p>
