										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_01_manbun.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430041129im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_01_manbun.jpg" width="305" height="425" class="image-right"> </span>Next time you see a guy wearing his hair in a bun, you can thank the NY Times for being on top of this trend.  Because there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430041129/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/fashion/in-brooklyn-committing-to-a-man-bun.html?ref=fashion">feature on the proliferation of this new &apos;do</a>: &quot;In certain arty neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Bushwick, some men are twisting their long hair into a form more famously worn by librarians, schoolmarms and Katharine Hepburn. But don&#x2019;t call the male version an up-do or a chignon. <strong>Call it a man bun.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, Gawker points out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430041129/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/fashion/in-brooklyn-committing-to-a-man-bun.html?ref=fashion">just three guys from Brooklyn</a> (&quot;the white part&quot;) seem to be the local early adopters (alongside tennis players Alexandr Dolgopolov and Xavier Malisse and Top Chef contestant Chris Jones).  But this hairstyle was examined by a blog far from the gentrified streets of Brooklyn, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430041129/http://www.reddirtchronicles.com/2011/03/in-search-of-a-name-for-the-man-bun/">Red Dirt Chronicles in March of 2011</a>:</p><blockquote> I somewhat accidentally discovered the continual twisting of a pony tail will eventually roll up into a bun.  And double-wrap a hair band around said bun and it is almost like a temporary shearing.  Amazing!  And, it fits around the inside straps of a hard hat.  Tremendous!<p></p>

<p>But here&#x2019;s the deal.  Not since the time of the Samurai have hair buns been cool when worn by men.  However, being the trendsetter that I&#x2019;ve never been, I don&#x2019;t mind stepping out there in an effort to - as in the days of the great sworded, martial arts warriors of old - make hair buns cool for men.</p>

<p>So, here is where I need your help.  I need a cool name for the &#x201C;man-bun&#x201D; because man-bun just is not going to cut it, so to speak.  So keep it clean and send your suggestions on a cool name for the man-bun.  Help me make this thing as respectable as possible, okay?</p></blockquote>Red Dirt readers suggested chump stump, man-gnon, knump (knot+lump), ninja knot, and bro non. Question: How does a bro non look with a fixie?<p></p>
