<p>Police say a woman fought off a man who tried to sexually assault her on a Brooklyn sidewalk yesterday morning.</p>

<p>The incident happened near 7th Avenue and Garfield Place in Park Slope around 4:40 a.m. Saturday. According to the NYPD, the 23-year-old woman was walking down the street when the suspect &quot;approached her from behind, pushed her the ground and began to pull down his pants. The victim threw her purse at the individual, who fled the location in an unknown direction.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The authorities released surveillance footage of the suspect, who is described as being approximately 25-30 years old, 5&apos;10-6&apos;0&quot; tall and 150-170 pounds. He was last seen wearing black hoodie and black sweatpants.</p>
