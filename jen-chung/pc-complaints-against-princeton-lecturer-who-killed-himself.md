<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_princetoncal.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213431im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_princetoncal.jpg" width="365" height="275" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213431/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/princeton_lecturer_killed_himself_i.php">suicide of a popular Princeton University Spanish lecturer</a> after being abruptly dismissed continues to raise questions as his friends talk to more media outlets. Antonio Calvo was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on April 12, with self-inflicted stab wounds, just four days before being essentially kicked out of his Princeton office. Calvo&apos;s contract was up for renewal, which is standard process, but, friends claims, two graduate students and another lecturer banded together against Calvo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213431/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/plot_led_to_prof_suicide_friends_ozxaIIM2KpiuL51Zbybi3K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME">complaining that in one instance he said</a>, &quot;You&apos;re spending too much time touching your balls. Why don&apos;t you go to work?&quot;</p>

<p>The friend told the Post, &quot;It was interpreted as sexual harassment, but it&apos;s a common expression in Spanish. Some people saw him as politically incorrect, but it was just the way he was -- his personality.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213431/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/nyregion/after-suicide-firing-of-princeton-lecturer-is-questioned.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times characterized that complaint</a>, &quot;In [one incident], he jokingly referred to a male student&#x2019;s genitalia in an e-mail, using a common Spanish expression that implores someone to get to work,&quot; adding, &quot;In [another] episode earlier this academic year, Dr. Calvo told a graduate student that she deserved a slap on the face, and slapped his own hands together.&quot;</p>

<p>Calvo oversaw the Spanish department and all the graduate students.  A friend who teaches at Columbia University told the NY Times that when she saw him in February, &quot;He was very upset because he was undergoing a review, which was normal, but some of the graduate students were not following what they had to do. Some didn&#x2019;t even show up to classes that they were teaching, and it&#x2019;s his responsibility to make sure that the language program runs smoothly.&quot;  Calvo, a Spanish national, was in the U.S. thanks to a work visa sponsored by Princeton; without a visa, he would have needed to find another job offering him a visa quickly or return to Spain.</p>

<p>Besides Calvo&apos;s friends, undergraduate students have been unhappy about the lack of answers from Princeton about his dismissal.  One said, &quot;I really want to know more about what happened. I want the holes to be filled before I can move on.&quot; Another student said, &quot;If there was an indiscretion on his part, this should all be left alone. But if there&#x2019;s a fault on the part of an individual or group or institution that perhaps treated him unfairly or unethically, that needs to be addressed and actions should be taken.&quot;</p>
