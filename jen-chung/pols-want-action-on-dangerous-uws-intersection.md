</div></div>					<p> Yesterday, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal called upon the Department of Transportation to stop dragging its feet and &quot;implement a swift solution to the public safety hazard at a dangerous &apos;bow-tie&apos; intersection at West 71st Street at Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue.&quot; Last year, there were 25 accidents (including a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160506/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/19/no_charges_for_cab_driver_who_drove.php"> taxi cab that crashed</a> into a West 72nd Street subway station head house) and eight this year&#x2014;just a few weeks ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160506/http://westsideindependent.com/2010/06/16/at-least-2-nasty-accidents-on-same-block-this-week/">another cab crashed into a pedestrian island</a>, injuring a woman.  Should get pretty interesting when the Trader Joe&apos;s opens on Broadway between 71st and 72nd!</p>

<p>One resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160506/http://wcbstv.com/seenon/dangerous.intersection.upper.2.1839157.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I tell you,<strong> I avoid it no matter where I have to go. Even if it takes me 10 blocks I&apos;ll walk it because they come form all directions</strong>.&quot; Rosenthal, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160506/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/13/uws_drivers_will_not_feel_need_for.php">concerned about the intersection for a while</a> (her Manhattan office is on West 72nd!), says she led DOT officials on a visit to survey the area this spring. However, the DOT said that a plan cannot be implemented until 2011, &quot;at the earliest and will require additional study.&quot;  Rosenthal complains, &quot;It seems like DOT is stuck in bureaucratic inertia,&quot; and said, &quot;While the city is lavishing attention on making Times Square more attractive, what they ought to be doing is lavishing on this intersection to make it more safe.&quot; </p>

<p>Stringer snarked to WCBS 2, &quot;You know if we were calling on them to create a [pedestrian] plaza on 72nd Street it would be created in a month. Here we&apos;re asking them to fix a couple of traffic lights and they still can&apos;t do that.&quot; He, Rosenthal and Upper West Siders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160506/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/a-call-for-safety-where-broadway-meets-amsterdam">are asking</a> for crossing times to be increased, countdown timers, and maybe even more police enforcement!  As for the DOT&apos;s plan, that&apos;ll be presented next month.  </p>
