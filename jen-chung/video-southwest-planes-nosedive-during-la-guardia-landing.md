</div></div>					<p>Laguardia Airport&apos;s runways are back open after last night&apos;s incident where an incoming Southwest Airlines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122149/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/22/southwest_flights_nose_gear_collaps.php">plane&apos;s landing gear collapsed while taxiing</a>.  A passenger, Anniebell Hanna, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122149/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/official-laguardia-looking-fully-re-open">said of Flight 345 from Nashville</a>, &quot;When we got ready to land, we nosedived.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122149/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Southwest-Flight-Landing-Gear-Collapse-LaGuardia-Injuries-NTSB-Boeing-Investigation-216561131.html">Another passenger said</a>, &quot;It sort of came down really fast, and kind of steep. And then it sort of banged, and then it banged again and then it sort of skidded to a stop. It all stopped quicker than you would have thought.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122149/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/wheels_come_off_eGonDZcrWOY80U1JHy3qEM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">A passenger told the Post</a>, &quot;I heard people screaming. We didn&#x2019;t know if the plane was on fire. The captain didn&#x2019;t come on the PA or anything.&quot; A video of the landing shows a fire.</p>

<p>The plane was carrying 149 passengers and crew members (there may have been a non-ticketed child on a passenger&apos;s lap as well). Ten people were treated for anxiety attacks and bumps while six others were taken to a hospital. </p>

<p>Hanna said the flight had been delayed in Nashville , telling the AP they heard an announcement saying &quot;something was wrong with a tire.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122149/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/nyregion/10-people-are-injured-in-plane-landing-at-la-guardia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">A fellow passenger described</a>, &quot;I saw a tire fly off and go to the left and the nose hit flat on the ground, and sparks went flying everywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Laguardia&apos;s manager said, &quot;There were no indications of problems with the nose gear before landing. There were no radio calls saying their landing gear was not locking.&quot;</p>
