<p>Fox News star Megyn Kelly&apos;s eagerly awaited memoir, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015357/https://www.amazon.com/Settle-More-Megyn-Kelly/dp/0062494600/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478874829&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=megyn+kelly">Settle For More</a></em>, will be on sale on Tuesday, November 15th. As has been previously reported, the memoir details how her former boss, Fox News founder Roger Ailes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015357/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/03/megyn_kelly_ailes_fox.php">tried to force himself on her</a>. The latest leak from the book describes what happened to Kelly before and during the first Republican debate&#x2014;it&apos;s pretty crazy.</p>

<p>The NY Times&apos; Jennifer Senior <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015357/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/books/review-megyn-kelly-tells-tales-out-of-fox-news-in-her-memoir-settle-for-more.html?_r=1">reviewed an advance copy of the book</a>: </p><blockquote>Ms. Kelly writes that her problems started in August, the Monday before the first Republican presidential primary debate. She had just done a segment on her show, &#x201C;The Kelly File,&#x201D; that infuriated Mr. Trump. He refused to make his own scheduled appearance on her show unless she phoned him personally.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I almost unleashed <em>my beautiful Twitter account</em> against you,&#x201D; she says he told her, &#x201C;and <em>I still may</em>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then, the day before the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump was in a lather again, Ms. Kelly writes. He called Fox executives, saying he&#x2019;d heard that her first question &#x201C;was a very pointed question directed at him.&#x201D; This disconcerted her, because it was true: It was about his history of using disparaging language about women.</p>

<p>She doesn&#x2019;t speculate where the leak came from. (She reports. You decide.) But that&#x2019;s another unambiguous takeaway from this book: Parts of Fox &#x2014; or at the very least, Roger Ailes, the network&#x2019;s chairman until July, when he was given the boot after several allegations of sexual harassment were made against him &#x2014; seemed to be nakedly colluding with the Republican presidential nominee.</p></blockquote>Kelly writes, &quot;Folks were starting to worry about Trump&#x2026; Yes, it was his first debate. But this was bizarre behavior, especially for a man who wanted the nuclear codes.&quot;<p></p>

<p>And Trump did target her with his Twitter:</p>

<p>That&apos;s not all&#x2014;from the NY Times review:</p><blockquote>Her story becomes more byzantine. On the day of the debate, Ms. Kelly writes, she woke up feeling great. Then an overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver picked her up to take her to the convention center. He insisted on getting her coffee, though she&#x2019;d repeatedly declined his offer. Once it was in her hand, she drank it. And within 15 minutes, she was violently ill, vomiting so uncontrollably that it was unclear if she&#x2019;d be able to go on and help moderate that evening. It was so bad that she kept a trash pail beneath her desk throughout the debate, just in case.<p></p>

<p>Ms. Kelly never says outright that someone tried to poison her. (A stomach bug was going around, she notes.) But the episode spooked her enough that she shared it later with Roger Ailes and a lawyer friend of his. Foul play? Again: She reports. You decide.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Today, she Tweeted denials:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the record, my book &quot;Settle for More&quot; does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did.</p>&#x2014; Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015357/https://twitter.com/megynkelly/status/796939729493168128">November 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Her memoir also reportedly describes how Trump tried to win her over, because you know how he feels about the media:</p><blockquote> Part of Mr. Trump&#x2019;s [social media] response seemed like that of a man betrayed: Months before announcing his candidacy, he had tried hard to curry Ms. Kelly&#x2019;s favor. He sent her notes, including an attagirl scrawled across her picture in The New York Times Magazine. (When Vanity Fair reported this, Mr. Trump denied it; Ms. Kelly includes proof, a picture.) Ms. Kelly and her husband declined an invitation to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump&#x2019;s fabled estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Then Mr. Trump tried, repeatedly and unsuccessfully, to persuade her to let him pick up the tab for the weekend she spent with two girlfriends at the Trump SoHo hotel.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign,&#x201D; Ms. Kelly writes. &#x201C;I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage. Many reporters have told me that Trump worked hard to offer them something fabulous &#x2014; from hotel rooms to rides on his 757.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Should be fun watching her tangle with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015357/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/megyn_kelly_newt_gingrich.php">future Secretary of State Newt Gingrich</a> (and by &quot;fun,&quot; we mean &quot;please won&apos;t someone wake us up from this nightmare?&quot;).<p></p>
