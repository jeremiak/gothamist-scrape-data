<p>Mayor Bloomberg was late to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107230252/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/mayor_bloomberg_to_discuss_soda_ban.php">his press conference</a>&#x2014;to discuss the judge&apos;s decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107230252/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/judge_stops_bloombergs_soda_ban.php">block his innovative and controversial sugary drink ban</a>&#x2014;because he got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107230252/https://twitter.com/marclavorgna/status/311230165734801408">held up in traffic</a>. (RIP, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107230252/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/08/congestion_pric_9.php">congestion pricing</a>.) He had been taping a segment for Late Show with David Letterman at the Ed Sullivan Theater and opted to travel by vehicle during the rush hour&#x2014;rather than take the N/R!  </p>

<p>Anyway, Late Show released a clip of Bloomberg discussing the soda ban&apos;s obstacle&#x2014;the mayor points out, &quot;For the first time in the history of the world, more people will die of over-eating than under-eating.&quot; Letterman says his theory is that obesity is caused by the &quot;corporate food industry&quot; (he&apos;s clearly read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107230252/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=all">NY Times Magazine story about junk food</a>) and says unhealthy foods are &quot;so engineered&#x2026; so people continue to eat&quot; them. Bloomberg didn&apos;t fall for that, &quot;People have a right to make products,&quot; but did said the government has a job to &quot;educate people&quot;&#x2014;also, &quot;Don&apos;t ban Cheez-its.&quot;</p>
