</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016133212/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/06/brooklyn_firefighter_killed_battlin.php">Saturday night blaze</a> that claimed the life of a 14-year veteran firefighter was caused by an air conditioner cord that was &quot;pinched.&quot; </p>

<p>Lt. Gordon Matthew Ambelas died while battling a fire in an apartment at 75 Wilson Street, a NYC Housing Authority building in Williamsburg. Ambelas was trapped in the apartment, which the Post and Daily News describe as being extremely cluttered.</p>

<p>Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said, &quot;The fire originated at an air-conditioning unit electrical cord, which was pinched between a bed frame and the wall of Apartment 19B.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016133212/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/high-rise-fire-killed-firefighter-caused-pinched-cord-article-1.1856750">An FDNY source told the News</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s difficult when there&#x2019;s &#x2018;Collyers&#x2019; mansion&#x2019; conditions,&quot; a reference to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016133212/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collyer_brothers">mansion, owned by two brothers</a>, famously packed with 140 tons of items. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016133212/http://nypost.com/2014/07/07/deadly-fire-blamed-on-electrical-cord/">Neighbors told the Post</a> that the apartment&apos;s tenant, &quot;Angel Pagan ran a home-based haircutting business.&quot; One said, &quot;He had a lot of clutter. He had a lot of things in his apartment. It was definitely overstuffed and you actually had trouble sometimes entering the apartment because he had so much stuff,&quot; while another said, &quot;He had a lot of wiring in there, a lot of electronics. He had two air conditioners, fans, TVs, a fish tank, a radio system.&quot;</p>

<p>Pagan, 51, denied that he was a hoarder and blamed the NYCHA for faulty outlets that didn&apos;t work&#x2014;which prompted him to &quot;run a cord from his living room to his bedroom, connecting his TV, A/Cs and other electronics.&quot; Per the News, &quot;The bedroom air conditioner was plugged into an extension cord that was also powering his television, DVD player, VCR and living room chandelier.&quot;  (Pagan&apos;s three dogs died in the fire; their bodies were found in the bathroom.) The Post, though, has photos showing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016133212/http://nypost.com/2014/07/07/deadly-fire-blamed-on-electrical-cord/">many, many burned items in the apartment</a>. </p>

<p>Ambelas&apos; death was the first in-the-line-of-duty FDNY fatality since 2012. The Staten Island resident leaves behind a wife and two children. </p>
