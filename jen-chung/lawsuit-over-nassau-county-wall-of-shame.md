Lawyer Brian Griffin says his client&apos;s mugshot and name should be removed from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801195108/http://www.nassaucountyny.gov/agencies/CountyExecutive/NewsRelease/2008/index.html">Nassau County website</a>, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t think you need a law degree to understand that this fundamentally goes against a system of justice in which punishment occurs after you&apos;ve been found guilty.&quot;  However, Nassau County&apos;s public attorney argues, &quot;These are public documents being given public airing,&quot; adding that the website stresses that the defendants are presumed innocent. </p>
