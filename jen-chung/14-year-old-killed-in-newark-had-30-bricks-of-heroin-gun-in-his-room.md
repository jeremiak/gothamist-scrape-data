                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_08_newshooting.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090048im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_newshooting.jpg" width="365" height="247"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Via WABC 7</i></div> Last night, a 14-year-old boy was fatally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090048/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9236879">shot in a Newark housing complex</a>. Ali Rajohn Eric Henderson was the 10th person to be killed in Newark in the past 10 days. And now reports say that the boy had 30 bricks of heroin as well as a gun in his bedroom.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090048/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/09/14-year-old_newark_boy_killed_had_prior_arrest.html#incart_m-rpt-1">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, the boy &quot;had several prior arrests for drug possession and robbery, according to police documents and law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation who declined to be identified because they are not yet authorized to speak about the investigation.&quot; Most recently, he was arrested for possessing crack cocaine on August 15. After the boy was killed, &quot;detectives from the prosecutor&apos;s homicide task force searched the boy&apos;s room and found 30 bricks of heroin, a loaded 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson handgun and a box of .357 ammunition, the document said.&quot;</p>

<p>Donna Jackson, of the Newark Anti-Violence Coalition, told WABC 7, &quot;The level of danger in this city is at an all-time high. For those of us here in Newark, we&apos;re not just the number one carjacking city in the world, we&apos;re the number one murder, crime city in this country, and we need help.&quot;</p>

<p>The shooting occurred at 9 p.m. at the Riverview Terrace Housing Complex, where the boy lived. About a half hour before, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090048/https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/375415922921459712">Mayor Cory Booker Tweeted</a>, &quot;Out with Police Director DeMaio tonight visiting with residents and reviewing our increased police operations.&quot; DeMaio said the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090048/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/09/a_14-year-old_boy_is_the_10th_person_killed_in_newark_in_as_many_days.html">various shootings were not linked</a>, &quot;It&apos;s just kind of a random spark-up. There&apos;s been no change in the deployment strategy we used all summer.&quot; Booker&apos;s office announced earlier that the Police Department was launching &quot;Operation Blue Zone,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090048/http://newjersey.news12.com/news/newark-mayor-cory-booker-authorizes-1m-more-to-city-police-following-crime-wave-1.6014017">to put police in troubled areas</a>.</p>
