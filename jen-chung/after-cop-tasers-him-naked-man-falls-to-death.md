Based on video (below) and witness reports, Iman Morales, 35, was wielding a fluorescent light bulbs at cops who tried to get close.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424125934/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09252008/news/regionalnews/cops_in_nude_taser_slay_130670.htm">According to the Post</a>, Morales was yelling from the fire escape at 491 Tompkins Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  When police asked him to come down, he &quot;climbed down to a ledge above a metal roll-down storefront cover&quot; and starting waving the long light bulb. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424125934/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/09/24/2008-09-24_naked_man_falls_to_his_death_after_taser-1.html">Daily News reports a witness</a> as saying, &quot;When the police came, he was screaming, &apos;You&apos;re gonna kill me and I&apos;m gonna take everyone with me. I&apos;m gonna die and you&apos;re gonna die with me.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>After he continued to ignore the police order, one officer fired his stun gun, apparently per orders from his boss.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424125934/http://www.wnbc.com/news/17550915/detail.html?dl=mainclick">WNBC reports</a> a witness saw Morales freeze and fall &quot;on his head on the sidewalk.&quot;  Another witness told the NY Times, &quot;It was a dead man&apos;s fall.&quot;  The Post also has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424125934/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09252008/news/regionalnews/cops_in_nude_taser_slay_130670.htm">distressing gallery of images</a> showing Morales outside the building, being Tasered, falling and on the ground.  </p>

<p>Morales was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he later died.  He had rented an apartment on the third floor of the building.  His mother had called 911, finding him &quot;out of control&quot; (she believed he stopped taking his medication).  When police went to his apartment, the Daily News reports he &quot;crept nude onto the fire escape and tried to enter a neighbor&apos;s fourth-floor window when police forced their way into his apartment.&quot;  That neighbor said, &quot;He tried to get into my window. He banged. He said, &apos;Let me in! Let me in!&apos;<strong> But no way I&apos;m letting a naked man into my apartment.</strong>&quot;  Another witness said that his mother had been yelling, &quot;No! No! Don&apos;t hurt him!  He&apos;s sick.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD is investigating the incident; this past summer, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424125934/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/08/nypd_looks_to_t_1.php">started to arm police officers with Tasers</a>, as a way to avoid shootings. The Times notes, &quot;Community activists held a news conference after Mr. Morales&#x2019;s death, urging neighbors not to prejudge the police and urging the authorities to fully investigate.&quot; However, City Councilman Peter Vallone did say, &#x201C;<strong>My first take is that while I&#x2019;m sure there are no experts out there on how to handle a crazy naked man with a weapon on top of a ledge, I&#x2019;m also sure this wasn&#x2019;t the right way</strong>.&quot;  </p>
