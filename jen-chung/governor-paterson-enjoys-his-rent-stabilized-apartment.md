It turns out his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164315/http://www2.nysun.com/new-york/paterson-pays-a-stabilized-rate-of-rent/">two-bedroom apartment in Harlem is rent-stabilized</a>, so he and his wife only pay $1,250/month for their home. </p>

<p>Paterson and his wife Michelle, who made $270,000 last year, live in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164315/http://www.olnick.com/residential/lenox/">Lenox Terrace apartment complex</a>, where the market rate for a two-bedroom go for $2,600.  When asked by the Sun, Paterson said the rent was appropriate, given the city&apos;s rent regulations. &quot;<strong>It is within the spirit of the law.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>However, the Conservative Party&apos;s chairman Michael Long told the Sun, &quot;Why should a high official like the governor of the state of the New York live in a government-subsidized apartment?&quot; (The Patersons own a home upstate, near Albany, and could reside in the Governor&apos;s Mansion.)  And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164315/http://www.rsanyc.com/index.html">Rent Stabilization Association</a>&apos;s Frank Ricci said, &quot;People who make over $100,000 have plenty of choices where to live.&quot;  </p>

<p>Discussions to raise rent stabilized rents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164315/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/30/its_time_to_dis.php">are currently underway</a>. They will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164315/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/06/landlords_tenan.php">undoubtedly be higher</a> than what tenants want and lower than what landlords want.</p>
