										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:170px; "> <img alt="32910ricco.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818081232im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32910ricco.jpg" width="170" height="255"> <br> <i>Victim Danielle Ricco</i></div> Yesterday, a cabbie who stopped taking his seizure medication <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818081232/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/29/seizure_cabbie_admits_he_caused_200.php">pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide </a>for a crash that killed a passenger in 2006.  But Hassan Afzal was given a plea deal with a sentencing recommendation of five years probation&#x2014;no jail time&#x2014;which upset victim Danielle Ricco&apos;s family as well as the other women injured in the accident.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818081232/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/03/30/2010-03-30_nojail_deal_for_cabbie_outrages_victims_parents.html">Ricco&apos;s father said,</a> &quot;We&apos;re heartbroken. He&apos;s never expressed any remorse,&quot; while Anna Sallustio, whose pelvis and leg were shattered, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818081232/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cab_slay_rage_iArfokaZuFnvFF6GB9Rm2N">said</a>, &quot;I am appalled.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Afzal was driving Ricco, Sallustio, Sallustio&apos;s sister, and Amy Vallarelli up the West Side Highway with four female passengers in tow.  Afzal lost consciousness and crashed into a building, causing 21-year-old Ricco to be thrown from the passenger&apos;s seat and then crushed by another car. Afzal&apos;s lawyer claims his client is remorseful, but it was only yesterday that Afzal admitted he lied on motor vehicle licensing documents about his history of seizures&#x2014;earlier, his claim was that the brakes failed.</p>

<p>Grieving father Richard Ricco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818081232/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/nyregion/30cabby.html?ref=nyregion">also spoke to the Tmes</a>, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to accept that, under the circumstances, this person just walks away with five years&#x2019; probation,&quot; but said that they appreciated the assistant district attorney for working closely with them: &quot;The family trusted [ADA Kerry] O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s advice that this was the best resolution to the case, Mr. Ricco said. Ms. O&#x2019;Connell told him that it would have been difficult to prove that Mr. Afzal had a seizure just before the car crashed.&quot;  </p>

<p>The News also reports that Afzal asked the judge if he could travel to Pakistan to see his family; probation officials will decide that.</p>
