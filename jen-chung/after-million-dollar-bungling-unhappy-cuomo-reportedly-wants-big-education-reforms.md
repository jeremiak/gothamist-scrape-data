<p>In spite of threats from the NY State education commissioner that he&apos;d &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104093454/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/nyregion/new-york-state-schools-may-lose-aid-over-teacher-evaluations.html">withhold tens of millions of dollars in federal grants to struggling schools</a>&quot; unless the districts and teachers union came to an agreement on teacher evaluations by January 1, the two parties <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104093454/http://gothamschools.org/2011/12/30/city-union-declare-impasse-in-teacher-evaluation-negotiations/">failed to do so</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104093454/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gov-slams-schools-making-deal-article-1.999348">Governor Cuomo said</a>, &quot;I am disappointed that agreements could not be reached. Students lose... because of this failure.&quot;  Yes, they&apos;ll probably lose $100 million in federal money, $60 million of it meant for NYC schools.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104093454/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/convention-center-coming-aqueduct-article-1.999550?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports</a> that Cuomo, &quot;in his second state-of-state address Wednesday, will accuse New York&#x2019;s schools of being unaccountable and announce a commission to come up with reforms.&quot;  A source says, &quot;The failure to pass the teacher evaluation system is an example that not only is the system broken, but the ability to monitor the system and come up with a method to ensure kids are educated properly is broken.&quot; </p>

<p>The teachers union and school districts were having a tough time agreeing on what would be a fair system, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104093454/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/education/teacher-evaluations-dispute-imperils-grants-for-schools.html">Times said the sticking points</a> were &quot;the type of help poorly rated teachers would get to improve their performance, and the appeals process available to teachers facing termination after receiving poor ratings two years in a row.&quot; The United Federation for Teachers president Michael Mulgrew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104093454/http://gothamschools.org/2011/12/30/city-union-declare-impasse-in-teacher-evaluation-negotiations/">told Gotham Schools</a> that be doubted the Bloomberg administration really wanted to negotiate while Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott told NY State officials that the union was aiming &quot;to protect the very worst performing teachers.&quot;</p>
