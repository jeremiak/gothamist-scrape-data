<p>A 60-year-old woman was seriously injured after being struck by a driver Sunday morning in Manhattan by the Midtown tunnel. The driver never stopped, and now the police are looking for him. </p>

<p>The incident occurred at 10:30 a.m., near East 38th Street and Tunnel Entrance Street.  According to the NYPD, &quot;the suspect&apos;s vehicle struck the 60 year-old female victim as she crossed 38 Street. The individual did not stop and fled eastbound on East 37 Street against the flow of traffic before the vehicle turned northbound onto 1 Avenue. The victim suffered a serious left leg injury as well as trauma to her body. She was removed to an area hospital in critical but stable condition.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the victim, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012406/http://abc7ny.com/news/video-released-of-suspect-in-hit-and-run-near-queens-midtown-tunnel/1581396/">may work in the neighborhood</a>, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012406/http://nypost.com/2016/10/30/woman-struck-dragged-by-hit-and-run-driver/">finally became dislodged near East 37th Street and 1st Avenue</a>&quot;&#x2014;a block away.</p>
