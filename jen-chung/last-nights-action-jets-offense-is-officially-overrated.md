There were three turnovers, two interceptions, and a half-dozen dropped passes.  And Jets punter Steve Weatherford faked a punt and ran on a fourth-and-18 from the Jets 20-year line and was a half yard short, allowing the Packers to take control and make a field goal. Apparently Weatherford had no idea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130846/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/jets/post/_/id/2595/when-in-doubt-punt-dont-run">how many yards he needed for a first down</a>!  </p>

LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh waltzed into the Prudential Center and grilled the Nets with a combined 55 points. Nets coach Avery Johnson said, &#x201C;I told my team, during the course of the year, you&#x2019;ve got two, or three, or four games where you&#x2019;re not very good. And this is one of them. We just weren&#x2019;t very good tonight &#x2014; from the start. We were stuck in mud; we were stuck in second gear. We just couldn&#x2019;t get anything going.&#x201D;</p>
