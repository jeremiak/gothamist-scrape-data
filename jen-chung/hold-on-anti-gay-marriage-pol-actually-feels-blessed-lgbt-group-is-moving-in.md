<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152314/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/gay_pride_parades_in_bx_foe_building_uwT0rBsgPrvBzLG7GpaJOI#ixzz1dagalGNc">Post reported</a> that Bronx Pride, the Bronx&apos;s biggest LGBT group, was moving into the Ruben Diaz Sr. Gardens building, a residential-commercial space funded by State Senator Diaz&apos;s non-profit and named after him. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152314/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/13/perfect_lgbt_group_moves_into_bronx.php">given his extremely anti-gay marriage stance</a>, the Post quoted a source who said that Diaz was &quot;furious. It&#x2019;s such a direct shot at him.&quot;  But Diaz tells us that&apos;s not true&#x2014;he actually feels &quot;honored&quot; and &quot;blessed&quot; to have the group in the building and is only furious that the Post reporter didn&apos;t include anything he told her!</p>

<p>After receiving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152314/http://www.nysenate.gov/press-release/senator-reverend-diaz-honored-bronx-pride-coming-rev-ruben-diaz-gardens">press release from Diaz&apos;s office</a>, we called the State Senator, who told us, &quot;I&apos;m a big guy. I can take criticism... But I wish that the reporter was fair and honest.  I think she wanted me to say bad things.&quot;  Of Bronx Pride&apos;s move, Diaz, who is a Pentecostal minister, said, &quot;I&apos;m not angry.  I feel blessed... It&apos;s a testament to the work I&apos;m doing [to let everyone know that] the Bronx is open for business.&quot; </p>

<p>When we asked Diaz about whether he would pursue a lawsuit against NY&apos;s same-sex marriage law&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152314/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/24/new-york-gay-marriage-protest_n_908196.html">a law he called &quot;criminal&quot; back in the summer</a>&#x2014;he said, &quot;That&apos;s over.&quot;  Still, Diaz was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152314/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/09/ruben_diaz_sr_bob_turner.php">happy that anti-gay marriage group</a>, the National Organization for Marriage had &quot;given me opportunities to robo-call and send mailings to the voters in the 9th Congressional District about my support for Bob Turner&apos;s pro-family values... I expect that the Hispanic vote in this race will be influential in determining who wins, and since the Hispanic community has traditional family values, I believe they will vote for Bob Turner because of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152314/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/could_gay_marriage_turn_weiners_old.php">position against gay marriage</a>.&quot;</p>
