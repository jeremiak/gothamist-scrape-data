<p>The man accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222122511/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/chelsea_slashing_arrest.php">slashing a woman walking on a Manhattan sidewalk</a> may be linked to more attacks. NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222122511/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/07/chelsea-slashing-suspect/">told reporters</a>, &quot;He took a razor blade and cut another young lady&apos;s face near Bruckner Boulevard&quot; in the Bronx.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, Amanda Morris was walking on West 23rd Street to her job at the Whole Foods in Chelsea when a stranger suddenly slashed her in the face. The slasher ran off, and workers at the Malibu Diner helped her and walked her to Whole Foods, where her supervisor contacted the police. She received stitches at Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>Later in the day, pedestrian in Midtown noticed a man who was wearing a similar jacket to the one the suspect was wearing and let a mounted police officer know. </p>

<p>Kari Bazemore, 41, was arrested, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222122511/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/07/chelsea-slashing-suspect/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that he &quot;spent [yesterday] in police lineups with potential victims.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222122511/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160107/port-morris/chelsea-slasher-attacked-me-too-bronx-woman-says">Nicole Pagliaro, 28, told DNAinfo</a> that on January 1st, while walking on Bruckner Boulevard, she noticed a man behind her, &quot;He stopped me and said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m not going to hurt you&#x2019; and then slashed my face...[He] didn&#x2019;t rob me, didn&#x2019;t go after me, didn&#x2019;t try to cut me multiple times. Just one slash and then ran off.&quot;</p>

<p>It turns out Bazemore has a history of 32 arrests, including a December 30th attack on a woman walking on 6th Avenue and 12th Street in Manhattan in which he was charged with misdemeanor assault.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222122511/http://nypost.com/2016/01/08/judge-ignored-warnings-let-slasher-loose-despite-30-arrests/">The Post, of course, blames</a> the &quot;de Blasio-appointed&quot; judge who allowed Bazemore out on December 31st:</p><blockquote>He was established as a &#x201C;high risk&#x201D; of flight &#x2014; a key factor for judges in setting bail &#x2014; by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, which evaluates all defendants before their arraignments.<p></p>

<p>The nonprofit determined Bazemore was likely to skip his next court date and &#x201C;not recommended for ROR [release on his own recognizance],&#x201D; documents state.</p>

<p>Agency reps interviewed Bazemore and gave him an abysmal score of negative-6 on his CJA assessment &#x2014; the lowest being negative-10, according to the report. He lost points for not have a working phone, not knowing anyone who could appear at his arraignment and having prior warrants.</p>

<p>Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Ashley Foote &#x2014; who asked for $1,000 bail &#x2014; also said during his arraignment that he had &#x201C;three misdemeanor convictions&#x201D; and had failed to appear in court once before.</p>

<p>She told the judge that Bazemore admitted to cops that, &#x201C;I pulled my hand out of my pocket and it landed on her face. She fell to the ground and I got scared.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Chief of Detectives Boyce said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222122511/http://abc7ny.com/news/arrest-made-in-random-chelsea-slashing;-suspect-linked-to-at-least-1-other-attack/1149516/">told reporters</a>, &quot;while the suspect has no public record of mental illness, his family members are telling detectives that he does. &apos;If you could see his actions prior to both instances, you could see a man clearly in emotional distress.&apos;&quot; <p></p>

<p>Morris, the victim in the Chelsea attack, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222122511/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/07/chelsea-slashing-suspect/"> told WCBS 2 she is focused on trying</a> to &quot;be an inspiration for people who do get hurt, that you can get past it and you can be OK, and I apparently won&#x2019;t even have scars if they heal properly, so I&#x2019;ll be fine.&quot;</p>
