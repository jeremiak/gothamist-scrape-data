										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_01_davidnewman12.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124526im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_01_davidnewman12.jpg" width="250" height="327"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> Dr. David Newman</i></div> A prominent doctor at Mt. Sinai Hospital is accused of heavily sedating a 22-year-old patient with morphine and then ejaculating on her face while she was semi-conscious. Dr. David H. Newman, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124526/http://nypost.com/2016/01/13/acclaimed-doctor-accused-of-drugging-assaulting-patient/">reportedly</a> given lectures on the importance of improving the patient-doctor bond, has not been arrested or charged.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124526/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-mount-sinai-doc-accused-ejaculating-patient-article-1.2496055">The Daily News reports</a> that the alleged incident occurred on the evening of January 11th, when the woman went to the hospital for shoulder pain. A nurse apparently gave her &quot;two pain pills and a shot for inflammation,&quot; and then morphine because the patient was still in pain. She was also asked to change into a gown for X-rays:</p><blockquote>The woman claims she removed her shirt and bra, but kept her pants on. The woman was still dressed in the gown when Dr. Newman walked into her room following the X-ray.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to give you a shot of morphine,&#x201D; the doctor told her, according to sources familiar with the woman&#x2019;s claims. The patient says she told the doctor that a nurse had already administered the drug, but she then felt a burning sensation in her arm that convinced her that Newman gave her more morphine anyway.</p>

<p>The visit turned creepy when the patient, while the doctor was examining her back, told him she felt pain on the right side of her chest. Newman started fondling her breasts, she alleged, according to sources.</p>

<p>The doctor then moved her bed away from the wall and positioned himself with his back toward the patient. The woman heard the sounds of someone masturbating &#x2014; and then felt semen on her face, she claimed. All the while, she was unable to move because she was heavily medicated, sources said.</p></blockquote>A nurse and a different physician found her, a source told the News, with the nurse unbelieving over the patient&apos;s &quot;blacked-out state.&quot; The patient was also unable to respond because she wasn&apos;t fully conscious. When she woke up, the News reports, &quot;[S]he walked into the bathroom and spotted what appeared to be semen on her face and bare chest. She told police she wiped it off with a gown, which she then placed in a plastic bag along with the bedding &#x2014; presumably to preserve as evidence.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A Post source says the NYPD Special Victims Squad wants to interview Newman about the alleged incident. Mt. Sinai said in a statement: &quot;We are aware of an allegation that has been made against one of our physicians,&#x201D; the hospital said in a statement. &#x201C;This is a matter under investigation and we are fully cooperating with the appropriate authorities. We take this matter very seriously and are conducting our own internal investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Newman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124526/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCk_vTkS6bU">has given TedTalks</a> and in 2013 he wrote an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219124526/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/opinion/at-the-er-bearing-witness-to-gun-violence.html">op-ed for the NY Times about gun violence</a>. He has reportedly been barred from seeing patients.</p>
