<p>Earlier this week, construction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220085502/http://espn.go.com/action/skateboarding/news/story?id=5025688">got started</a> on a new skate park near the 1964 World&apos;s Fair site in Flushing Meadows Corona Park.  The 16,000 square foot course, which is being built above the old Astral Fountain, will feature elements from around the city: &quot;Original Brooklyn Banks 9-stair replica rail; Union Square rail/steps Police Plaza 7-stair rail/various stairs; Ziegfeld ledge; Chrystie Park ledge; Exchange Place street gap; JFK Banks; Con Ed Banks; Pyramid ledges; Flushing Meadows Park ledge-over-the-grate replica.&quot;</p>

<p>The skate park is being created in anticipation of a skateboarding competition, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220085502/http://maloofmoneycup.com/">Maloof Money Cup </a>that will take place June 5 and 6. The Maloof Money Cup donated the park through the NYC Parks &amp; Recreation Department&apos;s Adopt-a-Park program, and Joe Maloof, whose family owns the Sacramento Kings basketball team, said, &quot;New York was first on our list of expansion markets because its the headquarters for skateboarding on the East Coast and is home to some of the most iconic skate spots in the world. With the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220085502/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/10/plans_for_brooklyn_banks.php">Brooklyn Banks now closed</a> for four years and the Unisphere set to close indefinitely, the timing was perfect for us to bring the Maloof Money Cup to New York City.&quot;  </p>
