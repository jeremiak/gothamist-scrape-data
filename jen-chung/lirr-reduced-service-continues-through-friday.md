For today&apos;s service, 22 trains were canceled or diverted, and the transit agency had been hoping that would be it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512233822/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/11/more-delays-wednesday-for-lirr-riders-as-amtrak-continues-rail-repairs/">LIRR president Helena Williams said</a>, &quot;I am disappointed that Amtrak was not able to complete their repair work in time to meet the goal of returning to normal service by Thursday.&quot;<p></p>

<p>On Sunday, an Amtrak train derailed in an East River tunnel.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512233822/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/officials-lirr-woes-through-friday-1.2867141">Newsday reports</a> the &quot;five-car train, which carried no passengers when it derailed while going 60 mph, was not cleared out of the tunnel until Monday evening.&quot; Amtrak had hoped to start clearing the train earlier, but the narrow tunnel&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512233822/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/10/lirr_hell_continues_today_through_a.php">it&apos;s only 23 feet wide</a>&#x2014;has hampered their efforts. So far, Amtrak has replaced 160 of the 275 wooden rail ties damaged. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512233822/http://mta.info/news/stories/?story=251">The MTA says</a>,  &quot;The LIRR expects that AM and PM rush hour service will be significantly affected through Thursday, May 12. However, the ability of LIRR to restore full service on Friday morning is directly dependent on the progress of Amtrak&apos;s repairs. The LIRR is in constant communication with Amtrak and is assessing Amtrak&apos;s ability to meet the deadline to restore full service.&quot; In other words, stop blaming us!</p>
