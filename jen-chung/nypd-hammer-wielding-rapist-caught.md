<p>Last week, the police alerted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120425070746/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/video_hammer-wielding_rapist_wanted.php">public to a man who had allegedly raped </a>a woman in Bed-Stuy and then allegedly attempted to rape another woman while threatening them with a hammer.  Now police say they have caught the suspect, 19-year-old Anthony Moore of Queens.</p>

<p>In the first attack, on April 9, at around 12:40 a.m., the suspect approached an 18-year-old in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120425070746/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_081.shtml">vicinity of the 81st Precinct</a> around 12:40 a.m., brandished his tool and threatened her with it unless she went down on him. The suspect allegedly then forced the woman into an alley where he raped her before fleeing.  Then, around 11 a.m., the same suspect apparently followed a 22-year-old woman into her apartment building (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120425070746/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_073.shtml">in the 73rd Precinct</a>), armed with a hammer, and attempted to rape her, too. However, the victim fought back and the suspect fled. Here&apos;s surveillance video from the second attack:</p>
