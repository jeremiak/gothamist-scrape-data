<p>It&apos;s that time of year again, when kids are in school, the air turns crisp and heads of state from all over the world flock to New York for the United Nations General Assembly.  With about 130 heads of state&#x2014;including President Barack Obama&#x2014;the NYPD has to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164933/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/09/19/un-general-assembly-means-frozen-zones-traffic-headaches/">coordinate 220 motorcades</a>.  Hey, Anonymous, maybe you can plan a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164933/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/18/photos_anonymouss_occupation_of_wal.php#photo-1">surge at Wall Street</a>!</p>

<p>Residents near the U.N. are annoyed that the world organization has to ruin everything for them, since their neighborhood is essentially sealed off (First Avenue is closed off to traffic between 42nd and 47th Streets).  One tells WCBS 2, &quot;It goes from sublime to ridiculous. I&#x2019;m already irritated, and this is costing us a fortune... It&#x2019;s really obnoxious. It&#x2019;s overkill,&quot; but another one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164933/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8358855">took the longview with WABC 7</a>, &quot;For two weeks of the year, we live in the safest neighborhood in the whole world. So that&apos;s a nice feature of it. You can&apos;t have that safety every day, but nice to have it for at least two weeks.&quot;</p>
