</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ve long known that Jesus Christ is solidly part of the the 99% (at least, that&apos;s what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130407/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2011/10/signs-of-the-times.html">a sign told us</a>) but it was still a nice belated Easter surprise to see him at today&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130407/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayday">May Day disruption</a> after his exhausting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130407/http://sfist.com/2012/04/09/from_san_francisco_to_andrew_sulliv.php#photo-1">time in San Francisco</a>. Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130407/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/01/tom_morello_joins_occupy_protesters.php#photo-1">south of Union Square</a>, J.C. was spotted with his cross.  </p>

<p>Clearly, he&apos;s just burning time before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130407/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_of_Jesus">his ascension</a>. But if we&apos;ve learned anything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130407/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar#Musical_numbers"><em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em></a>, he&apos;s got plenty of disciples with his highway to Heaven on Their Minds. (Forgive us, LORD.)</p>
