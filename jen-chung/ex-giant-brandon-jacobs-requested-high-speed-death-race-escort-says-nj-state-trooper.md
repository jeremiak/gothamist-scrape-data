<p>Now the NJ State Police scandal involving troopers who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523025026/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/23/nj_state_police_under_fire_for_esco.php">escorted caravans of luxury cars at extremely high speeds</a> (100-120 mph) has now claimed its first victims.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523025026/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/second_state_trooper_suspended.html">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, the state police &quot;suspended two troopers without pay and reassigned a station commander as the investigation into an unauthorized, high-speed escort of sports cars to Atlantic City last month kicked into high gear.&quot; And one trooper is saying car fiend and former Giants player Brandon Jacobs asked for the escort.</p>

<p>A lawyer for Sgt. 1st Class Nadir Nassry, 47, Charles Sciarra, said, &quot;I think that the powers that be have reacted to media coverage as opposed to facts,&quot; regarding the NJ Attorney General&apos;s investigation and the suspensions.  He added, &quot;This investigation was going on for two or three weeks and nothing changed but the appearance of headlines that people are now reacting to.&quot;  The Star-Ledger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523025026/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/nj_attorney_generals_office_in.html">reported on the story on Sunday</a>, after two witnesses filed a complaint about a March 30 caravan on the Garden State parkway: &quot;They said many drivers struggled to get out of the way of the caravan, including one older driver who panicked and almost wound up in a ditch.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked about the incident, Governor Chris Christie said he didn&apos;t think the State Police Superintendent Richard Fuentes knew about the incident but that Fuentes would take care of it, &quot;Leadership isn&#x2019;t about getting it perfect. Leadership is about when you see a problem fixing it,&quot; and mused about the weird scandal, &quot;You don&#x2019;t wake up in the morning and say maybe what will happen today is we&#x2019;ll have state troopers leading Lamborghinis and Porsches down the Parkway at 110 miles per hour and then block intersections for them so they won&#x2019;t have to wait for lights.&quot;</p>

<p>Sciarra also says that Jacobs and his client knew each other from charity events and says that Jacobs asked for the escort.  But that doesn&apos;t mean a state employee <em>has to give</em> an escort!  So think about that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523025026/http://www.chp.ca.gov/">CHiPs</a>.</p>
