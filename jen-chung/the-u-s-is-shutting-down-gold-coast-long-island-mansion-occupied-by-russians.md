<p>The New York-based Russian intelligence compound that President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/29/obama_issues_sanctions_against_russ.php">ordered to be shut down in the wake</a> of the Democratic National Committee hacking incident turns out to be a sprawling mansion in Glen Cove, Long Island, which was built for George duPont Pratt of the Standard Oil and Pratt Institute Pratts.</p>

<p>Many residents of the ritzy North Shore town had no idea that the estate, called Killenworth, has actually been a &quot;longtime getaway for Russian diplomats [that] was also used for Russian intelligence purposes, according to U.S. government officials,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Russian-Compound-Shut-Down-Glen-Cove-Long-Island-Obama-Sanctions-Election-Hacking-408700605.html">reports NBC New York</a>, which spoke to some of the neighbors. </p>

<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t even really know. It&apos;s kinda really scary, in your own backyard,&quot; one local said. Another was privy to it, saying, &quot;Ever since the late &apos;70s, that&apos;s when I knew about it... Never seen any activity there. Gates open, gates close, and that&apos;s it.&quot;</p>

<p>The mansion, which was built in 1912 (winning &quot;best country home&quot; design honors from the American Institute of Architects), was bought by the Soviet Union as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/29/the-luxurious-45-acre-compound-in-maryland-being-shut-down-for-alleged-russian-espionage/?utm_term=.5e0d31b75b17">weekend home for the delegation</a> to the United Nations. There&apos;s even an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://www.oldlongisland.com/2009/02/faces-of-old-long-island.html">old LIFE magazine photograph of Nikita Khrushchev</a> on the grounds.<br>
 <br>
However, because the home has been used for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/03/26/page/8/article/united-nations-life-one-of-privilege">diplomatic purposes</a>, Glen Cove has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/08/nyregion/russians-long-a-thorny-issue.html">never been able to collect taxes</a> on the 14-acre estate. </p>

<p>Then, in the 1980s, United Press International noted that it was believed Killenworth was a base for Soviet spying on Long Island&apos;s defense industry; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://abcnews.go.com/US/russian-compounds-nestled-york-washington-dc-suburbs/story?id=44457023">from ABC News</a>:</p><blockquote>According to UPI, this touched off a battle between the city of Glen Cove, the Russians and the U.S. federal government. The Soviets, in turn, refused to allow American diplomatic personnel there to use a beach outside Moscow, the report said.<p></p>

<p>For two years, the Soviets were banned from using the city of Glen Cove&apos;s beaches, golf courses and tennis courts in response to those reports, UPI reported.</p>

<p>&quot;This estate is a listening post for the Soviet Union but our government is aware of that fact and chooses to ignore it,&quot; the mayor, Alan Parente, said at the time, according to UPI. &quot;If it is used for spying, this residence is not entitled to tax exemption.&quot;</p></blockquote>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/us/politics/russia-spy-compounds-maryland-long-island.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">the NY Times says</a>, &quot;The estate is often nearly empty, according to law enforcement officials, inhabited year-round by just a few Russian caretakers. Protected by a chain-link fence, the mansion has stone peaks that poke into the sky. Thick brush obstructs the view of the bottom half of the house. Angelina Izzo, who works as a receptionist at a health care center next to the estate, said the mansion was &apos;very quiet.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>Killenworth is located on Dosoris Lane. If the street sounds familiar to movie buffs, it should: It&apos;s where the Larrabees and Sabrina Fairchild lived:</p>

<p>And a 1959 spy thrilled featured a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://www.scoutingny.com/the-filming-locations-of-north-by-northwest-part-2-new-york-youve-changed/">mysterious Glen Cove mansion</a>&#x2014;<em>North by Northwest</em>, which filmed at George duPont Pratt&apos;s brother&apos;s estate, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043428/http://www.glencovemansion.com/about-us/history/">The Manor</a>. Guess screenwriter Ernest Lehman knew what was up.</p>
