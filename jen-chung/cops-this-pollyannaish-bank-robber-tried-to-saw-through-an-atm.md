<p>Sometimes thieves will just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013700/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/video_thieves_steal_atm_from_jackso.php">steal an entire ATM</a>; on other occasions they&apos;ll try to liberate the money on the spot, by any means necessary. Like this optimistic individual, who apparently used a saw. Laugh if you must, but if it worked he would have been heralded as a genius for revolutionizing ATM robberies.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, yesterday morning Berkshire Bank in Borough Park called the cops about a burglary. Investigators say a man &quot;entered the Berkshire Bank at 0008 hours and attempted to break into an ATM machine [<em>ohhhh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013700/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">sic</a>!</em>] by using a saw. He did not remove any money from the location.&quot; So apparently ATMs are saw-proof? They&apos;ve really thought of everything.<br>
 <br>
The suspect is described as a man about 35-40 years old, 5&apos;8&quot; to 5&apos;10&quot; tall and 180 pounds. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
