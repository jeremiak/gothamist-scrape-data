                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_spitzerpetitioners.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820142643im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_spitzerpetitioners.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i>Three Spitzer canvassers (Azi Paybarah/Capital New York)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Sure, Eliot Spitzer is paying registered Democrats who have some spare time on their hands <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820142643/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/spitzer_will_pay_you_800day_to_coll.php">$800 a day to gather signatures</a> for his NYC Comptroller ballot petition. But that doesn&apos;t mean these folks want to, you know, talk about what they are doing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820142643/http://politicker.com/2013/07/eliot-spitzers-signature-scramble-shows-some-weaknesses/">Politicker spotted</a> a few at West 66th and Broadway: &quot;When asked about her petitioning, a female Spitzer staffer reluctantly said she had been on the job for a couple of hours and estimated having collected about 25 signatures. A male counterpart refused to comment.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820142643/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/07/8531740/please-dont-stare-spitzer-petitioning-operation">Capital New York&apos;s Azi Paybarah</a> tried to talk to some petitioners on the Upper East Side:</p><blockquote>I went over to 86th Street and Lexington, a regular petitioning spot for New York campaigns. At 8:06 p.m., I found two young men and one woman with clipboards and white sheets of paper, and round, blue Spitzer stickers. Two of them had white, square stickers with names on them: Allan and Angelina. The third person, a young man in a black shirt, did not have a name tag.<p></p>

<p>They were on the northwest corner of the intersection.</p>

<p>When I approached, Allan asked if I wanted to sign. I said no and identified myself as a reporter, showed my credential, and asked if I could talk with them.</p>

<p>All three said no and walked away.</p>

<p>When I asked why, Allan asked, &quot;Why what?&quot;</p>

<p>Why not talk to me, I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Just the way it is, man. It is what it is. No comment,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote>Paybarah followed them for a while, which apparently made Allan nervous enough to perhaps make up a story about his phone being dead and needing to call his mom&#x2014;so he asked Paybarah to use his phone: &quot;I said yes and asked what number he needed to call. He gave me the number and I dialed it. It went to a voicemail message that sounded exactly like Allan&apos;s voice.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Spitzer needs to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820142643/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/best_photo_of_nyc_2013_candidate_wi.php">get 3,750 valid signatures</a> of NYC Democrats so he can make the ballot. He only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820142643/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/07/ho_yes_client_no_9_is_back_eliot_sp.php">decided to run for Comptroller on Sunday</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820142643/https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/354417559291969537">after feeding the cows</a> or something.</p>
