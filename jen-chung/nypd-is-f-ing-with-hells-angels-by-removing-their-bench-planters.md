<p>The police made an unwelcome visit to the Hells Angels headquarters in the East Village yesterday, days after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/12/man_shot_after_moving_traffic_cone.php">man was allegedly shot by a Hells Angel associate</a>, taking the club&apos;s sidewalk planters, a ramp and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/08/hells_angels_bench.php">their beloved bench</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/hells-angels-refusing-to-help-cops-with-shooting-investigation/">A police source told the Post</a>, &quot;It was done just to f-k with them. They&#x2019;re not cooperating with the investigation. If they&#x2019;re gonna give us a hard time, we&#x2019;re gonna give them a hard time.&quot;</p>

<p>Dozens of officers descended on 77 East Third Street: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161213/east-village/hells-angels-biker-club-ecb-summons-issued-street-obstruction">DNAinfo called it a &quot;raid&quot;</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-grab-hells-angels-bench-ramp-days-shooting-article-1.2909633?utm_content=bufferab9d4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Cops armed with an Environmental Control Board Summons carried out a visual inspection outside of the property.&quot; </p>

<p>The shooting occurred outside the building early Sunday morning: A passenger in a Mercedes, David Martinez, exited a vehicle to move one of the traffic cones outside the Hells Angels clubhouse (the cones were claiming spaces for motorcycles) because a livery cab was blocking his way. A Hells Angels member allegedly objected, and this escalated into an &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/2-dead-6-wounded-mayhem-bronx-brooklyn-article-1.2907418">all-out brawl</a>&quot; between the Hells Angels and Martinez and his friends. </p>

<p>Martinez was shot in the stomach and taken to the hospital by his friend. Police think the shooter was a Hells Angels prospect.</p>

<p>On Monday, the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/hells-angels-members-are-literally-crying-over-parking-spot/">removed the traffic cones</a> from both sides of East 3rd Street&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/hells-angels-members-are-literally-crying-over-parking-spot/">according to the Post</a>, this &quot;prompt[ed] a female Hells Angels&#x2019; biker to start to cry and a male member to scream, &apos;It&#x2019;s harassment! This is harassment!&apos;&quot; (A biker also allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/hells-angels-refusing-to-help-cops-with-shooting-investigation/">nearly ran over</a> the Post&apos;s photographer.)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Hells Angels received summonses for the planters (blocking the sidewalk) and for &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012922/http://nypost.com/2016/12/14/all-out-war-brewing-between-hells-angels-nypd/">failing to display license plates on motorcycles</a>.&quot;</p>
