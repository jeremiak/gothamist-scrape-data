					<p>Members of Congress managed to agree on a spending bill&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501204734/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/30/budget-deal-congress-shutdown-237822">price tag is more than $1 trillion</a>&#x2014;that includes $1.5 billion in new border security <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501204734/https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-01/congress-strikes-tentative-deal-on-1-1-trillion-spending-bill">but not an actual wall</a>, plus $15 billion more for the Pentagon. Also tucked in there: $68 million for New York City and other municipalities for security costs related to protecting Donald Trump.</p>

<p>About $27 million is for costs between the election and the inauguration, and $40 million is for expenses when Trump has officially been president. The actual breakdown is still to come, but NYC will get most of the funds. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, whose district includes Trump Tower, said in a statement, &quot;I&apos;m very pleased that this budget agreement ensures that New York City taxpayers will be fully reimbursed for the costs to protect then-President elect Trump and his family and that future costs will be covered as the NYPD and FDNY continue to protect Trump Tower. This is the right and fair thing to do.<br>
 <br>
&quot;It is ridiculous to expect local law enforcement, like the NYPD and FDNY, to bear the extraordinary and ongoing costs of protecting the President of the United States. That is clearly a national security concern and paying for it should be federal responsibility. This budget agreement ensures the federal government meets this responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501204734/http://nypost.com/2017/05/01/spending-deal-gives-millions-to-nypd-for-protecting-trump-and-family/">Rep. Nita Lowey told the NY Post</a>, &quot;I am very pleased New York taxpayers will not be on the hook for these critical and necessary expenses.&quot;</p>

<p>Last week, President Trump told Fox News that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501204734/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/29/donald_trump_feels_guilty_about_mil.php">he felt &quot;guilty&quot; about coming to NYC</a> because of how much money it takes to protect him here. (The NYPD has estimated that when Trump is in town, security costs $308,000 per day, while it&apos;s around $127,000-145,000 for First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump.) </p>

<p>Trump is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501204734/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/26/president_trump_nyc_visit.php">returning to NYC for the first time as President</a> on Thursday for an event with the Australian prime minister at the Intrepid. It&apos;s unclear if he will spend the night in Trump Tower. <br>
