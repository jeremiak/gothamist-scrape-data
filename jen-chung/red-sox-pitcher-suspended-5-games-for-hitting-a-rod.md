<p>Two days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821004220/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/suddenly_kinda_sympathetic_a-rod_ge.php">hitting Alex Rodriguez with a pitch</a>, Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster was suspended for five games. Major League Baseball issued the following press release:</p><blockquote>Pitcher Ryan Dempster of the Boston Red Sox has received a five-game suspension and an undisclosed fine for intentionally throwing at and hitting Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees with a pitch in the top of the second inning of Sunday night&apos;s game at Fenway Park. Joe Garagiola, Jr., Senior Vice President of Standards &amp; Operations for Major League Baseball, made the announcement.<p></p>

<p>Unless appealed, Dempster&apos;s suspension is scheduled to begin tonight, when the Red Sox are to continue their road series at San Francisco. If appealed, Dempster&apos;s suspension will be held in abeyance until the process is complete.</p>

<p>In addition, Yankees manager Joe Girardi has received an undisclosed fine for his argument with Umpire Brian O&apos;Nora.</p></blockquote>Girardi was livid after Rodriguez was hit&#x2014;Dempster&apos;s earlier pitches ended up behind A-Rod&apos;s knees and on the inside before his 3-0 pitch hit Rodriguez in the elbow pad. <p></p>

<p>Girardi said today before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821004220/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/20/report-ryan-dempster-almost-certain-to-be-suspended-for-hitting-a-rod/">Dempster&apos;s suspension was announced</a>, &quot;That baseball is a weapon. It&#x2019;s not a tennis ball. &#x2026; It&#x2019;s a weapon, and it can do a lot of damage to someone&#x2019;s life. And that&#x2019;s why I was so upset about it. You can express your opinion and be upset with someone, but you just can&#x2019;t start throwing baseballs at people. I mean, it&#x2019;s scary,&quot; adding that if Dempster wasn&apos;t punished, then it would be &quot;open season for people, and that can&#x2019;t happen. It&#x2019;s not fair.&quot;</p>

<p>Dempster has denied deliberately aiming at Rodriguez, but, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821004220/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/08/20/ryan-dempster-suspended-alex-rodriguez-mlb/2676575/">per USA Today</a>, &quot;It was the first time in Dempster&apos;s 16-year career, according to the Boston Herald, that Dempster hit a batter on a 3-and-0 count.&quot; Boston.com&apos;s Chad Finn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821004220/http://www.boston.com/sports/touching_all_the_bases/2013/08/ryan_dempsters_decision_to_hit_a-rod_was_foolish_and_worse_c.html">bemoaned Dempster</a>, &quot;He shouldn&apos;t have been thinking about being the PED Avenger; he should have been thinking about getting his fourth out of the ballgame.&quot;</p>
