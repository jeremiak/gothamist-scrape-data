<p>A necropsy performed on a Great Dane-labrador mix that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/07/dog_death_central_park.php">died during a walk in Central Park</a> apparently revealed that the dog had an enlarged heart.</p>

<p>The dog&apos;s owner, David Burke, had let Duke off-leash in Central Park, near 110th Street and Central Park West, around 11 p.m. (dogs are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/park-information/dogs.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/">allowed off-leash in certain areas</a> between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.) when the 90-pound canine collapsed. When Burke caught up with him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://nypost.com/2015/10/07/my-dog-was-shot-in-the-head-in-central-park-man-tells-cops/">the Post reports</a> that he yelled &quot;Are you okay? Are you okay?&quot; and found Duke &quot;convulsing&quot; with a &quot;single puncture wound to his skull, cops said.&quot;</p>

<p>Burke called his vet and then 911, reporting that Duke had been shot, but later said he did not hear gunshots. He also called his 15-year-old daughter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://nypost.com/2015/10/07/my-dog-was-shot-in-the-head-in-central-park-man-tells-cops/">who was seen</a> comforting her father and Duke. </p>

<p>&quot;It looks like it may be natural causes,&#x201D; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/nyregion/rescue-dogs-death-in-central-park-baffles-owner-and-police.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the NY Times</a>, adding that the puncture wounds to the dog&#x2019;s head &quot;appeared superficial and did not penetrate its skull.&quot;</p>

<p>According to one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://www.petcarerx.com/article/4-dangers-of-an-enlarged-heart-in-dogs/1566">pet care website</a>, &quot;an enlarged heart in dogs develops when the heart&#x2019;s muscles weaken, causing pressure in the heart&#x2019;s blood vessels to increase and, in turn, stretching the muscles. Valvular defects, heartbeat abnormalities, tumors, and heartworms can all be behind the initial weakening of the muscles.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/nyregion/rescue-dogs-death-in-central-park-baffles-owner-and-police.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the Times</a>, Duke had been abandoned on the side of the Moshulu Parkway in the Bronx and was 40 pounds when Burke saw him at a Manhattan animal shelter four years ago:</p><blockquote>For Mr. Burke, it was the second tragedy in just a few days: On Saturday, his wife, Eileen, died at home from pancreatic cancer after being sick for three years. It was Eileen, he said, who had taken a particular liking to Duke at the pound.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;She fell in love with him at first sight,&#x201D; Mr. Burke said.</p></blockquote>The investigation into Duke&apos;s death is continuing, but the necropsy indicates that he had an enlarged heart. A police source told the Times, &quot;It looks like it may be natural causes.&quot; The wound on his head &quot;appeared superficial,&quot; and probably occurred when Duke fell.<p></p>

<p>Burke said that Duke was a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322025614/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/nyregion/rescue-dogs-death-in-central-park-baffles-owner-and-police.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">magnificent, gentle and intuitive animal.</a>&quot;</p>
