										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_mayrb.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522120113im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_mayrb.jpg" width="200" height="244" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, after the Daily News reported that NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522120113/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/26/nyc_murder_rate_higher_in_2010_vers.php">crime rates for murders and shootings have increased</a> 22.8% and 16.3%, respectively, in the last year, Mayor Bloomberg took up the topic during John Gambling&apos;s radio show.  And guess what&#x2014;he says that it&apos;s totally due to the decreasing number of cops due to budget cuts!  Bloomberg said, &quot;It is worrisome.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522120113/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/murder_surge_spurs_cop_alarm_4aaetuk6JOmHwHnrAbmG1K">He added</a>, &quot;[Police] Commissioner [Ray] Kelly and I talked at length about it. We have fewer police officers than we did before. More cops always helps.&quot;  But the Post reports that Bloomberg admitted that crime is &quot;still very low&quot; compared to, say, &quot;1990, when murders hit an annual record of 2,245.&quot;  (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522120113/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/03/26/2010-03-26_mayor_bloomberg_blames_spike_in_murders_in_2010_on_budget_cuts_that_puts_fewer_c.html">Daily News points out</a> that last December, Bloomberg said of the city&apos;s lowest murder rate on record while the NYPD had fewer resources, &quot;All of the experts said it couldn&apos;t be done, particularly in a down economy, but we&apos;ve done it.&quot;)</p>

<p>The city&apos;s latest budget might mean shedding about 2,000 cops, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522120113/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/12/budget_cuts_could_shrink_nypd_to_it.php">bringing the total to 32,817</a> (it&apos;s now currently at around 35,000; in 2000, there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522120113/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/nypd_budget_cuts_could_bring_back_9.php">were over 40,000 cops</a>).  Kelly said, &quot;It&apos;s not going to particularly help the situation to go down another 2,000 officers.&quot;  Something else that won&apos;t help?  Possible state cuts,  which would mean another 3,150 cops could be laid off.  </p>
