<p>It turns out there were three anti-gay attacks in Manhattan last week: Besides the May 5 assault near Madison Square Garden (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153644/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/video_knicks_fans_wanted_for_questi.php">apparently by sore Knicks fans</a>) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153644/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/midtown_manhattan_gay_bashing_two_v.php">May 10 incident</a> near the 33rd Street PATH station, now police are reportedly investigating a May 8 attack on Christopher Street. In this incident, a man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153644/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9101295">called gay slurs</a> before being beaten and chased.</p>

<p>The victim, 35, had left <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153644/http://www.piecesbar.com/">Pieces Bar</a> at 8 Christopher Street at 1:45 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153644/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cops_probing_new_bias_attack_near_ty4H61v1BZ5Gsf300f2zKO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">According to the Post</a>, he was &quot;trying to hail a cab near Avenue of The Americas when he heard someone say, &apos;f--k you,&apos; according to a police source. An assailant then hit him several times in the head and his body, and he was chased by two other goons, sources said. One called him a &apos;f----t.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The attackers fled. The victim was reportedly not seriously injured. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who represents the area, had said last week, &quot;I am outraged by this string of assaults. These vicious assaults are not reflective of the diversity that defines New York City. Our city prides itself on its inclusiveness, and hateful slurs and physical attacks against anyone, for any reason, go against the very fabric of what makes our City great.&quot;</p>
