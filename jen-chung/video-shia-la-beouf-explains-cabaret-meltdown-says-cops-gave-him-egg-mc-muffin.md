<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012715/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/10/shia_labeouf_pleads_guilty_to_being.php">Admitted <em>Cabaret</em>-hole Shia LaBeouf</a> finally told his side of what happened when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012715/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/26/shia_labeouf_reportedly_arrested_es.php">caused a commotion at the Broadway musical</a> and ended up getting arrested (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012715/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/27/shia_labeouf_allegedly_called_cop_a.php">spitting at cops</a>) on June 26th.  While on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> last night, the actor explained he had just been in Ireland, drinking whiskey, so he basically continued to drink whiskey while watching the World Cup and while at <em>Cabaret</em> (three double whiskeys, apparently). </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012715/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/28/then_10_weirdest_parts_of_shia_labe.php">homeless man that he was chasing Times Square</a>? LaBeouf says he had been talking to him, but then a woman taking photographs scared him off, so LaBeouf chased him around to calm him down. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012715/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-tells-cabaret-arrest-story-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-watch-20141410">Then, LaBeouf said</a>, &quot;I go back to the bar, pay my bill, and this dude comes up and says he&apos;s a big fan. He says, &apos;What you doing tonight?&apos; and I say, &apos;I&apos;m looking to turn it up a bit, trying to have a good time, what&apos;s going on?&apos; He says, &apos;Why don&apos;t you come to my show, I&apos;m a dancer in this Cabaret show.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>LaBeouf explained that he was confused by <em>Cabaret</em>&apos;s Kit Kat Club setting, where there are also cafe tables in addition to seats. He started drinking and bought two double whiskeys for two other woman at his table who refused them (so he had them). Then when he saw <em>Cabaret</em> star Alan Cumming smoking a cigarette, LaBeouf thought that meant he could smoke too. He also felt that Cumming was flirting with him, so that&apos;s why he grabbed Cumming&apos;s ass.</p>

<p>Then, at the police station, LaBeouf says he started to rip his shirt off and do push-ups to act tough because there were six other men being held in the cell, &quot;[One] is like, &apos;What are you in here for?&apos; And I&apos;m like, &apos;Cabaret, homie.&apos;&quot; He decided to start spitting at cops and the cops put him in his own cell for 25 hours, &quot;Then they gave me a McDonald&apos;s egg sandwich.&quot; Guess he blacked out the part where he was allegedly yelling &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;; &quot;F-k you. I&#x2019;ll f-k you up!&quot;; callig a cop a&quot;f-g&quot;; and bragging, &quot;I have millions and millions of dollars and attorneys. I&#x2019;m going to ruin your career.&quot; </p>

<p>Last month, he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for his behavior. LaBeouf told Kimmel, &quot;I&apos;m gonna stay away from Broadway for a little bit.&quot;</p>
