We don&apos;t know if she&apos;s out there crying for help. We don&apos;t know if she&apos;s being held against their will. We don&apos;t know anything. As parents, we just want our daughter home safely.&quot;</p>

<p>Police found that her credit card had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516023636/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Sabrina-Malone-Missing-Brooklyn-Woman-Found-Washington-DC-206870621.html">been used at Union Station in D.C.</a> Her mother told NBC New York that she&apos;s &quot;thrilled&quot; and is on her way to pick her daughter up.</p>
