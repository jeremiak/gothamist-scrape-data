<p>David Letterman, who has intimate experience with how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173245/http://www.amazon.com/Late-Shift-Letterman-Network-Battle/dp/0786880899">NBC sucks at late night transitions</a>, weighed in on news that Jimmy Fallon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173245/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/nbc_will_announce_jimmy_fallon_as_t.php">will in fact replace Jay Leno</a> as the new host of The Tonight Show. Letterman said in his monologue, &quot;How many of you folks earlier today saw the white smoke coming out of the chimney at NBC, anybody see that? We have a new pope.&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously, this was show biz deja vu, since Conan O&apos;Brien <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173245/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/21/conan_says_farewell_as_he_late_shif.php">replaced Jay Leno as Tonight Show host </a>in 2009&#x2014;only to be ousted and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173245/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/10/nbc_confirms_lenos_back_to_late-nig.php">replaced by Leno in 2010</a>. Letterman noted that, saying, &quot;Didn&apos;t we just go through this? Jay Leno now is being replaced, and this is the second time this has happened. I mean, it&#x2019;s crazy. He&#x2019;s being replaced by a younger late-night talk show host&#x2014;what could possibly go wrong? Honestly. They had pretty good luck with this in the past.&#x201D;&quot; He added, &quot;NBC announced his official date of departure... no word on his official date of return.&quot;</p>

<p>The CBS late night host acknowledged Leno&apos;s reign as #1 late night talk show host and how he will be going out on top, &quot;Congratulations to Jay, a job well done&#x2014;how many times can the guy be pushed out of the job? What&apos;s the matter with NBC? What are they thinking?&quot; He asked Paul Schaefer is NBC could push him out of his job, and Schaefer said it seems like they do what they want.</p>

<p>Letterman told the audience he&apos;s known Leno for 38 years, &quot;Good luck to Jay, I know he&apos;ll be out on the road, taking care of business.. Congratulations on a nice long run on the Tonight Show if in fact if you&apos;re not coming back.&quot;</p>

<p>Leno mentioned the news in his monologue, &quot;Folks, I got to be honest with you, I had a really awkward day today. I had to call David Letterman and tell him he didn&#x2019;t get the Tonight Show again. Awful! Terrible!&quot; He congratulated Fallon, &quot;He&#x2019;s a hell of a guy! He&#x2019;s going to do a great job!&quot; and said, &quot;We&#x2019;ve all fought, kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place, now we have to keep it there! Jimmy, don&#x2019;t let it slip into sixth! We are counting on you.&quot;</p>

<p>In last night&apos;s Late Night, Jimmy Fallon acknowledged the news and thanked his audience, crew and the Roots:</p>

<p>And O&apos;Brien congratulated Fallon&#x2026; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173245/http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/conan-fallon-leno-kimmel.html">but didn&apos;t mention Leno</a>.</p>
