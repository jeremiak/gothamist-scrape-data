Latia Harris, 25, was charged with aggravated assault and two counts of making terroristic threat.<p></p>

<p>The video was distressing for a number of reasons: Besides showing the beating of Catherine Ferreira, who was punched and kicked, Ferreira&apos;s son tries to stop his mother&apos;s attacker and cries out for the beating to stop. Then there are onlookers who watch the beating and don&apos;t stop it. Ferreira, though, forgave them, &quot;I really want to make this clear &#x2014; I don&apos;t want people to see them as monsters. They didn&apos;t really see that this was more serious than just a fight.&quot;</p>

<p>Ferreira, who said that she used to work with Harris at the McDonald&apos;s in Salem, NJ believes that Harris was upset because she joked about Harris being involved with another worker. (Harris was worried about losing her job.) Ferreira is 4&apos;9&quot; and 100 pounds; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706122645/http://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/2014/06/salem_video_beating_victim_says_she_feared_for_her_life_and_her_2-year-old.html">she said</a>, &quot;I thought she may have been capable of hitting my son. I mean, her size versus my size &#x2014; she could have killed me.&quot; Harris allegedly followed Ferreira behind the McDonald&apos;s and confronted her.</p>

<p>Ferreira managed to get help from a nearby apartment complex. She has  limited vision in her left eye, numerous contusions and a broken nose.</p>

<p>The authorities had been looking for Harris since last week. Yesterday, Salem Police Chief John Pelura III said, &quot;I believe Harris had no other choice than to turn herself in under her own terms as it would only be a matter of time before she was captured.&quot;</p>

Authorities will not charge witnesses who filmed and observed the beating. And the owner of the McDonald&apos;s said, &quot;I am aware of the incident involving one of my employees earlier this week. I am extremely disturbed by this kind of behavior and it goes against the values and standards that I expect from my employees in my restaurants. This employee will not be serving customers pending this important police investigation and I&apos;m fully cooperating with the local police in this matter.&quot;</p>
