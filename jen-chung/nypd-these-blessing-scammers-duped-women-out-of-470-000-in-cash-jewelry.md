<p>A group of female grifters are targeting Asian women and claiming they are &quot;cursed&quot; in order to have them hand over thousands of dollars, police say. </p>

<p>The five suspects are running what&apos;s known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015809/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/03/evil_spirit_cleansing_scammer_arres.php">&quot;Chinese blessing scam&quot;</a> in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. For these specific incidents, the NYPD says, &quot;The victims are approached by three of the five women who state that the victim&apos;s families have been cursed. The victims are instructed to bring all of their jewelry and money in a bag to the women who will perform a blessing ritual to reverse the curse. Only once the bag is returned to the victims do they discover that their money and valuables have been replaced by bottles of water.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a rundown of the incidents from the NYPD:</p>

<p>Incident #1 - At approximately 11:15 a.m. on Monday, April 18th, jewelry (unknown value) and $280,000 was taken from a 55-year-old woman in front of 191 Grand Street.</p>

<p>Three years ago, Sam Tsang, an NYPD Asian community liaison, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015809/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/exclusive-chinese-blessing-scam-rocks-brooklyn-asian-enclaves-article-1.1324365">explained to the Daily News</a>, &quot;These people go into coffee shops and listen to people&#x2019;s business and see what problems you have... Then they ask for cash to help the family members. They say they have special powers&#x201D; and if victims brush them off &#x201C;they say you or your family member will get ill.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The victims are usually immigrants who don&apos;t speak English. </p>

<p>Photographs of three of the alleged scammers have been released.
