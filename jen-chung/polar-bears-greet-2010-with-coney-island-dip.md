</div></div>					<p>Decked in swimsuits, swim trunks, bikinis and costumes, about a thousand folks joined the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701172354/http://www.polarbearclub.org/">Coney Island Polar Bear Swim Club</a> for its annual New Year&apos;s Day swim in the Atlantic Ocean.  The group&apos;s president<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701172354/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/01/02/2010-01-02_polar_bears_have_ice_day.html"> told the Daily News</a> it was their biggest turnout ever, thanks to a water temperature of 44 degrees.</p>

<p>One participant proclaimed, &quot;The cold water definitely cures a hangover. This event brings out all the nut cases in the city to come together and strip down. Where else can you wear a bikini, a Russian fur hat and a leopard print bathrobe and run into freezing water with a screaming crowd? I love it.&quot;</p>
