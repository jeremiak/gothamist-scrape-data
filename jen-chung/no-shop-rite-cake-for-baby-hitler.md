A NJ family is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103958/http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/today/index.ssf/2008/12/holland_township_family_angry.html">upset that ShopRite refused to personalize</a> a cake with &quot;Happy Birthday Adolf Hitler.&quot;  The boy&apos;s father, Heath Campbell, a &quot;Nazi fan&quot; (his other kids are JoyceLynn Aryan Nation and Honszlyn Hinler Jeannie) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103958/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2008/12/16/2008-12-16_happy_birthday_adolf_hitler_boy_with_naz.html">Holocaust denier</a> who decorates his home with swastikas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103958/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12172008/news/regionalnews/sick_world_of_baby_hitler_144582.htm">told reporters yesterday</a>, &quot;There&apos;s a new president and he says it&apos;s time for a change. Well, then it&apos;s time for a change. They need to accept a name. A name&apos;s a name. The kid isn&apos;t going to grow up and do what [Hitler] did.&quot;  ShopRite offered to write &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; with room for the Campbells to inscribe it themselves, but the outraged family took their business to Wal-Mart, which apparently supplied little Adolf&apos;s earlier cakes.
