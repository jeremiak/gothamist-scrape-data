It&apos;s unclear if the woman was a resident or pedestrian, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192443/http://wcbstv.com/local/hempstead.woman.killed.2.1644720.html">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;A broken lawn mower was seen near the van with the handle bars stripped off. Black tire tracks in the street mark where the van veered onto the sidewalk, followed by a long trail of tracks through the grass. The front of the gray van went through a portion of the brick house by the front door.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The police are investigating the incident. Newsday says the van is a &quot;commercial van&quot; with many ladders.  A man and a woman were taken into custody, but they are not cooperating with the police.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192443/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7395917">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;It is unclear which person was driving and if drugs or alcohol were involved.&quot;</p>
