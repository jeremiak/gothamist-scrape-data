<p>It&apos;s gonna be one of <em>those</em> snow storms: Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that NYC public schools are closed on tomorrow, February 9, because of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404052655/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/summers_almost_over.php">snow storm headed our way</a>. Forecasts are now saying that 8-12&quot; inches could fall in NYC&#x2014;and even more on Long Island.</p>

<p>Even the National Weather Service is recommending AGAINST traveling tomorrow:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Travel is NOT recommended tomorrow morning due to heavy snow. If you absolutely must venture out, have an emergency kit in your car. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404052655/https://t.co/DXmYeW9baf">pic.twitter.com/DXmYeW9baf</a></p>&#x2014; NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404052655/https://twitter.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/829477858590474240">February 8, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>We believe that the last NYC public school snow day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404052655/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/26/blizzard_2015_nyc_schools_cancelled.php">was on January 27, 2015.</a> (Last year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404052655/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/24/photos_nyc_shovels_snow_the_day_aft.php#photo-1">big blizzard was on January 23,</a> a Saturday!) Calling snow days <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404052655/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/17/data_proves_de_blasio_right_it_take.php">can be pretty thankless</a>, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404052655/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/24/mayor_de_blasio_al_roker_will_confr.php">de Blasio knows</a>!</p>

<p>Nick Agger, 11, a student at St. Ann&apos;s, was discussing the snow day while walking down Bergen Street in Cobble Hill with his parents and brother, who carried a plastic orange sled.</p>

<p>Agger said he was excited to go sledding in Prospect Park. He said he approved of Mayor Bill de Blasio&apos;s decision to announce the snow day early.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought he didn&apos;t give many snow days but now he did so I&apos;m excited to go sledding the whole day,&quot; Agger told Gothamist.</p>

<p>Susan Burton, 43, a producer at This American Life and Agger&apos;s mother, said she&apos;d be figuring out how to work from home. &quot;It makes the children happy,&quot; she said,&quot; smiling with a tiny bit of &quot;gonna be a long day&quot; grimace.</p>

<p>The boys&apos; father, who identified himself as &quot;anonymous dad of Brooklyn,&quot; said his wife and son were underselling the event.</p>

<p>&quot;You get one snow day a year,&quot; he said excitedly. &quot;You should enjoy it!&quot;</p>
