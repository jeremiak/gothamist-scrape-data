</div></div>					<p>The Transit Workers Union has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520203207/http://ratfreesubways.com/">running a contest</a>, asking New Yorkers to submit photographs of disgusting rats, to demand the MTA to improve current garbage cleaning/pick-up standards. And today the TWU has revealed the winner of a free monthly Metrocard. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520203207/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ugliest-rat-underground-transit-union-article-1.1019304?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports</a> that Michael Spivack&apos;s photograph of a rat with sores or burns or something horrible won over voters.</p>

<p>According to the News, Spivack &quot;snapped the creepy critter on the platform of the Seventh Ave.-53rd St. station in the summer of 2008.&quot; He said, &quot;I was waiting for the D train when I saw something on the platform. The thing wasn&#x2019;t moving but it was alive. I got as close as I dared to get.&quot;  </p>

<p>The TWU&apos;s site, Rat Free Subways, notes, &quot;Rats are proliferating in the New York City subways&quot;&#x2014;<a 26="" 2012="" href="&lt;a href=" http:="" gothamist.com="" 01="" video_rat_on_the_r_train_sends_stra.php"="">&quot;&gt;no kidding!</a>&#x2014;&quot;Riders overwhelmingly agree -- it&apos;s getting worse. Aggressive rats are bolder about coming onto the platforms, and have even been known to bite riders. They invest the &quot;refuse rooms&quot; where garbage is stored. Since the Transport Workers Union began shining a spotlight on this problem, the MTA has announced a program to clean 20 stations -- that&apos;s less than four percent of the stations system wide. It&apos;s not enough. More must be done!&quot;  and offers these ideas: &quot;More trash removal pickups from each station; Patch up rat holes in walls and floors; Place more platform trash cans in stations; Use tight-fitting lids for trash bins, so rats can&apos;t get in; More extermination and follow-up.&quot; </p>
