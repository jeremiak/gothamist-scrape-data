<p>Last year, the NY Times, NY Post, NY Daily News and Newsday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224947/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/11/september_11s_6.php">all featured 9/11 stories</a> prominently on their first pages.  This year, the Times doesn&apos;t have any, the NY Post focuses in on Election year makeup and  the Daily News splits the cover (as it did last year) between 9/11 and Election year coverage.  Only Newsday devotes the whole cover to the day.  Is this a sign of moving on?  At any rate, we bet that the full pages will come back in 2011, for the 10th anniversary.</p>

<p>The Star-Ledger, the NJ paper whose future is threatened, has a large feature on its front page about mourning at St. Paul&apos;s Chapel, near the WTC site.  The front page is after the jump, and you and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224947/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/mourning_in_america_as_911_ann.html">read the article here</a>.</p>
