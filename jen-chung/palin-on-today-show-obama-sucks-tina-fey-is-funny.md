<p>Former half-term Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin co-hosted the Today Show today (as part of the NBC&apos;s program to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173851/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/02/cant_wait_sarah_palin_to_go_rogue_o.php">counter Katie Couric&apos;s stint on Good Morning, America</a>). The show spoofed her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173851/http://instagr.am/p/I9JCSmQLRC/">love of printed media</a> and also showed her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173851/https://twitter.com/#!/todayshow/status/187141917128134656">&quot;taking over&quot; Matt Lauer&apos;s dressing room</a>.  How come Bob Dole never got a gig like this?</p>

<p>In an interview with Lauer, Palin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173851/http://todayonthetrail.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/03/10998814-palin-to-gop-dont-play-it-safe">said that Romney shouldn&apos;t play it safe</a>, but wouldn&apos;t endorse him, at least not on the program, &quot;Anything is still possible, there can still be a bit of a shakeup, but the numbers are what the numbers are. <strong>Anybody running on that GOP ticket would be better than Obama.</strong>&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173851/http://sfist.com/2012/04/02/rick_santorum_claims_california_universities_are_ruining_america.php">Really?!?!</a>)</p>

<p>When she appeared in another Today segment, on a panel with Star Jones, Donny Deutsch and Dr. Nancy Snyderman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173851/http://todayonthetrail.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/03/10999224-palin-i-wont-watch-game-change">Palin revealed that she wouldn&apos;t watch</a> HBO&apos;s Game Change, &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t seen &apos;Game Change&apos; because I wouldn&#x2019;t waste my time on false narrative. But I will have to admit Tina Fey has been pretty funny.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>The Rogue-ish conservative darling offered up another Fey-related anecdote, &quot;The nicest lady in the world, she stopped me, asked me where I was heading. I said 30 Rock, and she said, &apos;Oh honey, come here! I told you, Tina Fey is here.&apos;&quot;</p>
