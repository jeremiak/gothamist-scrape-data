Nazim Habib and Nadia Habib, who is a student at SUNY Stony Brook, are supposed to report to Federal Plaza for departure today, but their<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603061318/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/in-the-final-minutes-before-deportation-trying-to-stay-calm/"> lawyer has filed to block the deportation</a>&#x2014;on the grounds that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement deports illegal immigrants with criminal records first&#x2014;as they try to sort out the issue.  Nadia Habib, who arrived in New York as a baby, said, &quot;I&#x2019;m scared&#x2026;I don&#x2019;t want to be like arrested and put on a random plane and then like deported to a country that I don&#x2019;t consider my own.&quot;:<p></p>

<p>In 1993, the Habibs came to New York to join Nadia&apos;s father, Jawad, who has a green card.  The mother and daughter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603061318/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/09/28/queens-mom-daughter-may-avoid-deportation-to-bangladesh/">were granted political asylum</a>, but their attempts to gain legal citizenship were thwarted by bad immigration lawyers, according to the family.  Nazim and Jawad Habib have three American-born children, and when asked about leaving her husband and other children, Nazim Habib cried, &quot;I&#x2019;m to die without children.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Congressmen Tim Bishop and Joe Crowley and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand are working to keep the Habibs with their family.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603061318/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/stony-brook-student-mom-face-deportation-1.3205874">Bishop wrote a letter to ICE noting</a>, &quot;[Nadia] Habib shares the same values and ideals as those fortunate enough to be born in this country... I respectfully request ICE follow its own guidelines and focus attention on people who are more of a threat to this country than Ms. Habib.&quot;</p>
