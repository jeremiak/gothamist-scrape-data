<p>Do screaming women scare you? Especially ones in power? Then this NY Times &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301092507/https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/316391056558129153">blockbuster</a>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301092507/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/nyregion/in-private-quinn-displays-a-volatile-side.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all">about City Council Speaker</a> (and the current mayoral frontrunner) Christine Quinn is going make your balls shrivel right up&#x2014;even if you&apos;re a woman! Because the lawmaker&apos;s known to say stuff like, &quot;I&apos;m going to cut his balls off!&quot; when talking about lawmakers who piss her off&#x2014;and she&apos;s equal opportunity, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301092507/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/nyregion/in-private-quinn-displays-a-volatile-side.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all">telling the Times that</a> &quot;the phrase can apply to women, as well: in the interview last week, she volunteered that using that phrase with a gender-neutral pronoun &#x2014; &apos;their&apos; &#x2014; is &apos;a good way of doing it, so you don&#x2019;t have to wonder about the gender.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The Times does acknowledge that &quot;Ms. Quinn is by no means the first hotheaded politician in New York &#x2014; Fiorello H. La Guardia and Rudolph W. Giuliani, both former mayors, were famed for their outbursts.&quot; But then there are other details:<br>
</p><ul><li>&quot;in private, friends and colleagues say, another Ms. Quinn can emerge: controlling, temperamental and surprisingly volatile, with a habit of hair-trigger eruptions of unchecked, face-to-face wrath.&quot;</li>	<li>Her staff added soundproofing to her office. They also ask each other &quot;Did she throw up on you today?&quot;</li><br>
	<li>One official says, &quot;Her eyes get really wide, she points her fingers. She gets really close to you. It&#x2019;s really in your face.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>A former donor says one time, &quot;She screamed at me for 10 minutes, uninterrupted, and used the &#x2018;F&#x2019;-word at least 20 times. I was just so startled, I didn&#x2019;t know what to do.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>One ex-city official describes it as &quot;old-fashioned screaming, in a way that you just don&#x2019;t hear that much.&quot;</li></ul>In a 1999 interview with the Observer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301092507/http://observer.com/1999/06/christine-quinn-sets-it-straight-im-a-lesbian-yup-100-percent/">Quinn said</a>, &quot;I am very clear that a part of my personality is what some people might call a bitch. And I am very comfortable with that. I accept it both as a personality asset and as a personality defect. And I think as I&#x2019;ve gotten more mature-$500,000 worth of therapy later-I know when to be a bitch and I know when not to be a bitch. I make a conscious decision about when I&#x2019;m gonna, you know, open up the bitch tap and let the water run. It can be really effective when I need it to. I&#x2019;ve gotten through to people who are far more important than me by being, you know, a real bitch to their staff on the telephone.&#x201D; <p></p>

<p>One vivid example of Quinn&apos;s anger is when City Council Member Elizabeth Crowley (D-Queens) issued a press release taking credit for stopping local firehouses from closing&#x2014;and didn&apos;t give a shout-out to Quinn. According to the Times, Quinn was &quot;livid&quot; and &quot;began to shout at her, demanding to know who had authorized what she considered to be a premature and poorly worded release.&quot; One of Quinn&apos;s aides also questioned Crowley&apos;s abilities. A few days later, Crowley &quot;learned that Ms. Quinn had cut the Council contributions to senior centers and youth sports programs in her district. The two now rarely speak.&quot;</p>

<p>Quinn is unapologetic: While she knows that the yelling is &quot;not always attractive&quot; and &quot;not always the right thing to do,&quot; she said, &quot;At this point in my life, I&#x2019;m not going to spend a lot of time focusing on dissatisfaction with who I am, and I&#x2019;m not going to spend a lot of time tempering my personality. Whatever job I have next, I&#x2019;m going to be somebody who wants to get things done.&quot;</p>
