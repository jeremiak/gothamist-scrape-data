Their M.O. appears to be two men entering and robbing a store while a third awaits in a black Ford Expedition.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125041038/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6810355">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;The robbers hit the Sarubia Grocery at 1266 East 37th twice, on April 6 and April 22&quot;&#x2014;getting money in the 4/22 robbery (a customer was also injured). They also robbed a grocery store at 6106 3rd Avenue in late April, and a man was shot in the shoulder.  Most recently, on May 9, they robbed Blondie&apos;s Deli in Windsor Terrace. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125041038/http://wcbstv.com/cbs2crew/robbery.spree.trio.2.1008483.html"> According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Two young men...jumped up on the counter and tried to open the cash register...The latest attempted robbery was thwarted however when the owner chased the suspects with a bat and a scuffle ensued. Investigators say one of the suspects returned with a gun but the men ran away without any cash.&quot; Police are asking people to contact CrimeStoppers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125041038/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">website</a> or call 800-577-TIPS) with any information.</p>
