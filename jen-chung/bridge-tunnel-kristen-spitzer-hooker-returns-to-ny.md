The 23-year-old known better as &quot;Kristen,&quot; former Governor Spitzer&apos;s high class prostitute, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144833/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05152008/news/regionalnews/kristen_hows_what_shes_got_110919.htm">spotted taking a bus from NJ</a> (she&apos;s been living with her parents) into the Port Authority.  Three guesses: the Emperors&apos; Club VIP took a big chunk of her fees; she hasn&apos;t been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144833/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/15/celebrity_whori.php">paid for her music</a>; or she believes very strongly in ways to reduce her carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Of course, the Post managed to get a reporter and photographer at the terminal, causing Dupre to freak out.  She was seen taking a cab to the Flatiron area, wearing a &quot;sexy, see-through top, tight-fitting leather skirt and Fendi belt and buckle that retails for $632&quot; and <strong>looking &quot;worth every bit the $4,300 that Spitzer coughed up.&quot;</strong>   </p>

<p>Dupre&apos;s last public move was to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144833/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/kristen_aka_ash.php">sue Joe Francis for a Girls Gone Wild video</a>, claiming she was underage.  Francis said Dupre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144833/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/30/girls_gone_wild.php">lied about her name and said she was 18</a>.</p>
