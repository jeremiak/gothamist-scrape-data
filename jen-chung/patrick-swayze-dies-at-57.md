His family issued a statement, &quot;Patrick Swayze passed away peacefully today with family at his side after facing the challenges of his illness for the last 20 months.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143323/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008612.html?categoryid=2492&amp;cs=1">Variety writes</a>, &quot;Trained as a dancer, the half-Apache actor started out in teen heartthrob roles and segued into romantic leads, while also appearing onstage and weathering injuries and accidents. Swayze was raised in Houston, Texas, and his mother was a choreographer and ballet school owner. He trained with the Harkness Ballet and Joffrey Ballet Schools in New York, starting his career dancing for Disney on Parade.&quot; Swayze appeared in a number of films, such as <em>The Outsiders</em> and <em>Red Dawn</em>, but his breakout role was in <em>Dirty Dancing</em>, and stole hearts when he co-starred with Demi Moore in the blockbuster paranormal romance <em>Ghost</em>.   Earlier this year, Swayze admitted he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220143323/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20250329,00.html">afraid of his illness to Barbara Walters</a> and said, &quot;I&apos;d say five years is pretty wishful thinking. Two years seems likely if you&apos;re going to believe statistics. I want to last until they find a cure, which means I&apos;d better get a fire under it.&quot;  After the jump, the Saturday Night Live skit featuring Swayze with Hans &amp; Franz.</p>
