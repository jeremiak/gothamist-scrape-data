</div></div>					Here&apos;s proof that Rep. Anthony Weiner wasn&apos;t sending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weinergate_weiner_and_his_willing_w.php">his sext partners</a> messages and photos from his Congressional office&#x2014;at least some of the disclosed photographs were taken from the Forest Hills, Queens apartment he shares with (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/anthony_weiners_wife_huma_abedin_is.php">now pregnant</a>) wife Huma Abedin. The couple had put the two-bedroom condo on the market, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/now_she_got_two_children_1SEGRuMp35p2T7Ef5evWjK">Post said</a> they &quot;suddenly yanked the condo off the selling block a few days ago, said a broker with Madeleine Realty, which was handling the sale.&quot;  If you look at the listing photographs, you&apos;ll notice some things:
<ul>
	<li>The same filing cabinet appears in the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/weinergate_weiner_waxes_extremely_g.php#photo-1">topless</a>&quot; photograph as in the listing&apos;s study/second bedroom photo.</li>
	<li>Another listing photo of the study shows a PC&#x2014;with a webcam&#x2014;opposite the filing cabinet.</li>
	<li>The couch and shelf in the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/weinergate_weiner_waxes_extremely_g.php#photo-3">Me and the pussys</a>&quot; photograph is the same as the couch and shelf in the living room listing photograph.</li>
	<li>The orange cat in the &quot;Me and the pussys&quot; photograph appears in the bedroom photograph&#x2014;which also features two pillows, one with an &quot;H&quot; and the other with an &quot;A,&quot; on the bed.</li>
</ul>Weiner enjoyed making time to engage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/07/more_raunchy_weiner_sexts_im_horny.php">flirty and sexxxy online chats</a>, which has prompted House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/weiner_accepts_probe_on_prick_pics.php">for a House Ethics inquiry</a>. Of course, we&apos;ll wait for someone else to do analysis of where the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309225926/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weiners_alleged_naked_crotch_shot_r.php">naked cock shot was taken</a>.
