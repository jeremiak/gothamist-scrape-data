<p>Another day, another accolade for playwright-composer-actor Lin-Manuel Miranda: He was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his groundbreaking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923062152/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/19/hamilton_miranda_review.php">hip-hop musical about founding father Alexander Hamilton</a>, <em>Hamilton</em>. </p>

<p>Miranda, who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923062152/https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/718893835301036032">pretty excellent at Twitter</a>, told his followers:</p>

<p>The Tony Award nominations will be announced on May 3, and it&apos;s expected that the <em>Hamilton</em> juggernaut will continue its winning streak there. This past week, it was announced that the show would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923062152/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/16/hamilton_cast_members_will_get_to_k.php">share its (enormous) profits with original cast members</a>&#x2014;coincidentally, this socialist approach came after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923062152/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/09/bernie_sanders_hamilton.php">Bernie Sanders caught the show</a>.</p>
