</div></div>					<p>The long-awaited September 11 Memorial won&apos;t open at the World Trade Center site until September 11, 2011, but yesterday morning there were more signs of its progress as the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum and Port Authority planted the first Swamp White Oak trees that will surround the two reflecting pools.  Director of design for the memorial and museum, Ron Vega, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013340/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/28/first-trees-planted-at-911-memorial-site/">said</a>, &quot;<strong>Trees are about life. Trees are about renewal. You know when you plant a tree in someone&#x2019;s name, it&#x2019;s a moment of reflection and respect and here we are.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>There will be over 400 trees planted at the site&#x2014;the memorial, museum and the memorial plaza will comprise half of the 16 acre World Trade Center site.  The trees have been growing in NJ since 2007: Currently, their average height is 30 feet&#x2014;with leaf canopies between 18 and 20 feet wide&#x2014;but they are expected to grow to 80 feet. The Port Authority also says a special cistern system was designed to help sustain the &quot;urban forest&quot; and the Memorial plaza, designed by Peter Walker and Partners Landscape Architecture, &quot;will have an open turf glade for events every September, and numerous benches.&quot; </p>

<p>Joe Daniels, president of the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013340/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/29/2010-08-29_life_is_taking_root_again_at_ground_zero.html">further emphasized</a>, &quot;There was nothing here - it was a pit. To see trees is sort of saying that you can have life back here on the site.&quot;  As for other progress at the site, much of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013340/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/world_trade_center_site_progress_vi.php">underground infrastructure work has been completed</a>; One World Trade Center is now at 36 stories (it will have 105 total).  </p>
