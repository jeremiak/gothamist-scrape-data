<p>Verizon workers across New York City picketed outside offices and wireless stores today to protest the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825155139/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/verizon_strike_nyc.php">corporation&apos;s apparent unwillingness to agree on a contract</a>. &quot;This is a fight for the middle class,&quot; said Thomas, a Verizon technician who has been with the company for 19 years (and, like others we interviewed, declined to give his last name).</p>

<p>Thomas was leading his colleagues in chants on West 36th Street between 7th and 8th Avenues. &quot;First off, we&apos;re fighting for a fair contract. This is a company that is making a $1.3 billion profit every month,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not like we&apos;re asking for gains [in salary]. We want to keep what we have.&quot;</p>

<p>Anthony, a technician and 19-year veteran of the company who was picketing outside of a Verizon Wireless store in Herald Square, pointed out that Verizon is trying to freeze their pensions at 30 years of service and to change their health care coverage &quot;by charging us more for less.&quot; He also voiced frustration with the three-year contracts, which mean the union members are almost constantly negotiating.</p>

<p>The contract for the 39,000 workers expired last August. Shavonda, who has been with Verizon for 17 years, also voiced frustration that Verizon has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825155139/http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/5/9454403/verizon-fios-nyc-new-jersey-pittsburgh-mayor">apparently stalled in their efforts</a> to bring FIOS to more customers. &quot;When the company has new technology like FIOS,&quot; she said, &quot;they tell us [the employees] to tell our friends and family about it and get them excited.&quot; The reality of the slow rollout is &quot;disappointing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s regrettable that union leaders have called a strike, a move that hurts all of our employees,&quot; Marc Reed, Verizon&apos;s chief administrative officer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825155139/http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/13/technology/verizon-strike/">said in a statement</a>. &quot;Unfortunately, union leaders have their own agenda rooted in the past and are ignoring today&apos;s digital realities. Calling a strike benefits no one, and brings us no closer to resolution.&quot;</p>

<p>Every so often, the picketing workers would boo at temporary workers going into the office or at Verizon Wireless customers:</p>

<p>Passing truck drivers honked their horns in solidarity, too.</p>

<p>The Communications Workers of America union endorsed Bernie Sanders (Local 3 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the other union involved in the strike, endorsed Hillary Clinton today), and he visited striking Verizon workers in Brooklyn, telling them, &quot;Brothers and sisters, thank you for your courage in standing up for justice against corporate greed.&quot;</p>

<p>Thomas said of Sanders, &quot;He&apos;s been a friend to [CWA] for a long time&#x2014;and a friend to other workers, too... We will be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825155139/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/washington_square_park_is_berning.php">Washington Square Park tonight</a>. We&apos;ll be at the Brooklyn Navy Yard tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam, on the other hand, called Sanders&apos;s views contemptible, writing Wednesday on LinkedIn, &quot;Big companies are an easy target for candidates looking for convenient villains for the economic distress felt by many of our citizens. But when rhetoric becomes disconnected from reality, we&apos;ve crossed a dangerous line.&quot;</p>
