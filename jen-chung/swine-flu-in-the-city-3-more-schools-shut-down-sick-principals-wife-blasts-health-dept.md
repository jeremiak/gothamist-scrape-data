<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/new_swine_flu_outbreak_shuts_3_scho.php">closing three schools on Thursday</a> due to swine flu symptoms in many students, the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/16/nyregion/16flu.html?ref=nyregion">closed three more</a>&#x2014;JHS 74 in Bayside, Queens and P.S. 107 in Flushing, Queens and I.S. 318 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Students at those three schools also exhibited &quot;unusually high levels of influenza-like illnesses.&quot;  Health Department Commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden said, &quot;Despite the significant disruption this causes, the Health Department has recommended closing these schools to reduce the spread of influenza. We are continuing to carefully monitor H1N1 virus throughout the City, and are taking action again today because there are unusually high and increasing levels of flu-like illnesses at these three public schools.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_05_wiener.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_05_wiener.jpg" width="150" height="177" class="image-left"> </span>The city&apos;s most critically ill swine flu patient is I.S. 238 assistant principal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/15/queens_school_principal_with_swine.php">Mitch Wiener, who is on a ventilator</a>.  His family says he has kidney failure and pneumonia, making his symptoms untreatable&#x2014;and they criticized the city for being slow to act.  Wiener&apos;s wife Bonnie said that her husband told the principal to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207/http://wcbstv.com/health/swine.flu.nyc.2.1010855.html">close the school earlier</a>, &quot;I am outraged. What does it take to close the schools? We can close because of snow but not a disease, which can kill you.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg defended the city&apos;s decisions regarding schools closings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nyflu1612771478may15,0,2211076.story">explaining yesterday</a>, &quot;We have to make decisions on each school individually and if you close the school it doesn&apos;t mean that people aren&apos;t going to get sick. Each school is different, and we will evaluate.&quot;  But the parent of two children who have flu-like symptoms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05162009/news/regionalnews/flu_principal_wife_rips_slow_moves_169532.htm">told the Post</a>, &quot;They waited too long. It seemed like they were just waiting for all the kids to get sick before they decided to close the school.&quot;</p>

<p>And now a case of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519002207/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/99191/h1n1-flu-case-confirmed-in-rikers-island/Default.aspx">H1N1 has been confirmed in a Rikers inmate</a>.  While the Department of Correction says the inmate&apos;s condition is not serious, NY1 reports that Norman Seabrook, head of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association, thinks the Ann M. Kross Center at Rikers (with 600 inmates) should be closed and that inmates be transferred to other facilities: &quot;They need to be treated just as the public is treated. If the mayor of the City of New York can close several schools in the city of New York to make sure that they are sanitized properly, then he should do the same thing for the members of the New York City Department of Correction.&quot;</p>

<p>And after the jump, the city&apos;s press release about swine flu:</p>
