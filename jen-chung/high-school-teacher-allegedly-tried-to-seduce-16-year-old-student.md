Dean Bethea, 54, is accused of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201157/http://nypost.com/2015/12/09/city-teacher-accused-of-seducing-student-at-the-met/">trying to seduce a student on a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.&quot; <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201157/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teacher-busted-giving-ex-student-booze-hitting-article-1.2458984">The Daily News has some of the (allegedly) creepy details</a> about the Columbia Secondary School teacher:</p><blockquote>Last week, Bethea, who has been teaching at the Morningside Heights School for three years, invited a 16-year-old girl whom he had previously taught to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<p></p>

<p>While there, sources said, he took her to the caf&#xE9; and bought her two alcoholic drinks. He also allegedly told the girl she was beautiful, then later walked her to the subway and asked if he could kiss her, the sources said.</p>

<p>The girl rebuffed his advances, sources said, then later told her mother what happened. Police were called and an investigation was launched.</p></blockquote>The Department of Education has reassigned Bethea.<p></p>

<p>Bethea&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201157/http://www.columbiasecondary.org/tchr-directory/dean-bethea/">bio on Columbia Secondary&apos;s website</a> reads, &quot;I am in my second year of high school teaching after 25 years as a tenured college professor. I hope to use my college teaching experience to enrich my CSS students&#x2019; education. I obtained my Ph.D. at the University of Tennessee after completing my dissertation as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Goettingen in Germany. I have lived in East Harlem since 2007 and enjoy music, art, birding and flower gardening.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post reports that Bethea was charged with endangering the welfare of a minor and giving alcohol to a minor.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201157/https://www.visualcv.com/deanbethea">online CV for a Dean Bethea</a> notes his Fulbright scholarship at Georg-August-Universit&#xE4;t (University of Goettingen), a Ph.D. at  University of Tennessee and past professorships at Centenary College in NJ and Western Oregon University. It appears that Bethea was also arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201157/http://www.polkio.com/news/2002/jul/23/teacher-allegedly-beats-up-student/">allegedly beating up a 19-year-old male student</a> when he was a professor at Western Oregon University&#x2014;the fight was reportedly over Bethea&apos;s 20-year-old student girlfriend. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201157/http://www.polkio.com/news/2002/oct/02/western-fires-english-professor/">was later fired</a>.</p>
