<p>The only general interest bookstore remaining in the Bronx has gotten a reprieve: Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. announced today that Barnes &amp; Noble has agreed to a two-year lease extension with its landlord. Diaz said, &quot;I hope that, during this two year extension, both companies are able to reach a long-term agreement that ensures their mutual success in our borough while keeping Bronxites employed. This is a major victory for The Bronx, and I am grateful that both companies have come to an agreement for the betterment of our borough.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2014_10_bnbay.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001953im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_10_bnbay.jpg" width="349" height="253"> <br> <i style=" width:349px; ;display:block"> Via Google Maps</i></div> The Barnes &amp; Noble at the Bay Plaza mall opened in 1999, after, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001953/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/20/nyregion/neighborhood-report-co-op-city-cheers-not-the-bronx-kind-for-a-new-barnes-noble.html">as the Times put it</a>, &quot;a relentless pursuit by the borough&#x2019;s avid readers.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001953/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/barnes-noble-leaves-bronx-book-less-article-1.1982413">Daily News reported</a>, &quot;The Bronx&#x2019;s last independent bookstore, Books in the Hood, closed in 2011.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Why was Barnes &amp; Noble ready to leave the space when its lease ran out in January? Well, the chain has been struggling and it has closed major stores in NYC over rent (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001953/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/06/astor_place_bar.php">good-bye, Astor Place</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001953/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/02/barnes_noble_lincoln_center_locatio.php#photo-1">farewell, Lincoln Center</a>). According to the Times:</p><blockquote>The Barnes &amp; Noble executive, David Deason, who is vice president for real estate, said that during discussions to renew the store&#x2019;s lease, which expires in January, the landlord had communicated that it was able to lease the space to others in excess of what the bookseller paid...<p></p>

<p>Maranda Ashkar, director of marketing for Prestige Properties &amp; Development, the landlord for Bay Plaza and the Mall at Bay Plaza, said that Barnes &amp; Noble&#x2019;s option to renew its existing lease called for a rent increase based on a previous agreement. The company does not disclose rents, she said.</p>

<p>Once Barnes &amp; Noble decided not to renew, Ms. Ashkar said, Prestige Properties tried to work with the bookseller by offering to let it stay at its current site month to month at a reduced rent until another long-term tenant could be found (with ample notice given to vacate). Prestige&#x2019;s leasing agent, Welco Realty Inc., had also suggested a smaller space inside the Mall at Bay Plaza, and Barnes &amp; Noble&#x2019;s real estate agent declined, she said.</p></blockquote>Former state assemblyman Stephen Kaufmann, who helped bring the store to the Bronx, told the Times, &quot;It&#x2019;s like someone put a hand in your body and yanked out some of your heart. It hurts because this is a symbol of the intellectual coming-of-age of the borough and it&#x2019;s just being removed because of a dispute between Prestige Properties and Barnes &amp; Noble.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>But now, after heads have apparently been knocked together and parties have been likely shamed, everyone&apos;s happy! Deason said, &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble is extremely excited to announce that we have reached an agreement with Prestige Properties to extend our lease.&#xA0; We deeply appreciate the help of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., in helping to coordinate our discussions with Prestige.&#xA0; We look forward to continuing to serve the Bronx community.&quot;</p>

<p>Landlord Sam Shalem, Chairman and CEO of Prestige Properties, made clear he&apos;s granting everyone a favor, &quot;As a courtesy to the community and upon the request of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., we made every effort to ensure that Barnes &amp; Noble remains at their current location. Keeping Barnes &amp; Noble in our borough is beneficial for all and we are thankful for the Borough President&#x2019;s assistance in helping make this happen.&quot; </p>

<p>Congressman Eliot Engel is relieved, &quot;Reading is fundamental. Since its opening, the Barnes &amp; Noble at Bay Plaza has been an invaluable part of the neighborhood, serving 1.4 million Bronxites and countless others beyond the borough. Barnes &amp; Noble is the last brick and mortar bookstore in The Bronx, so its closure would have been devastating.&quot;</p>
