<p>Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151216015104/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/education/24homework.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times looks at an issue crippling the city</a>: The ruinous amount of homework  assigned by private schools like Dalton, Trinity and Horace Mann, &quot;Armed with neuroscience, self-analysis and common sense, some of New York City&#x2019;s most competitive high schools, famed for their Marine-like mentality when it comes to homework, have begun to lighten the load for fear of crushing their teenage charges.&quot; </p>

<p>There are two camps, according to the Times: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151216015104/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/09/chinese_mother_explains_why_chinese.php">Tiger Mom camp</a> &quot;...who see hard work as a rite of passage, part of what they pay $40,000 for and essential to making their children competitive. (<strong>One father commented wryly that it was unlikely that parents in India and China were fretting about overwork.</strong>)&quot; and the parents and educators who cite evidence that children with over three hours of homework are stressed out and sleeping very little. Trinity even brought in a sleep consultant to guide re-thinking its workload.  But whatever: People, City Councilman Peter Vallone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151216015104/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/29/peter_vallone_w.php">was all over this in 2007</a>!</p>

<p>New Yorker writer and father of two Dalton students Adam Gopnik supports the less homework movement, &quot;There&#x2019;s very little evidence that doing homework makes kids smarter. Even if it did, there are values other than achievement. For example, let&#x2019;s be curious,&quot; adding, &quot;The wind is blowing in the direction of sanity. There&#x2019;s no value in stressing kids out. You are robbing them of their childhood.&quot; On the other hand, parents who think a measly three hours of homework are enough may be robbing their children of making sure they get A&apos;s, not A-minuses, on tests.</p>
