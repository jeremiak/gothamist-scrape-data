Draven Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013759/http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2014/sep/11/schenectady-high-senior-portrait-absurd/?free=">explained to The Daily Gazette</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to go in the yearbook with the generic &#x2018;I-look-like-everyone-else&#x2019; photo. I wanted a &#x2018;He looks great. Only he would try that&#x2019; photo.&quot;<p></p>

<p>School district spokeswoman Karen Corona told the Gazette, &quot;That will not appear in the portrait section,&quot; because it&apos;d obviously be very different from the others, but added that there &quot;are other places in the yearbook where those photos can be placed... It doesn&#x2019;t mean the photo won&#x2019;t be in the yearbook. It just means it won&#x2019;t be in the section where the more professional photos are.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But it&apos;s clearly a professional photograph! Still, a spokesman for the neighboring Niskayuna Central School District gave this statement, &quot;There are no specific guidelines, but 99.9 percent of the time there are professional-type head shots. You do need to consider the consistency and decorum of the section.&quot; Niskayuna Central School District&#x2014;raising sheeple! </p>

Perhaps Draven should submit the picture sans lasers:</p>

<p>He was hoping for 500 signatures, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013759/http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/get-my-photo-into-the-yearbook">but there are currently over 1,000</a>. Draven told the Gazette, &quot;I&#x2019;m not trying to make any statement other than my photo is ridiculous and this is how I am.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the alternate:</p>
