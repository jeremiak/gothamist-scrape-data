<p>Because simply being an actual ridiculously hot couple isn&apos;t enough, Daniel Craig and Oscar winner Rachel Weisz are playing husband and wife on Broadway, in a revival of Harold Pinter&apos;s <em>Betrayal</em>. The play will be directed by Mike Nichols.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100954/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/daniel-craig-and-rachel-weisz-to-star-in-pinters-betrayal-on-broadway/">Arts Beat reminds us</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100954/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betrayal_(play)"><em>Betrayal</em></a> was groundbreaking: &quot;Pinter&#x2019;s 1978 play explores the frailties of marriage and long-term friendship and the fall-out from an extramarital affair, and is perhaps best known for its innovative structure&#x2014;many scenes are in reverse chronological order, with the drama starting in 1977 and ending in 1968.&quot;  </p>

<p>Betrayal was last on Broadway in 2000-2001, with Juliette Binoche, Liev Shreiber and John Slattery. (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100954/http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=3679">1980production</a> on Broadway had Blythe Danner, Raul Julia and Roy Scheider!) There&apos;s also a 1983 film, with Patricia Hodge, Jeremy Irons and Ben Kingsley&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100954/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19830318/REVIEWS/303180301/1023">Roger Ebert said</a>, &quot;The<em> Betrayal</em> structure strips away all artifice. It shows, heartlessly, that the very capacity for love itself is sometimes based on betraying not only other loved ones, but even ourselves.&quot;</p>
