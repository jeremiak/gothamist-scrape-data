<p>After last week&apos;s article about brides who will go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/fashion/weddings/Losing-Weight-in-Time-for-the-Wedding.html">extreme&#x2014;yet non-surgical&#x2014; lengths</a> to look perfect in their wedding gowns (hello, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/fashion/weddings/readers-respond-to-brides-losing-weight-for-weddings.html">feeding tube diet!</a>), the NY Times offers a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/fashion/weddings/readers-respond-to-brides-losing-weight-for-weddings.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">look at some of the response from readers</a>. For instance, an oblivious man wonders why brides can&apos;t just buy a bigger dress.  Jeez, did he not read the article about how weddings can make women totally insane?!  </p>

<p>Another woman commented, &quot;If you&#x2019;re with someone who wants a swimsuit model for a partner, then he is free to contact Sports Illustrated and ask to date one directly.&quot;  Pffft&#x2014;there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/kate_upton_lands_cover_of_sports_il.php">only one Kate Upton</a> and there are over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://www.soundvision.com/info/weddings/statistics.asp">2 million weddings in the U.S. each year</a>.  But most criticism was directed towards the so-called feeding tube diet, which gives its brides/victims all nutrients needs (but just 800 calories worth each day) via a &quot;nasogastric tube&quot; for 10 days and $1,500.</p>

<p>A nurse, who lost 70 pounds by a non-feeding tube diet, weighed in, &quot;If all you need are the low-carb fluids, why not just drink them? But it is going to be the next thing for dieters &#x2014; almost as dangerous as women eating cotton balls. We are all dying to be thin. I&#x2019;m just glad I found a healthy lifestyle that works.&quot; And Dr. Michael Cirigliano, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://www.myfoxphilly.com/dpp/good_day_philadelphia/doctor_mike/dr.-mike-on-the-feeding-tube-diet">on MyFoxPhilly, said</a> this is &quot;the most ridiculous, ludicrous thing... It&#x2019;s mind-boggling. I&#x2019;m speechless. You should not do anything like this. It&#x2019;s dangerous. It&#x2019;s wrong.&quot; Watch his video&#x2014;he talks about sinus infections and says it&apos;s &quot;off the deep end&quot; but admitted &quot;it&apos;s great for television... it&apos;s a great way to tell people not to do anything like this&quot;:</p>

<p>Jessica Schnaider, the feeding tube diet bride profiled by the Times,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/fashion/weddings/Losing-Weight-in-Time-for-the-Wedding.html?pagewanted=2"> said the critics were wrong,</a> &quot;I lost the weight. There was no other consequence. I wasn&#x2019;t putting myself at risk. I asked the doctor, &#x2018;Is there any kind of medicine or drug in the mixture?&#x2019; because I didn&#x2019;t want that. And he said, &#x2018;No, just protein powder,&#x2019; so I was fine. It made sense to me. Why can they say it&#x2019;s crazy?&quot; And her doctor, Dr. Oliver Di Pietro added, &quot;The doctors who are against this are showing a tremendous lack of empathy for people who need to lose weight.&quot;  </p>

<p>Yeah, stop being mean to the bridezillas who want to wear feeding tubes because if you&apos;re spending obscene amounts of money on the wedding already (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113755/http://theweek.com/article/index/226040/the-skyrocketing-cost-of-us-weddings-by-the-numbers">average wedding in Manhattan costs... $65,000</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s around $40,000 in the outer boroughs), why stop let the idiotic ideas stop?</p>
