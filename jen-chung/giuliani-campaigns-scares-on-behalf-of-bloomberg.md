<p>In Borough Park yesterday, it was Giuliani Time!  Former mayor Rudy Giuliani campaigned on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520003007/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/15/bloomberg_and_giuliani_rivals_or_bf.php">behalf of Mayor Bloomberg</a> and struck an ominous note at the  Jewish Community Council breakfast, &quot;I worry daily that the city might be turned back to the way it was, to the way it was before 1993. <strong>And you know exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Of course they did! Given that Giuliani also said, &quot;<strong>This city could very easily be taken back in a very different direction &#x2014; it could very easily be taken back to the way it was with the wrong political leadership,</strong>&quot; the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520003007/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/rudy_re_elect_mike_or_else_zjNkQMS1tccideNJUbfgwN">Post reports</a> that Public Advocate candidate Bill de Blasio&#x2014;a former David Dinkins staffer&#x2014; said Rudy&apos;s words were &quot;&apos;veiled race baiting&apos; for suggesting a black mayor wouldn&apos;t be tough on crime.&quot; de Blasio said, &quot;If Giuliani is using an openly divisive tactic, Bloomberg has to disavow it.&quot; Here&apos;s video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520003007/http://www.observer.com/2009/politics/bloomberg-supporters-talk-crime-borough-park">from PolitickerNY</a> (there&apos;s also City Councilman Simcha Felder talking about being mugged for five cents):</p>

<p>Mayoral challenger Comptroller Bill Thompson&apos;s campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520003007/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/nyregion/19rudy.html?ref=nyregion">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;This is a tired Republican campaign tactic &#x2014; scare people into voting by threatening their personal safety. It didn&#x2019;t work for Rudy Giuliani during his abysmal presidential bid, and it&#x2019;s not going to work for Mike Bloomberg this year. Bill Thompson is committed to public safety, not manipulating people and inciting unnecessary public fear.&quot;</p>
