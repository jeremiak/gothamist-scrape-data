<p>Last week, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101853/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/38/dtg_fortgreenerobbery_2011_09_23_bk.html">Brooklyn Paper revealed</a> that the latest victim of an armed man robbing people in Fort Greene claimed a local novelist as his latest victim, prompting the inevitable question: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101853/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/what_brooklyn_novelist_was_robbed_i.php">Which Brooklyn novelist could it be</a>?  Now, the cops have found the suspect&#x2014;and the novelist has expressed his gratitude.</p>

<p>Police say that Darryl Meachem is responsible for at last six robberies since August, including robbing a CVS and jumping a man near the Fort Greene tennis courts.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101853/http://www.arthurphillips.info/">Arthur Phillips</a>, whose recent novel <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101853/http://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Arthur-Novel-Phillips/dp/1400066476">The Tragedy of Arthur</a></em> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101853/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/books/review/book-review-the-tragedy-of-arthur-by-arthur-phillips.html?pagewanted=all">called &quot;splendidly devious&quot;</a> by the NY Times Book Review, had been playing with his sons near the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument on a Saturday afternoon (September 17) when Meachem allegedly demanded his money while flashing a weapon.  Phillips set out his wallet and the thief took the cash but left everything else.  </p>

<p>Phillips told the Brooklyn Paper he appreciated the 88th Precinct&apos;s hardwork but the incident was rattling, &quot;It would be hard to go there and think I&#x2019;m in any ordinary park&quot; adding, &quot;Maybe there is no such thing as any ordinary park. I just won&#x2019;t go in there with the same happy-go-lucky insouciance.&quot;  </p>
