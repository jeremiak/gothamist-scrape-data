<p>Smith was driving on the William Floyd Highway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415160104/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/14/police-two-dead-three-injured-in-car-crash-in-suffolk-county/">when his car struck a tree at 1:24 a.m</a>. Ryan Baumgardner, 17, and Jacqueline Salvador, 19 (she lived with Smith), were killed instantly&#x2014;while Salvador&apos;s 17-year-old brother, a 16-year-old girl and Smith all survived.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415160104/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/flags_teens_dead_after_car_crash_nhnLR0fAznEkvHKjcTx3ZL">According to the Post</a> (which has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415160104/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/flags_teens_dead_after_car_crash_nhnLR0fAznEkvHKjcTx3ZL">photo of the wreckage</a>) Suffolk Sgt. Daniel Molloy said the force of the crash &#x201C;took off the whole side of the car, the whole passenger side. It was such a bad wreck, we couldn&#x2019;t tell if the seatbelts were ripped.&quot;   WCBS 2 reports, &quot;After the wreck, the pickup truck was a mangled piece of metal, the roof was sheared off, the tire was missing and the door was thrown into the woods.&quot;</p>

<p>Smith allegedly admitted he was on prescription drugs; it&apos;s suspected he was speeding.  Molloy also said, &quot;Any time anyone dies in a car accident it&#x2019;s tragic, but they had no part in it whatsoever except being at the wrong place at the wrong time.&quot;  </p>
