<p>Remember how during Rep. Anthony Weiner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/crying_weiner_admits_to_sending_exp.php">Monday press conference</a>, he said the women (&quot;about six&quot; of them to be precise) he was having<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/07/more_raunchy_weiner_sexts_im_horny.php"> sexually explicit online relationships</a> with were adults &quot;to the best of my knowledge&quot;?  Well, it turns out he was also Twitter direct messaging a 17-year-old Delaware girl.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/06/10/exclusive-weiners-messages-to-teenage-girl-in-delaware-draw-police-attention/">According to Fox News</a>, &quot;Police here [in New Castle]  are investigating direct online communications between...Weiner and a 17-year-old girl and are looking for any other young women who may be involved, though the nature of the communications wasn&apos;t immediately clear.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently two cops went to the teen&apos;s home and &quot;asked to speak with the girl&apos;s mother about the daughter&apos;s contact with Weiner...  Another officer appeared at the home a short time later.&quot; As it happens,  a &quot;FoxNews.com reporter was at the home when the police arrived&quot; and got a quote from the girl, &quot;I&apos;m doing OK.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that the girl started to followed Weiner on Twitter in April&#x2014;after seeing him speak in D.C.&#x2014;and Fox News reports, &quot;Weiner, after signing on to follow the girl&apos;s Twitter feed, direct-messaged the girl on April 13, the sources said, though it is not clear what other communication the two may have had between or after those dates. Weiner no longer follows the girl on Twitter.&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner&apos;s spokeswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://www.politickerny.com/2011/06/10/weiner-confirms-contact-with-17-year-old-denies-explicit-messages/">issued a statement</a>, &quot;According to Congressman Weiner, his communications with this person were neither explicit nor indecent.,&quot; and the New Castle Police Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://www.politickerny.com/2011/06/10/report-underage-girl-questioned-in-connection-to-weiner/">told Politicker NY</a>, &quot;Our officers did respond to a residence in North Wilmington. I&#x2019;m not sure who they spoke to, I&#x2019;m not sure of the age of the person that they spoke to, and I can&#x2019;t confirm whether or not it&#x2019;s related to the Congresswoman Weiner incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Calls for Weiner&#x2014;married with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/anthony_weiners_wife_huma_abedin_is.php">a pregnant wife</a>&#x2014; to resign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/10/weiner_wont_go_even_though_people_k.php">have grown</a>, especially after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weiners_alleged_naked_crotch_shot_r.php">photograph of his naked genitals</a> surfaced.  Earlier today, Rep. Charles Rangel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140942/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/10/rangel_stands_up_for_weiner_he_wasn.php">stood up for Weiner</a>, finding the bright side, &quot;He wasn&apos;t going out with little boys.&quot;  </p>
