There&apos;s a white tiger there! (AirBNB)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Despite high profile reports of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202458/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/05/east_village_man_fights_30k_in_fine.php">$30,000 fines</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202458/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/27/word_to_the_wise_entrepeneurs.php">people getting sued by their buildings</a>, few New Yorkers realize that renting out their homes via sites like Airbnb is actually illegal. Which is why the company is pleading with Albany to help them.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202458/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130512/TECHNOLOGY/305129987">According to Crain&apos;s</a>, Airbnb is &quot;lobbying lawmakers for a change in a 2011 law that makes it illegal for New Yorkers to rent an entire apartment for less than 29 days. Though that stricture was intended to curb illegal hotels, it&apos;s turned the bulk of Airbnb users&#x2014;those who rent out primary and secondary residences for short-term stays&#x2014;into unwitting scofflaws.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a Brooklyn use case:</p><blockquote>Photographer Catalina Kulczar said Airbnb helped her and her husband, Juan Marin, move to Fort Greene, Brooklyn, from the Upper West Side. &quot;We had a month when we had to pay rent on both places, and we couldn&apos;t afford to do that,&quot; she said. Hosting guests allowed the couple to move. They still use the site occasionally when they need extra cash.<p></p>

<p>&quot;We have a pretty laid-back landlord who doesn&apos;t live in the building, and my neighbors are all cool, and several people use Airbnb as well,&quot; she said. &quot;We hold each other&apos;s keys for people who are going to stay in the building.&quot;</p></blockquote>State Senator Liz Krueger admits that the legislation is really meant for building owners and landlords, &quot;If you&apos;re renting out your apartment for a couple of days, this was not designed to target you. Somebody is going somewhere, and someone else needs a place to stay, so you make a deal&#x2014;those patterns have happened forever. That&apos;s not the problem.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The tech community has a vested interest in making sure Albany fixes the law:  Andrew Rasiej, chairman of NY Tech Meetup, tells Crain&apos;s, &quot;The No. 1 issue that technology entrepreneurs want is making sure we can get as many high-skilled engineering and entrepreneurial talent to move here.<strong> If it costs $350 a night for a hotel room for a developer to come here for interviews, that&apos;s a barrier that may force us to lose some potential talent.</strong>&quot; One of the tech community&apos;s suggestions is to have Airbnb &quot;self-regulate&#x2014;such as removing from the site someone renting out an apartment 52 weeks a year.&quot; Meanwhile, State Senator Martin Golden has a bill that proposes would-be renters register with the Department of Buildings for $200. </p>

<p>Airbnb&apos;s spokeswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202458/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/house_rent_web_site_on_the_outs_pGMBgdnD8CMceYexi4GI5K?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">says</a>, &quot;Eighty-seven percent of Airbnb hosts in New York list a home they live in. They are average New Yorkers trying to pay their monthly bills.&quot; In other words, Albany is preventing poor New Yorkers from paying their outrageous rents. We can&apos;t wait until enterprising New Yorkers wise up and start listing their vans, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202458/http://sfist.com/2013/05/08/hot_airbnb_item_live_in_a_van_for_5.php">the way enterprising San Francisco residents do</a>.</p>
