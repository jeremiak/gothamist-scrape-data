<p>Hope you still have some tissues left after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030084255/http://chicagoist.com/2017/01/10/obama_farewell_speech.php#photo-1">President Obama&apos;s stirring farewell speech</a>&#x2014;because First Lady Michelle Obama was on <em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030084255/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/16/fallon_trump_heads_on_sticks.php">thanks a lot, JIMMY</a>) to make her final talk show appearance as FLOTUS. </p>

<p>One of the best segments was a series of people recording very moving messages of gratitude to the First Lady&#x2014;and, of course, the First Lady and Fallon surprise them at the end. </p>

<p>Fun fact: At the 3:30 mark is Brooklyn resident and safe streets advocate Doug Gordon, who credited FLOTUS with both inspiring his daughter to try her school&apos;s salad bar AND infusing dialogue with kindness. Gordon called it &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030084255/https://twitter.com/BrooklynSpoke/status/819515686888292355">the privilege of a lifetime</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The First Lady wrote thank you notes:</p>

<p>She thanked her mother for living at the White House and helping raise Malia and Sasha:</p>

<p>The First Lady discussed how it&apos;s important that the First Family have their own space and that&apos;s sacred. She noted how former President George W. Bush and his family were gracious with advice, and she talked about helping the Trumps: &quot;This democracy is not about party. It&apos;s not about demonizing the other side. We&apos;re all trying to get stuff done. We&apos;ve seen that decency. We&apos;re trying to emulate that decency. We&apos;re going to be supportive to the Trump administration as much as we can be. Particularly, I&apos;m available for Melania, for Ivanka, for anyone.&quot;</p>

<p>As for why Sasha wasn&apos;t at her father&apos;s farewell speech, she explained, &quot;You know the Obamas! &apos;Sorry, girl, you better take your test. ... You can say goodbye later.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>It was a celebrity packed send-off for the First Lady. She and Fallon played Catch Phrase against Dave Chappelle and Jerry Seinfeld, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030084255/https://www.instagram.com/p/BPJbOQkAqjO/?taken-by=jessseinfeld">who wore a tux for the occasion</a>:</p>

<p>And Stevie Wonder sang a medley of &quot;Isn&apos;t She Lovely&quot; and &quot;My Cherie Amour&quot;:</p>
