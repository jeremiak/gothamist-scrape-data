<p>The Wildlife Conservation Society explained, &quot;Gus was euthanized yesterday while under anesthesia for a medical procedure conducted by WCS veterinarians. Gus had been exhibiting abnormal feeding behavior with low appetite and difficulty chewing and swallowing his food.  During the procedure, veterinarians determined Gus had a large, inoperable tumor in his thyroid region.  A necropsy will be conducted to determine the full pathology of the condition.&quot; The WCS adds, &quot;The median life expectancy for a male polar bear in zoos is 20.7 years, according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.&quot;</p>

<p>Gus was not a native New Yorker: He was born at the Toledo Zoo in 1985 and arrived at the Central Park Zoo in 1988. In 1994, Gus became a media darling when it was noticed that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118041714/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/opinion/in-america-bears-who-swim-too-much.html">swam endless laps in his pool</a>. It was determined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118041714/http://gothamist.com/2003/03/24/gus_the_formerly_depressed_polar_bear.php">that he was bored</a>, so the zoo developed an enrichment program for him, which, the WCS says, &quot;included providing moveable items for him to manipulate, implementing positive reinforcement training sessions, and having Gus forage for food to keep his mind and body active and healthy.&quot;</p>

<p>He had a great time with his companion Ida, but Ida <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118041714/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/04/ida_the_central_park_polar_bear_die.php">died in 2011</a>, raising concerns that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118041714/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/07/is_gus_the_widowed_central_park_pol.php">was depressed once more</a>. <br>
 <br>
Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President of Zoos and Aquarium, &quot;Gus was an icon at the Central Park Zoo and a great source of joy for our visitors and staff. He was an important ambassador for his species bringing attention to the problems these bears face in the wild due to a changing environment.  Polar bears are apex predators - the kings of their domain, but vulnerable in a world affected by climate change brought on by human activity.&quot; </p>

<p>Gus really did love swimming in his pool&#x2014;here&apos;s some footage we took last year:</p>

<p>The Wildlife Conservation Society estimates that 20 million people saw Gus. </p>
