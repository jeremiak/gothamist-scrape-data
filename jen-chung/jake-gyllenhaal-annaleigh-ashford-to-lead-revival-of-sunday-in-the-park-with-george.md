<p>In October, a select group of NYC theatergoers were dazzled by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022816/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/jake_gyllenhaal_city_center.php">special, very limited gala staging</a> of Stephen Sondheim&apos;s beloved <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. NY Times critic Ben Brantley wrote, &quot;[T]his is one of those shows that seems destined to be forever spoken of with misty-eyed bragging rights by anyone who sees it.&quot; Now, more Sondheim lovers&#x2014;and perhaps more than a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022816/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/21/gyllenhaal_every_subway.php">few Gyllenhaal fans</a>&#x2014;will get their chance, because the show is being staged next year with Gyllenhaal and his co-star, Tony winner Annaleigh Ashford, for a 10-week engagement.</p>

<p>The revival will mark the re-opening of the Hudson Theatre, which<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022816/http://www.playbill.com/article/hudson-theatre-will-be-reopened-as-broadway-house-com-375844"> last saw a Broadway show in 1968</a> (it&apos;s been used for conferences in more recent years). Performances will begin Saturday, February 11, 2017, with opening night on Thursday, February 23rd (the show will close Sunday, April 23). Tickets are now on sale at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022816/http://www.thehudsonbroadway.com/">Hudson Theatre&apos;s website</a> and by phone (855-801-5876). </p>

<p>&quot;We are absolutely delighted to be welcoming audiences back to the historic Hudson Theater for the first time in almost 50 years with this musical classic,&quot; said Mark Cornell, Ambassador Theatre Group&#x2019;s Chief Executive Officer. &quot;Direct from its acclaimed New York City Center production, Sondheim and Lapine&#x2019;s masterpiece Sunday in the Park with George, starring Jake and Annaleigh, is the perfect inaugural offering for this Broadway treasure box. To be re-opening our most intimate of New York venues with this special work makes me excited about the future of the Hudson.&quot;</p>

<p>In his review, the Hollywood Reporter&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022816/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sunday-park-george-941158">David Rooney wrote</a>, &quot;[Gyllenhaal] sang one of Sondheim&apos;s most self-revealing songs, &apos;Finishing the Hat,&apos; with aching expressiveness and an acute understanding both of the obsessive passion for making art and the isolation that can accompany it... Two of his duets with co-star Annaleigh Ashford as Seurat&apos;s muse Dot, &apos;We Do Not Belong Together&apos; and &apos;Move On,&apos; were especially stirring.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>, with music and lyrics by Sondheim and book by James Lapine, debuted on Broadway in 1984, with Mandy Patinkin as painter George Seurat, and co-starring Bernadette Peters, Charles Kimbrough and Brent Spiner. Lapine&apos;s niece, Sarna Lapine, directed the City Center gala presentation and will direct this revival. </p>
