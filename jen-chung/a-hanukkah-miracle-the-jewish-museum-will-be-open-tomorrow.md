<p>Tonight is the first day of Hanukkah, and tomorrow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012212/http://thejewishmuseum.org/">The Jewish Museum</a> will be open, with much to see and hear, including a display of 65 Hanukkah lamps.</p>

<p>The lamps, which are from the 17th through 21st centuries and represent 16 countries, include &quot;contemporary designer interpretations; a &#x201C;lamp&#x201D; using souvenir Statues of Liberty that offers a sly commentary on America&apos;s changing attitudes towards immigration; a souvenir Hanukkah lamp from Australia with emus and a kangaroo; and a whimsical interpretation of a lamp in the form eight miniature pewter chairs, a design once popular with kids,&quot; according to the museum.</p>
