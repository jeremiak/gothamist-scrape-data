<p>On the heels of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110628/http://dcist.com/2016/06/barack_obama_endorses_hillary_im_wi.php">President Obama&apos;s endorsement</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110628/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/hillary_clinton_victory_brooklyn.php">Hillary Clinton</a>, beloved progressive Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren finally announced that she&apos;s with her, telling Rachel Maddow last night, &quot;I&apos;m ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets any place close to the White House.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course some people wondered why it took Warren so long&#x2014;including Maddow herself:</p>

<p>Warren explained, &quot;I thought that the primary was really important and it was an opportunity for Democrats to get out there and show this is what it means to be a Democrat... What Bernie Sanders did was powerfully important. He ran a campaign from the heart.... He brought millions of people into the Democratic Party and for me, this is what it&apos;s all about.&quot;</p>

<p>Whatever&#x2014;Hillary will take it!</p>

<p>As for speculation about whether she&apos;s been talking to the Clinton campaign about maybe joining the ticket as running mate, Warren said she wasn&apos;t in talks with the Clinton camp. But Maddow got more specific:</p><blockquote>MADDOW: And I know you&#x2019;re not seeking the job and I know you love being a senator. But if you were asked to be Secretary Clinton&#x2019;s running mate, do you believe you could do it? By that I mean, the most important job of being a vice president is to be ready to be president if God forbid something happened to the commander-in-chief.<p></p>

<p>I know you don&#x2019;t want the job. But do you know you would be capable of stepping into that job and doing that job if you were ever called to do it? Because -- and I ask you because Ed Rendell, former DNC chairman, former Pennsylvania governor, said recently that you were no -- not in any way, shape or form ready to be commander-in-chief. I want to know if you think you could be.</p>

<p>WARREN: Yes, I do.</p></blockquote>Earlier in the day, Warren told the American Constitution Society, &quot;Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and who serves no one but himself.&quot; You can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110628/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FACAend5Vfc">the full speech here</a>, which includes observations such as, &quot;We will not allow a small, insecure, thin-skinned wannabe tyrant or his allies in the Senate to destroy the rule of law in the United States of America. It&apos;s time again to fight&#x2014;as we have in every generation&#x2014;for those four simple words that define the promise of our legal system. Equal justice under law.&#x201D;<p></p>
