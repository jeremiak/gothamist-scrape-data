But now, as he&apos;s apparently a surging potential 2012 Republican candidates, the &quot;You&apos;re Fired!&quot;-er <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424075854/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42469703/ns/today-today_people/">took the time to promise</a> he&apos;s going to figure out the biggest &quot;mystery&quot; of 2008: Where President Barack Obama was born. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424075854/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/trump_doubts_obamas_birth_certifica.php">Born again-birther</a> Trump said, &quot;Three weeks ago when I started, I thought he was probably born in this country. Right now, I have some real doubts,&quot; and added that he&apos;s got investigators <em>on the ground</em> in Hawaii, &quot;I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they&#x2019;re finding.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Yesterday, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424075854/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/04/06/wsjnbc-poll-a-donald-trump-surprise/">Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll</a> found he was tied with Mike Huckbee for second place (after Mitt Romney); a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424075854/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/donald_trumps_strong_showing_in_nh.php">Public Policy Polling poll from Tuesday</a> had second after Romney. Wily Republican operative Roger Stone, who is a friend of Trump&apos;s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424075854/http://stonezone.com/">wrote on his website</a>: </p><blockquote>Romney is widely expected to pass on the Iowa caucuses hoping to begin a winning streak in New Hampshire. Trump could frustrate his plans by doing better than expected in Iowa and beating Romney in Granite State. <p></p>

<p>In the Romney finance call Spencer Zwick, who is Romney&apos;s Finance Chairman responded to a question saying that Trump &quot;is an interesting prospect in the race and has high name recognition which is what explains his poll numbers. When the voters take a closer look at his actual business record as well his personal life, then Trump will be on the defensive. He isn&apos;t facing any scrutiny now and is able to get on a lot of TV exposure. In some ways, we are happy because even against Trump, Gov. Romney remains as the front runner with a lot of room to grow. Trump has a ceiling of support in the primary.&quot; </p></blockquote>But, anyway, back to issues that matter, Trump went on about Obama&apos;s birth certificate to Today&apos;s Meredith Vieira, &quot;His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya, and she was there and witnessed the birth. He doesn&#x2019;t have a birth certificate or he hasn&#x2019;t shown it. He has what&#x2019;s called a certificate of live birth. That is something that&#x2019;s easy to get. When you want a birth certificate, it&#x2019;s hard to get.&quot;<p></p>

<p>When Vieira spoke to a later Today show guest, Bill Cosby, about Trump&apos;s potential presidential chances, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424075854/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42471942/ns/today-today_people/">Cos said the developer</a> was &quot;full of it&quot; and &quot;You run or shut up.&quot; Vieira mentioned that if Trump did run, &quot;you&#x2019;ve got to take it seriously,&quot; but Cosby said, &quot;No, I don&#x2019;t. Not him, not him. Look, people have run for president for any reason. Come on, open your mouth &#x2014; run!&quot; <br>
