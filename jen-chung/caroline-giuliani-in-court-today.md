<p>Caroline Giuliani, the daughter of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and TV personality Donna Hanover, is expected in court today to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504064302/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/04/caroline_giuliani_arrested_for_shop.php">face shoplifting charges</a>.  Earlier this month, the Harvard student was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504064302/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/caroline_giuliani_will_never_forget.php">apparently caught in the act</a> by store employees and security cameras and police found items like &quot;Dior skin primer, Bliss moisturizer and a hairnet&quot; in her pockets.  It took a little while for Sephora to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504064302/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/07/sephora_may_press_charges_against_c.php">decide to press charges</a> and now the Daily News reports that she may be working on a deal with the Manhattan DA&apos;s office.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504064302/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/31/2010-08-31_rudys_kid_may_make_a_deal_in_makeup_shoplifting_case.html">News reports</a>, &quot;A source close to the case said that Caroline Giuliani has reached a possible agreement with prosecutors that could get her a day of community service and the charges eventually scrubbed... [She] could have gotten a year behind bars if convicted of misdemeanor petty larceny as a first-time offender. But under the possible deal, the case would be adjourned in contemplation of dismissal. It&apos;s typical in minor criminal cases for first-time offenders and, under the terms, as long as she stays out of trouble for a certain period of time, her record will be wiped clean.&quot;</p>
