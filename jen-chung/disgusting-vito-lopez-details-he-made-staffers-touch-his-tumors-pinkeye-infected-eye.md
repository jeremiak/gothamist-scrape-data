<p>Even though he&apos;s totally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/explosive_report_accuses_brooklyn_a.php">gross for pawing female staffers</a>, allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/teen_intern_had_assemblyman_wonderi.php">leering at a 14-year-old intern</a> and generally creating a terrifying workplace for women, Brooklyn Assemblyman Vito Lopez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/the_corrupt_system_works_no_charges.php">has avoided criminal charges</a> despite numerous allegations of sexual harassment. Since Lopez, still a powerful Democrat, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/liberal_democrats_want_city_council.php"> running for New York City Council</a>, let&apos;s just force ourselves to examine the insane depravity that staffers detailed to investigators&#x2014;depravity that somehow ISN&apos;T harassing enough to qualify as illegal.</p>

<ul>	<li>&quot;One woman was made to feel the tumors on his neck, shoulder and armpit as Lopez, who has cancer, told her he was dying and &#x201C;needed&#x201D; her.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/vito-lopez-won-face-criminal-charges-article-1.1344549">Daily News</a>)</li>
	<li>&quot;Mr. Lopez also demanded that several women write effusive and flirtatious text messages, in one case even writing a sample note for them to follow: &apos;<strong>Vito, I wanted to be nice to you. Hope you like way I look</strong>,&apos; he wrote. He then sometimes used such letters to forestall complaints made against him.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/nyregion/vito-lopez-accused-of-harassment-will-not-face-charges.html?pagewanted=all">NY Times</a>)</li>
	<li>After pressuring an employee to go to a bar, &quot;instead of talking about legislation, however, Lopez only spoke to Employee 3 about &apos;completely personal matters,&apos; such as her relationship with her boyfriend and her father. <strong>At the end of the evening, Lopez gave Employee 3 $50 in cash and told her to purchase a low-cut blouse to wear</strong>&#x2026;. [The next day] Employee 3 gave the money back to Lopez, telling him that she was &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with his offer. Lopez calmly took the money. Later that evening, they attended the Brooklyn Unidos Christmas party, and Emplooyee 3 said that <strong>Lopez threw the $50 in her face, while yelling she should never &quot;disrespect him&quot; again</strong> and that when he gives her something, she should take it.&quot; (JCOPE report)</li>
	<li>&quot;During the car ride home, a staffer said that Mr. Lopez once again put his hand between her legs on her inner thigh. <strong>She squeezed her legs together in an effort to prevent him from touching her and was scratched by one of Mr. Lopez&#x2019;s jagged fingernails.</strong>&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://politicker.com/2013/05/yikes-the-ten-worst-allegations-against-vito-lopez-in-ethics-report/">Politicker</a>)</li>
	<li>&quot;One of the staffers even recorded Lopez proposing that she move in with him in an Albany apartment so they could be together in &apos;<strong>an adventurous way</strong>.&apos;&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mr_sleaze_mr_squeeze_ObZxtOasHRaS9YphnmUo2M/1">NY Post</a>)</li>
	<li>&quot;A staffer once said she thought Mr. Lopez was too drunk to drive, but he insisted on doing so anyway. On the drive home, Mr. Lopez again requested a massage for his right hand. She said she complied because she was worried that Lopez might fall asleep while driving and she thought the massage would keep him awake. <strong>He used this opportunity to repeatedly force his right hand between her legs, at one point touching her underwear</strong>.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://politicker.com/2013/05/yikes-the-ten-worst-allegations-against-vito-lopez-in-ethics-report/">Politicker</a>)</li>
	<li>&quot;At a Long Island restaurant, Mr. Lopez told the same staffer who had massaged his hand to do it again. This time, Mr. Lopez placed his hands on the staffer&#x2019;s legs which she kept tightly crossed. Mr. Lopez pried her legs open and forced his hand between her legs and high up her inner thigh-in the words of the staffer: &apos;<strong>all the way up</strong>.&apos;&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://politicker.com/2013/05/yikes-the-ten-worst-allegations-against-vito-lopez-in-ethics-report/">Politicker</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And then there&apos;s the pinkeye&#x2014;here&apos;s an excerpt from the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics report:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_05_stafferpinkeye.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_stafferpinkeye.jpg" width="640" height="402" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/05/document-drop-its-not-all-about-vito-lopez">whole report</a> from JCOPE. Don&apos;t worry: Albany has paid some of the staffers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114011853/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/28/get_groped_by_vito_collect_100k_fro.php">$100,000 of TAXPAYER money</a> to make the whole thing go away. Lopez has denied the claims, issuing a statement saying, &quot;Salacious and sensational claims in the JCOPE report are fallacious. Should there ever come a time when Mr. Lopez is actually afforded the fundamental rights supposedly allowed everyone, the truth will finally be told... There is an all-out war against an ailing senior member.&quot;</p>
