<p>The police hope the public can help them identify three suspects in a violent robbery on an N train last month.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, on Wednesday, August 27th, at 2:55 a.m., a 39-year-old man was riding a southbound N train. When the train was near the Broadway and Prince Street station, the rider was approached by two men and a woman who, police say, &quot;punched him in the face and removed his backpack containing a check book and $200.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspects, who are described as being in their mid-20s, fled the scene. The victim refused medical attention. Here&apos;s video of the suspects at the Prince Street station:</p>
