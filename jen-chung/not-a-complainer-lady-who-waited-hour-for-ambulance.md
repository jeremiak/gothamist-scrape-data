title: Not a Complainer: Lady who Waited Hour for Ambulance
---

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062311im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_06_ambul.jpg" class="right">Yesterday, it was reported it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062311/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/11/eldery_woman_collapse_in_midtown_am.php">took 51 minutes for an ambulance</a> to respond to a 911 call about an 88-year-old woman who fell at East 55th Street and Lexington Avenue because the ambulance had been dispatched to Manhattan <i>from Staten Island</i>.  </p>

<p>The incident outraged the FDNY (which is conducting an internal investigation), Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum, a witness who helped the lady--pretty much everyone except the fall victim herself!  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062311/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/06/11/2008-06-11_woman_88_gives_ems_pass_on_wait.html">Daily News contacted</a> the woman, who was apparently &quot;jostled,&quot; falling to the &quot;hard pavement, injuring her head and back.&quot; She said, &quot;<strong>There are two kinds of people, the complainers and the noncomplainers.  I&apos;m not one of those to complain.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>And when the News told her why the ambulance took so long, she said, &quot;Oh, goodness.  Mistakes happen, even in the computer age.&quot; Aw, classy and cute!  But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062311/http://wcbstv.com/seenon/ambulance.emts.nyc.2.746133.html">WCBS 2 followed up and found</a> that there can be very long waits for emergency responders.  On Tuesday--which was the hottest day of the heat wave--some people&apos;s waits from 45 minutes (a woman with a broken leg) to almost two hours (a teen with a foot injury); critics say staff shortages and low pay are causing these problems.  </p>
