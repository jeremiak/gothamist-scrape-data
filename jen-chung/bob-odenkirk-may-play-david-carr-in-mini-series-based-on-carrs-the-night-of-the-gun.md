<p>A harrowing part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/12/ny_times_media_columnist_david_carr.php">late NY Times media reporter David Carr</a>&apos;s life may be the subject of an AMC miniseries. Today, the network announced that it&apos;s developing Carr&apos;s 2008 memoir, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/https://www.amazon.com/Night-Gun-reporter-investigates-darkest-ebook/dp/B001DXNZ9Q?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=dp-kindle-redirect">The Night of the Gun</a></em>, with <em>Better Call Saul</em> star Bob Odenkirk as Carr. </p>

<p>The book tracks Carr&apos;s journey to understand his time as a crack addict and new father. Odenkirk, who will also be an executive producer, said, &quot;I read David&apos;s story, The Night of the Gun, when it came out and was wildly entertained by his saga. It&apos;s a story of survival filled with pain, crack, journalistic righteousness, abandoned cars, crooks, lies, and then there&apos;s the two little girls who saved his life; it&apos;s overstuffed with humanity. I hope to do justice to David&apos;s intellect and his scrappy nature. It&apos;s gonna be crazy... if we do it right&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/amc-the-night-of-the-gun-david-carr-bob-odenkirk-1201789646/">Variety reports</a>, &quot;While the miniseries stands in development, the hot project will likely be greenlit, given the subject matter, plus Odenkirk and Ryan&#x2019;s involvement.&quot;</p>

<p>That&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0752841/">Shawn Ryan</a>, a writer and producer for <em>The Shield</em> and <em>Terriers</em>, who would take on those same roles for this project; Odenkirk calls him &quot;<em>the</em> man to explore this real anti-hero story.&quot; Ryan said, &quot;I couldn&apos;t be more honored to help bring his story to life, especially with the immensely talented Bob Odenkirk as an actor and creative partner.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2189280/">Eileen Myers</a>, who has written for <em>Masters of Sex</em> and <em>Big Love</em>, is also a writer on the project.</p>

<p>In a description on the website for his book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/http://www.nightofthegun.com/">Carr wrote</a>, &quot;If I told you I was a drug addict who sobered up, got custody of his kids, got them off welfare, survived cancer and went on to become a columnist at the NY Times, would you like my story? You bet. What if I told you I was a fat thug, sold drugs, beat up women, terrorized children, then maybe not so much.&quot; </p>

<p>He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/magazine/20Carr-t.html?pagewanted=all">wrote in the Times</a>, &quot;To be an addict is to be something of a cognitive acrobat. You spread versions of yourself around, giving each person the truth he or she needs &#x2014; you need, actually &#x2014; to keep them at a remove. Let&#x2019;s stipulate that I do not have a good memory, having recklessly saut&#xE9;ed my brain in fistfuls of pharmaceutical spices. Beyond impairment, there may be no more unreliable narrator than an addict. Recovered or not, I am someone who used my mouth to constantly create one more opportunity to get high.&quot;</p>

<p>Carr <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914002033/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/15/autopsy_says_ny_times_columnist_dav.php">died last year of lung cancer</a> at age 58; he had collapsed in the Times newsroom after moderating a panel with filmmaker Laura Poitras, journalist Glenn Greenwald and, by video, government-surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>
