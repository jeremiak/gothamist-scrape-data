<p>Alamo&apos;s website explains:</p><blockquote>The most iconic superheroine in comic book history finally has her own movie, and what better way to celebrate than with an all-female screening?<p></p>

<p>Apologies, gentlemen, but we&#x2019;re embracing our girl power and saying &#x201C;No Guys Allowed&#x201D; for several special shows at the Alamo Downtown Brooklyn. And when we say &#x201C;Women (and People Who Identify As Women) Only,&#x201D; we mean it. </p>

<p>So lasso your geeky girlfriends together and grab your tickets to this celebration of one of the most enduring and inspiring characters ever created.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Currently, there are only two screenings planned for Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone is thrilled about this special treatment for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526024140/http://laist.com/2017/05/25/2017_summer_blockbusters.php">highly-anticipated summer blockbuster</a>, starring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine and Connie Nielsen and directed by Patty Jenkins. </p>
