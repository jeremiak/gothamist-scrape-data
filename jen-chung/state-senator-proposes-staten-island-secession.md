The Staten Island Advance spoke to Lanza as he &quot;is putting the finishing touches on the <strong>2,115-page bill</strong>&quot; and found out he &quot;really believe[s]&quot; in the secession, because &quot;being part of New York City works against Staten Island on all the issues we care about.&quot; Lanza admits that Mayor Bloomberg has been helpful to his borough, but: &quot;<strong>Staten Island&apos;s voice is diminished in this big, bureaucratic system that we pay a lot of the bill for.</strong>&quot;  If S.I. secedes, it would be the second largest city in NY State and Lanza thinks it could raise enough money from property, business and payroll taxes.  As for the Mayor, his spokesman said, &quot;Mayor Bloomberg doesn&apos;t agree with Sen. Lanza on this but he appreciated...when Andy said that this mayor has been a great friend to Staten Island at City Hall who built on Mayor Giuliani&apos;s record of looking after Staten Islanders.&quot; <span class="photo_caption">Photo: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103191700/http://flickr.com/photos/wallyg/235446442/">wallyg on Flickr</a></span></p>
