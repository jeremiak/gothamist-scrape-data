<p>Last year, Long Island resident Raymond Roth was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154729/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/drowned_man_arrested_for_not_drowni.php">arrested for faking his death by drowning</a>, in a ploy to collect an insurance policy. Yesterday, he was arrested for allegedly posing as a cop and trying to lure a women into his van.</p>

<p>Roth was busted for two incidents over the past month, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154729/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/fake_new_bust_FfzCRMnuGoxMNi423NgUWJ">Post reports</a> he&apos;s suspected in a third: &quot;The Long Beach resident allegedly pulled up next to a woman in Freeport on March 16 and identified himself as a cop &#x2014; then ordered her to climb in his wood-paneled white van, Nassau police said. When she declined, Roth...briefly ran after her on foot, cops said.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, days later, he approached another woman in Freeport, saying he was a cop. When she declined to get into his van, he threatened to arrest her and chased her into a check cashing location. The woman convinced the employees to lock him out, but Roth allegedly attempted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154729/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=9043687">enter by telling employees he was a cop</a>. When she refused, he threatened to arrest her, cops said.</p>

<p>Roth, 48, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154729/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/28/l-i-man-who-faked-his-own-death-due-in-court-on-new-charges/">charged with criminal impersonation</a>, attempted kidnapping and attempted burglary. Though he faces fraud charges from his fake drowning (which he plotted with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154729/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/05/son_of_long_island_drowner_says_dad.php">his son</a>), he delayed his jail time of 90 days (plus probation) by claiming he was taking a culinary course. His lawyer had said, &quot;You heard that he spent two weeks at South Nassau Hospital. It wasn&#x2019;t a ruse that I concocted for sympathy, or as a defense. He needed treatment. There was a suicide attempt while he was in there.&#x201D;<br>
