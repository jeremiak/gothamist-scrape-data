<p>A week after stories were flying about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065129/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/20/is_ann_curry_being_ousted_from_her.php">Ann Curry&apos;s ouster from the Today Show</a>, it looks like a deal has been hammered out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065129/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ann-curry-today-nbc-news-341824">continue paying her $10 million/year</a> three-year contract (it only started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065129/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/09/meredith_vieira_officially_quits_to.php">last year</a>) and keep her in a &quot;substantial role&quot; at NBC News.  </p>

<p>The Today Show is a huge money-making four-hour behemoth for NBC, but lately Good Morning, America has been more competitive in the ratings.  So since Curry has lacked chemistry with Matt Lauer (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065129/http://theweek.com/article/index/229670/6-reasons-ann-curry-failed-as-todays-co-host">so they say</a>), she&apos;s being booted.  (Let&apos;s set aside the fact that NBC&apos;s primetime lineup<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065129/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ann-curry-is-getting-thrown-under-the-bus-2012-06-27"> isn&apos;t helping its morning ratings</a>.)  And the likely one to replace her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065129/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/television/savannah-guthrie-presumed-favorite-replace-ann-curry-co-host-nbc-today-show-article-1.1102720">will be Savannah Guthrie</a>, former white House correspondent.</p>

<p>But on the update, Curry is getting one hello of a good-bye: Today, sexy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710065129/http://klgh.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/26/12418013-chiseled-magic-mike-hunk-shows-off-stripper-moves?lite">Magic Mike co-star Joe Magnaniello</a> did a &quot;body-roll&quot;/freak on Curry, much to her horror (or is that horrified delight) before a bunch of dancers fake-flash-mobbed with Channing Tatum.</p>
