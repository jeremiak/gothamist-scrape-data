<p>A man was killed after he and his wife returned to their Staten Island home last night and came face-to-face with an intruder. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014020/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/09/home_invader_stabs_married_cou.html#incart_m-rpt-1">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;The terrifying discovery resulted in a struggle, police said, and ended with the suspect fatally stabbing the husband in the face and hand. The victim&apos;s wife suffered several stab wounds to the head, neck and back.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that they responded to a 911 call about an assault in progress at 80 Venus Place in the Woodrow section. When they got there, they found Peter Gialluisi with stab wounds to the face; his wife had stab wounds to the head, neck and back. Gialliuisi was taken to Staten Island University Hospital South, where he was pronounced dead, while his wife is in stable condition at Staten Island University North. </p>

<p>The preliminary investigation suggests that the suspect is a bearded white male, 25-30 years old, who was wearing a light-colored t-shirt. A neighbor told the Advance, &quot;It&apos;s obviously scary&#x2014;I have small children and to think something like that would happen in this neighborhood is very scary... We never had a problem with break-ins before.&quot;<br>
