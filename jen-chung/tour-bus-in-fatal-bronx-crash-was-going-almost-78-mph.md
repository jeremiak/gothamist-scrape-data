<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_fatbxbus.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_fatbxbus.jpg" width="240" height="159" class="image-left"> </span>National Transportation Safety Board chairman Deborah Hersman testified at a U.S. Senate committee hearing that the tour bus that crashed on I-95 in the Bronx earlier this month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/12/tour_bus_accident_in_the_bronx_kill.php">killing 15 passengers</a>, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/31/ntsb-tour-bus-in-nyc-crash-was-going-near-78-mph/">going near 78 mph</a>. The speed limit for commercial vehicles is 55 mph. The bus, operated by World Wide Tours, overturned, slid 500 feet, and then crashed into a highway sign pole, while sheared the bus in half.  </p>

<p>Hersman made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813/http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/03/30/new.york.bus.crash.ntsb/">recommendations for better bus safety</a>, such as better bus design (stronger roofs, redesigning window emergency exits) and more government oversight of drivers and buses, as well as using technology like forward-collision warning systems.  She told CNN, &quot;Unlike when travelers get in their own automobiles, passengers boarding a motor coach place their lives in the hands of the motor coach operator and its driver.&quot;  In the meantime, another bus company which had a fatal accident on the NJ Turnpike this month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813/http://www.northjersey.com/news/national/033011_NJ_NY_bus_crashes_lead_to_scrutiny_from_Senate_panel.html">was suspended</a>.</p>

<p>The driver of the bus, Ophadell Williams, claims the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/bus_driver_claims_he_awake_during_f.php">bus overturned when he swerved to avoid</a> a tractor-trailer, but passengers say he had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/witnesses_claim_bronx_bus_driver_wa.php">repeatedly swerving into the rumble strips</a>, leading investigators to suspect he was sleeping.  Williams&apos; lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132813/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/nyregion/31crash.html">said of the NTSB&apos;s speed estimate</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;d like to know: How do they know, and what are they basing that on?&quot; The bus&apos;s video camera did not record the crash.</p>
