The Transit Workers Union Local 100 issued a statement, &quot;Secretary-Treasurer Earl Phillips met with Mr. Moore&#x2019;s 17 year-old daughter, Shalaine, immediately after responding to the accident scene. He expressed the profound condolences of our entire TWU Local 100 family. Brother Moore worked out of crew quarters at the Parsons/Archer transit hub.&quot;<p></p>

<p>It turns out that Moore, who has two other children, had been working on a catwalk. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005824/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/180946/transit-worker-fatally-struck-by-e-train-in-queens">According to NY1</a>, &quot;Officials said the 58-year-old father of three was about to step off a catwalk at the 46th Street station when his tool belt apparently got caught on a gate, causing him to trip and tumble into the path of an oncoming E train just before 3:30 a.m.&quot; TWU Local 100 president John Samuelsen said, &quot;He was coming out of the tunnel, what we call the hole. He was coming out of the hole onto the station platform.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005824/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/24/mta-worker-fatally-struck-by-subway-train-in-queens/">MTA is investigating the incident</a>. TWU Local 100 also noted, &quot;Brother Moore&#x2019;s death comes on a tragic anniversary for TWU Local 100. It is the same day as the death of Track Worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005824/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/25/transit_worker.php">Daniel Boggs, who was killed by a train</a> at the Columbus Circle/59th Street station in Manhattan in 2007. We will remember both Danny Boggs and Louis Moore tomorrow, Thursday, April 25, at the Columbus Circle Station at 59th Street at 12 Noon, and all members are invited to attend and show our respect for the families of our deceased Brothers.&quot;<br>
