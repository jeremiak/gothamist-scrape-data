<p>The midwest is in the midst of a drought, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141126/http://chicagoist.com/2012/06/14/all_that_pretty_june_weather_its_ki.php">serious implications for our food</a>. A month ago, as &quot;young corn and soybean plants are struggling to poke out of the cracked earth,&quot; a farmer in Illinois <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141126/http://www.suntimes.com/business/13168174-420/farmers-gardeners-traders-waiting-and-watching-for-rain-relief.html">told the Chicago Sun-Times</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m trying not to worry, but Mother Nature is beating me up left and right. Every day that goes by is more money out of pocket.&quot;  Now, the futures for corn and soybeans have gone up 48.5% and 31.2% respectively since late May and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141126/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444097904577538920378814572.html?mod=WSJ__MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsThird">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;&quot;Wheat prices have soared 46.5%, and the heat is even hurting black beans and pinto beans. Weather forecasters see little relief in sight.&quot;</p>

<p>It might take a while for prices to go up, but the WSJ has this interesting example involving peanut butter from last year: </p><blockquote>Last summer, a drought in Southern states devastated the peanut crop, and by September, around harvest time, government data showed double-digit year-over-year retail price increases in percentage terms for the popular spread. By December, prices were up 27% and, most recently, 39% last month.</blockquote>Chipotle even warned investors that it might have to raise prices (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141126/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/days_of_discounted_chipotle_burrito.php">except for cops</a>).<p></p>

<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also expects higher prices, &quot;I get on my knees every day and I&#x2019;m saying an extra prayer right now.&quot;</p>
