<p>Snooki, the Jersey Shore muse and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/snooki_published_author.php">published author</a>, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/29/snooki_is_pregnant.php">apparently pregnant</a> and now she&apos;s apparently engaged, too.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20574684,00.html">People magazine says</a> Nicole &quot;Snooki&quot; Polizzi is getting hitched to boyfriend and the baby&apos;s father Jionni LaValle.</p>

<p>Snooki had told People in January, &quot;I know he&apos;s the one so I know the ring&apos;s gonna come soon... Well, not soon-soon. He knows it should be big, cuz if it&apos;s small I&apos;m saying no. Like, &apos;Get another ring!&apos;&quot;  Well, she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/03/05/snooki-engagement-ring-pic/#utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">seen with a rock on today</a> that looks pretty big!</p>

<p>While we can&apos;t totally imagine Snooki as a mom, it&apos;s pretty asshole-y of her ex-boyfriend to wish a miscarriage on her.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/05/snooki-pregnant-emilio-masella-miscarriage/#.T1VInXJAYU9">Emilio Masella told TMZ</a>, &quot;I hope for her sake ... not to be rude or anything ... but I hope she has a miscarriage.&quot;  He adds, &quot;I would def recommend her to get a paternity test to see who the father is because I&#x2019;m sure there are other subjects... Vinny could easily be the father.&quot; But it&apos;s also possible that Masella <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/05/snooki-emilio-masella-pregnancy-miscarriage-cease-and-desist/?adid=hero3#.T1VIlnJAYU8">could be the baby&apos;s father</a>... or something.</p>

<p>Snooki is currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/25/jersey_city_brace_yourself_snooki_j.php">filming her spinoff reality show with J-Woww</a> in Jersey City, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174346/http://remotecontrol.mtv.com/2012/03/05/jersey-shore-spinoff-snooki-car-crash/">she&apos;s wreaking havoc on cars there</a>.</p>
