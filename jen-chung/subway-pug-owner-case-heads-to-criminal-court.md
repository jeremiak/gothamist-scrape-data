While two citations issued to her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203025646/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/29/two_of_three_charges_dismissed_agai.php">were ruled &quot;invalid&quot;</a> a few weeks ago, there was were still some charges left.  Brodigan tells us, &quot;<strong>Today, the judge offered me an ACD, Adjourned in Contemplation. Basically, it&apos;s an offer that in 6 months the charges, which read &apos;loud and boisterous,&apos; would be dismissed in 6 months if I would admit guilt.</strong>&quot; She declined to take the ACD, because then she &quot;would not be allowed to sue the city for the wrongful arrest.&quot;  The NYPD&apos;s Civilian Complaint Review Board is also investigating the matter.  </p>
