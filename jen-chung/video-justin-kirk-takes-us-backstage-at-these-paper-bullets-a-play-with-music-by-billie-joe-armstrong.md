<p>What happens when William Shakespeare gets updated to swinging 1960s London, with era-appropriate songs by Billie Joe Armstrong? It&apos;s the effervescent new play, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406050105/https://atlantictheater.org/playevents/thesepaperbullets/">These Paper Bullets!</a></em>, Rolin Jones&apos;s adaptation of <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> starring Justin Kirk and Nicole Parker as squabbling lovers.</p>

<p>Opening tonight at the Atlantic Theater, the play, which calls itself a &quot;modish ripoff&quot; of <em> Much Ado</em>, sets up the pair as the top celebrities of their time: Beatrice is now Bea, a trendsetting fashion designer with an equally cutting-edge bob by Vidal Sassoon, while Benedick has become Ben, a member of The Quartos, a staggeringly popular rock band from Liverpool. This made the whole proposition irresistible to Kirk, who took us on a backstage tour, which includes a vintage Rickenbacker owned by Armstrong as well as the communal dressing room.</p>

<p>Jones, a Pulitzer-nominated playwright and Emmy-nominated TV writer (<em>Weeds</em>; <em>Friday Night Lights</em>&#x2014;he made you sob uncontrollably during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406050105/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_(Friday_Night_Lights)">&quot;The Son&quot;</a>; and <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>) received the initial commission from the Yale Repertory Theater. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406050105/http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/09/23/44588/these-paper-bullets-brings-shakespeare-to-the-swin/">recalled to SCPR</a> that Armstrong &quot;just said, &#x201C;OK, let me get this straight. You&#x2019;re going to rewrite Shakespeare and I&#x2019;m going to rewrite the the Beatles?&apos; And I was like, &apos;Yeah, that&#x2019;s pretty much it.&apos; And he was like, &apos;All right, what the hell, I got three weeks. Let&#x2019;s do it.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The cast of fifteen features a variety of British accents, and Parker is enjoying the posh one she employs. She spent some time demonstrating how American accents are so much lazier than British accents:</p>
