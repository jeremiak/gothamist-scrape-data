<p>The day after they said a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013418/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/12_years_later_after_911_plane_land.php">piece of plane landing gear had been found</a> between two buildings blocks from the World Trade Center site, the NYPD said the gear was indeed from a Boeing 767. However, it&apos;s unclear whether it&apos;s from one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>The NYPD issued a statement yesterday, &quot;NYPD Crime Scene detectives have been in contact with have  Boeing officials who confirmed today that the wreckage is from a Boeing 767.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013418/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/serial_is_no_tell_tale_evidence_R8XHAhy7NSl2FxhQg3mhDM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">The NY Post, though, reports</a>, &quot;Aviation experts say a number stamped on the wreckage will likely not help determine which of the two 767s it came from.&quot;</p><blockquote>That number &#x2014; BOEING CSTG 65B84045 &#x2014; is a &#x201C;casting number&#x201D; not unique to the part or to the plane, said Alan Lery of Turbo Resources International, an Arizona aircraft-parts seller.<p></p>

<p>It&#x2019;s possible a number of parts on the mechanism have the same designation, he explained.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Sometimes, the airlines track every single part number that comes with the plane,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But not likely this.&#x201D;</p>

<p>...More evidence is needed, said Chuck Horning, who chairs the Aircraft Maintenance Science Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Being that both aircraft were Boeing 767-200s, they both likely had components with the same casting number,&#x201D; Horning said.</p></blockquote>Police apparently think the plane landing gear may be from United Airlines Flight 175, which hit the WTC&apos;s south tower and spread debris on the blocks around the WTC (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013418/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Trade_Center,_NY_-_2001-09-11_-_Debris_Impact_Areas.svg">see this diagram</a>). <p></p>

<p>The debris was found on Friday by surveyors examining 51 Park Place, in a very narrow 18-inch space between 51 Park Place and 50 Murray Street. They were working for Sharif El-Gamal, who has been trying to develop 45-47 Park Place as a mosque and community center (aka<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013418/mailto:http://gothamist.com/tags/groundzeromosque"> &quot;Ground Zero&quot; mosque</a>). El-Gamal just bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013418/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/nyregion/developer-of-mosque-near-ground-zero-bought-adjoining-property.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">43 Park Place</a> and has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013418/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/judge_con_ed_cant_evict_park_51yet.php">leasing 51 Park Place</a> from Con Ed for years. <br>

The object is still there and may be removed tomorrow. <br>
