<p>Danny Burstein, who plays Herr Schultz in the musical, wrote on Facebook, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is your places call for Act II. Also, to let you know, Shia LaBeouf has just been escorted from the building in handcuffs. Yep, that just happened.&quot;</p>

<p>And Benj Pasek, a Tony-nominated composer, was there too:</p>

<p>When asked if the NYPD could confirm whether LaBeouf had been arrested, a spokesman told us, &quot;I cannot confirm that... as of yet.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022181952/https://twitter.com/TheRyanParker/status/482339266551234561">LA Times&apos; Ryan Parker Tweeted</a>, &quot;NOW: CONFIRMED: Shia LaBeouf  is in NYPD custody after being escorted out of CABARET the musical. He is being questioned, police tell me.&quot; </p>

He was also smoking.<p></p>

<p>When cops approached him, he tried to quickly walk away, but fell, so he was taken off in handcuffs as a crowed of shocked patrons looked on.</p>

<p>At the Midtown North precinct he got belligerent with officers, telling cops who were about to remove his hand cuffs: &#x201C;F-k you. I&#x2019;ll f-&#x200A;-k you up,&#x201D; sources said.</p>

<p>Cops decided to not take the cuffs off and he started spitting, prompting officers to put him in a face mask.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022181952/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Actor-Shia-LaBeouf-Arrested-at-Broadway-Theater-Police-264838041.html">A spokesperson for Cabaret said</a>, &quot;He was disruptive during act one and escorted out of Studio 54 at intermission.&quot; <p></p>
