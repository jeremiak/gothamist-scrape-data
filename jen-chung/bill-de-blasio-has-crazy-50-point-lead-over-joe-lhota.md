<p>Democratic mayoral candidate and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518101504/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/glenn_beck_de_blasio_makes_bloomber.php">Marxist terrorism-enabler</a> Bill de Blasio has a huge lead over Republican Joe Lhota, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518101504/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=1960">according to the latest Quinnipiac Poll</a>. De Blasio was the pick for 71% of likely voters, while Lhota got 21%. As for Independence Party candidate, Adolfo Carrion, he only got 2% of likely voters&apos; support.</p>

<p>Quinnipiac says, &quot;White voters support de Blasio 55 - 40 percent while black voters back the Democrat 90 - 6 percent, with Hispanic support at 79 - 10 percent... By a 69 - 19 percent margin, New York City voters have a favorable opinion of de Blasio. Lhota has a negative 26 - 36 percent favorability, with 33 percent who haven&apos;t heard enough about him to form an opinion.&quot; Can the Oracle of 9/11 Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518101504/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/oh_good_giuliani_is_making_sounds_w.php">reach those 33 percent</a> before the election?</p>

<p>Quinnipiac poll director Maurice Carroll said, &quot;These numbers say Public Advocate Bill de Blasio&apos;s kids can start arguing over who gets the best bedroom in Gracie Mansion.  The flurry of negative headlines about name changes, the Sandanista visit, the Cuban honeymoon don&apos;t seem to have any effect.&quot; </p>

<p>He adds, &quot;It&apos;s a new city demographically and de Blasio captures it. His primary-election coalition, with huge support among black and Hispanic voters, holds in this poll taken after primary-day opinions had time to settle in.&quot;</p>

<p>NYC&apos;s political reporters are speculating whether Lhota&apos;s dirty-socialist-hippie strategy is working:</p>
