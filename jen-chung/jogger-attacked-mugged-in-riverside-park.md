										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_07_rivpark.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927184745im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_rivpark.jpg" width="180" height="169" class="image-left"></span>Police are looking for a mugging suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927184745/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/park_jogger_brutalized_QuqPVjtRlTav4nwEZuputL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">attacked a jogger</a> in Riverside Park on Monday morning.  According to the Post, &quot;The 19-year-old victim was running by the tennis courts near West 120th Street at 6 a.m. Monday when the thug attacked her and stole her iPod.&quot;  The suspect allegedly &quot;threw her into a wall,&quot; and she hit her head, losing consciousness.</p>

<p>Another person in the park found the woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927184745/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/07/07/2010-07-07_jogger_gets_head_bashed_as_thief_takes_ipod.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">&quot;slumped over a bench,&quot;</a> apparently in a &quot;pool of blood.&quot;  The Daily News reports that the woman, who suffered &quot;bleeding on the brain, a fractured cheek bone and cuts to her face, head and neck,&quot; is in serious but stable condition at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital.  </p>

<p>The victim doesn&apos;t have any memory of the attack, so cops are hoping witnesses in the area will come forward with information.  The NYPD is accepting tips at Crime Stoppers&#x2014;either call 1-800-577-TIPS, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927184745/http://a056-crimestoppers.nyc.gov/crimestoppers/public/index.cfm">visit the website</a>, or text &quot;TIP577&quot; (plus your message) to &quot;CRIMES&quot; (274637).</p>
