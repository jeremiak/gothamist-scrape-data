The fire at a vacant building was so intense that it took firefighters two hours to get it under control.  </p>

<p>The fire looks suspicious, and the authorities are investigating whether the men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130926/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/06/2_found_dead_in_tompkinsville.html">died before or during the fire</a>.  Additionally, the building is one of three that was given the go-ahead for demolition last month by the Department of Buildings.</p>

<p>As for Saturday&apos;s fire in Middle Village, Queens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130926/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/16/two_more_die_from_middle_village_fi.php">that claimed three lives</a>, the fire department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130926/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2008/06/16/2008-06-16_arson_call_in_deadly_queens_blaze.html">says it was deliberately set</a>.  The deaths of 68-year-old Heriberto Garcia-Vera, his wife 48-year-old Flor Sandoval and their son 20-year-old Felipe Garcia-Sandoval are now considered homicides (another son survived).</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130926/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06172008/news/regionalnews/slay_probe_in_qns__fire_115886.htm">suspected arsonist is one of the five people injured</a>.</p>
