<p>Authorities in Edgewater, NJ made a grisly discovery on Christmas Day: the bodies of a 53-year-old man, his 49-year-old wife and their 8-year-old daughter were found in their apartment. And it&apos;s believed that the husband, Michael Stasko, killed his wife and daughter before turning the gun on himself.</p>

<p>The Bergen County Prosecutor&apos;s Office says that relatives called the police after the family hadn&apos;t arrived to Missouri for holiday celebrations; Stasko and wife Melissa weren&apos;t answering their cellphones. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150255/http://www.northjersey.com/news/3-found-dead-in-edgewater-bergen-county-prosecutor-says-1.1480493">According to the Record</a>, &quot;Stasko was found with a gunshot wound under his chin, and his wife and daughter had been shot in the backs of their heads, [Prosecutor John] Molinelli said. The shootings could have occurred while the two were sleeping, as they were dressed in pajamas, and as long ago as Tuesday, on [daughter] Nellie&#x2019;s eighth birthday, Molinelli said. Along with the bodies, police found a .45-caliber handgun with hollow-point bullets.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150255/http://nypost.com/2015/12/26/dad-murders-wife-and-8-year-old-kid-in-gruesome-murder-suicide/">Molinelli also said that</a> &quot;Melissa and her daughter, both wearing their pajamas, appeared to have been cowering under the bedsheets as they were fatally shot in the back of their heads.&quot; The bodies were in the couple&apos;s bedroom, where a .45-caliber handgun with hollow-point bullets was recovered. The Post says a towel or blanket may have been used to muffle the sound of the shots.</p>

<p>Stasko ran a watch business from the apartment at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150255/http://www.windsoratmariners.com/">Mariner&apos;s Tower</a>. The business, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150255/http://www.americasfinestpolice.com/"> Audemars M&amp;M; Inc.</a>, offered customized watches to groups, including the New York City Patrolmen&apos;s Benevolent Association, NYC Detectives&apos; Endowment Association, NYC Sergeants Benevolent Association, NYC Lieutenants Benevolent Association, NJ State Policemen&apos;s Benevolent Association and others. A motive for the killing is unclear; Molinelli said, &quot;We don&#x2019;t know whether it was financial, we don&#x2019;t know whether it was familial, we don&#x2019;t know really perhaps what was going through Mr. Stasko&#x2019;s mind for him to do this.&quot;</p>

<p>He described the family&apos;s apartment as being &quot;well-kept&quot; and full of Christmas decorations: &quot;You see some cards and holiday cards. It would appear from the 8-year-old&apos;s standpoint she very much loved her father.&quot;</p>

<p>Molinelli added, &quot;I&#x2019;m doing this 14 years and whenever you see an 8-year-old lying in a bed and she&#x2019;s dead, we try to find answers right away and we will try to find answers on this one. It&#x2019;s troubling.&#x201D;<br>
