In both cases, the victims were young women who were entering their apartments.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the first incident occurred on October 18th, at 11:50 p.m. when a 23-year-old woman was followed into her West 106th Street building: &quot;Once inside, the suspect pushed the victim against the wall, removed her pocketbook and fled. The victim chased the suspect, who, when confronted, threw the pocketbook at the victim and fled the scene.&quot; The victim was not injured.<br>
 <br>
Then, hours later, at 3:30 a.m. on October 19th, police say the suspect followed a 24-year-old into her building on West 107th Street: &quot;Once inside, the suspect pushed the victim to the floor and removed her iPhone. The victim, who sustained a cut to her upper lip, refused medical attention on scene.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Police, who describe the suspect as being 40-50 years old and 6&apos; tall, released a sketch of the suspect and surveillance of him from the first incident: </p>
