<p>Last night, an 18-year-old male jumped from a high Brooklyn tower&apos;s roof and &quot;crashed through a skylight in an adjacent building while the occupants of the apartment were home, police said,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308080706/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/teen-shocking-leap-death-brooklyn-heights-article-1.1033762?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports</a>.</p>

<p>The teen had been on the roof of the St. George Tower, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308080706/http://www.111hicksstreet.com/building/features.php4">which is 30 stories</a>, on Hicks Street and fell through the roof at 60 Pineapple Street, a six-story building.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308080706/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_hts_death_plunge_GYJLqxEYFScyc8PPvngqCK">60 Pineapple Street resident told the Post</a>, &quot;I just heard an enormous blow, a bang!  I thought that someone had thrown a 700-pound table onto the roof or something. It&#x2019;s just awful this happened.&quot; No one in the Pineapple Street apartment was injured.  </p>
