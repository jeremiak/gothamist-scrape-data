Daniel Reilly, 36, was arraigned on charges ranging from second-degree rape to child endangerment for alleged incidents that started last year and continued up until Monday.<p></p>

<p>Prosecutors say that Reilly met the student when he taught her English at IS 237 in Queens. According to the criminal complaint, the victim told the Queens DA&apos;s office that sometime in August of last year, Reilly &quot;sent her a text message indicating in sum and substance that he wanted to have sex with her.&quot; Beginning in October, the pair allegedly met in Reilly&apos;s apartment&#x2014;the one he shares with his wife and baby daughter&#x2014;had sex at least 10 times, with the last incident on Monday, April 6. </p>

<p>Reilly supposedly had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064840/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/cell_code_for_sex_DNsVanxLWHxGo3tayy9uqO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">secret name for the victim on his cellphone</a>&#x2014;the alleged conduct was discovered after the victim&apos;s sister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064840/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/09/nyc-teacher-arrested-on-rape-charges-of-girl-14-due-in-court/">noticed &quot;sexually explicit&quot; texts</a> on her phone and then told their parents. The victim&apos;s mother then called the school.</p>

<p> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064840/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teacher-arraigned-raping-student-article-1.1311647">A prosecutor said</a>, &quot;The defendant planned on keeping the relationship secret,&quot; and Queens DA Richard Brown said, &#x201C;This case is particularly disturbing. Schools should be safe havens for children. Instead, this defendant is accused of sexually preying upon one of his former students and rendezvousing with her at his residence.&quot;</p>

<p>Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064840/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/180178/teacher-accused-of-raping-his-former-student-released-after-posting-bail">said</a>, &quot;This is totally unacceptable and I&apos;ve said it repeatedly, keep your hands off our students. This is obviously alleged, so it&apos;s not a proven fact yet. But either things that you say inappropriately or things that you do with our students, we have no tolerance for that in our system.&quot;</p>

<p>Reilly, a former Marine, is out on $30,000 bail, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064840/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/cell_code_for_sex_DNsVanxLWHxGo3tayy9uqO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">which his wife paid</a>. His lawyer said, &quot;He&apos;s happy to return home to his family, the judge saw fit to trust him to go home to his family and she did just that.&quot; However, there is an order of protection for the victim. <br>
