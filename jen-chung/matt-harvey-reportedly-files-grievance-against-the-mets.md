<p>After getting suspended for three games for unspecified reasons&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195520/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/07/mets_suspend_matt_harvey_amid_fever.php">which launched a frenzy of sex toy prank rumors</a>&#x2014;Mets pitcher Matt Harvey has filed a grievance with the team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195520/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-suspend-matt-harvey-games-violating-team-rules-article-1.3144427">according to the Daily News</a>. </p>

<p>On Sunday, team manager Sandy Alderson announced that Harvey was suspended, and brought up Adam Wilk from the triple-A. Wilk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195520/http://nypost.com/2017/05/07/mets-put-adam-wilk-through-hell-even-before-he-got-pounded/">lasted 3 2/3 innings, giving up six runs</a>. </p>

<p>The Mets lost to the Miami Marlins, 7-0.</p>

<p>As for why Harvey was suspended, the Mets have only said it was for a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195520/https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2017/05/mets-suspend-matt-harvey.html">compilation of issues</a>&quot; since last season. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195520/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/sports/baseball/new-york-mets-matt-harvey-suspension.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsports&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=sports&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>Someone close to Harvey, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the problem was miscommunication. The person said Harvey played golf on Saturday, was bothered by a migraine and did not report to the ballpark or tell the Mets of his absence before 3 p.m. The Mets reached out to Harvey then, the person said, and when Harvey arrived at Citi Field on Sunday, he was told of the suspension and sent home...<p></p>

<p>The union could file a grievance for Harvey, to try to recoup the lost salary, but he has treaded into this territory before. He missed a mandatory workout on the eve of the 2015 playoffs, later apologizing to teammates and explaining that he had no excuse. There is no evidence of other no-shows this season, but Saturday&#x2019;s apparently was enough to warrant discipline.</p></blockquote>A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195520/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-manage-mess-matt-harvey-suspension-article-1.3144740">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;He has some growing up to do.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Mets, past and present, weren&apos;t amused:</p>
