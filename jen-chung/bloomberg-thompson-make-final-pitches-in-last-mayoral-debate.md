Last night, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Comptroller William Thompson squared off for their second and final mayoral debate.  And it was a feisty affair, with just a week till the election:  The Post called it a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221042517/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bloomy_and_bill_in_yankee_basebrawl_rldECmWXxtkZOgLz1wVMbO">&quot;Yankees basebrawl&quot;</a>, the Daily News noted how they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221042517/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election_2009/2009/10/27/2009-10-27_one_final_brawl_mayoral_candidates_thompson_bloomberg_pull_out_all_stops_in_fina.html">&quot;pulled out all the stops&quot;</a>, and the NY Times noted how Bloomberg &quot;pound[ed]&quot; Thompson.  
<br><br>
Some highlighted soundbites:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Bloomberg on Thompson&apos;s time at the Board of Education: &quot;He didn&apos;t get the job done. He failed our students. He failed teachers. He failed the taxpayers. He failed our future.&quot; </li>
	<li>Thompson&apos;s response: &quot;This constant distortion of my record at the Board of Education and spending an excessive amount of money to continue to lie to the people of New York needs to stop.&quot;</li>
	<li>Bloomberg on Thompson&apos;s fiscal plans: &quot;My opponent has proposed something like $5 billion in expenses that would have to be paid for with job-killing taxes. He said so many things I can&apos;t keep straight who he&apos;s going to tax, but he&apos;s going to tax somebody.&quot; (Thompson denied this.)</li>
</ul>
