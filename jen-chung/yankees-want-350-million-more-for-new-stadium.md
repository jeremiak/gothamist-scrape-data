<p>The NY Yankees has reportedly asked city for $350 million more in public financing for its new stadium.  The $1.3 billion project is currently under construction, and the urgency for additional funds in the form of tax-free bonds ranges from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611061256/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06112008/news/regionalnews/yankees_seek_more_public_financing_for_n_115059.htm">Assemblyman Richard Brodsky saying</a> &quot;the Yankees said they couldn&apos;t complete the Stadium without additional financing&quot; to the NYC Economic Development Corporation president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611061256/http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/yankees/ny-spystad0612,0,315331.story">saying the Yankees are just making &quot;informal inquiries.&quot;</a>  </p>

<p>An NYC EDC spokesperson said that the Yankees can&apos;t get the additional financing because of an IRS rule that &quot;prohibits more public debt to be incurred for the stadium,&quot; but the city is trying to help the Yankees--not to mention other sports teams--get around the rule.  However, Good Jobs New York director Bettina Damiani told the Post if the IRS reverses that regulation, the &quot;floodgates&quot; would open, &quot;It defies all fiscal common sense to subsidize wealthy sports teams.&quot;</p>

<p>Yankees team president Randy Levine sought to calm things down by explaining, &quot;This issue does not affect completion of the Stadium,&quot; noting the organization always considered &quot;additional bonding.&quot;  Keep in mind that the Yankees have already received $900 million in tax-free bonds (the Mets received $500 million in tax-free bonds for CitiField).
