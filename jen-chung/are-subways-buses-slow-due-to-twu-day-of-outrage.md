It&apos;s possible there really wasn&apos;t &quot;train traffic up ahead&quot;&#x2014;apparently the Transit Workers Union <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122850/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/10/14/2009-10-14_riders_mta_brace_for_twu_day_of_outrage.html">wants to give the MTA (and riders) hell</a> because the agency won&apos;t pay arbitrator-decided raises.  And a text message last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122850/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/09/2009-10-09_simmering_feud_at_mta.html">suggested</a> that workers were advised to &quot;slow it down&quot; today.  </p>

<p>Over the summer, an arbitration panel ruled that the union <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122850/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/the-mta-arbitration-decision-and-dissent/">could get 11% raises</a> over three years, but the MTA won&apos;t pay them.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122850/http://www.twulocal100.org/">TWU Local 100</a> acting president Curtis Tate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122850/http://wcbstv.com/cbs2crew/twu.workers.union.2.1246815.html">said</a>, &quot;This time we followed the rules. This time we did exactly what they said we should do. And what did they do? Because they didn&apos;t like the way it turned out, they want a do over. You don&apos;t get do overs.&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily News reports, &quot;Strikes or slowdowns are illegal under the state&apos;s Taylor Law, and the MTA in the past has responded with court orders mandating the union to obey,&quot; but of course, the 2005 strike happened anyway.  The MTA said, &quot;Obviously, we are prepared&quot; for a potential slowdown, but what does that really mean, when your commute ended up taking twice as long?</p>
