<p>During the Knicks&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161012141251/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/26/last_nights_action_knicks_give_the.php">victorious home-opener</a>, rookie guard Iman Shumpert injured his knee.  So today, the team picked up second-year guard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161012141251/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jeremy_lin/">Jeremy Lin</a> from the Rockets.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161012141251/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/harvard-grad-jeremy-lin-claimed-waivers-ny-knicks-asian-american-guard-offers-backcourt-insurance-article-1.997304">Coach Mike D&apos;Antoni said</a>, &quot;Yeah we picked up Jeremy Lin off of waivers (as) a backup point (guard) in case. We&apos;ve always liked him as a player so we&apos;ll see where we go with it.&quot; This makes Lin the Knicks&apos; first Asian-American player since the 1947-1948 season!</p>

<p>Lin, a Harvard graduate, played his first year with the Golden State Warriors, who released him; the Houston Rockets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161012141251/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7392484/new-york-knicks-claim-guard-jeremy-lin-waivers-houston-rockets">picked him up</a> but then put him on waivers Sunday. D&apos;Antoni added, &quot;He went to Harvard so he might be the smartest guy we have. But he&apos;s very quick, he defends pretty well and he can really get in the lane and distribute the basketball. We haven&apos;t seen him for a couple of years but when we worked him out we liked him.&quot;</p>
