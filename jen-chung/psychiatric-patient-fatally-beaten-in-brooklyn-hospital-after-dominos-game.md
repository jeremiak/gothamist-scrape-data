<p>The NYPD said that the victim, a 47-year-old man, was found unconscious and unresponsive on the 8th floor with blunt force trauma to the upper torso and head. He was later pronounced dead.  A 20-year-old man was apprehended and taken to Kings County Hospital; he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325000735/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_hospital_patient_fatally_attacked_a220Nhg2dLx02l1Yw1AbLK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Brooklyn">not been charged yet</a>.</p>

Just before the confrontation, the two men were playing a game of dominoes in the ward&#x2019;s day room. &apos;<strong>It was a quiet, peaceful domino game</strong>,&apos; Ms. Krantz said. The episode was moments after the game ended, she said. &apos;We&#x2019;re still trying to figure out what occurred between the two patients to have caused this,&apos; she said.&quot; She also told the Times there are no surveillance cameras.</p>
