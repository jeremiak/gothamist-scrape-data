<p>A funeral will be held today for a five-year-old boy who fell to his death from a Brooklyn apartment balcony last night.</p>

<p>Police responded to a report about an injured child at 200 Wallabout Street in South Williamsburg before 8 p.m. and found that Meisels Shimon fell from a fifth floor balcony to the ground. Hatzolah, the volunteer EMS service that responds to emergencies in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111758/http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/425959/tragedy-in-williamsburg-young-child-rl-dies-after-falling-from-upper-floor-of-building.html">transported the boy to Brooklyn Hospital</a>, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111758/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/02/funeral-to-be-held-for-5-year-old-boy-who-died-after-falling-from-brooklyn-building/">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Witnesses said he had been playing outside, possibly on chairs stacked on the terrace, before he fell.&quot; </p>

<p>Police sources tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111758/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/boy-killed-falling-porch-brooklyn-building-article-1.2657842">the Daily News</a> that no one called 911 after the boy fell. &quot;Cops are still investigating how the boy fell and if anyone was watching him, though investigators believe that an adult relative and the boy&#x2019;s siblings were present in the apartment,&quot; the paper reported. </p>

<p>A neighbor told the News that it was a &quot;terrible tragedy,&quot; saying, &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful, very, very special family. Everybody&apos;s asking, why this is happening, why this has happened, and we don&apos;t understand the way God governs the world.&quot;</p>
