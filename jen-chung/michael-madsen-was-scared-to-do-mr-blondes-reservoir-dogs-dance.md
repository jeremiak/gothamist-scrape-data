<p>One of the most memorable&#x2014;and gory&#x2014;scenes from 1990s cinema is when Michael Madsen, as Mr. Blonde, tortures a cop in <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> while dancing to Stealer&apos;s Wheel&apos;s &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430004513/https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/reservoir-dogs-2017">At the Tribeca Film Festival</a> on Friday night, Madsen reveals that he was &quot;intimidated&quot; by the scene and never rehearsed it.</p>

<p>The film, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, was screened at the Beacon Theater before a chat with actors Madsen, Harvey Keitel (Mr. White), Steve Buscemi (Mr. Pink), Tim Roth (Mr. Orange) and, of course, writer-director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino gleefully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430004513/http://deadline.com/2017/04/reservoir-dogs-reunion-quentin-tarantino-harbey-keitel-tribeca-1202079580/">recalled all the walkouts from the extremely violent movie</a>&#x2014;&quot;Wes Craven walked out of my movie. The guy who did Last House on the Left walked out of my movie! I guess it was too tough for him.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the dance, Madsen confessed his fears&#x2014;and inspiration&#x2014;for it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430004513/http://ew.com/movies/2017/04/29/reservoir-dogs-reunion-tribeca/">From Entertainment Weekly</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;You never made me do it in rehearsal because I was so intimidated by it. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do,&#x201D; Madsen recalled. &#x201C;In the script, it said, &#x2018;Mr. Blonde maniacally dances around.&#x2019; I remember specifically that&#x2019;s what it said. And I kept thinking, &#x2018;What the f&#x2014; does that mean? Mick Jagger?&apos;&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Tarantino said the entire scene was done in three takes, but Madsen&#x2019;s dance occurred during the first.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know what the hell to do. I heard that music and I said, &#x2018;Oh f&#x2014;, I better do something,&apos;&#x201D; Madsen said. &#x201C;I remember thinking about Jimmy Cagney. I remember this weird little thing he did in a movie I saw. He did this crazy little dance thing and it just popped into my head at the last second. That&#x2019;s where it came from.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430004513/http://ew.com/movies/2017/04/29/reservoir-dogs-reunion-tribeca/">Madsen added</a>, &quot;I went to Michigan to open up this theater. They were going to name it for Michael Madsen. And I thought it was great. They sent me a memo of what I was supposed to do and it said, &#x2018;First we&#x2019;ll announce the naming of the theater and then Michael Madsen will come out doing the Mr. Blonde dance.&#x2019; I was like, &#x2018;Oh my God! There is no way I&#x2019;m going to do that.&#x2019; I started imagining myself at 80 years old, someone asking me to do the Mr. Blonde dance. It&#x2019;s been following me around forever.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the dance&#x2014;warning, the scene is VERY graphic:</p>
