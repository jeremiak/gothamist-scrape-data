<p>A 26-year-old man was slashed on a subway train last night after police say he got into a &quot;verbal dispute&quot; with another rider.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. on a northbound 3 train near the West 72nd Street station. An NYPD spokesman says the victim was slashed several times in the head and arm. The victim fled the train at the station, while the assailant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020206/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-slashed-on-upper-west-side-subway-following-dispute/1693145/">remained aboard the train</a>.</p>

<p>Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020206/http://nypost.com/2017/01/09/man-slashes-subway-rider-who-stepped-on-his-foot-cops/">tell the NY Post</a> the argument started when the victim &quot;stepped on the man&#x2019;s foot.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020206/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Man-Slashed-at-Upper-West-Side-Subway-Station-1-2-3-Train-410043405.html">NBC New York&apos;s sources</a> describe another scenario: &quot;[T]he suspect was walking through the train with luggage and said &apos;excuse me&apos; to the victim, who ignored him. That&apos;s when the suspect reacted angrily, police say, slashing and stabbing the man on his head, hand and right arm.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Roosevelt Hospital for his injuries.</p>
