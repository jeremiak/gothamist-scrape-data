										<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145223im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_07_bitten.jpg" class="right">After finding themselves in bankruptcy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145223/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/did_898_dresses_do_steve_barrys_in.php">last month</a>, Steve &amp; Barry&apos;s, the clothing retailer boasting inexpensive designs from Sarah Jessica Parker and Stephon Marbury, announced that an investment company has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145223/http://www.newsday.com/business/ny-bzstev0805,0,4759765.story">offered them $163 million</a>.  Newsday reports that a subsidiary of Bay Harbor Management, which specializes in &quot;purchasing and revitalizing troubled companies,&quot; has made the offer, in exchange for some assets and would want the company to continue to operate.  The offer needs to be accepted by bankruptcy court and would establish &quot;a minimum price for other bidders during the auction process.&quot;  One retail consultant said it would be a &quot;steal.&quot;  It remains to be seen what will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145223/http://ydr.inyork.com/ci_10098211">happen with its stores</a>--some would probably be closed.</p>
