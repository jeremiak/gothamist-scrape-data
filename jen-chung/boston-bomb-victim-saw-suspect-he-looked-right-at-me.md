<p>Yesterday, the FBI <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223004933/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/video_here_are_the_two_boston_marat.php#photo-1">released photographs</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223004933/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php#photo-1">two Boston Marathon bombing suspects</a>. Within hours one was dead after a chaotic shootout with police, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223004933/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/one_boston_bomb_suspect_is_dead_as.php#photo-1">a massive manhunt continues for the other</a>. Now it turns out that the FBI may have been aided by one of the people horribly injured by the blast: Jeffrey Bauman, the man who was seen being wheeled away by three people, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223004933/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/cowboy_hat-wearing_man_who_help_bos.php">including Carlos Arredondo</a>. Bauman lost both his legs below the knees.</p>

Bauman&#x2019;s information helped investigators narrow down whom to look for in hours of video of the attack, he said.</blockquote>Bauman was visited by Bradley Cooper and New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman yesterday.<p></p>
