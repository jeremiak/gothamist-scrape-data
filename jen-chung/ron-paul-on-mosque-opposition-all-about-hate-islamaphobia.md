Ron Paul (R-Texas) is speaking up in favor of the not-really-at-Ground Zero mosque! A strong defender of property rights, he&apos;s shared his thoughts on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163515/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosque">proposed mosque and community center planned for 45-47 Park Place</a>&#x2014;and he basically thinks that the project&apos;s opponents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163515/http://www.ronpaul.com/2010-08-20/ron-paul-sunshine-patriots-stop-your-demagogy-about-the-nyc-mosque/">are narrow-minded, bigoted demagogues</a>!  Here&apos;s an excerpt: </p><blockquote> The debate should have provided the conservative defenders of property rights with a perfect example of how the right to own property also protects the 1st Amendment rights of assembly and religion by supporting the building of the mosque.<p></p>

<p>Instead, we hear lip service given to the property rights position while demanding that the need to be &#x201C;sensitive&#x201D; requires an all-out assault on the building of a mosque, several blocks from &#x201C;ground zero.&#x201D;...</p>

<p>The outcry over the building of the mosque, near ground zero, implies that Islam alone was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. According to those who are condemning the building of the mosque, the nineteen suicide terrorists on 9/11 spoke for all Muslims. This is like blaming all Christians for the wars of aggression and occupation because some Christians supported the neo-conservative&#x2019;s aggressive wars...</p>

<p>This is all about hate and Islamaphobia.</p>

<p>We now have an epidemic of &#x201C;sunshine patriots&#x201D; on both the right and the left who are all for freedom, as long as there&#x2019;s no controversy and nobody is offended.</p>

<p>Political demagoguery rules when truth and liberty are ignored.</p></blockquote><br>
Paul also points out, &quot;The nineteen suicide bombers didn&#x2019;t come from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan or Iran. Fifteen came from our ally Saudi Arabia, a country that harbors strong American resentment, yet we invade and occupy Iraq where no al Qaeda existed prior to 9/11.&quot;<p></p>
