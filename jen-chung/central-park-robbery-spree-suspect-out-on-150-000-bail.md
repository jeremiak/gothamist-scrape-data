A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163433/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/boarding_school_bandit_facing_years_uJF33CoI8dQyLwYQopadxN">prosecutor said</a> that Wasserman, 17, was found riding a bicycle belonging to one victim and had a ring and ID from another victim in his pocket.  <p></p>

<p>Wasserman faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted; an accomplice, whom Wasserman did not name, allegedly showed a rubber gun during the robberies. When his mother, an expert in attention deficit disorder, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163433/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/07/2010-08-07_aw_the_poor_kid_heads_back_to_moms_mansion_after_night_in_jail.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;We&apos;re going through tremendous hardship,&quot; Wasserman reportedly &quot;shushed&quot; her.  But a neighbor of Wasserman&apos;s in New Rochelle (the family lives in a $1.75 million house) said, &quot;Why is he out robbing people when he has a nice life?...He&apos;s the black sheep of the family. <b>They&apos;re a good Jewish family and he&apos;s bringing shame to them. He acted like a schmuck.</b>&quot;  </p>

<p>Another friend reiterated the claims that Wasserman was a wannabe tough guy, &quot;<b>He thinks he&apos;s from the streets, but he&apos;s this rich kid whose family buys him whatever he wants</b>... He acts like a gangster and he doesn&apos;t want people to know who he really is.&quot; His lawyer said that his family members &quot;stand by him, and look forward to a time in the near future when he moves on to better things.&quot;  </p>
