<p><i>Since September, Rachel Maddow has been hosting a news program&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213155/http://rachel.msnbc.com/">The Rachel Maddow Show</a>&#x2014;on MSNBC, covering the day&apos;s big new stories&#x2014;plus some smaller ones that viewers should be aware of&#x2014;with intelligence, compassion and wit. Before becoming part of the MSNBC family as a political commentator, Maddow hosted a radio show in Massachusetts (while not working on her Ph.D. dissertation) and later became part of Air America&apos;s team. A Rhodes scholar, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213155/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/25/rachel-maddow-mixes-cockt_n_178865.html">self-described &quot;mean dork&quot;</a> about pre-Prohibition cocktails, and Gothamist reader, Maddow chatted with us earlier this week about her show, tea-bagging, and Scotch.</i></p>

<p><b>How are you doing, other than having to brave the mid-morning traffic?</b> I&apos;m good. Last night we did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213155/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#30335366">interview on the show with Philip Zelikow</a>, who was Condoleezza Rice&apos;s right hand man at the State Department when all the torture memo stuff was going on. There&apos;s this very grave, very serious first-draft-of-history sort of thing, and it was very exciting.</p>

<p><b>I saw the interview last night and wanted to ask you about that. The revelation of the memos has been big news for you&#x2014;it&apos;s consistently a topic that you&apos;ve drawn attention to.  I was wondering, given your background with prisoners&apos; rights and reform, if that was the reason you felt so strongly about the issue of torture. </b> Maybe, it might be. There have been a lot of other people who have focused on it too, who don&apos;t have a background in prison reform, so that can&apos;t be the sort of secret to it. </p>

<p>I think that it definitely inflects the way I see it. I definitely have a belief that people are more than the worst thing they&apos;ve ever done, and that the way that you treat people when they&apos;re completely under your control and you&apos;ve completely taken away their liberty, says a lot about you. And the fact that these are bad people is irrelevant, because in fact who <em>you are</em> is evident in the way that you treat them.</p>

<p>Maybe that&apos;s what made me interested in prison reform in the first place, or maybe that&apos;s what I learned from prison reform. But there is a thread that carries from that previous part of my life into that issue, I think you&apos;re right. </p>

<p><b>How is it going, juggling all your new responsibilities, with the TV show?</b> I have been trying to simplify my life a little bit, because the TV show is hard. It&apos;s very hard to do this well, and it&apos;s really fun; it&apos;s a really good job. I&apos;ve never had a job this good, and I still sort of can&apos;t believe that I have it. But it&apos;s just wicked hard to do a good job in an hour of television every single day. </p>

<p>Daily production is hard, I knew that already from having been in radio a long time. I just don&apos;t know how to do TV right, and part of that is just what my responsibility is, just as far as talking to the camera, and making sure the script&apos;s right, and saying exactly what I need to be doing, and doing good interviews and stuff like that. </p>
