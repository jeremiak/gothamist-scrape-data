<p>Yesterday afternoon, a 23-year-old woman was fatally stabbed in an attack that started in a car and continued after she ran into the street.</p>

<p>Apparently the victim, Amarita Khan, was meeting her husband, Nazier Khan, 25, at a relative&apos;s house at 1538 Hone Avenue in The Bronx to discuss their marriage around 6 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014855/http://nypost.com/2014/08/10/man-stabs-wife-to-death-outside-home/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;the husband lost his cool and took the knife to his wife, cops said.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014855/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/nyregion/woman-is-fatally-stabbed-in-the-bronx-the-police-say.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">couple had been sitting in a car</a> when Nazier Khan allegedly used a gravity knife to attack his wife. Then she ran out into the driveway and onto the street, where neighbors were getting ready for a party.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014855/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-stabs-wife-death-broad-daylight-bronx-street-cops-article-1.1898283">One neighbor told the Daily News</a>, &quot;We heard the screaming, but we thought it was the kids playing. Nothing like that ever happens here, so we didn&#x2019;t think much about it (initially).&quot;</p>

<p>Nazier Khan continued to stab his wife, witnesses say. When police arrived, he was reportedly standing over his wife&apos;s body. Nazier Khan&apos;s mother told the Post her son, a TSA supervisor, has bi-polar disorder: &quot;I was shocked. I never think he is capable of this. He&#x2019;s a quiet boy, a good boy. No smoking, no drinking, always just working. I never expected my son would do something like this...  He a very quiet boy, very keep to himself. Never tell nobody nothing, just `Good morning and good afternoon.&#x2019;&quot; </p>

<p>She added that her daughter-in-law had been cheating, and that her son &quot;love her so much.&#x201D; The couple had two children.</p>

<p>Nazier Khan was taken into custody. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014855/http://nypost.com/2014/08/10/man-stabs-wife-to-death-outside-home/">Post has photos of him</a> covered in blood and then collapsing onto a sidewalk. </p>
