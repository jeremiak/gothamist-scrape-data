<p>Rail fans, rejoice: As part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111533/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/vintage_transit_museum.php">New York Transit Museum&apos;s 40th Anniversary festivities</a>, you&apos;re just a MetroCard swipe away from riding on a vintage train in Brooklyn!</p>

<p>From noon to 4 p.m. today and tomorrow, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111533/http://www.nytransitmuseum.org/40th-anniversary/">the museum says</a>, &quot;Ride the rails in historic style by hopping on and off a selection of the Museum&#x2019;s vintage fleet at the Brighton Beach station B/Q platforms, including BRT/BMT &#x201C;Standards,&#x201D; BMT D-Type Triplex, and IND R1/9s. A pop-up retail shop and hands-on activities for the whole family round out this day of fun at the Brighton Beach station!&quot;</p>
