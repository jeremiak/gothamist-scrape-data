<p>Here&apos;s something to add to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/27/doubts_raised_about_etan_patzs_alle.php">doubts about the man</a> who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/nypd_commissioner_pedro_hernandez_a.php">confessed to the 1979 killing</a> of six-year-old Etan Patz: Manhattan DA Cy Vance refused to give a firm answer about the strength of his case against Pedro Martinez.  The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/manhattan-district-attorney-dodges-question-case-etan-patz-confessed-killer-solid-article-1.1087495?localLinksEnabled=false">says he &quot;punted&quot; while telling reporters</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m not going to answer that question and not because I&#x2019;m afraid to answer that question, but because it&#x2019;s premature to answer it at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ray_arm_twist_iAf3TlkNOMFvwKxZTyH3QN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Post reports that a source said, </a>&quot;Vance did not want an arres... [Police Commissioner] Kelly pushed, insisted, but Vance wanted time to investigate. He wanted to hold him in a safe place and evaluate the guy while they investigated.&quot; Vance was not present at Kelly&apos;s press conference announcing the arrest&#x2014;which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/nypd_commissioner_pedro_hernandez_a.php">held on the eve of the 33rd anniversary of Etan&apos;s disappearance</a>.</p>

<p>Hernandez&apos;s confession last week that he strangled the boy resulted in the first arrest in the case.  Last month, the boy&apos;s disappearance was thrust back into the national spotlight when the FBI and NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/spotted_fbi_on_prince_and_wooster.php">started to investigate a Soho basement</a> previously used by a handyman who was friendly with the then-6-year-old boy.  Etan went missing while walking from his parents&apos; loft on Prince Street a few blocks to the school bus stop. His disappearance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/etan_patzs_1979_disappearance_in_so.php">prompted a nationwide movement</a> to find missing children (Etan&apos;s photo was the first to be placed on milk cartons).  </p>

<p>The April re-opening of the case stirred up old emotions, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/21/etan_patz_case_fbi_removes_concrete.php#photo-5">especially for Etan&apos;s parents</a> who never moved from their loft in hopes their son would return one day, and, as yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/23/no_remains_found_in_etan_patz_dig_s.php">uncovered no new evidence</a>. It apparently also prompted a relative of Hernandez&apos;s to call the authorities.</p>

<p>Hernandez, who worked as a bodega stock clerk at the time of Etan&apos;s disappearance, admitted to the killing, but his lawyer says he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/26/suspect_in_1979_etan_patz_murder_ha.php#photo-1">schizophrenic and bipolar, and suffers from hallucinations</a>.  Some psychiatrists are surprised&#x2014;based on what&apos;s known about the 51-year-old NJ resident&apos;s history&#x2014;about the confession.  Noting that Hernandez seemed to be living a peaceful existence in the years since 1979, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/nyregion/psychiatrists-puzzled-by-hernandezs-confession-in-etan-patz-case.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">one doctor told the NY Times</a>, &quot;Someone who at age 18 kills a child in a psychotic rage is generally going to be already pretty crazy by age 16 or 17 and often not a lot better by age 42.&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily Beast&apos;s Michael Daly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233723/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/31/why-pedro-hernandez-confessed-to-killing-etan-patz.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+thedailybeast/articles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29">has an account of how the confession allegedly unfolded</a>: </p><blockquote>Detectives, in fact, found Pedro Hernandez all the more convincing for the very reason that he so clearly seemed to be lying at the start of their interview with him.<p></p>

<p>According to a knowledgeable source, Hernandez began to incriminate himself only after more than an hour of questioning. He initially told investigators that he could not identify Patz in a photo they showed him. The statement was remarkable, coming from someone who lived and worked at the epicenter of the search at the time the 6-year-old went missing in 1979.</p>

<p>Hernandez claimed to be unsure of why he had been brought for questioning to the Camden, N.J., prosecutor&#x2019;s office. He is said to have asked if cops wanted to talk to him about his ex-wife or late child-support payments.</p>

<p>A detective from the NYPD missing person&#x2019;s squad then set down the photo of Patz and said something to the effect of, &#x201C;You know why you&#x2019;re here.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>After a break in the question, then Hernandez supposedly admitted he knew about Etan.<p></p>
