<p>Remember, last year, when Gloria Allred was defending two women for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150116005517/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/gloria_allred_defends_right_to_badm.php">their right to trash their cheating ex on a website</a>?  Now Justice is smiling because a judge agreed with Allred.  After looking an angry exes&apos; web postings, such as &quot;Lied and cheated his entire way through his 40 years of life&quot; and &quot;HE&apos;S SCUM. RUN FAR AWAY,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150116005517/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/judge-tosses-manhattan-lawyer-lawsuit-exes-trashed-a-cheater-online-article-1.1025795">Daily News reports</a> that New York Federal Judge Harold Baer found the comments to be &quot;clearly hyperbolic&quot; rather than defamatory, &quot;When viewed within the larger context of the website on which they were posted, there can be no doubt that a reasonable reader would understand the comments to be opinion.&quot;</p>

<p>Former &quot;roller jam&quot; television star Stacey Blitsch and lawyer Amanda Ryncarz both dated lawyer Matthew Couloute Jr., and say that Couloute jilted them (Blitsch also has a son with him).  Couloute sued both of them for defamation, and say that they have interfered with his &quot;ability to make a living,&quot; thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150116005517/http://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/lawyer-suing-hot-ex-girlfriends-over-scathing-relationship-reviews-on-liarscheatersrus-speaks-out/liarscheatersrus-matthew-couloute-jr/">comments on LiarsCheatersRUs.com</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150116005517/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/gals_hail_dismissal_of_ex_lover_K6ajxKqDaoqvA8nhoMbRbK">Baer added</a>, &quot;Even though plaintiff&apos;s reputation has suffered, I am unwilling to take the leap from generalized comments calling plaintiff a &apos;liar&apos; and a &apos;cheater&apos; -- on a Web site called &apos;liarscheatersrus&apos; no less -- to actions directed at specific business relationships.&quot;</p>

<p>Coulote plans to appeal, but Allred said, &quot;We think this is a beautiful opinion. Women should have the right to warn each other about men that they believe have lied and cheated on them... <strong>If you are afraid that your lying and cheating might show up on the internet, don&apos;t lie and cheat.</strong>&quot;</p>
