</div></div><p>While Brookfield Properties told Occupy Wall Street protesters that their encampment at Zuccotti Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/brookfield_tells_ows_protesters_to.php">would undergo cleaning at 7 a.m.</a>, the protesters are preparing to deal with the NYPD earlier than that.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://twitter.com/#!/Newyorkist/status/124635391360901121">NewYorkist Tweeted</a>, &quot;Direct Action committee: &quot;<strong>We have word that NYPD are showing up as early as 4am. So let&apos;s stay up all fucking night!</strong>&quot; #occupywallstreet&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/this_just_in_mayor_bloomberg_shows.php">Mayor Bloomberg visited the park last night</a>, supporting their right to protest as well as Brookfield Properties&apos; right to clean the plaza.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/brookfield_tells_ows_protesters_to.php">NYPD is supposed to clear out</a> the park in phases starting at 7 a.m., but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://twitter.com/#!/OccupyWallSt/status/124610376527650818">Occupy Wall Street has said</a>, &quot;Please show up at MIDNIGHT to be prepared for 6 a.m.&quot;<br>
  <br>
Protesters have also been cleaning the park all day, in an attempt to show that the plaza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/photos_video_protesters_hustle_to_c.php">has been kept in good condition</a> (they have been cleaning it regularly, but OWS would like Portapotties and dumpsters).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://twitter.com/unclerush">Russell Simmons has been Tweeting</a> a lot about the potential clash:</p><blockquote>I am hearing about a potential showdown at #OccupyWallStreet tmw. I am offering to pay for the clean-up of the park to avoid any problems.<p></p>

<p>The yogi in me wants 2 pay 2 clean park &amp; the threat goes away. The activist thinks it may be better to let authorities fu+k themselves #OWS</p>

<p>Dear @MikeBloomberg -- I will pay for clean-up of Zuccotti Park to avoid confrontation. http://bit.ly/oPxWkO PLS RT #OWS</p>

<p>Damn looks like they are gonna start a war out of this non violent movement. This could set off lots of chaos.</p>

<p>Dear @MikeBloomberg -- I will pay for clean-up of Zuccotti Park to avoid confrontation. I don&apos;t wanna go to jail but I will be there ready!</p></blockquote>The National Lawyers Guild sent a letter to Brookfield Properties, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082536/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/lawyers_group_accuses_brookfield_of.php">suggesting their involvement of the NYPD violates the First Amendment</a>.<p></p>
