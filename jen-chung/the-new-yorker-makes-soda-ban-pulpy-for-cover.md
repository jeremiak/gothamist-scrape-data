<p>This week&apos;s issue of The New Yorker features a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130321013207/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/bloomberg_wants_to_ban_sugary_drink.php#photo-1">soda/sugary drink ban</a>-inspired cover by Owen Smith. Shocking that The New Yorker didn&apos;t opt for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130321013207/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/03/disturbing_nanny_bloomberg_photosho.php">Nanny Bloomberg caricature</a>!  Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130321013207/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/06/cover-story-crime-fiction.html">Smith explains</a>, &quot;When I heard about Bloomberg&#x2019;s plan, on the national news, to make large sodas illegal, my mind immediately went to &#x2018;Are people going to jail for this?&quot; Oh don&apos;t be silly&#x2014;after a quick stop-and-frisk anybody packing a giant soda will simply be issued a summons and released.</p>

<p>Smith continued, &quot;Making things criminal that you wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily think of as a crime, to me it&#x2019;s just &#x2018;crime fiction,&#x2019; and that&#x2019;s sort of a pulp idea. When I was in art school, pulp covers weren&#x2019;t mentioned because they were considered far too trashy. I discovered them when I was at a thrift store, or a used bookstore, or at a flea market, and then I just started collecting &#x2014;pulp magazines and book jackets. I just like the way they&#x2019;re quickly done but quite nicely painted, and sexy&#x2014;sex and violence always catches.&quot;</p>
