<p>For this year&apos;s 12th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173628/http://gothamist.com/tags/tributeinlight">Tribute In Light</a> will come back. </p>

<p>Yesterday, Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s office announced, &quot;The &apos;Tribute in Light&apos; will return for one night as a tribute to all those who were lost on September 11th. The lights are located at West and Morris Streets in lower Manhattan.  The lights will be on beginning at sunset on September 11, 2013 and fading away at dawn on September 12th.  There will be no formal program.  The lights are best seen when it is completely dark; sunset is expected to occur at 7:11 P.M. that night and sunrise is expected to occur at 6:34 A.M. on the morning of September 12th.&quot;</p>

<p>The ethereal installation, which involves high-powered lights at a lower Manhattan location, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173628/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/03/anne_pasternak_executive_director_creative_time.php">commissioned by Creative Time</a> after the attacks. Artists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173628/http://creativetime.org/projects/1799-2/">Julian Laverdiere and Paul Myoda</a> had proposed the twin beams of light for a NY Times Magazine feature and the Tribute was first lit for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173628/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/11/nation.remembers/index.html">six month anniversary of the attacks</a>.</p>

<p>The funding for Tribute In Light has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173628/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/the_tribute_in_lights_future_looks.php">imperiled in the past</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173628/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/11/photos_last_nights_tribute_in_light.php#photo-1">is now under management</a> of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. </p>
