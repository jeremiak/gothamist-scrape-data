</div></div>					<p>Last night, The Daily Show finally took up NYC&apos;s most controversial issue that is tearing apart communities. No, not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145704/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk</a> (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145704/http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-may-23-2013/the-only-unfair-thing-ever">it&apos;s been tackled</a> by the program)&#x2014;let&apos;s talk about the issue that&apos;s getting old white ladies really riled up: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145704/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike.</a> </p>

<p>After looking at news footage reporting how bike share is already on the streets of Barcelona and Paris, Stewart said, &quot;We have basically imported Europe&apos;s most boring idea!&quot; Then he adopted his New York wiseguy persona, &quot;Hey, I&apos;ve got a f*cking idea&#x2014;why don&apos;t you keep your f*cking Louvre and your progressive attitude toward sexual freedom&#x2014;just give me your f*cking bikes! That&apos;s what we want!&quot; Also: &quot;<strong>First of all, the idea of New Yorkers sharing anything&#x2014;except for sexually transmitted diseases&#x2014;is whackadoo.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><br>Then, after realizing that some Citi Bike riders may not even know how to bike and that no helmets are required, Stewart muttered, &quot;A lot of people are going to die,&quot; and came up with a money-making idea:</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145704im_/http://gothamist.com/upload/2013/06/2013_05_brainremoval.jpg" width="640" height="407" alt="2013_05_brainremoval.jpg"></p>

<p>The Daily Show also tried to examine the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145704/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/14/bloombergs_citi_bike_program_remind.php">extreme hatred</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145704/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/i_dont_live_in_paris_i_live_in_new.php">NYC bike share has aroused</a>. Stewart mocked the complainers, &quot;Oh, they&apos;re not safe. They don&apos;t work. Looks like shit. Blah blah blah&#x2014;you know we used to say the same thing about the Irish! And look at them now&#x2014;they&apos;re running the joint!&quot; He also singled out everyone&apos;s new favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145704/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/video_conservative_who_represents_m.php">bike share troll, Dorothy Rabinowitz</a>, &quot;There&apos;s just f*cking bikes. Slow down, Lady Hungers Games&#x2014;or should I say Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial board member of The Wall Street Journal.&quot; </p>

<p><br>Correspondent Al Madrigal spoke to people in the West Village (who hate it) and also in Bedford Stuyvesant, where residents hate it because it&apos;s not there. &quot;Ain&apos;t no Citi Bike in the hood,&quot; one man said, who responded to the suggestion that he could take the subway instead, &quot;The J train? <b>The J TRAIN?</b> Where the f*ck am I gonna go on the J train?&quot; Touche.</p>
