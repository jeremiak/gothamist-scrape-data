<p>A bank robber determined to get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823094714/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/26/police-suspect-used-backhoe-to-break-into-bank-in-queens/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Queens Chase branch&apos;s ATM used a backhoe</a> to break in. The robber managed to drag the ATM out and tried to use the backhoe&apos;s arm to open it up&#x2014;but the ATM was too strong for the backhoe. So the crook fled!</p>

<p>The break-in took place at 3:15 a.m. at a branch on 48th Street in Maspeth.

I lost a half day&#x2019;s work and the machine&#x2019;s damaged now.&quot;</p>

<p>Investigators are reviewing surveillance footage. An office worker in the neighborhood told WCBS 2, &quot;That bank&#x2019;s been robbed before, but not quite like that. It&#x2019;s a little desperate, that&#x2019;s kind of extreme.&quot;</p>
