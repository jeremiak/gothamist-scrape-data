<p>With over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164301/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/queens_arson_reward.php">$52,000 in reward money offered</a>, the hunt for the arsonist responsible for seven fires in Forest Hills continues. The police released a new video of the suspect, showing him at the scene of the first fire&#x2014;and it appears he is armed with a gun.</p>

<p>The NYPD says this footage is from &quot;the general vicinity of Incident #1 on Sunday, November 8, 2015 at approximately 1920 hours at 112 Street and 68 Drive. In the video the suspect has his face covered and he is wearing gloves. It also appears that the suspect removes a firearm from his left ankle and then transfers the gun to his front right pocket.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is the NYPD&apos;s list of incidents (it&apos;s not chronological, but the police order; #6 and #7 were added recently):</p><blockquote>Incident #1 - At approximately 1930 hours on Sunday, November 8, 2015 at 68-60 112 Street.<br>

Some residents worry that the authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164301/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new-york/arson-forest-hills-ignites-fear-bukharian-enclave-0">aren&apos;t taking it seriously enough</a>, but  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164301/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/10/forest-hills-arsons-new-video/">Fire Commssioner Daniel Nigro said</a>, &#x201C;We have a task force working together. We believe it is one person. We believe we will find him soon.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s footage of the Bukharan community meeting with the NYPD. Officials say it does not appear to be a hate crime at this point, though other evidence could later lead to that:</p>

It might very well be some one from the neighborhood, the sources added.&quot;<br>
