</div></div>					<p>Emergency personnel are responding to a construction accident at the World Trade Center site, according to the Office of Emergency Management.  Apparently a load fell 40 stories from a crane near Cortlandt and Church Streets&#x2014;and it looks like the load fell on a truck.  We&apos;re hearing there may be one victim.</p>

<p>The load, possibly a beam, fell from the under-construction Tower 4, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102514/http://www.wtc.com/about/office-tower-4">which will be 72-stories</a>. A person in the area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102514/https://twitter.com/#!/CharlesJB12/status/170164973585170433">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Construction workers pouring out of WTC South site into Zuccotti Park as emergency vehicles are driving into the site. #WTC&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Now the 1 train is suspended in both directions between Chambers and South Ferry.  They are going to inspect the train tunnel; it&apos;s unclear if they&apos;ll need to shut down the R to check that tunnel.</p>

<p>Also, one construction worker was injured but we hear he refused medical attention.</p>

<p><b>Update 11:15 a.m.</b>: Service for the 1 train has been restored.  Construction at the site has been suspended as the investigation continues.  The Daily News reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102514/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/worker-hurt-crane-cable-snaps-wtc-work-site-article-1.1023703?localLinksEnabled=false">a cable carrying the load snapped</a>.</p>
