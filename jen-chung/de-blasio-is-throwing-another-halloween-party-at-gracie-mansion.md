<p>Last year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235909/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/29/photos_gracie_mansions_first_hallow.php#photo-1">Halloween Party at Gracie Mansion went so well</a> that this year Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray are having TWO Halloween gatherings!</p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s office announced, &quot;New York City families are welcome to enter a ticket giveaway to enjoy a time of tricks and treats with the First Family. Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235909/http://www.nyc.gov/GracieHalloween">www.nyc.gov/GracieHalloween</a> or call 311 on Monday, October 26 between 12 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST to sign up for your chance to attend.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_10_graciehalloween.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235909im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_graciehalloween.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Jen Chung / Gothamist)</i></div> <br>
 <br>
The website explains further: &quot;Tickets will be available for 15 minute time slots on Friday, October 30th, between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. and on Saturday, October 31st, between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. The Halloween party is open to New York City children 5-10 years of age and their parents/guardians. Each awardee will be granted up to four (4) tickets.&quot; <p></p>

<p>This year, there will be &quot;activities on the front lawn, including face painting, story-telling, a magic show and an art activity courtesy of Blick Art.&quot; This sounds much bigger than last year&apos;s bash, which turned Gracie Mansion&apos;s yard into a spooky cemetery, complete with ghosts haunting the grounds.</p>

<p>Last year there were also snacks inside the mansion, and staffers handed out candy and Vision Zero pamphlets. The goody bag my daughter got from First Lady McCray included zero transfat animal crackers, a gluten-free trail mix bar, a reflective LOOK! bracelet and shoe tags, and a big bag of M&amp;M;&apos;s. </p>

<p>There was also the photo op:</p>
