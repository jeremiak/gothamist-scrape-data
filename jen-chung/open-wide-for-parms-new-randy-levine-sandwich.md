<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003033/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/22/parm_uws_photos.php">Parm&apos;s Upper West Side location</a> has a new addition to the lineup that has a special, pinstriped pedigree. And, yes, it is as delicious as it looks. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003033/http://ny.eater.com/2015/10/20/9573551/maple-david-chang-delivery">Eater reported</a> today that the &quot;Randy Levine&quot; sandwich&#x2014;&quot;made with slow-cooked pork belly, plum sauce, Chinese mustard, half-sour pickles, and garlic bread&#x2014;is based on one that Yankees president Randy Levine had at Catskills restaurant Herbie&apos;s.  </p>

<p>Major Food Group partner Jeff Zalaznick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003033/http://ny.eater.com/2015/10/20/9573551/maple-david-chang-delivery">explained to Eater</a>, &quot;We were told about this sandwich by [Levine]...about four years ago, and since then we have been trying to perfect our version of this historic sandwich.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_10_randyl.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003033im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_randyl.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Jen Chung / Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003033/http://unlikelywords.com/2009/03/02/sandwiches/">original Herbie&apos;s version</a> uses sliced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003033/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_siu">char siu</a>/Chinese barbecued pork, but the Parm rendition takes it to a new level with the pork belly, which is slow-cooked, then thickly sliced and finally grilled. The fat pieces of, well, bacon are succulent, and the grilling give it that charred flavor. The other ingredients also help balance the pork&apos;s richness well.</p>

<p>It is messy, but it&apos;s worth every bite. </p>

<p><em>The Randy Levine sandwich is $10, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003033/http://www.parmnyc.com/location/upper-west-side/">Parm UWS, 236 Columbus Avenue</a>. It is not listed on the menu (yet).</em></p>
