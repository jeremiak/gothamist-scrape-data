<p>Last night, the police released details about a September 22nd incident: At around 10:30 p.m., the NYPD says a 20-year-old woman was walking in the vicinity of Harding Avenue and Prentiss Avenue in the 45th Precinct when she was &quot;engaged [in] conversation by&quot; the male suspect who &quot;ask[ed] her for the time. The suspect then proceeded to ask the victim for a sexual favor.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim refused, and police say &quot;the suspect put the victim into a bear hug and after releasing her, grabbed her buttocks with both hands and fled.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect fled, but was described as being 17-20 years old, about 5&apos;5&quot; and 130 pounds. A police sketch of the suspect was released, and it appears he was also wearing a Mets cap.</p>

<p>The police also asked for help yesterday in finding a suspect and a person of interest in an alleged forcible touching incident in the 46th Precinct: On November 11th, at the corner of Sedgwick Avenue and Fame Hall Terrace at 6 p.m., a male suspect approached a 22-year-old woman &quot;from behind and grabbed her buttocks.&quot; </p>

<p>The suspect fled on foot, and he was with a male riding a bicycle, who is now a person of interest. The NYPD release surveillance video:</p>

<p>The suspect was wearing a yellow tank-top and a multi-colored winter cap, while the person of interest on the bicycle was wearing a red T-shirt. </p>

And in an incident in the 46th Precinct, police say that on October 30th, at 5:20 a.m., near East 141 Street and Bruckner Blvd, 44-year-old woman walking from a train station to work at St, Mary&apos;s Place and Southern Blvd. was approached from behind by a male who &quot;grabbed the victim by her hair and her buttocks and fled.&quot;</p>
