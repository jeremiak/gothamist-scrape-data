<p>Mayor Bloomberg unveiled the 2010 fiscal year budget yesterday and acknowledged that that his proposed sales tax hike, which would raise the tax rate to 8.875%, is no fun.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145908/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/nyregion/02budget.html?ref=nyregion">During the press conference</a>, he said, &quot;It is true that sales tax, if you have the same rate, is a regressive tax, but the bottom line is, the people that have more money buy a lot more things, and they spend a lot more of it.  <strong>Is it a good tax? No. None of these taxes are good taxes</strong>... I&apos;m not happy about raising any tax.&quot;</p>

<p>The exemption on sales tax for clothing and shoes under $110 would also be eliminated, and all told, the mayor hopes to raise nearly $1 billion in revenue from the tax hike.  According to the NY Times, the Independent Budget Office estimates a household making $35,000/year &quot;would have to pay an extra $129 a year in sales taxes...A household making $125,000 would pay an additional $356 a year, and one making $500,000 would pay $840 more.&quot;  City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, usually a friend of Bloomberg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145908/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/05/01/2009-05-01_mayor_bloomberg_unveils_city_budget_with_higher_sales_taxes_plastic_bag_surcharg.html">criticized the tax hike</a> as &quot;a regressive way to generate revenue because it places an unfair burden on those who have the least,&quot; while City Comptroller William Thompson, who is running for mayor, said the hike would &quot;<strong>balance the budget on the backs of the small business owners and hardworking, middle-class residents of this city</strong>.&quot;  And the Retail Council of New York State&apos;s Ted Protrikus said, &quot;<strong>It could make the consumer say: &#x2018;You know what? I&#x2019;ll buy my underwear in Paramus next week.&apos;</strong>&quot;</p>
