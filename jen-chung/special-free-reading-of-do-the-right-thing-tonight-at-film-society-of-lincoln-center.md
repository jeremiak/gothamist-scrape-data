Mr. Jordan will read the role of Mookie while Mr. Turturro will be Sal, the pizzeria owner who was played by Danny Aiello in the film. (Mr. Turturro played one of Sal&#x2019;s sons in the movie.) The filmmakers Ryan Coogler (&#x201C;Fruitvale Station&#x201D;) and Shaka King (&#x201C;Newlyweeds&#x201D;) organized the reading; the event is being held in the memory of Eric Garner and Akai Gurley, two New Yorkers who died after confrontations with police.
