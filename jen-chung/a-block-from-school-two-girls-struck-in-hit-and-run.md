The two girls decided to cross in the middle of the street, managing to pass after a bus, but both were hit by the Nissan.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122009/http://www.nypost.com/video?vxSiteId=a89dc16f-1771-485a-8c76-3ebbf3072361&amp;vxChannel=NY%20Post&amp;vxClipId=1458_382144&amp;vxBitrate=300">Surveillance video</a> shows the NIssan knocking both girls down: The friend gets up immediately but Nisha remains on the ground, while the car doesn&apos;t even stop or slow down.
