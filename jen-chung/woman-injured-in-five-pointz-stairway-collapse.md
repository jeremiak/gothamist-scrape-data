<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319134038/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/04/11/2009-04-11_designer_critical_as_staircase_collapses.html">Daily News reports</a> the victim is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319134038/http://www.leoworks.com/Leoworks_jewelry_designer.html">Nicole Gagne</a>, 37, a jewelry designer, who has a work loft at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319134038/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Pointz">Long Island City structure</a> that is familiar to passengers on the 7 train&#x2014;the warehouse on Davis Street is covered in legal graffiti. Apparently a 20-foot section of the 100-foot concrete stairway fell&#x2014;and Gagne fell 100 feet. An artist told the News, <strong>&quot;It was a huge noise. I thought it was a bomb. The cement blocks covered her. You could only see her small feet sticking out.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Many artists tried to help remove rubble to free her, but the debris was too heavy: Another artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319134038/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04102009/news/regionalnews/woman_falls_over_100_ft__when_staircase__163866.htm">told the Post</a>, &quot;I tried to help remove the rubble, it was very heavy...  I hope she&apos;s still alive.&quot;  Gagne was taken to Bellevue Hospital; her condition is not known.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319134038/http://www.ny1.com/Content/Top_Stories/97230/woman-injured-in-queens-stairwell-collapse/Default.aspx">According to NY1</a>, the Department of Building is now inspecting the building and questions whether it&apos;s safe: &quot;Artists say they were told the building is unsafe and it was being shut down temporarily due to serious safety code violations.&quot; Naturally the artists are worried; one told NY1, &quot;Over five years you accumulate a lot of work. I work every day. So I&apos;m trying to figure out how to get my stuff out.&quot; NY1 adds, &quot;<strong>City officials told the artists on Friday that they could only reenter once the building had a protective scaffolding, and that it would not be built until at least Monday.</strong>&quot;</p>
