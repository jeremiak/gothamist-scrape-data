</div></div>					<p>Just after midnight, a fire broke out at a supermarket in the Bronx and grew into a five-alarm blaze. Over 200 firefighters have responded, and some are still at the scene, making sure any pockets of fire are put out.</p>

<p>According to the FDNY, they received a call about a fire at Food Dynasty, a supermarket at 862 Hunts Point Avenue, at 12:32 a.m. It&apos;s believed the fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015441/http://7online.com/news/injuries-reported-at-bronx-supermarket-fire/218645/">started in the store&apos;s ceiling</a>.</p>

<p>Apartments on both sides of the supermarket were evacuated. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015441/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/25/firefighters-battle-5-alarm-blaze-at-bronx-supermarket/">One resident told WCBS 2</a>, <br>
&quot;My brother was like, &#x2018;Oh my God, there&#x2019;s a fire, there&#x2019;s a fire next door&#x2019; and we just ran out of the building. We didn&#x2019;t grab anything, we just left.&quot;</p>

<p>A child from one of the neighboring buildings was treated for smoke inhalation while two firefighters suffered minor injuries. </p>
