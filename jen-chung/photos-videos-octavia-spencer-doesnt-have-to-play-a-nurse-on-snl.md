</div></div>					<p>Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer hosted <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, offering up silliness as well as her trademark no-BS attitude in a series of sketches and digital shorts. She also reflected on the dearth of decent roles for black women during her monologue, &quot;I played a nurse 16 times. I did it so many times that when I played a maid, they gave me an Oscar.&quot;</p>

<p>The best of the night were, as has been the case more and more lately, the digital shorts. There was &quot;Youngblood,&quot; a twist on the old guy (Kenan Thompson) playing chess in the park against a brash loudmouth youth (Pete Davidson), and &quot;Girl at a Bar,&quot; featuring Cecily Strong as a woman navigating the meat market, with nice guys trying to show off their feminist cred: &quot;I worked for Hillary.&quot; And there was also a fake trailer for a movie about a brave Republican who can stand up to President Trump.</p>

<p>The cold open touched on Trump via<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307224916/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/05/snl_cold_open_kate_mckinnon_as_jeff.php#photo-1"> Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>, and then Weekend Update had Michael Che and Colin Jost discussing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307224916/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/04/trump_claims_with_no_proof_that_bad.php">President&apos;s tweets</a>. There was also an appearance from the older Trump sons:</p>

<p>If anyone was hoping for some of Kate McKinnon&apos;s Kellyanne Conway, there were no specific Kellyanne sketches, but McKinnon did strike a &quot;Conway on the Oval Office couch&quot; pose on various sets during the show, popping up like an Easter egg. </p>

<p>Other sketches included how a pharmaceutical seems to name all of its products after an employee&apos;s family and friends; a TV cartoon knock-off of <em>Zootopia</em> had cast members showing off their celebrity impressions (Spencer did Oprah and Viola Davis; Melissa Villasenor had a pretty good J.Lo and Kathy Griffin; Mikey Day was a decent Hugh Grant); working at a sticky bun shop; the return of a fired employee; and what to do with Spencer&apos;s Gifts. </p>

<p>Next week, Scarlett Johansson will host, with musical guest Lorde. Let&apos;s hope they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307224916/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/15/scarlett-johanssons-role-in-ghost-in-the-shell-ignites-twitter-storm">talk about whitewashing</a>.</p>
