<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233140/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/06/man_moves_entire_apartment_usi.html">Daily Intel caught up</a> with a 24-year-old who moved from Queens to the Upper West Side, via the 7 train then the 1 train&#x2014;via a transfer at Times Square&#x2014;and thanks to his friends from his language school. Well, now they&apos;re his former friends after hauling Young Min&apos;s &quot;air conditioner, collapsible double-rod closet, dishes (including serving platters and utensils), laptop, linen, quilts, books, clothes, and assorted framed pictures, a soup cauldron, Korean medicine, condiments, and a 40-pound bag of rice... (Mid-trip, the air conditioner broke through the trunk holding it.)&quot;  </p>

<p>However, when Min asked for more help with his bed, &quot;his friends didn&apos;t return his calls and one even skipped their Kaplan class in order to avoid getting roped into another move.&quot; </p>
