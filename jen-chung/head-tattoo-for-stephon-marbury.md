<p>The NY Times described it as &quot;a replica of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://www.starbury.com/">Starbury shoe logo</a>&quot; while the Post said it was the &quot;&apos;3&apos; logo found on his Starbury sneaker and apparel line.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://deadspin.com/5024681/starbury-does-some-self+branding">Deadspin</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://www.sportsbybrooks.com/marburys-head-now-a-billboard-for-starbury-inc-18774">SPORTSbyBROOKS</a> each made their own renderings, inspiring us to imagine as well.  </p>

<p>Talk of an imminent Marbury departure has dominated Knicks scuttlebutt, since management has agreed to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/05/chris_duhon_to_join_knicks_marburys.php">deal with point guard Chris Duhon</a>, whose agent said, &quot;we&apos;ve been given all assurances that they&apos;re not bringing Chris here to sit on the bench.&quot;  Marbury told reporters on Friday, &#x201C;Right now, I&#x2019;ve been told that I&#x2019;m going to be playing basketball here...I mean, I love New York, I want to play basketball here. But I understand it&#x2019;s a business. And in this business, things happen. I don&#x2019;t take it personal. I just continue to do what I do.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Other great Marbury moments:  His rambling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/06/can_someone_mak.php">interview on Mike&apos;d Up</a>, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/15/stephon_marbury.php">love of the Big Onion</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/14/how_low_can_the.php">going AWOL</a>,  and admitting to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/13/marburys_slam_d.php">luring an MSG intern into his truck</a>.  And you can get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://www.starbury.com/">Starbury goods</a> at Steve &amp; Barry&apos;s (as long as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318220418/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/did_898_dresses_do_steve_barrys_in.php">they are still open</a>).  </p>
