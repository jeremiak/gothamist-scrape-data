The boy&apos;s five siblings,  ages 1 to 10, were injured in the blaze which apparently started from holiday candles&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090728/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/29/2010-09-29_boy_8_dies_in_brooklyn_house_fire.html">according to the Daily News</a>, the children were inside the house while their parents &quot;were eating dinner outside in a tent for the Simchat Torah holiday when they were startled by their children&apos;s cries for help.&quot; A witness said, &quot;The children were screaming. The parents heard them, but it was too late.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The father rushed into the house to try to save them; he was able to bring them out but couldn&apos;t reach his 8-year-old.  Firefighters tried to reach for the boy through the bedroom window&apos;s burglar bars; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090728/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7697398">witness told WABC 7,</a> &quot;They were trying to give him CPR, and you could see black foam in his mouth. And then all hell broke loose.&quot; </p>

<p>One witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090728/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/boy_dies_in_blaze_qRpDtGB55fHvIEIq57vUaP">told the Post</a>, &quot;I was around the corner when I heard an explosion and I started smelling smoke. I looked up and saw huge flames licking the sky coming from the middle of the house from the attic,&quot; while another said of the father, &quot;I don&apos;t know how he made it out alive.&quot;  A one-year-old girl in respiratory distress was taken to the hospital in critical condition while others were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.  Four firefighters were injured in the blaze as well.</p>
