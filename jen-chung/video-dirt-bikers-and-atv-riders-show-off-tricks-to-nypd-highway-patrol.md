title: Video: Dirt Bikers And ATV Riders Show Off Tricks To NYPD Highway Patrol
---

	
										<p>Yesterday the NYPD Facebook Live-streamed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021131011/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/17/the_nypds.php">a ceremonial crushing of seized ATVs and dirt bikes</a> to show how they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021131011/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/04/knuckleheads_ouch.php">cracking down on the &quot;clowns&quot; and &quot;nitwits&quot;</a> who ride them. But for every cathartic crushing there are many more instances of dirt bikers taunting the cops who are barred from chasing them.</p>

<p>According to our tipster, this ride happened last weekend, from Brooklyn to Queens. &quot;That&apos;s highway patrol next to the riders in marked and unmarked cars,&quot; the tipster says. Apparently the police officers in this incident didn&apos;t follow the riders and didn&apos;t arrest them.</p>

<p>The tipster added, &quot;In Manhattan, there was a group of about 30 that road from the Bronx into Harlem then west along 110th street to Broadway then all the way down to Times Square.&quot;</p>

<p>After incidents where police pursuits led to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021131011/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/13/cop_fatally_shots_man_on_atv_in_the.php">officer shooting an ATV driver</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021131011/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/graphic_video_of_nypd_car_fatally_h.php">motorcyclist being fatally struck</a> by a police cruiser, the department has retooled their strategy: NYPD Housing Chief Carlos Gomez said last month, &quot;We like to apprehend them as they are gassing up in the gas stations or as they are gathering in parks or deserted streets. We&apos;ll descend on the streets and apprehend as best we can.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD has asked the public to call 911 about garages where bikes are stored. The department is also using social media to brag about busts, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021131011/https://twitter.com/hashtag/UseItAndLoseIt?src=hash">with the hashtag #useitandloseit</a>:</p>

<p>We&apos;ve asked the NYPD for comment on these riders. In the meantime, enjoy this:</p>
