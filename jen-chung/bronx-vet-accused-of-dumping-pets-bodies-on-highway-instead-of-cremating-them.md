<p>Last month, there were worries there was a person killing animals in Westchester County, when the bodies of over 30 dogs and cats were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603070920/ttp://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/is_there_a_serial_animal_killer_on.php">found in garbage bags along the Hutchinson Parkway</a>. Now it turns out that there&apos;s no serial killer of animals, but there&apos;s still a depressing twist: Westchester County authorities say that Bronx veterinarian Andrew Manesis<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603070920/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Animals-Hutchinson-River-Parkway-Veterinarian-Arrest-155413865.html"> dumped the bodies after promising his clients &quot;proper burials&quot; for their pets.</a></p>

<p>Manesis allegedly took cash ($100-300) to cremate the pets.  Authorities tracked down Manesis after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603070920/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/29/bronx-vet-accused-of-promising-to-have-pets-cremated-dumping-them-instead/">contacting the owner of one of the cats found in a shoebox</a>. Sgt. Edward Reich said, &quot;The serial number from that shoebox was subpoenaed and the business records revealed the owner of the cat. That owner brought us to the veterinary office in the Bronx.&quot;  And the Westchester SPCA&apos;s  Enrnest Lungaro.  &#x201C;It was very, very disturbing &#x2014; reason being people place a lot of trust and faith in the vets. What he did was he betrayed that trust of his clients.&quot;</p>

<p>Manesis,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603070920/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-veterinarian-busted-dumping-dead-pets-hutchinson-river-parkway-westchester-article-1.1086324?localLinksEnabled=false"> who was charged with fraud,</a> violation of environmental conservation law and two counts of petit larceny,  told WCBS 2, &quot;[We&apos;re] grossly defending these allegations. We have a counsel for the hospital and I wish that this would be resolved. This is a disdainful situation,&quot; but one former client told the station that he wasn&apos;t happy with Manesis&apos;s diagnosis for his cat.  Apparently Manesis said his cat had a virus that would go away, but another vet &quot;just felt it for a second. The cat had a softball-size tumor in his stomach. They had to put the cat to sleep immediately.&quot;</p>
