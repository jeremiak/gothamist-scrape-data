<p>While his first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/video_obamas_first_2012_ad_attacks.php">re-election TV commercials start airing in key states today</a>, President Obama will be heading to New York City today to raise a little cash.  Among the stops are Spike Lee&apos;s Upper East Side townhouse (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/https://twitter.com/#!/SpikeLee/status/159953647554412544">someone is really excited!</a>) and the Apollo Theater. Which means&apos;ll be wreaking traffic havoc on the Upper East Side (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/http://twitter.com/#!/GridlockSam/status/160022911770570753">lots of</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/http://twitter.com/#!/GridlockSam/status/160023953157533697">street closures</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/http://twitter.com/#!/GridlockSam/status/160025558875508736">Harlem</a> (as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/http://twitter.com/#!/GridlockSam/status/159835033719422976">Triborough Bridge</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/http://twitter.com/#!/GridlockSam/status/160021849051381760">FDR Drive</a>)&#x2014;here&apos;s his agenda:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228053622/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2012/01/obama-hits-ny-for-starry-fundraising-hobnobs">Per the Daily News</a>, &quot;He&apos;ll start at the lavish Upper East Side restaurant, Daniel, where he&apos;s scheduled to meet with Jewish Leaders. Donors there will fork over $15,000 per plate. Next, Obama will attend dinner at Lee&apos;s brownstone on 63rd Street. The gathering will be small &#x2014; about 40 people &#x2014; and tickets begin at a cool $38,500 per person. He&apos;ll round out the day at the historic Apollo theater in Harlem, where [Al] Green and India.Arie, will perform. Tickets for that event start at $100 per person and soar to $25,000.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, many are unhappy with the President&#x2014;MoveOn, Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Harlem and locals will be there to make their concerns clear.  According to MoveOn, they will &quot;demand that the president hold the big banks accountable by ordering a federal investigation into Wall Street&apos;s involvement in the foreclosure crisis, and oppose a sweetheart deal that would give them immunity from investigation&quot; MoveOn&apos;s executive director Justin Ruben says, &#x201C;<strong>Millions of American jobs and homes have been lost, but the president has yet to hold the banks accountable for the fraudulent foreclosure practices that nearly torpedoed the economy.</strong> President Obama has the power to order a federal investigation and start the year with a real win for the 99% movement. It&#x2019;s far past time to hold the big banks responsible for the havoc they wreaked on homeowners and the economy.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And Occupy Harlem protester Nellie Bailey told the news that the fancy fundraising events in Harlem represent &quot;a profound disconnect the sitting President has with poor and working class Blacks that constitute his core base of support.&quot;  The protesters will be a half block from the Apollo,  at 163 West 125th Street (at 7th Ave), in front of the Adam Clayton Powell Building, at 6:15 p.m.</p>
