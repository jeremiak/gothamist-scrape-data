</div></div>					<p>The life of fashion designer L&apos;Wren Scott was celebrated in a private memorial yesterday. Her companion, Mick Jagger,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506212934/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/mick-jagger-sings-sad-song-wren-scott-memorial-article-1.1777908"> sang &quot;Just Like A Woman&quot;</a> at the service in St. Bartholomew&#x2019;s Church on Park Avenue.</p>

<p>The statuesque former model <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506212934/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/17/lwren_scott_mick_jaggers_girlfriend.php">had committed suicide</a> in her Chelsea apartment in March. Reports suggested that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506212934/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/18/lwren_scotts_fashion_label_owed_mil.php">she was deeply in debt</a> and that she was going to close down her clothing line. However, her friend, former NY Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn, said, &quot;Still, as painful as the decision must have been for her, I wouldn&#x2019;t draw any conclusions from it about her state of mind. Nor should any credence be given to reports of a breakup with Mick. It&#x2019;s rubbish.&quot;</p>
