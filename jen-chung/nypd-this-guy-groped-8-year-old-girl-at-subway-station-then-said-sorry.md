According to the NYPD, &quot;the 8-year-old female victim was walking behind her 39-year-old mother up the stairs when the unknown individual approached from behind and forcibly squeezed her buttocks twice, saying he was &apos;sorry.&apos; The individual then ran back toward the southbound 4 train and fled to parts unknown.&quot;</p>
