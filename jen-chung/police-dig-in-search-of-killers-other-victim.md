Gregory Wynder, who is serving a life sentence for the 2001 murder of a Harlem woman, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120614031318/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2008/05/22/2008-05-22_cops_dig_up_yard_in_serialslay_probe.html">claimed he killed two other women</a>--claims that Queens detectives believe are true--in a South Jamaica home where a girlfriend lived.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120614031318/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05222008/news/regionalnews/cops_in_grim_dig_for_buried_victim_112006.htm">&quot;handcuffed and shackled&quot; Wynder showed</a> detectives where on the 170th Street (near 105th Avenue) lot he supposedly buried the body of Jackie Torres, a homeless woman with whom he ran a shoplifting scheme.  However, the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120614031318/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/22/nyregion/22dig.html?ref=nyregion">did not find a body yesterday and do not plan to continue digging</a>, though they did take away bags of evidence.</p>

<p>Celeste Smith, the daughter of Wynder&apos;s girlfriend at 170th Street, remembered when he lived with them and told the Daily News her son used to say, &quot;<strong>I swear to God he killed somebody in the house.</strong>&quot;  She added she saw Wynder mopping up blood, but that he claimed it was Kool-Aid.</p>
