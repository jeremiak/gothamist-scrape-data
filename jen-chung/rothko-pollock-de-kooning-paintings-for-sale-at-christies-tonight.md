</div></div>					<p>Tonight, Christie&apos;s will have its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184300/http://www.christies.com/sales/post-war-contemporary-new-york-may-2012/evening-sale.aspx">Post-War and Contemporary Art auction</a> and the highlights include a 93&quot; x 81&#xBC;&quot; Mark Rothko painting, <em>Orange, Red, Yellow</em>, and Jackson Pollock&apos;s Lot 22 from 1951.  </p>

<p>The works are from the collection of David and Geraldine Pincus, a Philadelphia couple who started collecting on their honeymoon (she spotted Henry Moore at their hotel in Rome). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184300/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/arts/design/rothko-warhol-and-pollock-works-headed-to-auction.html">NY Times wrote</a> in March, &quot;Mr. Pincus died in December, and now Mrs. Pincus is selling a significant portion of her collection at Christie&#x2019;s in New York on May 8 and 9, including seminal examples of paintings by Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Willem de Kooning: Abstract artists who are all the rage now. The collection is expected to bring a total of about $100 million.&quot;  Geraldine Pincus explained, &quot;Our foundation&quot;&#x2014;which raises money for causes like pediatric AIDS, museums and hospital&#x2014;&quot;needs money.&quot;</p>

<p>The estimate for the Rothko is $35,000,000-$45,000,000. Christie&apos;s says its the most important Rothko for sale since <em>White Center</em>,  which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184300/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/16/rothko.php">sold for $72 million in 2007</a>. The Pollock&apos;s estimate is $20,000,000-30,000,000; the de Kooning included is <em>Untitled I</em>, which was shown at the Museum of Moden Art&apos;s retrospective, (estimate $8,000,000 - $12,000,000) and the Barnett Newman, <em>Onement V</em> from 1952, is believed to fetch between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000. </p>
