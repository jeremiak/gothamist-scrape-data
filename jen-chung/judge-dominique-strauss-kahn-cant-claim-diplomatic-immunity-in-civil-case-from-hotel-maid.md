<p>A Bronx judge has ruled that former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn cannot claim diplomatic immunity in a civil case from a hotel maid.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/judge_rejects_dsk_claim_of_diplomatic_Xy1QexU1hZxYcRFfa41oTO">According the Post</a>, Judge Douglas McKeon wrote, &quot;Confronted with well-stated law that his voluntary resignation from the IMF terminated any immunity which he enjoyed&#x2026; Mr. Strauss-Khan, threw [legally speaking that is] his own version of a Hail Mary pass.&quot;</p>

<p>Nearly a year ago, Nafissatou Diallo, a hotel maid at the Times Square Sofitel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/14/imf_head_arrested_at_jfk_accused_of.php">accused Strauss-Kahn</a> of trying to rape her and forcing her to perform oral sex on him in his suite.  Strauss-Kahn was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/imf_head_to_plead_not_guilty_to_sex.php">removed from an Air France flight back to Paris</a>, arrested, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/hotel_maid_ids_imf_head_as_her_atta.php">perp-walked to the Special Victims Unit</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/imf_heads_perp_walk_horrifies_the_f.php">incited an international incident</a>.  His lawyers claimed his innocence, insisting that his accuser had ulterior motives, and then it appeared the case against Strauss-Kahn was weak because the accuser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/30/report_authorities_suspect_dominiqu.php">had some inconsistencies in her story</a>. Eventually, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/tags/nafissatoudiallo">Diallo made herself public</a> and insisted the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/29/dsk-accuser_makes_glam_first_public.php"> attack was not a ploy</a> for money&#x2014;and the Manhattan DA&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/das_office_formally_requests_dismis.php">dropped charges against Strauss-Kahn</a>, much to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/23/dsk_accusers_meeting_with_das_offic.php">dismay of Diallo&apos;s lawyer</a>.</p>

<p>Diallo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/09/dsk_plans_to_defend_himself_from_ho.php">civil case claims a &quot;violent, sadistic attack&quot;</a>; the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022750/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/08/nafissatou-diallo-dsk-maid-launches-civil-lawsuit.html"> Daily Beast reported</a> last year that the lawsuit &quot;Specifically...cites an injury to Diallo&#x2019;s shoulder as well as &apos;redness&apos; on her vagina where Strauss-Kahn is alleged to have groped her, ripping her pantyhose and forcing her to her knees.&quot; Strauss-Kahn&apos;s lawyers said, &quot;We have maintained from the beginning that the motivation of [Diallo&apos;s lawyer Kenneth] Thompson and his client was to make money. The filing of this lawsuit ends any doubt on that question. The civil suit has no merit and Mr.Strauss-Kahn will defend it vigorously.&quot;</p>

<p>Judge McKeon also wrote in his decision today, &quot;Mr. Strauss-Khan cannot eschew immunity in an effort to clear his name only to embrace it now in an effort to deny Ms. Diallo the opportunity to clear hers.&quot; </p>
