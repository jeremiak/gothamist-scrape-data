<p>Yesterday, Mayor Bloomberg, when he was addressing Staten Island&apos;s 117-year-old Westerleigh Improvement Society, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229093545/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2010/06/on_staten_islander_mayor_bloom.html">showed off his iPad</a>, which he was using instead of paper notes.  But interacting with the touchscreen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229093545/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/02/2010-06-02_hizzoners_hitech_mike_says_his_move_to_ipad_saves_paper.html">was a little hard</a>: &quot;I put some notes on it [that] normally I have on my cards, and we&apos;ll see whether or not this works. Right away, I just went zipping off to the wrong place.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Daily News, Bloomberg&apos;s scheduler &quot;Shea Fink suggested Bloomberg trade in his usual thick daily briefing book for a special iPad version.&quot;  Bloomberg said he hoped it would save time and paper, &quot;We&apos;re going to have to do it with less. So maybe we can use technology to do that.&quot;  While he has no idea what else is on his iPad, it&apos;s possible he could run the city from the device (maybe he needs tips from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229093545/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/ray_kelly_feature.php">Ray Kelly</a>)&#x2014;heck, the Prime Minister of Norway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229093545/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/16/norwegian_pm_photo_ops_with_ipad_bi.php">relied on his iPad</a> when grounded in the state when the Eyjafjallajokull volcano erupted with the travel problem-causing ash.</p>
