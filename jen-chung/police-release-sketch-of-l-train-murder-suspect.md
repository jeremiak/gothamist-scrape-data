<p>Police say that the suspect and the victim, Joshua Basin, 20 of Howard Beach, were arguing on a L train.  The argument continued onto the Bedford Avenue platform, and cops say that the suspect initiated a physical altercation that eventually put both of them in the tracks.  The suspect managed to climb out of the tracks in time, while Basin remained in the tracks, where he was struck by a Manhattan-bound train. Basin was later pronounced dead at Bellevue.  Police responded to the scene around 10 p.m.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a white male, between 30 and 35 years old, with a thin build, light complexion, dirty blond hair with pock marks on the right side of his face. He was wearing brown pants, black rain jacket and black sneakers.  Police are asking anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.<br>
