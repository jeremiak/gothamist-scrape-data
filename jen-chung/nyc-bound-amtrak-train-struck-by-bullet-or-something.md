<p>Last night, an Amtrack Acela train traveling from Philadelphia to New York City was struck by an unknown object. A Brooklyn-based writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609075903/https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/693946661756932096">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Uhhhh someone just SHOT our Amtrak car.&quot;</p>

<p>The train, which had started in Washington D.C., was traveling near Bridesburg, PA, when an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609075903/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/31/amtrak-train-hit-by-unknown-object/">&quot;unknown object&quot; hit a window</a> around 7 p.m. Taylor Lorenz told WCBS 2, &quot;There was this great boom. Sounded like a tray table drop. Like really hard and strong and loud.&quot;</p>

<p>In a conversation with Philly.com, Lorenz explained, &quot;Everybody just looked around, like: &apos;Whaaaaat?!&apos; It sounded like a tray table being smashed really loudly, or something hitting the train from above the train. Where it hit, it looked like a bullet hit the train, like something pointy, not rounded, hit the glass. Somebody said: &apos;Somebody shot the train!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The train stopped at the Metropark station in NJ, where police boarded the train. Lorenz said, &quot;The conductor came over and said: &apos;Yeah, this has happened before.&apos; He said: &apos;Don&apos;t worry, the glass is really strong.&apos; We were like: &apos;What the hell, Amtrak?!&apos;&quot; Lorenz said. &quot;And because we were going through Philly, we were like: &apos;Of course this would happen in Philly.&apos; Baltimore is so sketchy. I was just glad it didn&apos;t happen in Baltimore, because people are always throwing shade on Baltimore.&quot;</p>

<p>No injuries were reported. Today, the National Transportation Safety Board is set to release documents related to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609075903/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/5_dead_over_50_injured_as_nyc-bound.php">May 2015 Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia</a>; that incident killed six people.</p>

<p>Lorenz, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609075903/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160202_Amtrak_train_window_shattered_by_object_in_NE_Philly.html">who takes the train regularly</a>, says, &quot;I feel like I&apos;ve seen it all. My Amtrak train hit and killed someone in July. But I&apos;ll keep taking it, because it&apos;s the only way to get around. I don&apos;t have a car, and the bus sucks.&quot;</p>
