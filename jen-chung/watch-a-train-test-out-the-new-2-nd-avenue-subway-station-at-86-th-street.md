<p>The MTA is still hoping the Second Avenue Subway, which had its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022054118/http://gothamist.com/entryTopics.php?record=http://gothamist.com/2007/04/09/video_groundbre.php">first groundbreaking ceremony in 1972</a> (at 103rd Street and 2nd Avenue), will open in December, despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022054118/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/27/second_avenue_delayway.php">delays (of course) with some stations</a>. In the meantime, we can cozy up with YouTube videos of test-trains on the future T line&apos;s tracks.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022054118/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/mta_2nd_ave_subway_video.php">video of a test train at the 63rd Street station</a> was uploaded. Now, there&apos;s a video at a brand new station, the one at 86th Street:</p>

<p>Uploader Bryan M. Wade writes, &quot;This northbound test-train entered 86th Street on the uptown track, paused and then proceeded north past 96th Street into the layups. Mayor Lindsay broke ground on that section in 1972. The test-train then headed back from the layups southbound on the uptown track, crossed over to the downtown track south of 96th and then proceeded south into 86th Street. After a short pause at 86th it continued south towards 72nd Street. Enjoy!&quot; [h/t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022054118/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/10/31/13476864/second-avenue-subway-station-test-trains-mta">Curbed</a>]</p>

<p>One consultant said earlier this month that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022054118/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/27/second_avenue_delayway.php">number of weekly tests had to be nearly tripled</a> if the MTA was going to meet its goal of a December opening. There are also issues about the train cars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022054118/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/22/mta_had_to_shave_down_second_avenue.php">being too big for the tunnels</a> at the curves. </p>

<p>The MTA is hoping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022054118/http://web.mta.info/capital/sas_alt.html">to build 16 new stations</a>.</p>
