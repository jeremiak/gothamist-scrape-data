Karen Santorum. Ann Romney. Now, do you really think our country is ready for a white first lady?&quot;  And when someone yelled, &quot;No!&quot; De Niro said, &quot;Too soon, right?&quot;  Well, that did not make Newt Gingrich very happy!<p></p>

<p>Gingrich said, &quot;I do want to say one thing, both on behalf of my wife and on behalf of Karen Santorum and on behalf of Ann Romney &#x2014; I think that Robert DeNiro&apos;s wrong. I think the country is ready for a new first lady and he doesn&apos;t have to describe it in racial terms.&quot;  The Republican presidential candidate/laggard added, &quot;What DeNiro said last night was inexcusable and the president should apologize for him. It was at an Obama fundraiser, it is exactly wrong, it divides the country. If people on the left want to talk about talk show hosts, then everybody in the country should hold the president accountable when someone at his event says something that is as utterly and terribly unacceptable as what Robert DeNiro said.&quot;  Yes, Newt Gingrich&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014054/http://dcist.com/2012/01/gingrichs_ex-wife_newt_asked_for_op.php">standing up for ladies</a>!</p>

<p>A campaign spokeswoman for the First Lady told Roll Call, &quot;We believe the joke was inappropriate.&quot; So now let&apos;s turn to how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014054/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117606/Beyonce-Robert-De-Niro-Stars-come-Michelle-Obamas-5k-fundraising-dinner.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">amazing Beyonce was looking</a> at the event!</p>
