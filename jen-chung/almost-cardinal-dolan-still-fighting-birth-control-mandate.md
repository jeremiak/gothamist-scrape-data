<p>Archbishop Timothy Dolan may be in Rome, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/vatican_elevates_archbishop_dolan_t.php">awaiting elevation to Cardinal</a>, but he&apos;s still thinking about making sure religious organizations&apos; insurance plans aren&apos;t compelled to give women free birth control.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/dolan_vows_to_fight_obama_birth_lYvEitx720ALivKX1DksEO">He told the Post</a>, &quot;<strong>We will now seek to remedy the situation through legislation if we have to at this point.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/21/archbishop_dolan_really_doesnt_want.php">Catholic leaders objected</a> to the White House&apos;s requirement that insurance plans from religious organizations (like Catholic universities and hospitals) would have to provide free contraception to women, and the situation became more heated as the rhetoric&#x2014;and media attention&#x2014;ratcheted up.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/obama_signals_coitus_interruptus_in.php">President Obama then decided</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/10/white_house_to_offer_contraception.php">offer a compromise</a> with a work-around where the insurance company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/10/obama_discusses_birth_control_its_n.php">will reach out the covered females</a>. But not before Dolan painted the president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/09/archbishop_dolan_basically_says_oba.php">as a huge liar</a>!</p>

<p>Dolan said he spoke to Senators Marco Rubio (R-Florida) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Virginia) about legislation that would allow employers to deny birth control contrary to religious beliefs, &quot;I speak to lawmakers - both Republican and Democrat - all the time. The legislative route is one way to try and remedy the issue. [Rubio&#x2019;s] bill would do that.&#x201D; Of course, the White House hates the bill (Obama did say, &quot;Whether you&#x2019;re a teacher, or a small businesswoman, or a nurse, or a janitor, no woman&#x2019;s health should depend on who she is or where she works or how much money she makes. Every woman should be in control of the decisions that affect her own health. Period.&quot;). </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215220725/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/02/14/international/i031847S34.DTL">cardinal-designate also said</a>, &quot;I couldn&apos;t see why the president would have any consternation [about the bill], because he said to me that religious freedom remains sacrosanct. Well, let&apos;s legislatively guarantee it.&quot;</p>
