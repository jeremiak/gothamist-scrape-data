<p>The Coast Guard is investigating a report of a possible downed aircraft, which was found eight miles north of the Mattituck Inlet.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Coast Guard, &quot;At approximately 8:50 a.m., Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound command center received notification from another aircraft operating in the vicinity. The aircraft was described as a small, white, experimental aircraft with a parachute deployed. A rescue boatcrew from Coast Guard Station New Haven from New Haven, Conn., are searching along with Suffolk County Marine as well as Riverhead and Southhold Emergency Medical Services.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The Coast Guard says, &quot;Mattituck Fire Department divers responded and recovered a body from the aircraft.&quot; The victim was the plane&apos;s male pilot, and it seems that he was the only person on the plane. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012253/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/u-s-coast-guard-reports-small-plane-has-crashed-north-of-mattituck-inlet-1.8701670">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;The FAA said the Coast Guard later confirmed the aircraft that crashed was an experimental, amateur built fixed-wing Raven powered by a Lycoming engine. FAA records indicate it is registered in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board will be leading the crash investigation. </p>
