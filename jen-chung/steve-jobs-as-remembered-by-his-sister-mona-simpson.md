Jobs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140340/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/apple_visionary_steve_jobs_dies_at.php">who died earlier this month</a>, was born two years before Simpson but their parents put him up for adoption; she was an adult when she found out who her brother was:</p><blockquote>I grew up as an only child, with a single mother. Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria, I imagined he looked like Omar Sharif. I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives (and our not yet furnished apartment) and help us. Later, after I&#x2019;d met my father, I tried to believe he&#x2019;d changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary, plotting a new world for the Arab people.<p></p>

<p>Even as a feminist, my whole life I&#x2019;d been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I&#x2019;d thought that man would be my father. When I was 25, I met that man and he was my brother.</p>

<p>By then, I lived in New York, where I was trying to write my first novel. I had a job at a small magazine in an office the size of a closet, with three other aspiring writers. When one day a lawyer called me &#x2014; me, the middle-class girl from California who hassled the boss to buy us health insurance &#x2014; and said his client was rich and famous and was my long-lost brother, the young editors went wild. This was 1985 and we worked at a cutting-edge literary magazine, but I&#x2019;d fallen into the plot of a Dickens novel and really, we all loved those best. The lawyer refused to tell me my brother&#x2019;s name and my colleagues started a betting pool. The leading candidate: John Travolta. I secretly hoped for a literary descendant of Henry James &#x2014; someone more talented than I, someone brilliant without even trying.</p>

<p>When I met Steve, he was a guy my age in jeans, Arab- or Jewish-looking and handsomer than Omar Sharif.</p></blockquote>Simpson describes telling her brother that she knows nothing about computers and how she considered getting a Cromemco: &quot;Steve told me it was a good thing I&#x2019;d waited. He said he was making something that was going to be insanely beautiful.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Simpson also describes his love for his family, his failures and successes, struggles with his health, and his last words.  Jobs&apos; biographer Walter Isaacson also has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140340/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/sunday/steve-jobss-genius.html?ref=opinion">Times op-ed making the case for Jobs as a genius</a>: &quot;In some ways, Mr. Jobs&#x2019;s ingenuity reminds me of that of Benjamin Franklin, one of my other biography subjects. Among the founders, Franklin was not the most profound thinker &#x2014; that distinction goes to Jefferson or Madison or Hamilton. But he was ingenious.&quot;</p>
