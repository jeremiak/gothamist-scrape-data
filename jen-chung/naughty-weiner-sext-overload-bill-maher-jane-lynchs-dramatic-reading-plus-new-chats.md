<p>In case reading Rep. Anthony Weiner&apos;s various <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080839/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/10/haiku_friday_zen_and_the_art_of_wei.php">explicit online messages as haikus</a> wasn&apos;t bizarre enough, last night, for his HBO program Real Time, Bill Maher staged a dramatic reading of the Congressman&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080839/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/07/more_raunchy_weiner_sexts_im_horny.php">raunchy sexts</a> with Vegas blackjack dealer Lisa Weiss&#x2014;with the incomparable Jane Lynch reading Weiss&apos; words. See the video below&#x2014; yes, Lynch did say, &quot;c*ck-sucking Republicans&quot; with gusto! Of course, Maher will need to stage another reading next week, because Radar Online has unearthed some explicit, insane messages Weiner made to Georgia teacher Traci Nobles.</p>

<p>Nobles was outed at the fifth known Weiner sext partner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080839/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jun/08/another-rep-weiner-sexting-partner-emerges-relucta/">by her roommate</a> (Nobles claims the roommate took a screenshot of her Facebook account) earlier this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080839/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/06/weiner-dirty-emails-traci-nobles-weinergate-scandal-twitter-facebook">Radar reports</a> that she sent Weiner the message, &quot;i cant stop thinking about you, I&apos;m touching myself as we speak, i want you (censored, describes a sex act), i need to see you mr. congressman, please don&apos;t disappoint me!&quot; So Weiner wrote back on May 6, <strong>&quot;Please understand i am a very important man. I&apos;m always busy, but I promise i will make time for you soon!  Don&apos;t the pictures i send keep you satisfied?</strong>&#x201D;  Then:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;YES BABY I UNDERSTAND. BUT THIS WEEK I&apos;VE BEEN EXTREMELY HOT FOR YOU!!!!! I WANT TO DO THINGS TO YOU I KNOW YOUR WIFE WON&apos;T... PICS ARE NOT ENOUGH.  :-(&#x201C; Nobles explained to the philandering New York lawmaker on May 6, 2011.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;So i will make sure to keep some time open so we can have a cyber session via skype. Does that make my hot sexy baby happy?&#x201D; Weiner responded the next day.</p></blockquote><br>
Weiner does not have any plans to resign, but, then again, a week ago, he was claiming his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080839/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/weinergate_weiner_calls_a_lawyer_no.php">Twitter account was hacked</a>&#x2014;resulting in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080839/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php">underwear-clad crotch shot</a>&#x2014; when actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080839/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/crying_weiner_admits_to_sending_exp.php">he did attempt to send the image</a> as a direct message.<p></p>
