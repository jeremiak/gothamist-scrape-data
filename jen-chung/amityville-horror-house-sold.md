The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151458/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/25/amityville_horror_house_for_sale_as.php">so-called &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; house</a> was just sold!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151458/http://www.newsday.com/classifieds/real-estate/real-li-1.812034/amityville-horror-house-goes-into-contract-1.2179904">Newsday reports</a> that five-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath home went into contract this week; the buyers apparently &quot;wanted to get on the water in a big, old classic house.&quot;</p>

However, another owner of the house said, &quot;Nothing weird ever happened, except for people coming by because of the book and the movie.&quot; Which is why they changed the address. </p>

<p>The house was on the market for 70 days, which another broker said was a &quot;very good turn-around time.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear how much the house sold for, but it does look really nice in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151458/http://public6.superlativestudio.com/IDXDetail.aspx?mlstableid=LIBORMLSDGALEOFFICERES&amp;mlsnum=2294176&amp;sp=y&amp;segmentid=0&amp;uid=69327&amp;sid=65331&amp;htmlfile=shell_idxsearch.html">listing&apos;s photographs</a>.</p>
