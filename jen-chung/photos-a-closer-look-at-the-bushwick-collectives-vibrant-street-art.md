</div></div>					<p>Last week, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011423/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/28/photos_28_pieces_of_street_art_that.php#photo-1">looked at the &quot;Bushwick Five Points,&quot;</a> a.k.a., the Bushwick Collective, a street art haven that&apos;s sprouted at the intersection of Troutman Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, where a growing number of artists have painted elaborate murals. Yesterday the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011423/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/nyregion/a-son-of-bushwick-turns-the-neighborhood-into-a-gallery-for-street-art.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">took a closer look at the street art destination</a> and its curator Joe Ficalora.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011423/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/nyregion/a-son-of-bushwick-turns-the-neighborhood-into-a-gallery-for-street-art.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">According to the Times</a>, &quot;Joseph&#x2019;s father, Ignazio Ficalora, was murdered on these streets in 1991. He was knifed for his wallet and a worthless chain around his neck when his son was only 12.&quot; Last year, his mother died after a battling a brain tumor for four years. </p>

<p>Ficarola explained, &quot;What was the point of life then? You come down this block, you see graffiti on the walls, you remember all bad memories. I turn another corner, I see where my dad was murdered. I turn another corner, I have memories of my mom. There was nothing left for me to want.&quot; (He told Street Art NYC, &apos;I was moved to transform the cold industrial aura of this area into something that would revive me and provide the artists with a space to showcase their talents.  I am trying to create an environment that I couldn&#x2019;t get as a child.&apos;) Ficalora has managed to get walls from numerous businesses and says he has &quot;a lot of walls in my back pocket.&quot;</p>

<p>The expanding installation has attracted a growing number of admirers who travel to Bushwick to take in the work. Australian street artist The Yok told the Times, &quot;There&#x2019;s nowhere to paint in Manhattan, so the Bushwick Collective gives all those people that come a spot to be up in New York, which is kind of everyone&#x2019;s dream&quot; while &quot;A woman with a face tattoo and two toddlers in tow paused in front of one mural. &apos;All this fantastic art keeps popping up,&apos; she said, spinning her head to scan the walls. &apos;I love it.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s resident street art expert, Jake Dobkin, says, &quot;I like many of the pieces around the intersection of St. Nicholas and Jefferson&#x2014;although some artists I know feel like it&apos;s starting to look too much like a poster store, with the pieces so close together. It&apos;s always like that at these spots: There are great pieces, but you lose the context&#x2014;like seeing a lone Swoon piece in the middle of a neighborhood with no other art.&quot;</p>

<p>He points out, &quot;The artists like having a legal spot to paint, and it&apos;s like all the kitchen supplies stores on Bowery&#x2014;when you cluster together you can generate more foot traffic.  And it can be fun to paint collaborations with other artists. The best street art really considers its context&#x2014;like Banksy pieces that make use of the stuff already on the street.  A legal spot like this has less opportunities for that kind of thoughtfulness.  But it does make it easier for fans to see a bunch of art all in one place, and that&apos;s important for learning about the scene.  Especially with Five Pointz getting razed, you need a spot like this.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, for those taking advantage of the beautiful weather to check out more street art, Dobkin suggests, &quot;There are a few other good spots right by there, too- at Gardner and Johnson there&apos;s the Robots Will Kill buildings, and at Meserole and Waterbury there&apos;s another legal spot with a lot of art.&quot;</p>
