</div></div><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050609/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Eisenberg_Rich">Denise Rich</a>, the songwriter, philanthropist and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050609/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,98756,00.html">Clinton Presidential Library donor</a>, is putting her Fifth Avenue duplex on the market for $65 million, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050609/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/pad_is_oh_so_rich_G1uI9bbtnb79DExCnjxJ3I">makes it the most expensive co-op ever</a>.  </p>

<p>The Post describes the 12,000-square-foot home, &quot;The digs are so expansive that Rich &#x2014; who penned the lyrics to such hits as the Aretha Franklin-Mary J. Blige duet, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Waste Your Time,&#x201D; and Mandy Moore&#x2019;s &#x201C;Candy&#x201D; &#x2014; once converted one of her three terraces into a professional-grade figure-skating rink for a blowout party. The other two outdoor spaces are a rooftop terrace that can hold up to 200 people and a separate wraparound terrace. Stevie Wonder has tickled the ivories of her baby grand piano, which takes up only a fraction of the living room, and Celine Dion has sung in the apartment&#x2019;s personal recording studio.&quot; Yes, there&apos;s a recording studio inside. </p>

<p>There are seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, and three kitchens. The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050609/http://www.corcoran.com/property/listing.aspx?Region=NYC&amp;ListingID=2290618&amp;ohDat="> listing adds</a>, &quot;The upper level is home to the grand salon and the most amazing views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline to be found. The room has beautiful striated marble floors, 11&apos; ceilings and custom mahogany doors.&quot; Rich, 67, is downsizing, because her daughters live in Europe, telling the Post, &quot;This apartment has been an incredible home... I don&#x2019;t have the need for this type of space. My greatest hope is that the next family loves and enjoys this home as much as we did.&quot; </p>

<p>Since this is not as expensive as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050609/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/ex-citi_chair_lists_15_cpw_apartmen.php">$88 million Central Park West condo</a> that Sandy Weill sold to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050609/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/russian_billionaire_supposedly_boug.php">Russian billionaire&apos;s daughter</a>, we assume that the listing&apos;s mention &quot;Pied-a-terre and International purchasers welcomed&quot; means that the co-op would be okay with Chinese, Brazilian, or Russian big bucks.</p>
