<p>As expected, the full MTA board approved a new budget that includes s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070211/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/14/mta_doomsday_has_dawned_major_servi.php">ervice cuts on subways, buses</a>,  commuter railroads and paratransit&#x2014; plus the controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070211/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/15/doomsday_cuts_could_cause_uptick_in.php">phase-out of student fares</a>.  The agency found it would be over $400 million short, after the State underestimated tax revenue, the State Legislature decided to eliminate some funding, and a judge ordered the MTA to pay transit union raises.  </p>

I wish there was a way to do it fast enough to take the things off the table that we&#x2019;re talking about today; I don&#x2019;t think we can.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the cuts offered up are closing the W and Z lines and reducing service the G and M; eliminating and cutting bus routes; making students pay for their student Metrocards (currently free); cutting paratransit service;  and pay cuts for non-union MTA positions.

We must not be afraid to eliminate work that is unnecessary.... The reality is that the majority of our costs come from labor.&quot;</p>
