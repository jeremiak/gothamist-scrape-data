<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806124754/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/dont_bring_your_gun_to_the_911_memo.php">deja vu again</a>: A Wisconsin woman visiting the 9/11 Memorial yesterday was arrested after a security guard screening her bag spotted a gun in the purse.</p>

<p>Ursula Jerry, 41, had a .380-caliber semi-automatic Kel-Tec gun in her purse. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806124754/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/22/woman-arrested-with-gun-at-911-memorial/?mod=WSJBlog">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;The weapon had two rounds in the magazine-none were in the chamber, the official said.&quot; Jerry also told cops, &quot;<strong>I travel with this from home on Amtrak to New York City. I don&#x2019;t mean harm to anyone.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Jerry has a permit for the gun in Wisconsin, but not NYC. Responsible gun owners would know that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806124754/http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-laws/new-york.aspx">New York City is really horrible</a> and requires a NYC gun permit, which means out-of-towners are out of luck. </p>
