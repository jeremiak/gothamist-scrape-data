                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_09_mileybna.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_mileybna.jpg" width="640" height="604"> <br> <i> Via Miley Cyrus&apos; Twitter</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940/http://terrysdiary.com/post/63000740309/miley-cyrus-in-nyc-14">seeing snapshots</a> from her photo shoot with Terry Richardson, it&apos;s unclear whether anyone wants to think about Miley Cyrus&apos; &quot;creative juices.&quot; But now we are&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940/http://pagesix.com/2013/10/04/miley-bickers-with-sinead-plans-wild-hosting-stint-on-snl/">thanks to Page Six</a>!</p>

<p>Tonight, Cyrus is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/your_miley_cyrus_snl_promos_are_her.php">hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>, as well as performing as musical guest, and now the show will likely tackle her Twitter tussle with Sinead O&apos;Connor. O&apos;Connor wrote two public letters, first asking the 20-year-old singer-actress-provocateur to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/sinead_oconnor_to_miley_cyrus_what.php">&quot;stop prostituting herself&quot;</a> and then, after Cyrus mocked her, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/sinead_pens_2nd_letter_to_miley.php">in a second missive</a>, O&apos;Connor said, &quot;Who the fuck is advising you? Because taking me on is even more fuckin&apos; stupid than behaving like a prostitute and calling it feminism.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Page Six, &quot;We&#x2019;re told that all the recent controversy over her raunchy behavior &#x2014; and public battle with Sinead O&#x2019;Connor &#x2014; has just &apos;got Miley&#x2019;s creative juices flowing,&apos; as insiders describe it. One NBC source told us of the &apos;We Can&#x2019;t Stop&apos; singer, &apos;She has been coming up with so many wild ideas that Lorne Michaels has had to rein her in. No topless twerking. Her mom is there with her.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>While cast members are reportedly &quot;jockeying to play O&#x2019;Connor,&quot; Page Six says, &quot;another TV source said, &apos;The biggest coup would be to get Sinead herself.&apos;&quot;  Or O&apos;Connor can make an appearance on SNL next month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940/http://www.sineadoconnor.com/tour-dates/">when she&apos;s in New York</a>, to show that Lorne Michaels has ended the &quot;lifetime ban&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061940/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCOIQOGXOg0">over her Pope photo-tearing</a>. </p>

<p>Anyway, we&apos;d settle for the Wrecking Ball Kitten:</p>
