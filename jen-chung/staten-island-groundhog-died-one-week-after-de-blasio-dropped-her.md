<p>A beloved tradition may have turned tragic: It turns out that the Staten Island Zoo groundhog that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319003428/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/02/staten_island_chuck_doesnt_bite_de.php">Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped on Groundhog Day</a> <em>died from &quot;internal injuries&quot;</em> a week later. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319003428/http://nypost.com/2014/09/25/groundhog-dropped-by-de-blasio-died-of-internal-injuries/">The Post declares</a>, &quot;<strong>then the coverup began</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently, after the real Staten Island Chuck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319003428/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/02/mayor_bloomberg_vs_staten_island_ch.php">bit Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009</a>, the zoo starting subbing out Chuck for his lady friend Charlotte. (Bloomberg started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319003428/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/staten_island_chuck_predicts.php">wearing the huge gloves in 2010</a>). From the Post:</p><blockquote>The zoo doesn&#x2019;t make public that it has stand-in groundhogs to protect the &#x201C;groundhog brand,&#x201D; insiders said.<p></p>

<p>A zoo spokesman tried to downplay the mayor&#x2019;s role in the critter&#x2019;s death, saying the animal was examined and seemed fine. &#x201C;It appears unlikely that the animal&#x2019;s death is related to the events on Groundhog Day,&#x201D; the spokesman said.</p></blockquote>Charlotte was found dead in her pen on February 9, and the Post points out, &quot;She had fallen nearly 6-feet when the mayor lost his grip during the Groundhog Day photo-op. Sources said her injuries were consistent with a fall.&quot;<p></p>

<p>When the Post informed the Mayor&apos;s office, spokesman Phil Walzak said, &quot;We were unaware that Staten Island Chuck had passed but are sorry to hear of the loss.&quot; </p>

<p>The groundhog that de Blasio will meet in February is Chuck and Charlotte&apos;s daughter, Charlotte (Jr.). </p>
