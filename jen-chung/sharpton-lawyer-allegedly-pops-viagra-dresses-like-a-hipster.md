</div></div>					<p>Over the weekend, it was revealed that prominent attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324041743/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/05/nypd_investigating_rape_accusations.php">Sanford Rubenstein was under investigation for allegedly raping</a> a woman after his friend Rev. Al Sharpton&apos;s 60th birthday party. Investigators from the NYPD were seen removing evidence&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324041743/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/lawyers-alleged-rape-victim-confident-evidence-indict-sanford-rubenstein-article-1.1965099">including a mattress</a>&#x2014;from Rubenstein&apos;s Upper East Side apartment as his accuser&apos;s lawyer said, &quot;There&#x2019;s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein. We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.... We expected the district attorney to do the right thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Rubenstein is known for representing victims of police brutality, such as Abner Louima, Sandra Amezquita, and the families of Sean Bell and Eric Garner, and is often at Sharpton&apos;s press conferences. The victim is, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324041743/http://nypost.com/2014/10/05/nypd-investigating-lawyer-for-alleged-rape-after-sharpton-party/">according to the NY Post</a>, &quot;a 42-year-old retail company executive and longtime top aide to Sharpton at the National Action Network.&quot; A source said, &quot;She is scared and embarrassed.&quot;</p>

<p>There are many &quot;sources&quot; providing sordid quotes to the tabloids. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324041743/http://nypost.com/2014/10/07/sharpton-lawyer-accused-of-rape-is-hung-like-a-cashew/">Post has these details about Rubenstein</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;The guy&#x2019;s hung like a cashew,&#x201D; a source said Monday of Rubenstein, with a neighbor adding that the 70-year-old lawyer relies on amenities such as stretch limos to attract women...<p></p>

<p>He is frequently seen squiring around women barely out of their teens, the longtime neighbor said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Not the kind of women you&#x2019;d expect. He uses the penthouse and the limo to [attract] them,&#x201D; said the neighbor outside Rubenstein&#x2019;s East 64th Street building.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Every time I see him, he wants to tell me about his latest m&#xE9;nage &#xE0; trois. It&#x2019;s all about sex with this guy. He&#x2019;s a real p-&#x200A;-&#x200A;-y hound.&#x201D;</p>

<p>..While Rubenstein is frequently seen at news conferences in flashy, peaked-lapel suits, he usually wears tight jeans and T-shirts in his off-hours, his neighbor said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He dresses like a hipster kid, like the [women] he&#x2019;s trying to [attract],&#x201D; the neighbor added.</p></blockquote>Others claim he pops Viagra and frequents strip clubs regularly (&quot;Every girl would be like, &#x2018;Hi Sandy!&#x2019;&quot;) and likes tall women. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324041743/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/alleged-victim-awoke-encounter-sanford-rubenstein-source-exclusive-article-1.1963982">from the Daily News</a>:<blockquote>The woman allegedly raped by Sanford Rubenstein awoke the next morning and had sex with him again, a source close to the powerhouse attorney told the Daily News.<p></p>

<p>That version of events, in which the pair had consensual sex, conflicted with one presented by a police source, who said the 42-year-old victim awoke from a booze-filled haze to find she was having sex with the 70-year-old lawyer.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a classic he said, she said. She&#x2019;s claiming she was attacked. He said it was consensual,&#x201D; a police source said of the incident following the Rev. Al Sharpton&#x2019;s 60th birthday bash Wednesday.</p></blockquote>A colleague for the victim&apos;s attorney pointed out that Rubenstein&apos;s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn, &quot;They&#x2019;re trying to demonize this woman in the process,. Her world has turned upside down. This is a mother, someone who&#x2019;s gainfully employed. She&#x2019;s a pillar of the community, a board member. This is a horrible situation for her, almost surreal.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Sharpton said on Sunday, &quot;I don&#x2019;t care how close we are. If he&#x2019;s wrong, he&#x2019;s wrong. If he&#x2019;s right, we&#x2019;ll see.&quot; </p>
