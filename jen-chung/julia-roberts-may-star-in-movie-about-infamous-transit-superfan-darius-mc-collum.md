<p>Notorious NYC mass transit thief who has been, uh, appropriating subways and buses since 1981 is getting the Hollywood treatment with one of the biggest stars: Julia Roberts is reportedly interested in starring in a film about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://gothamist.com/tags/dariusmccollum">Darius McCollum</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/julia-roberts-crime-dram-train-man-darius-mccollum-1201729771/">According to Variety</a> the film, called <em>Train Man</em>, will be about &quot;the criminal (and Internet celebrity) known for impersonating public transit authorities in order to drive away subway trains and Greyhound buses. McCollum, who is diagnosed with Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome, has been arrested more than 25 times for such crimes.&quot; His early heists (starting at age 15) will also be shown throughout the film via flashbacks. </p>

<p>Roberts will portray his most recent lawyer, and those who have read the script by Simon Stephenson (of the U.K. series &#x201C;Eleventh Hour&#x201D;) tell that Variety it&#x2019;s a meaty role for Roberts, along the lines of her Oscar-winning portrait in 2000&#x2019;s &apos;Erin Brockovich.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>McCollum was most recently arrested last November <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/12/bus_thief_busted.php">for stealing a Greyhound bus</a> from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. He was pulled over in Brooklyn, by police officers who heard the alert; McCollum apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/serial-mass-transit-thief-arrested-stealing-bus-n-article-1.2431732">told the authorities</a>, &quot;Next time I&#x2019;m taking a plane.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_03_dariusmccollum.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_03_dariusmccollum.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Darius McCollum (Facebook)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>His first brush with the law was when he commandeered an E train in 1981, taking it &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323394504578609752550093808?alg=y">from 34th Street to the World Trade Center</a> without the conductor or passengers reporting anything amiss.&quot; McCollum&apos;s mother has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/nyregion/15arrest.html">said she&apos;s gone into debt</a>, hiring lawyers for him repeatedly. </p>

<p>Mostly recently, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/15/darius_mccollum_counter_terrorism.php">lawyer Sally Butler suggested</a> that McCollum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192425/http://nypost.com/2015/11/13/serial-transit-thief-should-be-hired-as-a-consultant-lawyer/">could help the authorities</a>, since he obviously knows how to exploit weaknesses in the system, &quot;He walked with them through the system, showing them where things were vulnerable. And obviously, he still knows them. If anyone can walk up in Port Authority and steal a bus, do you think we need some assistance?&quot;</p>

<p>McCollum, now 50-years-old, faces charges including grand larceny, criminal impersonation of a public servant and unauthorized use of a vehicle. He is currently being held on $50,000 bail or $100,000 bond at Rikers. His next court date is March 21st.</p>
