<p>Bowery Boogie had a last meal there:</p><blockquote>It&#x2019;s just after midnight when we finally get inside. Baklava is what we want, but like much of the menu, it&#x2019;s no longer available. We settle on the delicious lentil soup. With each slurp we savor the simplicity of the joint: the faded photography, Marco artwork (e.g. Berecat), the collection of PBA cards at the cash register, etc. Then it&#x2019;s back into the night&#x2026;<p></p>

<p>Several readers were quick to mention, though, that Bereket is in fact moving to an unspecified location, possibly to a space over on Allen Street. But, to be honest, this seems unlikely. Even the employees serving us were skeptical it would happen. We nevertheless remain hopeful that a relocation does come to pass, and that the customers follow its journey.</p></blockquote>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516095653/http://evgrieve.com/2014/06/bereket-has-closed.html">EV Grieve reported</a> that its &quot;reader Bill Imprint stopped by around 1 a.m., and the quick-serve Turkish restaurant had already run out of falafels and doner kebab sandwiches with several hours to go.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Bereket says that people should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516095653/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=691976440837417&amp;set=a.564806626887733.1073741826.111692215532512&amp;type=1&amp;comment_id=692269277474800&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=5">follow their Facebook page for more news</a> on a location change. Meanwhile, Bowery Boogie worries about developer Ben Shaoul&apos;s plans for the block, since he&apos;s bought up property where establishments like &quot;Lobster Joint, Ray&#x2019;s Pizza, Empanada Mama, the bodega, 200 Orchard, Taqueria, Karaoke Boho&quot; operate.</p>
