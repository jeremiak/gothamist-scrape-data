                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_01_metrocin.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_01_metrocin.jpg" width="150" height="180" class="image-right"> </span>Sigh.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01062009/business/deal_for_1540_bway_147352.htm">Post&apos;s Steve Cuozzo reveals</a> that the former Metro Theater, on the Upper West Side at Broadway and 99th Street, will become a 15,000 square foot Urban Outfitters over three-and-a-half floors: &quot;It will be the seventh Manhattan location for the teen-oriented clothing chain, which bucked prevailing trends and enjoyed a 31 percent earnings increase last year.&quot;  The 20-year lease is &quot;worth $1 million a year to start with 12 percent increases every five years.&quot;</p>

<p>Winick Realty Group president Benjamin Fox tells the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/from-metro-theater-to-urban-outfitters/">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s a testament to Urban&#x2019;s strength in the marketplace and to their design approach. There were other spaces of similar size available, but the way they build their interiors is such that they fell in love with this place because of its uniqueness.&#x201D;  The exterior of the building&#x2014;Times reporter David Dunlap calls it an &quot;Art Deco jewel box&quot;&#x2014;is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011/http://cinematreasures.org/news/14166_0_1_0_C/">landmarked</a> but its interior was gutted and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/what-to-make-of-the-metro-theater/">ornate grille work and other detailing were lost</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011/http://cinematreasures.org/theater/287/">Cinema Treasures notes</a> that the Metro originally had first-run movie, before showing adult films in the 1970s and 1980s (the economy), and a CT commenter reminds that the Metro was also a revival house.  It was immortalized in Woody Allen&apos;s Hannah and Her Sisters in this scene:</p>

<p>The new Urban Outfitters is expected to open in 12 months or so.  And the Beekman Theater (also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011/http://www.filmbuffonline.com/News/2005/BeekmanTheatreCloses.htm">seen in an Allen film</a>) was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014011/http://cinematreasures.org/theater/306/">demolished a few years ago</a> to make way for a Memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer center.</p>
