Why?&quot;  Well, it&apos;s also closed to vehicular traffic in <em>both</em> directions&#x2014;apparently there are two suspicious packages, one in each direction!  You can send us photos and tips at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153324/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tips@gothamist.com</a>.  <b>UPDATE</b> 10:55 a.m.:  Now the bridge is reopened&#x2014;the suspicious packages were...flashlights from a leukemia walk.</p>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153324/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/brooklyn/brooklyn-bridge-closed-suspicious-package-20101015-kc">apparently the NYPD got a call</a> about a flashlight on the pedestrian walkway; the AP says there was a copper wire around the flashlight. Last night was the &quot;Light the Night&quot; walk for the Lymphoma and Leukemia Society.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153324/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/about_us/public_affairs/light-the-night-for-cancer-research">According to MyFoxNY</a>, &quot;During this highly visible event, participants carry illuminated red balloons, survivors carry white balloons and gold balloons are carried in memory of loved ones lost.&quot;  Balloons?  Are we sure there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153324/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/15/ufos_are_from_mars_cover-ups_are_fr.php">wasn&apos;t a UFO by the bridge</a>?</p>
