</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317021910/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/14/nypd_civil_forfeiture.php">disturbing use of civil forfeiture</a> by many cities and states to line their coffers has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317021910/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/">on the rise</a>, and Last Week Tonight took up the topic and framed it the only way most of us can understand: In the guise of a <em>Law &amp; Order</em> episode.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317021910/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/08/12/taken">The New Yorker put it in an excellent piece last year</a>, &quot;In general, you needn&#x2019;t be found guilty to have your assets claimed by law enforcement; in some states, suspicion on par with &#x201C;probable cause&#x201D; is sufficient. Nor must you be charged with a crime, or even accused of one. Unlike criminal forfeiture, which requires that a person be convicted of an offense before his or her property is confiscated, civil forfeiture amounts to a lawsuit filed directly against a possession, regardless of its owner&#x2019;s guilt or innocence.&quot; John Oliver emphasized the absurdity of this, noting one 1986 case, &quot;The United States v. Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($8,850) in United State Currency.&quot;</p>

<p>After going through the Kafka-esque reality of civil forfeiture, Oliver introduces <em>Law &amp; Order: Civil Asset Forfeiture Unit</em> at the 14-minute mark, complete with <em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em> alums Jeff Goldblum and Kathryn Erbe; <em>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</em>&apos;s Robert John Burke; John Fiore, reprising his role as Detective Tony Profaci from <em>Law &amp; Order</em>; and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317021910/https://twitter.com/LastWeekTonight/status/518966318666899456">Chung-Chung</a> sound:</p>

<p>Many property owners are unable to afford lawyers to fight these claims, but in one instance, a Bronx man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317021910/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/14/nypd_civil_forfeiture.php">got his $4,800 back with help from the Bronx Defenders</a>&#x2014;but not exactly his $4,800. His money was deposited into the NYPD pension fund soon after its was seized; when he was given a check a year later, that money came from the city&apos;s general fund (a.k.a. taxpayer money). Some lawmakers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317021910/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/nypd_takes_the_money.php">expressed interest in reforming the practice</a>, but the allure remains, since it&apos;s so easy.</p>
