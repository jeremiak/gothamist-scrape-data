<p>You know who doesn&apos;t like that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515065302/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/anti-christine_quinn_ads_she_has_1.php">anti-Christine Quinn ad</a> that says she has a terrible record on progressive issues? City Council Speaker Quinn! And her campaign is trying to get Time Warner Cable to stop running the ad.</p>

<p>Currently, the ad is running on NY1. It features a voiceover saying things like &quot;Virtually all of Christine Quinn&#x2019;s decisions were made in rooms just like this, with her friends in the 1%&quot; and &quot;All that&#x2019;s clear when the smoke lifts is her political ambition.&quot; Her campaign lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515065302/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130409/new-york-city/christine-quinn-threatens-sue-tv-stations-for-airing-critical-ads">wrote in a cease-and-desist</a>, &quot;Your station need not air the subject ad. If you choose to do so, however your station bears responsibility for its content.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515065302/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ad_nausea_for_quinn_apAFXf20zca2MqQHPX3TnJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">From the NY Post</a>:</p><blockquote>Quinn&#x2019;s campaign attorney, Jerry Goldfeder, disputes the ad&#x2019;s characterization of Quinn as on the &#x201C;wrong side&#x201D; of a bill forcing companies taking city subsidies to pay a so-called living wage of $11.50 an hour. <p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Although opponents of a candidate often resort to fanciful broadsides (as with the cigar smoke permeating this ad), facts must not be fabricated or distorted,&#x201D; Goldfeder wrote to Time Warner [which owns NY1]. &#x201C;In truth and in fact, Speaker Quinn led the City Council in passing a living-wage bill.&#x201D; Quinn ended up passing the living-wage bill last year after substantially weakening it.</p></blockquote>Quinn said, &quot;You&apos;re simply not allowed to put ads on television or anywhere else that distort the truth and make factually incorrect claims,&quot; but Chelsea Connor, representing the group that made the opposition ad, counters, &quot;The filing of a cease and desist against Time Warner Cable today is a desperate attempt from the Quinn campaign to stop a campaign that is based on the facts ... and was approved by the legal department at Time Warner.&quot; However, Time Warner&apos;s legal department didn&apos;t actually approve the ad. Here was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515065302/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/04/quinn-campaign-asks-time-warner-to-yank-negative-ads">Time Warner&apos;s response to Goldfeder</a>:<blockquote>Mr. Goldfeder,<br>
We have received your letter concerning the &#x201C;NYC is Not for Sale&#x201D; ad involving your client, Ms. Quinn. We are taking immediate action to address your concerns in accordance with Time Warner Cable Media policy in these matters. We have asked the NYC is Not for Sale group to provide, without delay, substantiation supporting the claims contained in the spot as they have the right and opportunity to defend your client&#x2019;s challenge and request to take their spot off the air.<br>
The NYC is Not for Sale spot will continue to air as ordered unless we arrive at a decision to act otherwise.<br>
We will contact you immediately once a decision is rendered.<br>
Please feel free to contact me with any questions.<p></p>

<p>RA<br>
Rich Ambrose<br>
Time Warner Cable Media</p></blockquote>Here&apos;s the ad:<p></p>

<p>Quinn&apos;s rivals criticized her attempt to stop the ads, with Bill Thompson telling DNAinfo, &quot;I think it&apos;s bit much and it&apos;s very over-the-top. I think it is an attempt to intimidate the press, attempt to intimidate the stations, and I think it&apos;s wrong.&quot; And Bill de Blasio&#x2014;who denied his involvement in the opposition group&#x2014;said, &quot;People are expressing their anger, and that is part of the public discourse. I think the notion of any candidate suggesting that something shouldn&apos;t be aired publicly is problematic.&quot;<br>
