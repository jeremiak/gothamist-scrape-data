<p>The 81-year-old man whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165421/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/two_teens_shoved_81-yr-old_man_into.php">iPhone was stolen and then was shoved into Brooklyn subway tracks</a> says that he&apos;s thankful to the subway riders in the station who helped him.  Andrew Wang, who spent three days in the hospital after the incident at the Lorimer Street J train station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165421/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/82-year-old-man-hurled-subway-tracks-thugs-thanks-god-good-samaritans-article-1.1027371?localLinksEnabled=false">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;Other people came and helped me. It was God who helped. Thank God, I&#x2019;m all right.&quot;  </p>

<p>Wang, who walks with a cane, told the News that he was checking his iPhone on Friday morning. &quot;Suddenly, the guy grabs my phone. I wouldn&#x2019;t let him have it. We struggled and he got it, all that was left was the cover.... I yelled and chased him down the platform. I wanted other people on the platform to know that he robbed me.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165421/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Elderly-Man-Subway-Thief-iPhone-Tracks-Push-Suspect-Brooklyn-139963573.html">Then</a>, &quot;I chased him a little bit, and about 10 steps later, another guy just pushed me and I fell down.&quot;  </p>

<p>Wang suffered a sprained ankle, cuts and bruises.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165421/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/push_guy_oh_fu_Dej7TxbXdcx0silBXMr6aP">He told the Post</a>, &quot;I learned kung fu when I was 10. I couldn&#x2019;t remember how to do it.&quot;  Here&apos;s video of Wang:</p>

<p>NBC New York reports that two teens, ages 15 and 17, were arrested and charges are pending.  Wang also said, &quot;They are young and have a lot of chances to do good. They can still turn their lives around. I wish only to get my iPhone back.&quot;</p>
