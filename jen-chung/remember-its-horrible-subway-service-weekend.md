<p>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221011653/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/widespread_subway_interruptions_com.php">mentioned earlier</a>, 18 of the 20 subway lines are undergoing weekend service changes. Why?  Because NYC Transit is performing work on the lines that can&apos;t be done during harsher weather.  We&apos;ve got the laundry of service changes after the jump, but the topline is:Riders on the 5, A, F, G, L and E get the shuttle-bus transfer at various points along their routes; the 1, 2, 7, B, N, J and R will skip a section of stops; the 4, 6 and Q lines will run express at times, bypassing more stops; and the D will run on the N during midday hours tomorrow, skipping 12 Brooklyn stops. The lines that aren&apos;t getting the service treatment? The M, the Times Square shuttle and the Franklin Avenue shuttle.</p>

<p>One subway rider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221011653/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/107069/riders-brace-for-citywide-subway-disruptions">told the NY1</a>, &quot;It&apos;s gonna be a problem for me, even to find an alternate train route. I can&apos;t take an alternate train route because they are all going to be effected. Not only that, weekends you expect to relax a little, you expect it to be smoother, easier, less crowded, more space,&quot; while another, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221011653/http://wcbstv.com/consumer/mta.service.problems.2.1238199.html">speaking to WCBS 2</a>, estimated his usual 30-minute ride would take more like 90 minutes.  Bring a whole lot of patience&#x2014;and a magazine or <em>War and Peace</em>.  </p>
