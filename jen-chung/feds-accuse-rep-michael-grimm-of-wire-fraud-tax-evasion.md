<p>Justice Department officials have hit Rep. Michael Grimm with a slew of charges, including wire fraud, mail fraud and tax fraud. FBI Assistant Director George Venizelos was unsparing in his statement: &quot;As a former FBI agent, Rep. Grimm should understand the motto: fidelity, bravery, and integrity. Yet he broke our credo at nearly every turn. In this 20-count indictment, Rep. Grimm lived by a new motto: fraud, perjury, and obstruction.&quot;</p>

<p>While the FBI had been investigating donations to Grimm, a Republican, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052027/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/nyregion/rabbis-followers-say-money-given-to-grimms-house-race-broke-the-law.html?pagewanted=all">from the mystic rabbi Yosef Pinto</a>, the indictment relates to Grimm&apos;s pre-Congressional years Upper East Side restaurant, Healthalicious&#x2014;and Grimm&apos;s alleged attempt to avoid paying taxes on wages. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052027/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/grimm_leaves_home_to_face_the.html#incart_big-photo">According to the State Island Advance</a>: </p><blockquote>In total, he&apos;s accused of concealing more than $1 million in Healthalicious gross receipts and hundreds of thousands of dollars of employees&apos; wages.<p></p>

<p>From 2007 to 2010, Grimm paid workers -- many of whom were allegedly undocumented immigrants -- in cash and did not report those wages to federal and state authorities, according to the indictment. By under-reporting the true amount of payroll to the New York State Insurance Fund, Grimm received lower monthly workers&apos; compensation premiums, the indictment alleges.</p>

<p>Additionally, by under-reporting the amount of gross receipts the restaurant earned, he dramatically lowered the taxes the restaurant owed to both the state and federal government, the indictment alleges.</p></blockquote>U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said, &quot;He deliberately planned to systematically lie to every taxing authority to whom his business had an obligation to report... Michael Grimm never met a tax he didn&apos;t like to evade.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Grimm is up for re-election, and some Republicans have suggested the indictment is politically motivated, especially since it might be too late for the GOP to suggest a different Republican candidate. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052027/http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/michael-grimm-in-custody-106090.html">Politico reports</a> that Lynch &quot;rejected claims of playing politics by indicting Grimm after the filing deadline closed for his race. Grimm is now almost certain to be on the ballot in November, giving Democrats a pick-up opportunity on a seat they&#x2019;ve long targeted. &apos;When you investigate a case like this, we follow the evidence,&apos; Lynch said. &apos;It&#x2019;s just as irresponsible to bring it before it&#x2019;s ready.&apos;&quot;</p>
