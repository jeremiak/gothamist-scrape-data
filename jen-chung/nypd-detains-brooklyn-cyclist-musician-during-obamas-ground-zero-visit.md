<p>The cops grabbed and held a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160909115305/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/05/cops-question-cyclist-claiming-to-be-secret-service-during-presidents-nyc-visit/">&quot;pushy&quot;</a> bicyclist with their guns drawn during an incident that occurred during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160909115305/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/05/obama_lays_wreath_at_ground_zero_me.php">President Obama&apos;s visit at Ground Zero.</a>  Matthew Duhaime had apparently been yelling in the crowd, &quot;Secret Service, coming through!&quot; while carrying a messenger bag and pushing a bike.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160909115305/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/05/2011-05-05_suspicious_man_tackled_by_nypd_cops_secret_service_close_to_president_obamas_vis.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Cops jumped over barricades near a post office and rushed toward [him],&quot; while yelling, &quot;It&apos;s him! It&apos;s the guy with the Cubs hat!&quot; </p>

<p>Cops apparently thought that Duhaime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160909115305/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_detain_cyclist_during_president_0ZLrqIueWipkAcTo5bGoeL">was acting suspiciously</a> (obviously Cubs-following bicyclists are trouble!) and threw him to the ground.  A cop reportedly yelled, &quot;No guns! No guns! We got him!&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160909115305/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/05/05/brooklyn-man-briefly-detained-during-obamas-visit/">Wall Street Journal says</a> that the cops acted because Duhaime, 30, &quot;had earlier been waving his Chicago Cubs hat and then reached into his backpack.&quot; The NYPD said that two counterterrorism cops were concerned that he could &quot;have been signaling the president&#x2019;s arrival to possible cohorts, then possibly reaching in his backpack for a weapon or bomb.&quot;  Duhaime&apos;s bag was checked and he eventually released.</p>

<p>Duhaime, who moved to Brooklyn from Chicago, has been pretty excited about Osama bin Laden&apos;s death: He has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160909115305/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEAHPAyb2fI&amp;feature=player_embedded">singing at Ground Zero</a> and even wrote a song about Bin Laden&apos;s demise (which he appears to have removed from YouTube).</p>
