<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163429/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/nyregion/03poll.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times conducted its own poll</a> of New York City residents to find out how they feel about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163429/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosque">Park 51 mosque and community center</a> project proposed for 45-47 Park Place, which is two blocks from the World Trade Center site. And guess what&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163429/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/nyregion/03poll.html?ref=nyregion">many want it to move</a>: &quot;Two-thirds of New York City residents want a planned Muslim community center and mosque to be relocated to a less controversial site farther away from ground zero in Lower Manhattan, including many who describe themselves as supporters of the project.&quot; </p>

<p>A 71-year-old Bensonhurst resident said, &quot;My granddaughter and I were having this conversation and she said stopping them from building is going against the freedom of religion guaranteed by our Constitution. I absolutely agree with her except in this case. <strong>I think everything in this world is not black and white; there is always a gray area and the gray area right now is sensitivity to those affected by 9/11, the survivors of the people lost</strong>.&quot;  And a 56-year-old Upper West Side resident added, &quot;Freedom of religion is one of the guarantees we give in this country, so they are free to worship where they<strong> chose. I just think it&#x2019;s very bad manners on their part to be so insensitive as to put a mosque in that area.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Some other findings: &quot;Thirty-three percent said that compared with other American citizens, Muslims were more sympathetic to terrorists. And nearly 60 percent said people they know had negative feelings toward Muslims because of 9/11. Over all, 50 percent of those surveyed oppose building the project two blocks north of the World Trade Center site, even though a majority believe that the developers have the right to do so. Thirty-five percent favor it.&quot;  Oh, and &quot;One-fifth said [it should be moved] at least 20 blocks, while almost the same number said at least 10 blocks. Seven percent said at least five blocks.&quot; </p>

<p>This poll comes after a Quinnipiac poll of NY state residents which foun<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163429/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/poll_71_of_nyers_says_mosque_should.php">d 71% think the mosque should move</a>.  Developers will need to raise millions to tear down the building, which used to house a Burlington Coat Factory, and put up the planned 13-story complex, and there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163429/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/builders_of_nyc_mosque_face_financial_2CvaRDlDl3MFFd058UuOvK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">significant financial hurdles</a>.</p>
