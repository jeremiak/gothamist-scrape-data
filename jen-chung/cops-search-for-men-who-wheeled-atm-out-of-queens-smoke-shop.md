<p>Police are searching for a pair of brazen ATM robbers who strolled into a Queens convenience store and rolled the ATM away over the weekend. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, it happened on Sunday, June 12th, at 1:38 p.m. at the Ozone Howard Smoke Shop at 137-20 Cross Bay Boulevard: &quot;[T]he two suspects placed the store&apos;s ATM on a hand truck, wheeled it outside and loaded it onto their vehicle. When the store&apos;s 53 year-old male employee tried to intervene, one of the males displayed a handgun. The suspects fled in the vehicle, westbound on 149 Avenue.&quot; Now they just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124620/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_wQqNIUBu8">have to figure out how to open it</a>.</p>
