</div></div><p>Kris Humphries, a forward for the NJ Nets and also boyfriend of Kim Kardashian, visited the Barclays Center, the former site of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/04/its_official_no_gehry_at_brooklyn_n.php">Frank Gehry-designed sports arena</a> (now it&apos;s something that look like <strike><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/09/times_savages_new_brooklyn_nets_are.php">an airplane hanger</a></strike> a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/09/new_atlantic_yards_renderings_show.php?gallery0Pic=6#photo-6">modified airplane hanger</a>), where his team is supposed to play.  In fact, Barclays Center CEO Brett Yormark, who happens to be the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://www.nba.com/nets/news/brett_yormark.html">Nets CEO</a>, says the area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/14/dtg_netstourbarclays_2011_04_08_bk.html">will open on September 28, 2012</a>.  And Humphries can&apos;t wait.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/2011/04/04/2011-04-04_watch_out_melo_nets_star_kris_humphries_says_rivalry_with_knicks_will_heat_up_wi.html">He told reporters</a>, &quot;Hopefully we can get everyone in Brooklyn to come out and support us and build the tradition the Knicks have... There is a rivalry now. Just think about what it will be like out in Brooklyn.&quot; And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703806304576243280634692062.html">Wall Street Journal&apos;s Jason Gay also attended the press event</a>:</p><blockquote>On Monday I rode my bike in Brooklyn, because I live there, and because that&apos;s what terrible people do in Brooklyn&#x2014;load up their hemp backpacks with baguettes and copies of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; and ride their bikes everywhere, ruining civic life in New York City.<p></p>

<p>But lo, the outlaw behavior gets crazier. I rode my Satan bike in a Satanic bike lane to see the Nets. The New Jersey Nets&#x2014;currently rattling around the trunk of the NBA&apos;s Eastern Conference&#x2014;are coming soon to the magnificent birthplace of Lena Horne and Woody Allen and the adopted home of a lot of dudes who can&apos;t stop yapping about the final LCD Soundsystem show. (To take every lazy Brooklyn stereotype to the extreme, please read this story while chomping an artisanal pickle. And growing a mustache. And converting your Satan bike to a single speed.)</p></blockquote>According to Gay, &quot;[Humphries]  said he wasn&apos;t sure if he would live in Brooklyn, though he&apos;d heard &quot;there are some real great places to stay.&quot; He said he didn&apos;t mind if parents wanted to bring their babies into Park Slope bars. OK, just kidding about that last part.&quot;<p></p>

<p>As for rumors that the Barclays Center will be the only thing built at the Atlantic Yards, based on developer Forest City Ratner&apos;s SEC filings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/mike_believes_atl_yards_hoopla_DSPDRGUzwuT4smq4Qj9TIN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Mayor Bloomberg said</a>, &quot;I talked to Bruce Ratner as late as 30 minutes ago, and let me tell you, he thinks his business is going very well out there and he&apos;s very optimistic about Atlantic Yards.&quot; He also sarcastically explained that SEC filings are supposed to point out any and all potential problems, &quot;It does say that the world could come to an end. And it might. It does say everybody could give up watching basketball -- that&apos;s a possibility.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, and Kris?  Apparently Kim says she&apos;d <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407093420/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/kim-kardashian-would-accept-marriage-proposal_1211279">accept your marriage proposal</a>, if you want to make one!</p>
