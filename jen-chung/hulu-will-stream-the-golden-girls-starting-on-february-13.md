<p>Yesterday, during the Television Critics Association, Hulu announced it won the rights to stream all seven seasons of the NBC hit sitcom, <em>The Golden Girls</em>. The show, which featured stories about four older women sharing a home in Miami, will be available on February 13, aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319093602/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galentine&apos;s_Day">Galentine&apos;s Day</a>.</p>

<p>The show, which premiered on September 14, 1985, followed the friendship of femme fatale Blanche (Rue McClanhan), naive Rose (Betty White), sarcastic Dorothy from Brooklyn (Bea Arthur) and Dorothy&apos;s mother Sophia (Estelle Getty), who was an immigrant from Italy and began her anecdotes with, &quot;Picture it, Sicily, 1922...&quot;</p>

<p><em>The Golden Girls</em> featured a lot of sexual innuendo&#x2014;it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319093602/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessmjordan/sex-and-the-city-is-basically-pre-golden-girls-115gs?utm_term=.edYLmz0dE#.vcd8LRaAv">basically</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319093602/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/arts/television-the-prequel-and-sequel-to-sex-and-the-city.html">template for <em>Sex and the City</em></a>&#x2014;and was a hit with viewers of all ages. My parents let me watch it when I was in the fourth grade because it was on Saturday nights!</p>

<p>The show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319093602/https://medium.com/@traceylross/30-years-later-the-golden-girls-is-still-the-most-progressive-show-on-television-b63aadd2edec#.wpxsffxs7">tackled a number of issues</a>, including AIDS, interracial marriage, assisted suicide, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319093602/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpNS8jYniLY">safe sex</a>, immigration and, in one episode, same-sex marriage (Blanche&apos;s brother announces he and his partner will have a commitment ceremony):</p>

<p>I also learned that a lanai is a fancy word for a porch and how all problems can be solved with cheesecake:</p>

<p>Craig Erwich, Hulu content chief, talked about the challenges of making sure Hulu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319093602/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hulu-craig-erwich-tca-golden-girls-handmaids-tale-1201954853/">had a compelling selection of programming</a>, &quot;You need to have a pretty wide variety of shows &#x2014; and then within that we try to have the best shows in each category. You want to have the &#x2018;Empires&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Golden Girls&#x2019; and the &#x2018;South Parks&#x2019; because you can&#x2019;t have everything.&quot;</p>
