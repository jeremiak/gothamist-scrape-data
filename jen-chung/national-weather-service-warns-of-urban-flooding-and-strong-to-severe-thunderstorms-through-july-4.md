<p>While many people are trying to figure out if their rooftops might provide a good view of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706122706/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/de_blasios_new_york_fireworks_comin.php">East River July 4th fireworks</a> or make plans to check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706122706/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/01/nyc_fireworks_2014.php">other displays</a>, Mother Nature might change those plans with Tropical Storm Arthur.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706122706/http://nypost.com/2014/07/01/fourth-of-july-might-be-a-washout-in-nyc/">According to the Post</a>, an Accuweather meteorologist, Paul Walker, said that Arthur, which is off Florida, &quot;could become a hurricane by the time it reaches the North Carolina coastline on Thursday. Once it hits Carolina, the system is expected to veer east as it heads north and shouldn&#x2019;t hit New York with anything close to Sandy-like strength. But it&#x2019;ll likely bring rain to New York on Friday morning, according to forecasts. The high temperature is forecast to be 77 degrees on Friday afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>Walker also said, &quot;The best-case scenario is that things will dry out by the afternoon and evening, in time for the fireworks.&quot; </p>

<p>The National Weather Service issued a &quot;Weather Briefing&quot; that outlines what&apos;ll happen for our area:</p>

<p>As for Arthur, the NWS says, &quot;Low probability of direct wind and rain impacts from Arthur. Periods of Heavy Rain and Thunderstorms likely with slow moving cold front Thu aft thru Fri. High surf, Dangerous rip currents, and rough ocean/inlet conditions likely late Fri thru Sat.&quot; According to a graphic, we can expect around 1.75-2 inches of rain.</p>

<p>A Macy&apos;s spokeswoman told the Post they are &quot;Confident, not cocky &#x2026; [that] the show will go on.&quot;</p>
