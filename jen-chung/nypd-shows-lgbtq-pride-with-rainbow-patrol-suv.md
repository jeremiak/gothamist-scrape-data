<p>It&apos;s Pride Week in NYC, and the NYPD is ready for the crowning event: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024181725/https://www.nycpride.org/events/the-march/">big Pride March</a> on Sunday. But some police vehicles are already getting into the spirit. Yesterday, the Orlando Police Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024181725/https://twitter.com/OrlandoPolice/status/745669517578207232">Tweeted a photograph of an NYPD SUV</a> with rainbow details, &quot;Some love from NYPD.  Thank you All!.  #OrlandoUnited&quot; </p>

<p>On a window, it says, &quot;Our &#x2665; goes out to Orlando,&quot; and on a door, instead of &quot;Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect,&quot; it says, &quot;Pride, Equality, Peace.&quot;</p>

<p>But there&apos;s a bigger question that remains: Will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024181725/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/29/gay_pride_dancing_cop.php">hot cops be dancing</a> along the parade route?

Here are two of New York&apos;s Finest throwing down:</p>

<p>The march steps off at noon on Sunday, June 26th; it starts at 36th Street and Fifth Avenue, travels down Fifth Avenue and makes its way to end at Christopher and Greenwich Streets (here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024181725/https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-pride/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-NYC-Pride-March-Route.pdf">PDF of the parade route</a>).</p>
