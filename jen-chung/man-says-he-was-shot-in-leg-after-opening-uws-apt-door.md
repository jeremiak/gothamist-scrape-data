The Post reports, &quot;The 20-year-old victim said in a 911 call that he let two men into his building on West 100th Street near Riverside Drive believing they were deliverymen, and they attempted to rob him in his fifth-floor, blasting him in the leg.&quot; The NYPD is investigating his claims.<p></p>

<p>One neighbor saw the victim being carried on stretcher and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120329054605/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-shot-leg-opening-door-upper-west-side-walkup-article-1.1051268">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;He said to the cops, &#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;m alive at least, aren&#x2019;t I?&quot; Another neighbor said to the Post, &quot;This is a very quiet building. I was very, very afraid. This never, ever happens.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the alleged gunmen is described as being 6&apos;4&quot; and 250 pounds with a White Sox cap.  Some nearby residents bemoaned an apparent uptick in crime, &quot;This area has gotten worse &#x2014; the robbers run to (Riverside Park) to escape, they don&#x2019;t run to the street. That makes it easy for the bad guys.&quot; Apparently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120329054605/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120327/upper-west-side/more-cops-added-uws-streets-address-increase-property-thefts">police have increased patrols</a> in the area to address those concerns.<br>
