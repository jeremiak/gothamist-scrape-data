<p>The U.S. Postal Service shut down its beloved Operation Santa program, where people can take letters to Santa written by needy children and send those kids gifts.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111114202223/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/nyregion/19santa.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times has the grim explanation</a>: </p><blockquote>A Postal Service official in Washington, after an initial, limited acknowledgment of a &#x201C;privacy breach,&#x201D; said that at one of the programs, not New York&#x2019;s, a man whom a letter carrier recognized as a registered sex offender had &#x201C;adopted&#x201D; a letter. When postal officials confronted the man, the official said, he said he was sincerely trying to do a good deed, but postal inspectors nonetheless retrieved the letter and notified the family of the child.</blockquote>Oh, man.  The U.S.P.S. tells the Times the program&apos;s closing might be temporary, with this possible reworking for Manhattan&apos;s program: &quot;Names and addresses will be blacked out and letters will be numbered. Instead of sending gifts directly, gift-givers will need to take wrapped presents to the post office and provide the recipient&#x2019;s number. The post office will then send them out.&quot;  <p></p>
