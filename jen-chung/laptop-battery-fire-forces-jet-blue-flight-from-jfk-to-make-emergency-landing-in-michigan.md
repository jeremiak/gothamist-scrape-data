<p>A flight from JFK Airport, headed to San Francisco, was diverted to Michigan on Tuesday night when a laptop battery caught fire. </p>

<p>The flight left New York at 6:25 p.m. and was scheduled to land at SFO at 8:53 p.m. Pacific time, but ended up at Michigan&apos;s Ford Airport in Grand Rapids at 8:12 p.m. CST.</p>

<p>One passenger, Kat Honniball, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624235831/http://www.wzzm13.com/news/local/metro/reported-laptop-fire-forces-jetblue-flight-to-land-at-ford-airport/444297221">told the ABC affiliate</a> that &quot;a man a few rows behind her smelled smoke and noticed it was somebody&apos;s backpack burning.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was stunned,&quot; she said, but added that she &quot;knew something was going to happen because you know, lithium batteries catching on fire when you&apos;re up at 38,000 feet&#x2014;you can&apos;t help but think you gotta do something. So I was prepared for it.&quot; </p>

<p>In a statement, the FAA said, &quot;JetBlue 915 from New York&apos;s JFK to San Francisco diverted to Grand Rapids, Michigan following reports of smoke emitting from a carry-on bag holding an electronic device. The flight landed safely and the aircraft is being inspected by maintenance crews before customers continue on to San Francisco.&quot;</p>

<p>The United States is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624235831/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/30/confusion-laptop-flight-ban-us-denies-eu-reports-proposals-have/">considering a ban on laptops on flights</a> between the U.S. and Europe. No decision has been made yet, but a European Commission official told the Telegraph yesterday, &quot;[Homeland] Secretary [John] Kelly affirmed he will implement any and all measures necessary to secure commercial aircraft flying to the United States - including prohibiting large electronic devices from the passenger cabin&#x2014;if the intelligence and threat level warrant it.&quot;</p>
