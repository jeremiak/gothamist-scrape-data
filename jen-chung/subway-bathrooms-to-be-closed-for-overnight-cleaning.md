<p>Some subway riders and transit advocates are upset about NYC Transit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309054225/http://www.amny.com/news/local/transportation/am-potty0521,0,2315984.story">closing subway bathrooms between midnight and 5 a.m. for cleaning</a>.  As AMNY puts it, &quot;Subway toilets are the pit stop of last resort,&quot; but many New Yorkers, whether they are &quot;leaving bars, clubs, or their work shift,&quot; rely on them.  One ironworker said, &quot;Where do I go now? Wet my pants?&quot;</p>

<p>Others suggest the closings will mean worse things--one station agent says, &quot;<strong>If the riders can&apos;t use the public toilets, they&apos;re going to use the train station as a toilet.</strong>&quot;--and others are skeptical the cleanings will really need to take 5 hours.  But NYC Transit wants to make sure the bathrooms are clean and one cleaner explained, &quot;The public is just nasty.&quot;</p>

<p>There are 78 public bathrooms in the NYC subway system.  And there was a pivotal scene set in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309054225/http://www.nycsubway.org/biblio/movies.html">subway bathroom in The Warriors</a>.</p>
