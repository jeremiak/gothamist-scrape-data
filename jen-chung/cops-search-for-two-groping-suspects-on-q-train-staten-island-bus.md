<p>The first incident was on Staten Island on Thursday, February 18th. Police say that at 6:25 p.m., a 25-year-old woman was on a S53 bus near McClean Avenue and Lily Pond Avenue &quot;when an unidentified male grabbed her buttocks and fled.&quot;<br>
 <br>
A photo of the suspect (right) was released. He is described as being an adult male last seen wearing a green jacket, dark gray hooded sweatshirt underneath, a hat and a backpack.</p>

<p>The second incident took place on Sunday, March 6th, at 7:22 a.m. According to the NYPD, a 54-year-old woman was on a Manhattan-bound Q train when &quot;an unidentified male seated beside a 54-year-old female victim reached over and rubbed his hand on her&quot; inner thigh. </p>

Then she reported the incident to the police. <br>
 <br>
The Q train suspect (photo left) is described as 25-30 years old with an afro. He was last seen wearing a black jacket with gray sleeves, gray jeans and black sneakers.<br>
 <br>
Anyone with information in regards to either of these incidents is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617130555/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on, etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617130555/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. Don&apos;t let the perverts win.</p>
