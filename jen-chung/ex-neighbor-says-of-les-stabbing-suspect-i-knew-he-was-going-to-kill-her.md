<p>Raul Barrera, the man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110429005830/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/10/boyfriend_confesses_to_stabbing_wom.php">allegedly confessed to fatally stabbing</a> his girlfriend in a Lower East Side apartment, was arraigned on second-degree murder charges, held without bail, and put on suicide watch yesterday.  Barrera, 33, is accused of attacking Sarah Coit, 23, with a knife so brutally that her internal organs were showing by the time the police arrived to the apartment at 63 Clinton Street. But a woman who used to live next to the couple said, &quot;I knew he was going to kill her...His eyes were insane. He was a killer.&quot;</p>

<p>Colleen Carerir, who lived in the same East 33rd Street building as Barrera, a PR professional, and Coit, a former Hunter College student who was working at Lacoste, before they moved downtown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110429005830/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/killer_charm_N4fRhl9rEy43nscdnotFJM#ixzz1JK7X6oga">told the Post</a> that she once called the police on Barrera: &quot;I heard her violent screams,&quot; and in January, she called 911 &quot;when I thought he was killing her... He had her in the bathtub, and it sounded like he was filling it with water. I think he was strangling her. She was screaming a lot and coughing.&quot; Careir added, &quot;He wasn&apos;t human. He was a monster. He looked at me like I was a piece of meat. I worked at Bellevue with mental patients, and they had nothing on this guy.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110429005830/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/12/2011-04-12_suspect_fled_after_brutal_e_side_killing_but_father_urged_him_to_turn_self_in_to.html#ixzz1JK8y6YIJ">Daily News has the violent details on how Coit was attacked</a> on Sunday: </p><blockquote>Barrera pulled several knives from a wooden butcher block early Sunday, cops said. Then, in a fit of rage, he used them to gouge Coit&apos;s pretty face. He sliced her across the mouth and jaw, and with such force that one of the tips of the blades broke, authorities said.<p></p>

<p>The blow that killed the 23-year-old blond was a stab to the left side of her back, an autopsy revealed. It left &quot;a gaping stab wound to the left side of the torso from which internal organs were protruding,&quot; court records show.</p></blockquote>A source told the News, &quot;It was pure anger...He didn&apos;t want her to leave, and he didn&apos;t want her to be beautiful for anyone else.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Barrera fled the apartment and was headed to Penn Station, but he called his father, who convinced him to turn himself in.  The News reports that Barrera&apos;s father allegedly said, &quot;There&apos;s no way to hide. It would go easier on you ... if you turned yourself in.&quot; The Post says that Barrera has a history of seven domestic violence incidents with former girlfriends.  His former boss, B.J. Coleman, said, &quot;He wasn&apos;t a monster. He was ambitious. This is not someone who goes around hacking people.&quot;</p>

<p>Coit died about an hour after the police arrived.  While neighbors could hear the screaming and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110429005830/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/11/police_received_four_911_calls_abou.php">four 911 calls were made</a>, it turns out three of the calls had the wrong address:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110429005830/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/killer_charm_N4fRhl9rEy43nscdnotFJM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Three people living in a building next door called 911 and told operators the yelling was coming from their apartment building. Two others also called 911, and they, too, gave the wrong address.&quot; </p>
