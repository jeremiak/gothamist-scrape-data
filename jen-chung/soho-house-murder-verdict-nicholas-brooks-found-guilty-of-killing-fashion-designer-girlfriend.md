<p>A jury found the son of an Oscar-winning composer guilty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820175513/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/10/boyfriend_questioned_in_fashion_des.php#photo-1">murdering his girlfriend</a> at the Soho House in 2010.

<p>While Brooks&apos; lawyer claimed her death was accidental, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820175513/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/12/29/2010-12-29_sylvie_cachays_soho_house_death_ruled_homicide_boyfriend_nick_brooks_will_likely.html">ME&apos;s findings showed</a> that &quot;bruises on her neck, bleeding in her eyes and abrasions inside her mouth from chewing her lips - injuries consistent with asphyxiation.&quot; Further, the couple had a volatile relationship&#x2014;prosecutors pointed to an email Cachay, an aspiring swimsuit designer, sent to Brooks, demanding that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820175513/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/nyregion/jurors-hear-of-turbulent-relationship-in-sylvie-cachay-murder-trial.html">stop being a hard-drinking, pot-smoking slacker</a>. In another email, referring to his cheating on her, she wrote, &quot;Nick, for the past six months I have supported you financially and emotionally. I am speaking with the credit card company and the police and I am going tell them that I never allowed you to use my card. I don&#x2019;t care. Have fun in jail. Sylvie.&quot; </p>
