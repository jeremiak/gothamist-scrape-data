Layoffs prevailed.&quot;  Now, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015020/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/nyregion/23building.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Now Mr. Leviev is back with a partner and a new plan to turn the 15-story building, where printing presses once churned out newspapers, into a glamorous three-decker sandwich, with <strong>a vertical mall that includes luxury shops on the lower floors, along with exhibition space and a stylish bowling alley and nightclub surrounded by seven restaurants. A high-end hotel with as many as 379 rooms would sit in the middle, and 26 penthouse condominiums on top</strong>.&quot;</p>
