<p>A 32-year-old dancer who has performed in videos for Beyonce and also teaches in NYC has been reported missing. Shirlene Quigley was apparently last seen &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028223945/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Missing-Dancer-Celebrity-Shirlene-Quigley-Manhattan-New-Jersey-Beyonce-Phone-Chelsea-398210081.html">getting on a bus at Port Authority around 1 a.m. Sunday</a>,&quot; and her friends and family are worried. </p>

<p>Quigley, who was a backup dancer in Beyonce&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028223945/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwtNLUqkMY">&quot;Crazy in Love&quot; video</a>, lives in North Bergen, NJ and  teaches at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028223945/http://www.peridance.com/facprofile.cfm?fid=1092&amp;name=Shirlene_Quigley">Peridance Capezio Center</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028223945/https://www.broadwaydancecenter.com/faculty/bios/quigley_shirlene.shtml">Broadway Dance Center</a> in NYC. </p>

<p>A friend wrote to us, &quot;Shirlene is a responsible and successful professional dancer and beloved dance teacher who has been missing since her phone was found and turned in to the police on Friday evening. She was last seen early Sunday morning at Port Authority and may be disoriented and in need of medical attention. Her car, at this time, is also missing.&quot; (Update: The car,  2006 Silver Mercedes C230, may have been located recently.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028223945/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Missing-Dancer-Celebrity-Shirlene-Quigley-Manhattan-New-Jersey-Beyonce-Phone-Chelsea-398210081.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;The father, who lives in California, said Quigley normally calls him every day around 6 p.m., and he became concerned when he hadn&apos;t heard from her. Police say Quigley&apos;s phone was found at a bridal store in Chelsea; her father says she could&apos;ve been there to pick up something for a show... Her landlord saw her leave her New Jersey home Saturday afternoon and later called a friend to say Quigley did not seem well, the friend said.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, Quigley&apos;s father said she apparently told a friend, &quot;Get ready, it&apos;s about to happen and I&apos;m going to need you to sub for me.&quot; </p>

<p>Friends say Quigley was last seen wearing a pink top, jeans, and 3-4&#x201D; high heeled shoes. She is 5&apos;10&quot; and 150 pounds, and has a few tattoos: &quot;Emotion&quot; on her inside right forearm, &quot;Daddy&apos;s Girl&quot; on top of her left foot,&quot; and the zodiac sign for Cancer on the small of her back. </p>
