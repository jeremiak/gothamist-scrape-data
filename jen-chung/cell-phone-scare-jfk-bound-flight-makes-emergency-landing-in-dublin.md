										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_04_cellcharger.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165055im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_cellcharger.jpg" width="300" height="248" class="image-left"> </span>A flight from Istanbul to New York&apos;s JFK Airport was diverted to Dublin earlier today, thanks to a suspicious item in the plane&apos;s bathroom.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165055/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0416/breaking44.html">According to the Irish Times</a>, it turns out the item was a &quot;passenger&apos;s mobile phone plugged into the shaving socket.&quot; </p>

<p>The Delta plane&apos;s pilot requested to make the landing at Dublin&apos;s airport because a &quot;&apos;suspect device&apos; had been found in the passenger toilet.&quot;  When the plane was parked in an isolated area of the airport, the Irish police boarded the plane and spoke to the pilot.  Then the police made an announcement about a cell phone that was found in the bathroom, at which point a passenger remembered he/she left it there!  Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165055/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/16/delta-flight-lands-in-dublin-over-bomb-scare-1797419830/">how the AP puts it</a>: &quot;It was determined that the passenger had decided to charge the phone using the restroom&apos;s socket for shavers and left it there, wrapped up in its charging cord, and another passenger using the restroom reported it might be a bomb.&quot;</p>

<p>No arrests were made and the plane continued on its journey to NYC, presumably with everyone staring at the person who left the phone in the bathroom in the first place.  </p>

<p>Last week, the World Financial Center was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165055/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/grenade_that_shut_down_world_financ.php">evacuated over a novelty grenade toy</a>.</p>
