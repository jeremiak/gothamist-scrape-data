</div></div><p>Reader Yojimbot offers some photographs and perspective on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052605/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/25/harlem_shooting_2.php">Sunday afternoon shooting</a> where two 63-year-old women were injured on St. Nicholas Avenue near West 113th Street.  On his blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052605/http://harlemhybrid.blogspot.com/2008/08/bullet-control.html">Harlem Hybrid</a>, he writes, &quot;This is the 4th mass shooting of the Summer of &apos;08, and it is only by the Grace of God, that no one has been killed yet as a result. It was this latest round, which took place on Sunday at 2pm in the afternoon, which was the most disturbing. <strong>The block was full of pedestrians and children</strong>, and the end result was that two elderly women were caught in the crossfire.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently a man confronted someone else and shot him as he left one building.  The other person then fired back. Yojimbot noticed two security cameras, &quot;which hopefully captured the scene.&quot;  Today, the police said there still no suspects.</p>
