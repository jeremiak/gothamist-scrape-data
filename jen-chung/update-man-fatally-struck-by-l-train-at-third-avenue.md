<p>A man was struck by a L train at Third Avenue this morning, and initial reports say he is dead.  The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140211175252/http://www.mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html"> MTA has suspended L service</a> in both directions between Bedford Avenue and 8th Avenue. </p>

<p><b>Update, 12:40 p.m.</b>: L train service has been restored between Bedford and 8th Avenues.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. About two hundred straphangers evacuated the train, walking along a platform in the tunnel before they exited at Third Avenue.&quot;</p>
