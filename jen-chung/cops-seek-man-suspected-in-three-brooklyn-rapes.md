<p>The police say that in each incident, &quot;the suspect engages the victim in a conversation and lures them to an isolated location where he rapes them.&quot; Here are the details of the attacks: On April 4 at 9 p.m., a 25-year-old woman was approached near Albany Avenue and Fenimore Street; the suspect lured her to a parking lot where he raped her.<br>
 <br>
On April 11, 2013 at 8 a.m., 19-year-old was approached near Remsen Avenue and Farragut Road, lured to the driveway of a private home and was raped. On the same day, at 8:15 p.m., a 15-year-old was approached in a building in the vicinity of Midwood Street and Schenectady Avenue, where she was lured to the 6th floor  and raped.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a black male in his 20s, about 5&apos;9&quot; and 160-180 pounds, wearing a green camouflaged jacket, pants, boots and baseball cap (possibly with a NY Knick or Yankees logo). </p>
