<p>According to the NYPD, officers responded to a 911 call around 3:49 p.m. When they arrived near Gerritsen and Lois Avenues, they found a 1999 Honda Accord in the water.

The homeowner, Christopher Gardner, said a neighbor who lives two houses inland from the water showed him video of a car going at a high rate of speed down Gerritsen Avenue at about 5 a.m. Gardner&apos;s home is located at the very end of the avenue, just before the creek.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver was identified as Brooklyn resident James Miro, 31. One resident told WCBS 2 that many drivers speed on Gerritsen Avenue, &quot;I would say it&#x2019;s pretty common. It&#x2019;s a long strip with basically no lights. It&#x2019;s a wide street.&quot; Gardner added that many don&apos;t realize the road ends with a dead end.</p>
