</div></div>					<p>Last night, Sadie the Scottish Terrier won the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140312065903/http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/">Westminster Kennel Club</a>&apos;s 134th Best in Show.  The four-year-old pup was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140312065903/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/14/scottish_terrier_the_favorite_for_w.php">favored to win</a> it all, since she won the American Kennel Club/Eukanaba Championship and the National Dog Show in the past few months. Her handler Gabriel Rangel said, &quot;She was perfect. I couldn&apos;t ask for anything more.&quot; </p>

<p>Judging was momentarily interrupted by PETA protesters (more on that later), but the show went on. Best in Show judge Elliott Weiss thought Sadie, whose official name is Ch Roundtown Mercedes Of Maryscot, was amazing: &quot;This is very special. A dog of this quality comes along once every 10 years... <strong>Her breed character is fabulous &#x2014; she thinks very highly of herself.</strong> Her coat is absolutely breathtaking.&quot;  Rangel also said that Sadie was happy and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140312065903/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/sports/17dog.html?ref=sports">NY Times reports</a> that while the champion was on a table, &quot;Her stubby tail wagged merrily, but she said nothing. She appeared to dance in place at times, sort of a Scottish jig, especially when she saw her breeder, Mary O&#x2019;Neal.&quot;  </p>

<p>Sadie will be making the rounds on various talk shows and media appearances.  After the jump, there&apos;s video of Westminster terrier judging where Sadie started her victory trot. And another fun fact about Sadie: Rangel told reporters, &quot;She likes to watch TV. We have dinner together at the hotel and watch Animal Planet.&quot;</p>
