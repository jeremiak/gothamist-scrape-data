<p>NYC&apos;s Office of Emergency Management issued a hazardous travel advisory as a lot of snow is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404103440/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/winter_snow_warning_fake_news.php">apparently headed our way Thursday</a>, February 9th, even though some New Yorkers have been spotted wearing spring-summer attire this afternoon. NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Joseph Esposito said, &quot;Although the weather is warm today, winter will return quickly on Thursday with dangerous conditions for the morning commute. New Yorkers should be prepared for snowfall and slippery roads and plan to take mass transit where possible.&quot; <b>Update</b>: Mayor de Blasio just said that it&apos;s a &quot;distinct possibility&quot; that schools are closed tomorrow. On 1010 WINS, he said, &quot;We&#x2019;re going to make a decision ideally at the end of the afternoon as we get more information in from the National Weather Service... We&#x2019;ll have a definite answer this evening.&quot;</p>

<p>In an interview with WCBS 880, de Blasio said, &quot;We will make a decision&quot; about school closings &quot;certainly by the time of the 11 o&#x2019;clock news this evening, maybe earlier if we have really clear information. We&#x2019;ve got a projection right now from the National Weather Service that I described to you, six to 12 inches of snow - super concentrated in the mid-morning, let&#x2019;s say.&quot;</p>

<p>But he added, &quot;I&#x2019;ve seen now over the three years of being Mayor these projections change up and down very suddenly. So, parents should be on alert that we may be in a position to close school tomorrow. We may find that necessary. Parents should definitely make alternative plans now just in case. And then we will give them a clear answer no later than the 11 o&#x2019;clock news, possible even earlier in the evening.&quot;</p>

<p>The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning, and OEM described what will happen:</p><blockquote>A coastal storm will develop off the mid-Atlantic coast Wednesday night, bringing a chance for precipitation after midnight. The precipitation could start as rain or a mix of rain and snow for coastal sections, but is forecast to turn to snow early Thursday morning. Snow will continue into Thursday morning, falling heavily at times, creating reduced visibilities. Snow will taper off Thursday afternoon into the evening as the storm pushes away from the area. A total accumulation of 6 to 12 inches of snow is anticipated, but locally higher amounts are possible. New Yorkers should avoid driving during the morning hours and use mass transit where possible on Thursday.<br>
 <br>
After Wednesday&#x2019;s unseasonably high temperatures, temperatures plummet Wednesday night, with lows around freezing and wind chill values between 25 and 30 degrees. Temperatures continue to drop Thursday, with highs around freezing and wind chill values in the teens. Temperatures drop to the teens Thursday night, with wind chill values as low as single digits. Temperatures return to around freezing on Friday.</blockquote> The city is prepping 689 salt spreaders, and 1,600 plows will hit the roads when more than two inches of snow is on the ground (current rock salt status: 315,000 tons). <p></p>

<p>For you drivers, &quot;Alternate Side Parking is suspended Thursday to facilitate snow removal operations. Parking meters are in effect.&quot; For you Citi Bikers, &quot;Citi Bike service is expected to remain in service Thursday until further notice.&quot;</p>

<p>The MTA is also prepping its divisions:</p>

<p>Governor Cuomo said, &quot;As Mother Nature once again tests the resilience and strength of this state, I urge New Yorkers to plan ahead, stay informed, and above all, stay safe this weekend. I have directed state agencies to closely monitor conditions and to clear roadways as quickly as possible in order to avoid accidents and keep our roadways safe. I encourage everyone in the path of these storms to use extra caution and avoid unnecessary travel during these hazardous weather conditions.&quot;</p>
