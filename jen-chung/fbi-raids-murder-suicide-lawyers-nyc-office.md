Parente <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092447/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/22/li_lawyer_kills_family_himself_in_m.php">killed himself after killing his wife and two daughters</a> in a Maryland hotel room last week&#x2014;the Long Island family had been visiting the eldest daughter at college. Based on some papers left in the room, it&apos;s believed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092447/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/23/li_lawyer_who_killed_family_had_fin.php">Parente was in financial trouble</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092447/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-lipare3012711457apr29,0,926794.story">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;Investors have said Parente used the money to make high-interest commercial bridge loans&quot; (with high returns) and that the FBI has spoken to many individuals who invested $20 million with Parente over the past two decades.  Some investors had demanded their money back, but Parente stalled on giving them the money and when he did, the checks bounced.  One person said, &quot;No one questioned him, because everyone knew him. I don&apos;t understand where the money could have gone.&quot; The FBI left the office with dozens of file boxes and a hard drive.</p>
