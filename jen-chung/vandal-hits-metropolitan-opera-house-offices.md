<p>The Metropolitan Opera&apos;s offices were vandalized this morning. A spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705211637/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/metropolitan-opera-offices-vandalized-police-and-company-say/?smid=tw-share">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;At some point this morning, some administrative offices at the Metropolitan Opera house were vandalized with spray paint. There was little or no permanent damage. The New York City Police Department is investigating. We have no further comment at this time.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705211637/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/art-vandalized-nyc-met-opera-article-1.1843727">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The destructive Philistine entered the Lincoln Center building between 7:15 a.m. and 8 a.m. and scrawled profanities and curse words on statues and paintings near the bandshell... One of the paintings vandalized is worth $50,000, cops were told.&quot; A maintenance worker discovered the damage.</p>

<p>The act may have been in an inside job, because there were no signs of a break-in. As for the possibility that it might be related to contract talks between the Met and various unions, one union leader said to the Times, &quot;I don&#x2019;t see it being related to the labor dispute. Nobody&#x2019;s that crazy.&quot;</p>
