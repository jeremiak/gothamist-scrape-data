This surcharge is in addition to the existing surcharges, such as the rush-hour surcharge (Monday-Friday) of $1 between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. and the night surcharge between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.  <p></p>

<p>Two taxi metering companies&apos; computers (not the Taxi and Limousine Commission&apos;s) jumped the gun with the surcharge&#x2014;apparently 4,000 taxi riders were overcharged by 50 cents on October 22, 25 and 26, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123021805/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/30/2009-10-30_oops_cabs_charged_too_much__tlc.html?r=ny_local">because of a &quot;computer glitch.&quot;</a>  The Daily News reports that riders can get refunds&#x2014;call 311&#x2014; if they can back up their claims with a credit card receipt or taxi receipt: &quot;The TLC said it has made arrangements for the responsible companies to refund the overcharges.&quot;  More details about the refund after the jump:</p>
