<p>While the parade itself was a cheerful event, there were a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909114104/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/01/1_person_killed_4_others_shot_at_pr.php">number of shootings, including a fatal one, leading up to the parade</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909114104/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/01/large-crowds-begin-gathering-for-west-indian-day-parade-in-brooklyn/">Mayor de Blasio said</a>, &quot;The vast, vast majority have a wonderful time, and only a few individuals get out of line... This parade started small, became big and is one of the great events in our city... This is an event of incredible importance to the Caribbean-American community of the city.&quot;</p>
