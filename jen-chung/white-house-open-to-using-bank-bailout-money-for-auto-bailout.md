White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said, &quot;<strong>Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms. </strong>However, given the current weakened state of the U.S. economy, we will consider other options if necessary &#x2014; including use of the TARP program &#x2014; to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers.&#x201D; The Treasury Department also signaled it could help prop up the automakers, and that helped the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P; 500 stay in positive territory.
