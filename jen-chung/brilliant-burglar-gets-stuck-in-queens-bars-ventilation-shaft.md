<p>Police arrested a man who got stuck inside the exhaust shaft of an Elmhurst bar during an alleged attempt to break into the establishment. The local precinct wasn&apos;t impressed:</p>

<p>Apparently George Romaro, 26, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625114743/http://abc7ny.com/news/burglar-busted-after-getting-trapped-inside-queens-bar/1782304/">made his way into an exhaust shaft</a>&#x2014;by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625114743/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170302/elmhurst/winners-bar-elmhurst-exhaust-vent-stuck">&quot;smashing&quot; the vent&apos;s cap</a>&#x2014; at Winner&apos;s Bar in Elmhurst, 82-67 Broadway, after it closed on Thursday morning. </p>

<p>A neighbor called 911 when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625114743/http://nypost.com/2017/03/02/this-burglar-got-busted-in-the-dumbest-way-possible/">the Post reports</a>, &quot;she heard a man&#x2019;s muffled cries and looked out her window to see a hand sticking out of the vent. Police and firefighters showed up to the bar around 11:30 a.m. and found Romero waving helplessly at them when they came upon the vent shaft.&quot;</p>

<p>After Romero was freed, he was charged with burglary.</p>
