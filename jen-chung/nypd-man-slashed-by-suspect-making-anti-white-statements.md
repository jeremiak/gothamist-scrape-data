<p>A man was attacked at a Manhattan bodega last week, and police say the suspect &quot;made anti-white statements&quot; during the incident.</p>

<p>The assault occurred last Friday, September 23, in front of 245 9th Avenue in Chelsea; according to the NYPD, &quot;the suspect made anti-white statements to the 40 year-old male victim prior to cutting him with a knife.&quot;</p>

<p>The couple continued on their way but the man followed them to Ninth Avenue before taking a swing at the victim. He missed, but a scuffle quickly ensued. The two fell to the ground as they wrestled with each other, police said.</p></blockquote>The boyfriend then ran into the store, followed by the man from the stoop, and was slashed. Video shows the dramatic attack inside a bodega.<p></p>
