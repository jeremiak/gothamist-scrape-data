The rumored 2012 presidential candidate&#x2014;or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124713/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/mitt_romney_teases_chris_christie_w.php">VP candidate</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124713/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/christie_gets_rushed_to_hosp_jxjoqmp1UQHvD8m0xlYqaL">admitted his weight causes problems</a>. &quot;I think the weight exacerbates everything,&quot; he said last night. &quot;The lighter I am, the healthier I&apos;ll be... I feel a pretty big sense of urgency [to lose weight].  It&apos;s one of the major struggles of my life. I&apos;m working on it.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124713/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/chris_christie_weight_issue.html">Christie was honest, too</a>, saying &quot;I weigh too much because I eat too much. And I eat some bad things too.&quot; He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124713/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/christies_hospitalization_afte.html">had used an inhaler</a>, but &quot;It didn&#x2019;t give me the kind of release I normally get,&quot; so the state troopers he was traveling with decided to take him to the hospital.  But Christie didn&apos;t blame his weight for the incident. He said the humidity was what got to him, adding that &quot;Despite the well chronicled issues of my weight, I&#x2019;ve been healthy by the normal indicators.&quot;</p>

<p>Newton Medical Center&apos;s manager of respiratory care, Robert Guardabasco, explained to the Star-Ledger why excess weight is problematic for asthma sufferers:  The additional body mass &quot;can hinder the movement of the body&#x2019;s diaphragm, a sheet of muscle that extends across the midsection of the chest.&quot; He said, &quot;If you&apos;re overweight, it can&apos;t drop well because the stomach&apos;s in the way.&quot;</p>
