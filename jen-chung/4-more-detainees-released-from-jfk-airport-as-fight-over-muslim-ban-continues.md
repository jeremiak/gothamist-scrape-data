<p>The detention of two Iraqi refugees, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, on Friday brought their lawyers, as well as Representatives Jerry Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, to the airport to try to secure their and other detainees&apos; release.

<p>Darweesh&apos;s detainment was particularly distressing, as he had been an interpreter for the U.S. Army shortly after the invasion of Iraq, making him a target in the country. His visa had been approved last week. (He was released in the afternoon, Alshawi was eventually released in the evening.) The ACLU&apos;s legal team, who pointed out that Darweesh and Alshawi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021444/http://nypost.com/2017/01/28/iraqi-citizen-detained-at-jfk-under-refugee-ban-is-released/">had spent years</a> working on their applications to event the U.S., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021444/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?_r=0">told U.S. Federal Judge Ann Donnelly</a> that anywhere from 100 to 200 people were being detained at international airports across the county.

<p>Governor Cuomo then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021444/https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/825511640854622209">issued a statement</a>, &quot;One of the fundamental rights that is granted to the people of this country is the right to peacefully protest. I have ordered the Port Authority to reverse its decision regarding the JFK AirTrain. I have also directed the MTA and the New York State Police to assist with transportation and security needs to ensure the safety of all those participating. The people of New York will have their voices heard.&quot;</p>

<p>The crowd eventually swelled into the thousands, according to what one witness overheard on a Port Authority police walkie talkie.</p>
