<p>He was plainspoken.</p>

<p>He was unflappable.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013428/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/wcbs-tv-reporter-john-slattery-dies-hours-newscast-article-1.1952493?cid=bitly">The News adds</a>, &quot;Slattery, 63, was among the city&#x2019;s longest-serving television reporters, joining WABC-TV in 1979 and participating in the Emmy-winning coverage of the December 1980 assassination of ex-Beatle John Lennon.

<p>President of CBS Television Stations Peter Dunn said, &quot;We are saddened by the unexpected passing of our friend and colleague John Slattery. During his nearly 30-year career at WCBS, he was great at reporting the news and was someone we counted on to cover big stories for us, both here in New York and around the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with John&#x2019;s wife, Suzie, and their children and grandchildren.&quot;</p>
