<p>While other politicians are just noting Memorial Day by honoring active, retired and late members of military, Senator Chuck Schumer is also worried for an important constituency: Those who love to grill food during these warm weather months.  Which nicely complements one of his other efforts&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150327011814/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/06/schumer_supports_lowering_taxes_on.php">keeping microbrews cheap</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150327011814/http://politicker.com/2012/05/chuck-schumers-next-fight-metal-bristle-brushes-for-cleaning-barbecues/">According to Politicker</a>, the senior Senator from New York sent out a press release with the headline, &#x201C;SCHUMER: CLEANING YOUR BARBECUE GRILL WITH A METAL BRUSH THIS SUMMER COULD HAVE SERIOUS HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; CALLS FOR SAFETY REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER METAL BRISTLE GRILL BRUSHES ARE SAFE FOR CONSUMER USE.&#x201D; Apparently a metal bristle got caught in a man&apos;s throat&#x2014;and it took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150327011814/http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2012/05/23/beware-the-bbq-metal-bristles-from-grill-brush-pose-health-risk/">four hours to remove it from his esophagus</a>!</p>

<p>Schumer&apos;s statement went on to read, &quot;Metal bristles are one topping no one wants on their burger this holiday season. Grilling season should be a great time for the whole family, not a time to be worried about an emergency visit to the hospital. I urge the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the FDA to launch a safety review of these products and warn consumers about their potential dangers. I&#x2019;m also urging consumers to use caution when using these metal grill brushes this summer to avoid more accidents like these.&quot;  So stop playing it fast and loose with metal bristle grill brushes, big government, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150327011814/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/schumer_wants_to_ban_us_citizenship.php">also take away Eduardo&apos;s citizenship</a>.</p>
