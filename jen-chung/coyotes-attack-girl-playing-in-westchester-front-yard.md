The girl was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152721/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/new_york_state/coyotes-attack-westchester-girl-20100626-akd">playing in her front yard</a> with her sisters when the coyotes &quot;pounced&quot; from a bush, biting her on the shoulder, thigh and possibly ear and scratching her back.  <p></p>

<p>The girl&apos;s sisters&apos; screams got the attention of their mother, who then scared the coyotes.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152721/http://www.lohud.com/article/201006261605/NEWS02/6260362">Rye Police Chief William Connors said</a>, &quot;Her injuries are not life-threatening but she sustained a number of significant bite wounds and lacerations... It seems that she was probably the smallest of the group and the attack seemed to focus solely on her.&quot;  Police, who suspect the coyotes may be rabid, are warning residents with young children to be extra careful.  </p>

<p>Police had managed to find a coyote at the country club and even fired at it, but the coyote got away.  The Rye police will be setting up traps for the coyotes.  A neighbor of the victim told the Journal News that he bought an air horn to use while walking his dog; after seeing a coyote the size of a German Shepard, he is now &quot;totally paranoid.&quot;</p>

<p>In April, a coyote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152721/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/03/coyote_kills_poodle.php">killed a toy poodle in Rye</a>.
