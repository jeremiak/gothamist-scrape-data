Now, M&amp;M;&apos;s, which has promised to unveil the brown M&amp;M;&apos;s persona in a game day commercial, showed off what Ms. Brown looks like at its Time Square store.</p>

<p>Ms. Brown wears white high heels, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131123814/http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150508085196957&amp;set=a.131015676956.121420.30634981956&amp;type=1&amp;ref=nf">Judith Ripka gloves</a> and has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131123814/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=liz+lemon+glasses&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=1832l1832l0l2135l1l1l0l0l0l0l94l94l1l1l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1123&amp;bih=640&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=5xQnT8rnKYji0gHlwt2JCQ">Liz Lemon-y</a> (or are they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131123814/http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=lisa+loeb+glasses&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=-RQnT5SsNKnY0QHe9IGDDA&amp;biw=1123&amp;bih=640&amp;sei=-xQnT5rHDoHd0QHp6PiBCQ">more Lisa Loeb?</a>) glasses.

<p>There was actually a live event in LA&#x2014;with Neil Patrick Harris&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131123814/http://www.ustream.tv/mmschocolate">to unveil Ms. Brown</a>, but there were &quot;technical difficulties at our Ms. Brown Reveal event&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131123814/http://www.facebook.com/mms?sk=wall">M&amp;M;&apos;s Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: J.K. Simmons (forever Emil Skoda in our heart) is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131123814/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Simmons">voice of Yellow M&amp;M;</a>.<br>
