The plane landed safely at Dulles at 9:36 p.m.  Passenger Phil Lobel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124443/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gG4tfcH9566zt1jI2S6L8VZFMIZgD9FOG3S05">told the AP</a> that 30 minutes in, &quot;he detected an electrical burning smell. He said flight attendants began going over emergency instructions with passengers in the exit rows and someone brought up a fire extinguisher from the back of the plane to the cockpit.&quot; Other tidbits: Some passengers took pictures of the flames, some passengers were celebrities, and &quot;About an hour after the plane landed, Lobel received an e-mail from United apologizing for the &apos;experience&apos; he had on the flight.&quot;</p>
