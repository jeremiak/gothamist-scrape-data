According to conservative blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082557/http://thesilentmajority.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/up-date-on-the-assault-against-a-mccain-manhattan-volunteer/">The Silent Majority</a>, a man--without provocation--grabbed the woman&apos;s McCain sign, ripped it up, and hit her with it, bruising her face.  The victim followed him into the 6 train subway station and found police officers on the platform; she added that he was only arrested after she showed the cops her bruised face.  The assailant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082557/http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/obama-supporter-assaults-female-mccain-volunteer-in-new-york/2/">allegedly said</a>, &quot;<strong>I don&#x2019;t know why I did this. It&#x2019;s just those signs, and this election, it has me so upset.</strong>&#x201D; Smith reports that the man, Bernard Feuerman, was charged with second degree assault and has a January 23 court date.</p>
