<p>Police are searching for convicted sex offender for questioning about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195546/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/05/german_tourist_robbed_sexually_assa.php">brutal robbery and sexual assault</a> of a tourist on a Manhattan street. </p>

<p>Keon Robinson, 28, was identified by the NYPD as a &quot;person of interest&quot; for the May 4th incident. Around 2:50 a.m. on that day, a 31-year-old German tourist was walking from the subway to her Airbnb in Harlem when, in front of West 219 West 146th, she was approached by a man who allegedly took her purse. Authorities say that he punched her repeated in the face and sexually assaulted her.</p>

<p>The attack, which was caught on video [warning: the footage shows the violent assault and may be distressing to viewers], left the victim with broken teeth. &quot;The injuries were so severe, investigators said they were not immediately able to speak with her,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195546/http://pix11.com/2017/05/08/man-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-tourist-knocking-out-several-of-her-teeth-is-idd-by-police/">according to PIX11</a>. </p>

<p>He was arrested again in December 2007 for sexually assaulting and robbing a woman he didn&apos;t know under threat of violence, records show. He was convicted in March 2008 and spent the next eight years behind bars, prison records show.</p>

<p>Robinson was released in March 2016, but arrested for another sex offense that August, police and prison officials said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce, who said last week that the suspect for the May 4th attack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195546/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170505/central-harlem/german-tourist-sex-assault-nypd-suspect-wanted?_ga=2.238310464.1718856964.1494256656-116819253.1443456074">may be the same person</a> as an April 24th robbery and assault of a woman in the same area, said that Robinson is known to be in Bedford-Stuyvesant:</p>
