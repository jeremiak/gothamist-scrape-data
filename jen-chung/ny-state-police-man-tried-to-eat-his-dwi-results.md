<p>The NY State Police say that Kenneth Desormes, of Greenwich, Connecticut, attempted to consume the physical paper his Breathalyzer test results were printed on Sunday.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012114/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2014/11/03/cops-man-charged-eating-dwi-evidence/18431311/">According to the Journal News</a>, &quot;[T]he 40-year-old was arrested about 5:30 a.m. Sunday after troopers pulled him over for speeding on Interstate 95 in Port Chester. Suspecting that Desormes was drunk, police took him to the Tarrytown barracks to administer a Breathalyzer test, state police said.&quot;</p>

<p>The Breathazlyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012114/http://wivb.com/2014/11/03/police-man-attempts-to-eat-dwi-paperwork/">came back with a 0.13 result</a> (the legal limit is 0.08)&#x2014;at which point Desormes allegedly tried to eat the paper. </p>

<p>He is now charged with DWI, second-degree obstruction of governmental administration and third-degree criminal tampering.</p>
