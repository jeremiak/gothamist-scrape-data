<p>The police had arrested two people in connection with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706124220/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/24/video_captures_attack_on_sleeping_h.php">awful, fatal beating of a homeless man</a> who was sleeping on a Bronx church&apos;s steps. </p>

<p>The homeless man, Miguel Dircio, 41, was lying on the steps of Saint Nicholas of Tolentine Church, at West Fordham Road and University Avenue, at 10:11 p.m. on  June 19. Three individuals approached Dircio and they started to kick him in the head. The attack was captured on video:</p>

<p>Dircio died at Saint Barnabas Hospital on June 28. Yesterday, police arrested a pair of brothers, Angel Monegro, 17, and Noel Martinez, 24, and charged them with manslaughter. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706124220/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-bust-brothers-allegedly-killed-homeless-man-bronx-article-1.1851822">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The beating was in retaliation after Dircio punched Martinez and Monegro&#x2019;s father in a nearby restaurant after an argument over the dad&#x2019;s leftovers, cops said. The father told Martinez and Monegro about the incident, prompting the trio to go out hunting for the homeless man, authorities said.&quot;</p>

<p>Father Joseph Girone of Saint Nicholas of Tolentine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706124220/http://pix11.com/2014/06/23/homeless-man-viciously-beaten-while-sleeping-on-bronx-church-steps/">told PIX 11 last week</a>, &quot;I believe [homeless people] sleep there precisely because it&#x2019;s up high, and there&#x2019;s a certain protection there, the lights are, on, and the fact that the man was assaulted, kicked in the head like that, in front of the church door, where it&#x2019;s supposed to be a place of peace, at the very least, it&#x2019;s disconcerting.&quot;</p>
