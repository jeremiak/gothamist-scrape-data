<p>A man was fatally crushed by a B train in the Bronx, and it&apos;s believed he had been subway surfing.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228221555/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/subway-surfer-dies-falling-train-tracks-bronx-article-1.2982610">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The victim, described only as a man in his 30s, fell from the top of a southbound D train at the Tremont Ave. station in Mount Hope just after 4 a.m., cops said.&quot;</p>

<p>When he fell, the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228221555/http://nypost.com/2017/02/26/subway-surfer-is-crushed-to-death/">rear of the train</a>&quot; rolled over him. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Late last year, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228221555/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/08/deadly_subway_jump.php">teenager was killed</a> while trying to attempt a subway surfing stunt on the L train. And a well-known photographer who specialized in urban exploration died <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228221555/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/subway_surfer_urbex.php">while allegedly subway surfing</a> on an F train.</p>
