</div></div><p>Ricky Gervais didn&apos;t burn down the house while hosting the Golden Globes for the third time last night&#x2014;though he did get to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200436/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/golden-globes-ricky-gervais-monologue-282120">talk about Jodie Foster&apos;s <em>Beaver</em></a> (&quot;I haven&apos;t seen it myself. I spoken to a lot of guys here, they haven&apos;t seen it either. That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not any good&quot;)&#x2014;and the show did its part to honor movies that producer Harvey Weinstein had a hand in. Madonna, always modest while winning Best Song for her ditty in <em>W.E.</em>, referred to Weinstein as &quot;the Punisher.&quot;  All in all, business as usual, as was spotting Rupert Murdoch and wife Wendi sitting at the Fox table.</p>

<p>The Weinstein Company racked up metal for Best Picture (Comedy or Musical) <em>The Artist</em>, Best Actor (Comedy or Musical)  Jean Dujardin for <em>The Artist</em>, Best Actress (Drama) Meryl Steep for <em>The Iron Lady</em>, Best Actress (Comedy for Musical) Michelle Wiliams for <em>My Week With Marilyn</em>.  George Clooney&apos;s win for Best Actor (Drama) for <em>The Descendants</em>, plus <em>The Descendants</em> anointment as Best Picture (Drama) and Martin Scorsese&apos;s Best Director nod for <em>Hugo</em> broke up the Weinstein love.  Supporting acting honors were given to Christopher Plummer in <em>Beginners</em> and Octavia Spencer in <em>The Help</em>.</p>

<p>On the TV side, <em>Homeland</em> was named Best Drama while <em>Modern Family</em> was Best Comedy; <em>Downton Abbey</em> won best mini-series.  Claire Danes (<em>Homeland</em>) was Best Actress in a Drama and Kelsey Grammer was Best Actor in a Drama (<em>Boss</em>), Matt LeBlanc won Best Actor in a Comedy for playing himself in <em>Episodes</em> while Laura Dern won Best Actress in a Comedy for playing crazy in <em>Enlightened</em>.  Stringer Bell&#x2014;no, Idris Elba&#x2014;won for Best Actor in a Mini-Series in <em>Luther</em> and Kate Winslet won for Best Actress in a Mini-Series for her marathon <em>Mildred Pierce</em>.  Rounding out the TV acting categories were the supporting acting winners Jessica Lange for <em>American Horror Story</em> and Peter Dinklage for <em>Game of Thrones</em>.  Dinklage used his time to mention how his mom in NJ thought Guy Pearce was probably going to win and draw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200436/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2087341/Martin-Henderson-Dwarf-tossing-victim-trends-Twitter-Golden-Globes-2012.html">attention to an injured dwarf</a>.</p>
