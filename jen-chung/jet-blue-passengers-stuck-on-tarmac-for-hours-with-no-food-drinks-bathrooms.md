Flights were stopped for hours at JFK, Laguardia and Newark.  And for one Newark-bound Jet Blue flight from Miami, that meant its 200 passengers were stuck on the tarmac at Bradley International in Hartford, Connecticut <em>for eight hours</em>.  A Miami Sun-Sentinel sports writer, on his way to today&apos;s Giants game versus the Dolphins, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://twitter.com/#!/andrew_b_carter/status/130405279941668864">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Lady on board just broke down. Like that guy who cried in his cell at the beginning of Shawshank. Can someone sneak me in Rita Hayworth?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Flight 504, after circling Newark, was diverted to Bradley and passengers landed around 2 p.m. Of course, the storm was also impacting Bradley, and the plane waited on the tarmac.  Passengers say that after three hours on the tarmac, Jet Blue informed them that by law (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://airconsumer.dot.gov/publications/flyrights.htm">Passenger Bill of Rights</a>), they would be allowing passengers to leave the plane. But it didn&apos;t happen. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Passengers-Grounded-for-Hours-With-No-Bathrooms-or-Water-132862693.html">A passenger told NBC Connecticut</a>, &quot;They were waiting for a tug to take us to a gate. We heard that same message at the four-hour mark, and continuing until state troopers boarded the plane for a medical emergency.&quot;</p>

<p>Andrew Carter, the sports writer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://twitter.com/#!/andrew_b_carter/status/130439255171407872">Tweeted</a>, &quot;To answer questions we&apos;re on Tarmac. No water. Bathrooms don&apos;t work. Don&apos;t know the reason why we&apos;re stuck. It changes,&quot; and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://www.courant.com/news/politics/capitol-watch/hc-jet-blue-stranded-20111029,0,6035066.story">told the Hartford Courant</a> while still on the plane, &#x201C;We ran out of water. <strong>The bathrooms are all clogged up and disgusting.</strong> The power would go off every 45 minutes or so for five minutes or so, and that would freak people out. &#x2026; I&#x2019;ve heard about these kind of stories.&quot;  The funny thing is that keeping passengers on the tarmac appears to go against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/20/putting_a_price.php">Jet Blue&apos;s own passenger bill of rights</a>, after stranding passengers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/18/jet_blew_it.php">on a plane for 11 hours in 2007</a>.</p>

<p>Other passengers said that Bradley airport apparently wasn&apos;t prepared to bring them in.  The airline said, &quot;JetBlue is doing everything possible to ensure our customers affected by today&apos;s unusual combination of weather and infrastructure issues are being well cared for. We apologize for the experience.&quot; But one passenger said, &quot;I&apos;ll never fly JetBlue again, and I&apos;ll never fly through Connecticut again.&quot;</p>

<p>Other flights were delayed, including a Jet Blue flight between Boston and New York that was delayed at Bradley: One passenger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://twitter.com/#!/HedgeyeENERGY/status/130635681021177856">reflected this morning</a> that John Galt probably wouldn&apos;t have approved, &quot;Was actually like a scene out of atlas shrugged last night. No leadership, no accountability, &amp; dumb mistakes @jetblue and #bdl airport&quot;</p>

<p>As for Carter, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423142102/http://twitter.com/#!/andrew_b_carter/status/130617153304014848">finally headed to NJ this morning</a>.</p>
