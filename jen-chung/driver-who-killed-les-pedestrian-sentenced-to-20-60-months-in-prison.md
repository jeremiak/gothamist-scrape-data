<p>A driver who was going over twice the speed limit when he fatally struck a pedestrian in Manhattan has been sentenced to at least 20 months in prison. In a statement yesterday, Manhattan DA Cy Vance said, &quot;We will continue doing our part to reduce vehicular fatalities by holding criminal drivers accountable for the harm that they inflict.&quot;</p>

<p>On November 24, 2014, at 7 p.m., Robert Perry, 57, was walking across Bowery near Rivington Street when a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013944/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/25/two_pedestrians_one_cyclists_killed.php">driving a 2001 BMW barreled into him</a>. The BMW driver, Danny Lin, sped away, but stopped down the block when he hit a fire hydrant on Stanton Street. </p>

<p>Lin was going 55 mph, 30 mph above the speed limit. Perry flew up in the air and landed 140 feet away, according to authorities. He was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013944/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/07/driver_convicted_of_manslaughter_fo.php">convicted of manslaughter</a>, and, at the sentencing yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013944/http://nypost.com/2016/10/18/judge-slams-driver-in-fatal-accident-for-worshiping-speed/">a judge said</a>, &quot;I accept the fact that the defendant is a decent person, [but] I can&#x2019;t consider this an aberration. This defendant lived a life of worshiping speed and fast driving.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Despite all our gains in public safety, too many pedestrians, cyclists, and law-abiding drivers still perish needlessly at the hands of reckless drivers in New York City each year,&quot; Vance said. &quot;Danny Lin&apos;s reckless driving brought about the untimely death of Robert Perry and gravely endangered several others as he sped down the Bowery at more than twice the local speed limit. Thanks to my Office&#x2019;s prosecutors and the NYPD&#x2019;s Collision Investigation Squad, he will now serve a prison sentence for his deadly conduct.&quot;</p>
