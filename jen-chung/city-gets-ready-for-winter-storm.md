<p>Oh, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021222049/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/18/snow_on_the_way_this_weekend.php">winter weather</a> is on: Notify NYC sent the message, &quot;The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for NYC, effective at 12 PM Saturday until 11 AM Sunday,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021222049/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/110690/city-readies-for-first-winter-storm">NY1 says,</a> &quot;About six to nine inches of snow are expected to fall in the city between Saturday morning and Sunday morning, with the worst downfall taking place 4 p.m. Saturday and 5 a.m. Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p>As you might imagine, the Department of Sanitation says it&apos;s ready for the snow, as does the Port Authority, which takes care of roadways <em>and</em> airports.  And the MTA says its Bridges and Tunnels division is &quot;is primed and ready to hit the roadways with snow and ice-fighting supplies that include 8,000 tons of deicer and a fleet of 97 trucks.&quot;  </p>

<p>As for the MTA&apos;s mass transit, the agency says it&apos;s going to cancel its planned weekend service outages, &quot;Our goal is to keep as many trains in service as possible and  to keep you informed.&quot;  Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021222049/http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/cold_weather.htm">their list of what they think you should expect</a>.</p>
