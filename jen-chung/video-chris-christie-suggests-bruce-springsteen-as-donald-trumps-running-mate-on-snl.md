<p>The strange, car-wreck beauty of Donald Trump and Chris Christie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000729/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/chris_christie_makes_america_great.php">friendship</a>, or really, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000729/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/28/watch_chris_christies_cringeworthy.php">master-servant relationship</a>, got the starring treatment on Saturday Night Live last night. The cold open sketch showed Christie, played by Bobby Moynihan, offering possible vice presidential choices to Darrell Hammond&apos;s classy Trump. When Trump asks if Paul Ryan is interested, Christie says, &quot;Not right now, but he&apos;d see you in the hell.&quot;</p>

<p>The sketch also references Trump&apos;s apparent fondness of pretending to be a publicist named John Miller to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000729/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html">chat with reporters about how awesome Trump is</a>&#x2014;in the sketch, Trump calls himself Joey Pepperoni. And, on the VP shortlist, Christie offered up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000729/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/26/christie_demon-free_3_hours.php">NJ resident who is truly &quot;born to run&quot;</a>:<br>

<p>Of course, being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000729/http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/09/politics/donald-trump-chris-christie-transition-team/">head of Trump&apos;s transition team</a> is the closest that Christie will ever be to the White House after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000729/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/dead-eyed_christie_drumpf.php">fateful night on March 1</a>:</p>
