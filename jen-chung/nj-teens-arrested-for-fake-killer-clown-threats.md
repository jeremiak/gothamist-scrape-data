<p>If you&apos;ve ever worried about the future of America, you were right to be concerned: Not only can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/https://www.buzzfeed.com/benrosen/how-to-snapchat-like-the-teens?utm_term=.hun5bWZ0B#.mxK1DK9Pl">they use Snapchat better</a> than you ever will and have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/the-vault-apps-that-keep-sexts-a-secret.html?_r=0">secret apps to keep their sexts</a> hidden from olds, teenagers are really into this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/creepy_clowns_coming_for_you.php">killer clown trend</a>. So much so that they are faking killer clown threats... and getting arrested for it.</p>

<p>A 13-year-old girl was arrested and charged with cyber harassment after making threats on social media about a clown targeting students and residents in Washington Township, NJ. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Washington-Township-Clown-Threat-Arrest-13-Year-Old-Girl--395734281.html?_osource=SocialFlowFB_PHBrand">According to NBC Philadelphia</a>, &quot;The threats warned people that they should be scared and should not walk by themselves. The threats also mentioned specific targets, according to officials.&quot; Also:</p><blockquote>The teen girl was arrested and charged. Police say the girl&apos;s family is also cooperating with the investigation. Investigators say the girl made the threats because it was a popular trend around the country and she thought it would be funny.</blockquote>A 14-year-old male student at a high school in Washington Township was also arrested and charged with cyber harassment for a different clown threat. <p></p>

<p>These arrests come as Philadelphia police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://6abc.com/news/philly-police-girl13-made-clown-threats-toward-schools/1536124/">have identified a 13-year-old girl</a> who made clown threats with a friend. </p>

<p>Authorities have been investigating threats of clowns <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/us/creepy-clown-hoaxes-arrests.html">terrorizing communities</a>, which have been reported all over the country and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/28/how_long_until_the_creepy_clown_epi.php">in recent days</a>, in the New York and Philadelphia area. </p>

<p>NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Counterterrorism and Intelligence John Miller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/creepy_clowns_coming_for_you.php">said the NYPD is on it but so far</a> they&apos;ve &quot;found none of these to be credible, and we&apos;ve tried to avoid falling into the trap of putting extra police protection... We&apos;re tracking it, but we don&apos;t see any real threat here. Our main message is: don&apos;t believe the hype, and don&apos;t be afraid of the clowns.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Frank Farley, a psychology professor at Temple University, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://6abc.com/news/philly-police-girl13-made-clown-threats-toward-schools/1536124/">told WPVI there&apos;s a difference</a> between harmless pranks and this kind of fake threat: &quot;I don&apos;t think pranks that threaten lives are innocent anymore. This nation in 9/11 was invaded from the outside, and we&apos;ve had terrorist incidents since then.&quot; He added, &quot;Now a 13-year-old probably doesn&apos;t know anything about John Wayne Gacy, but most parents should know about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Gacy">John Wayne Gacy,</a> who was this lovable clown in Chicago who everyone wanted this John Wayne Gacy clown to come to their children&apos;s party and so on, and he was systematically killing young boys.&quot;</p>

<p>Philadelphia officials said of the teen girl who confessed to clowning, &quot;This juvenile indicated that this &apos;prank only&apos; was committed with a friend at her school and she never had any intent to harm anyone.&quot; But others aren&apos;t comforted. Mother Yvette Malave said to WPVI, &quot;If she was old enough to make the prank, she should pay for what she did. She should be punished.&quot; </p>

<p>All of these clown threats make us nostalgic for a simpler time, when teens got their kicks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/29/typical_teenagers.php#photo-1">drawing boobs on Civil War memorials</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013007/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/vodka_eyeballing_trend_jumps_the_po.php">vodka eyeballing</a>. </p>
