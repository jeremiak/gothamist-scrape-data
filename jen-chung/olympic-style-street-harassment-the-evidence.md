<p>A follow-up to our post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163253/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/15/suspected_wannabe_olympics_judges_a.php">about the Olympic-style street harassment</a> last month, when men rated women walking in Madison Square Park.  Reader Lauren writes in to confirm it did happen with a photo and says, &quot;To be honest, &apos;crude&apos; or &apos;offensive&apos; as the guys may have been,  I thought it was one of the funnier things I&#x2019;ve ever seen in NYC.&quot;  But maybe that&apos;s because she was getting 9&apos;s and 10&apos;s!</p>
