                            <p><img alt="2008_09_rudjude.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065154im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_09_rudjude.jpg" width="240" height="267" class="left">The travails of Russell Harding, former Rudy Giuliani-appointed head of the NYC Housing Development Corporation have been  well documented, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065154/http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-03-18/news/russell-harding-s-vanity-fair/">especially in the Village Voice</a>.  Harding, who billed the city for his personal travels, dining, and a vehicle and whose computer was found with child pornography on it, is out of prison and seemingly ready to settle some scores.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065154/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/nyregion/26rudy.html">NY Times notes</a> that Harding&apos;s new website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065154/http://www.rudyveritas.com/">Rudy Veritas</a> is unsparing in criticism about the former mayor. But the article (which reminds us that Harding&apos;s inclusion in the Giuliani administration was &quot;widely viewed as a political favor to his father, Raymond B. Harding, a former leader of the New York Liberal Party&quot;) also suggests that Harding may be upset that Giuliani and his associates aren&apos;t assisting him financially.  </p>

<p>At any rate, Rudy Veritas makes for some fun reading.  For instance, here&apos;s Harding&apos;s take on how Rudy&apos;s then-chief of staff, Anthony Carbonetti, asked him to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065154/http://www.rudyveritas.com/rudy_veritas/2008/08/home-sweet-home.html">find a cheap rental apartment for Judi Nathan</a>.  </p><blockquote>    Tony said he needed an apartment for someone. &#x201C;Whose it for?&#x201D; I asked. &#x201C;Judith.&#x201D;, he said. &#x201C;Oh, ok.. . does he know you&#x2019;re calling me?&#x201D; I asked referring to the Mayor. &#x201C;Yup, he knows,&#x201D; Tony replied. &#x201C;What does she need?&#x201D; I wanted to know. &#x201C;She wants a two-bedroom, two-bath, doorman, on the Upper East Side. Preferably, near Gracie,&#x201D; Tony outlined for me. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s she willing to pay?&#x201D; I asked. &#x201C;No more than $1,800 but she&#x2019;d prefer $1,500,&#x201D; he responded.</blockquote><p></p>
