                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_05_walshes.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730154414im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_05_walshes.jpg" width="200" height="177" class="image-left"></span>Two years ago, William Walsh hung posters and made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730154414/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/28/long_island_man_begs_for_missing_wi.php">tearful pleas for help</a> in finding his missing wife Leah. Now, after claims that his confession was coerced, he has pleaded guilty to her murder: In court yesterday, Walsh told a judge that he strangled her in a rage as they were arguing about a affair he was having, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730154414/http://wcbstv.com/local/school.teacher.husband.2.1705424.html">saying</a>, &quot;I put her in a chokehold. I covered up my actions after the fact. I wish I hadn&apos;t done any of it. I am truly sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2008, Walsh went to media outlets, begging for his wife&apos;s return, &quot;I just keep talking to the cops. I keep asking questions. I wish I could give them more. I don&apos;t know where to look. I don&apos;t know what to do. I just want my wife back. I miss her more than anything.&quot;  But Nassau County police found inconsistencies with his story and surmised that Walsh actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730154414/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/30/cops_confirm_body_is_missing_teache.php">killed the 29-year-old</a> special ed teacher and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730154414/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/31/police_explain_walshs_elaborate_cov.php">tried to cover up her death</a>, by dumping her body near a golf course while leaving her car, with a flat tire, on the Seaford-Oyster Expressway.  He even sent a text message, from her phone, to himself.  </p>

<p>However, a Department of Transportation employee spotted him by her vehicle.  And when police questioned him about the murder and asked for where his wife&apos;s ID and credit card were, Walsh allegedly took them out of his shoe.</p>

<p>Walsh&apos;s lawyer said that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730154414/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/walsh-pleads-guilty-to-killing-wife-1.1925073">did not recommend</a> his client take the plea deal, but Walsh wanted to spare his wife&apos;s family the pain of a trial.  A prosecutor confirmed that Leah Walsh&apos;s family &quot;would rather agree to this plea and this sentence than to be put through a lengthy trial.&quot; Walsh, 31, now faces 18 years to life in prison; he will be sentenced next month.</p>
