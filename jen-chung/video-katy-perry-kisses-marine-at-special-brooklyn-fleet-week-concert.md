<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527022439/http://www.katyperry.com/">Katy Perry</a> performed in a special concert for U.S. service members.  The concert, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527022439/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685770/katy-perry-fleet-week.jhtml">sponsored by Pepsi and held at Pier 9 in Brooklyn</a>, meant that Perry could wear an American flag dress and demand that a marine kiss her in the style of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527022439/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/23/edith_shain_nurse_in_kiss_photo_die.php">famous V-J Day kiss in Times Square</a>&#x2014;&quot;On the lips!&quot;</p>

<p>Perry told MTV, &quot;I think if anyone deserves a party, I think it&apos;s probably the people in service. They are the ones that are actually deployed and protecting us from all the bad guys, and they deserve to celebrate, and they deserve to be celebrated.&quot; She added, &quot;I&apos;ve always heard about Fleet Week in New York; I&apos;ve never been a part of it. It&apos;s really exciting to see a lot of seamen in white, but they all look gorgeous. It&apos;s kind of vintage-y feeling and really patriotic, and I love a theme. So, it&apos;s really cool to be a part of this and be entertaining for them. I think that it&apos;s appropriate to go out there in a little dress, and they&apos;re all in uniform.&quot;</p>
