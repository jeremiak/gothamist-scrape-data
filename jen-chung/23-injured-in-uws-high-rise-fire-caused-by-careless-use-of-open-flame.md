<p>A fire broke out on the third floor of a Manhattan high-rise apartment building and quickly grew to four alarms, as wind fed the blaze and immense smoke filled hallways. Twenty-three people were injured, including four firefighters and a seven-year-old girl who was found in cardiac arrest. One person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/12/22/west-side-fire-witnesses/">stuck on the 7th floor said</a>, &quot;You open the window and you hear people everywhere scream &#x2018;help, please help!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The girl, found on the 21st floor of 515 West 59th Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Manhattan-High-Rise-Fire-515-West-59-Street-New-York-City-407962925.html">was revived outside</a>. Many residents of the 33-floor building, which is used to house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/https://www.wehealny.org/professionals/slr_gme/Buildings_and_Floor_Plans.html">Mount Sinai graduate medical students</a>, were trapped on their floors. </p>

<p>One 13th floor resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/21-injured-blaze-high-rise-nyc-apartment-building-article-1.2920622">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I was cooking and no fire alarms went off so I didn&apos;t notice.&quot; </p>

<p>Some people left their apartments and went to the roof, which the FDNY does not advise (in 2014, a man who tried to flee his high rise apartment during a fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/06/newlywed_killed_in_high-rise_fire_h.php#photo-1">died in a stairwell from smoke inhalation</a>). Instead, the FDNY says they should have stayed in their apartment:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a fireproof building, if an apartment that is NOT yours is on fire, stay in your apt. Call 911, open windows, place towels under door</p>&#x2014; FDNY (@FDNY) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/https://twitter.com/FDNY/status/812104004608163840">December 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Two babies were in serious condition while one firefighter was badly burned. </p>

<p>The FDNY believes that the fire was caused by &quot;careless use of an open flame/candle.&quot; Further, the smoke detector wasn&apos;t working:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/https://twitter.com/hashtag/FDNY?src=hash">#FDNY</a> Fire Marshals: Smoke alarm was present but not operational in yesterday&apos;s 4-alarm fire at 515 W 59 St  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/https://t.co/Y2oGCLxePG">https://t.co/Y2oGCLxePG</a></p>&#x2014; FDNY (@FDNY) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/https://twitter.com/FDNY/status/812286255664889857">December 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>A woman who lives next to the apartment where the fire broke out told the Post, &quot;I saw [the neighbor] in the lobby. She was completely covered with black ashes. I tried to have her go to emergency room, but she was concerned about the damage in her apartment. I ran downstairs, not sure how she got out. I am concerned about my friends in the building.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The FDNY recommends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190158/https://twitter.com/FDNY/status/812123346968125440">people learn if their building</a> is fireproof or non-fireproof and develop an escape plan accordingly:</p>
