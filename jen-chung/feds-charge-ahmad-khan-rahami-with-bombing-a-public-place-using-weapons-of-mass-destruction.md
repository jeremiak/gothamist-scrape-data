<p>The Elizabeth, NJ man accused of setting off a series of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/chelsea_explosion.php">explosive devices in New York</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/pipe_bomb_explodes_on_route_of_seas.php">and NJ</a>, injuring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/18/chelsea_explosion_investigation_con.php#photo-1">dozens in Manhattan</a>, bought various components to make the bombs on eBay and was filmed lighting explosives days before the bombing, federal authorities say. Ahmad Khan Rahami was hit with charges yesterday, including bombing a place of public use and using of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>Rahami is currently in NJ, after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/20/ahmad_khan_rahami_charged.php">charged with attempted murder of a law enforcement officer </a>for shooting a Linden cop during a manhunt. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara&apos;s office said, &quot;Rahami will first be transported by the United States Marshals Service, pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to face the charges filed in the Southern District of New York.&quot;</p>

<p>The bombings took place on Saturday, September 18th; the first bomb detonated in the morning in Seaside Park, where one pipe bomb with a cellphone exploded (two others did not detonate), causing no injuries. The second explosion occurred on West 23rd Street between 6th and 7th Avenues in Manhattan at 8:30 p.m.; according to Bharara&apos;s office, over 30 people were injured.</p>

<p>The Chelsea bomb was a pressure cooker with Christmas lights and a cellphone (shrapnel, like ball bearings, was packed into the cooker), and a second pressure cooker device was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/18/chelsea_explosion_investigation_con.php#photo-1">found on West 27th Street</a> and removed safely. This device was left in a suitcase, but two sidewalk opprtunists may have &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160919/chelsea/thieves-helped-crack-chelsea-bombing-case-sources-say">inadvertently disabled the explosive</a>&quot; when taking the suitcase. Then a resident called the police after seeing the pressure cooker, though she thought it looked like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/chelsea_bomb_discovery.php">&quot;kid&apos;s science experiment.&quot;</a></p>

<p>On Sunday night, five devices in a backpack were found at the Elizabeth, NJ train station by homeless men; they saw the wires coming out of the bag and informed police. One of the bombs was detonated by a bomb robot.</p>

<p>By Monday morning, Rahami was identified as a person of interest and, after raids of his and his family&apos;s home in Elizabeth, was found sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, NJ (by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://abc7ny.com/news/exclusive-linden-bar-owner-talks-about-finding-bombing-suspect/1517980/">bar&apos;s owner, who called the police</a>). When officers confronted him, Rahami allegedly shot at them, hitting one in the stomach (the cop was wearing a bulletproof vest and survived), and ran away before being shot and wounded.</p>

<p>The criminal complaint, which covers all three areas where bombs were found, says that Rahami ordered bomb parts on eBay between June and August of this year, and shipped them to a Perth Amboy business where he worked: </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_09_bombcom.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_09_bombcom.jpg" width="640" height="1137" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The criminal complaint also alleges that video of Rahami &quot;igniting incendiary material in a cylindrical container&quot; was found on a relative&apos;s cellphone. Feds believe the video was filmed on Thursday, September 15th, in Elizabeth: &quot;The video depicts Rahami in a backyard. Partially buried in the ground is a small black cylindrical object. A fuse is lit and the object ignites; the video depicts the lighting of the fuse, a loud noise and flames, followed by a billowing smoke and laughter. Rahami then entered the frame and is seen picking up the cylindrical container.&quot;</p>

<p>Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan, is currently hospitalized in Newark, NJ. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/20/dad_of_chelsea_bombing_suspect_told.php">His father called him a &quot;terrorist&quot;</a> during an argument two years ago, prompting a neighbor to call the authorities. The FBI questioned Rahami&apos;s father and other relatives; his father was apparently more upset about about his son&apos;s drinking and unsavory friends.</p>

<p>Rahami&apos;s wife left the country in the days before the bombings. She was headed to Pakistan but was stopped in the United Arab Emirates for questioning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;She provided a statement to the F.B.I., according to officials, and the authorities are working to bring her back into the country as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>Friends have said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015929/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/rahami_friends_shocked.php">Rahami changed after trips to Afghanistan</a>, appearing more religious and serious. After his arrest, authorities reportedly found a journal sympathetic to jihadist causes. The criminal complaint said Rahami allegedly wrote about his fears of being captured before the bombings: &quot;The handwritten document closes as follows: &apos;Inshallah [God willin] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION.&apos;&quot;</p>
