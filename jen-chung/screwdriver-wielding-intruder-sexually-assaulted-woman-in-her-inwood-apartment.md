<p>Authorities are searching for a man who sexually assaulted and robbed a woman in her Manhattan home. He apparently got into the apartment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020715/http://pix11.com/2016/10/31/armed-man-breaks-into-inwood-apartment-sexually-assaults-woman-nypd/">through an unlocked door</a>.</p>

<p>Police received a 911 call just before 9:30 p.m. last night. The victim, a 26-year-old woman, said that she found an unknown male holding a screwdriver in her apartment, an NYPD spokesman said. The stranger then forced her to perform a sex act on him before leaving with some of her property. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020715/http://abc7ny.com/news/inwood-woman-sexually-assaulted-by-man-armed-with-screwdriver/1581424/">WABC 7 reports</a> that the suspect took &quot;cash, a cell phone and a laptop.&quot;</p>

<p>The apartment is near 213th Street and Broadway. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020715/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Woman-Robbed-Sexually-Assaulted-in-Inwood-Manhattan-399282211.html">NBC NY reports</a> that the woman did not know her assailant.  </p>
