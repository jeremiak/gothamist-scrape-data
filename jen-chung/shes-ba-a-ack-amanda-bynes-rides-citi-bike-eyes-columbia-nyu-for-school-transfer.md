<p>Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, based in San Diego, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012952/http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/01/amanda-bynes-kicked-out-fashion-school-expelled-fidm/">apparently kicked her out last week</a> for odd behavior. Following that, Bynes was spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012952/http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/03/amanda-bynes-airport-lax-new-york-hair-salon-weed/">at LAX</a>, where she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012952/http://www.eonline.com/news/585477/amanda-bynes-spotted-in-nyc-with-a-band-aid-on-her-face-after-bizarre-airport-behavior?cmpid=tweol-manual">was seen at a restaurant</a> before her flight. From E!:</p><blockquote> &quot;She sat down at a booth, which is normally reserved for groups. They let her stay at the booth because she was Amanda Bynes and they knew her history. She asked for extra napkins before she even placed an order. [She] was at the table by herself with all her makeup spread out... She was talking to herself and putting on a ton of makeup. She would apply some, look in her compact and make weird pouty faces and then say to herself, &apos;OK, that looks fine.&apos;&quot;</blockquote>She has been in New York since last week, and was even spotted utilizing the city&apos;s bike share program:<p></p>

<p>Though it seems she needs to get the hang of CitiBike&apos;s quirks&#x2014;this video shows a wobbly Bynes nearly hitting some pedestrians:</p>

<p>Also? The 28-yea-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012952/http://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/exclusive-amanda-bynes-tells-in-touch-i-m-engaged-43950">announced that she&apos;s engaged</a> to a 19-year-old:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I am very needy for friendship and I hate men. I want to f--- them, but I can now say I&#x2019;m engaged &#x2014; get away from me,&#x201D; she told an In Touch reporter yesterday, Oct. 5. &#x201C;I want to be married and I want to be away from people.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>She claimed her 19-year-old fianc&#xE9; lives in Costa Mesa, California, and works in a bait shop... she hopes they can settle down in New York because she &#x201C;really [likes] walking and riding [her] bike, and in California, you need to drive.&#x201D; &#x201C;I really do not enjoy driving,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like the way I look in a car. The lighting is very bad.&#x201D;</p>

<p>After saying &#x201C;I do,&#x201D; she plans to start a family with her husband-to-be &#x2014;and hopes to have lots of baby boys. &#x201C;I want boys, for sure. However many I can pop out,&#x201D; she told In Touch. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want a gorgeous girl around. Then I [would] feel way jealous. Ew.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>On the other hand:<p></p>
