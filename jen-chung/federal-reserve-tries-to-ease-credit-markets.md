<p>After global stock markets fell--and the U.S.&apos;s Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051217/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/06/dow_falls_below_10000_for_first_tim.php">fell below 10,000 points</a> for the first time since 2004-- the Federal Reserve announced it would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051217/http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081007c.htm">create a new facility</a> to buy the short-term debt (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051217/http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2008/10/commercial_paper.html">commercial paper</a>) various companies hold.  The &quot;Commercial Paper Funding Facility&quot; will &quot;purchase three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper&quot; and &quot;<strong>this facility should encourage investors to once again engage in term lending in the commercial paper market</strong>&quot;--which is worth $1.6 trillion.  Of course, it&apos;s unclear how much the Fed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051217/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aAyx4qPsKSZk&amp;refer=home">will ultimately buy</a>.</p>

<p>The Dow opened up, but is, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051217/http://www.cnbc.com/id/27066304">right now</a>, basically unchanged (up 8 points; Nasdaq down 0.65%, S&amp;P; 500 down 0.08%).  Still, this was good news to investors.  Rosenblatt Securities&apos; Gordon Charlop told CNBC, &quot;Terrific news. Frees up money markets. If you just look around at some of the valuations ... book value versus earnings, there seems like there&apos;s some opportunities here.&quot;    The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051217/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/07markets.html?ref=business">NY Times points out</a> this &quot;move will put more taxpayer dollars at risk,&quot; but &quot;it underscore the growing sense of urgency felt by policy makers in a climate where lending has virtually dried up.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will discuss the economic outlook at 1:15 p.m. (EST).  And while the $700 billion bailout package President Bush signed into law may help companies in the U.S., many think economics around the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051217/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/worldbusiness/07global.html?hp">will fall into recession</a>.
