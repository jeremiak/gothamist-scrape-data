<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011907/http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20395222_20859606,00.html">weeks of rumors</a>, it was finally confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&#x2014;better known as Prince William and Kate Middleton&#x2014;will be visiting New York City next month to support a number of charities and British government initiatives. The palace said this was &quot;the first visit by either of Their Royal Highnesses&quot; to NYC &quot;in any capacity.&quot; The trip will be December 7th through 9th. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011907/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/press-releases/the-duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-will-visit-the-united-states-of-america">According to Clarence House</a>, &quot;The charitable themes will include promoting sustainable conservation issues with a particular focus on collaborative working to tackle the illegal wildlife trade, and also supporting organisations which reflect Their Royal Highnesses&apos; interest in young people&apos;s mental health and the importance supporting disadvantaged young people from an early age. As Patron of the University of St Andrews 600th Anniversary Campaign, The Duke accompanied by The Duchess will also attend the University&apos;s 600th Anniversary Gala Dinner in New York. In support of UK Government initiatives, The Duke and Duchess will attend events that celebrate the successful partnerships between the UK and USA in the technology and creative industries sectors.&quot;</p>

<p>Prince William will be going to Washington D.C. one day while Kate Middleton will remain in NYC: &quot;Her Royal Highness will be accompanied by The First Lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, on a visit to a local child development centre. They will learn about how this organisation fosters the healthy development of children and families by providing high-quality mental health and educational services, which is an issue strongly supported by The First Lady. Her Royal Highness will also attend a lunch, hosted by the British Consul General in New York, to celebrate the achievements of a successful British community in New York from the culture, arts, hospitality and business sectors.&quot; And will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011907/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/27/taylor_swift_nyc_nye.php">NYC&apos;s ambassador Taylor Swift be on hand</a>? </p>

<p>Also of note: They&apos;ll be attending the December 8th Brooklyn Nets-Cleveland Cavaliers game at the Barclays Center and the St. Andrews Anniversary Gala Dinner will be at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if baby Prince George will be attending, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011907/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2827163/Prince-William-pregnant-Kate-return-unveil-new-charity-three-years-2011-post-wedding-trip-Los-Angeles.html">the Mail on Sunday noted</a> they are &quot;expected to&quot; bring him.</p>
