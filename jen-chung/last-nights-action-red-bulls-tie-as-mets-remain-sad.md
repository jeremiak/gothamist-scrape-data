<p>The Red Bulls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506174251/http://www.nj.com/redbulls/index.ssf/2011/08/red_bulls_tie_revolution_2-2_as_playoff_chances_take_another_blow.html">managed to tie the New England Revolution 2-2</a> after falling behind 2-0 in the first half.  But even though they avoided a loss, the team is still fighting for a  playoff spot. Forward Thierry Henry didn&apos;t play due to a &quot;balky Achilles.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, the Mets had a 9-7 lead going into the eighth inning against the Brewers.  But in the ninth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506174251/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/sports/baseball/former-met-provides-little-relief-but-current-ones-provide-even-less.html">as the NY Times reports</a>, Mets reliever Jason Isringhausen promptly loaded the bases and walked in a run. Manny Acosta replaced Isringhausen and gave up a run-scoring single to Prince Fielder and another single to Casey McGehee, resulting in two more runs for Milwaukee.&quot;  Milwaukee won 11-9.</p>

<p>What?  Another A.J. Burnett implosion?  Colored us not shocked.  In one-and-two-thirds innings, Burnett gave up seven runs to the Twins.  The Yankees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506174251/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/curses_implodes_again_as_yankees_BKg3tPTohBdEhjBYOgKyHI">lost to Minnesota 9-4</a>.</p>

<p>The Seattle Storm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506174251/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/liberty/late_no_call_dooms_liberty_zPexofe0JBSUV4bPG97mkM">beat the New York Liberty 63-62</a>, and the Liberty are complaining about the refereeing. Coach John Whisenant said of a Storm player stripping a ball from Essence Carson and not getting called out, &quot;The official choked the last play. They were trying to foul and he choked. There is not a whole lot you can do about that.&quot;</p>
