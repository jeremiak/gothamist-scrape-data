<p>As ex-IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn awaits release on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019020341/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/19/dominique_strauss-kahn_indicted_on.php">$1 million cash bail</a>, the Daily Show and Jon Stewart looked at the leading French economist and politician&apos;s passionate supporters.  Like Ben Stein, the lawyer, Nixon speechwriter, actor, joke-teller, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019020341/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/ben_stein_imf_head_too_short_fat_ol.php">who wondered earlier this week</a>, &quot;The prosecutors say that Mr. Strauss-Kahn &apos;forced&apos; the complainant to have oral and other sex with him. How? Did he have a gun? Did he have a knife? He&apos;s a short fat old man,&quot; and &quot;Can anyone tell me any economists who have been convicted of violent sex crimes?&quot; Well, Stewart managed to find some examples, leading him to declare, &quot;Economists are the rapiest profession going.  It turns out the invisible hand of the market is very f***ing touchy feely... Yes, it&apos;s a redistribution of rape.&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart also looked at French philosopher<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019020341/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-05-16/bernard-henri-lvy-the-dominique-strauss-kahn-i-know/?cid=hp:beastoriginalsR5"> Bernard-Henri L&#xE9;vy&apos;s essay on The Daily Beast</a>.  (L&#xE9;vy espoused a distaste for American justice and hotel cleaning standards: &quot;I do not know&#x2014;but, on the other hand, it would be nice to know, and without delay&#x2014;how a chambermaid could have walked in alone, contrary to the habitual practice of most of New York&#x2019;s grand hotels of sending a &apos;cleaning brigade&apos; of two people, into the room of one of the most closely watched figures on the planet... I am troubled by a system of justice modestly termed &#x201C;accusatory,&#x201D; meaning that anyone can come along and accuse another fellow of any crime&#x2014;and it will be up to the accused to prove that the accusation is false and without basis in fact.&quot;)</p>
