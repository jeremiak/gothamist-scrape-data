title: From Brian Lehrer to Tina Fey: 67th Annual Peabody Award Winners Honored
---

	
										<p>Last night at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, a group of journalists and entertainers were honored for their work in 2007 at the ceremony for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150316/http://128.192.29.189/news/pressrelease.asp?ID=152">67th Annual Peabody Awards</a>.  This year&apos;s awards, administered by the University of Georgia&apos;s Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication  and selected by a board, are considered one of the most prestigious awards in electronic media (films intended for wide theatrical release are not allowed), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150316/http://128.192.29.189/news/pressrelease.asp?ID=152">were given to 35 different recipients</a>--many of them NYC-based entities, like the series 30 Rock and Mad Men, the mock-news show The Colbert Report, reality show Project Runway and WNYC&apos;s The Brian Lehrer Show.  </p>
