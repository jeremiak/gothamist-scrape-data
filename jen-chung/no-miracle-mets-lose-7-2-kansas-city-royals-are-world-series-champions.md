Oh, the pain of seeing the Royals celebrating on Citi Field!</p>

<p>Mets starter Matt Harvey pitched eight innings without a run. Manager Terry Collins kept Harvey in to pitch the ninth inning, a fateful decision as Harvey gave up a leadoff walk to Lorenzo Cain, allowed a stolen base and RBI double to Eric Hosmer. Then closer Jeurys Familia gave up the tying run to put the game into extra innings. Mets first baseman Lucas Duda <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305150433/http://nypost.com/2015/11/02/lucas-duda-throws-away-game-5-and-the-world-series/">is also reaping the blame</a> for letting Hosmer score. </p>

<p>Then things fell apart in the 12th inning, with relievers Addison Reed and Bartolo Colon. Here&apos;s how the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305150433/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/sports/baseball/kansas-city-royals-beat-new-york-mets-world-series-game-5.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0">NY Times described the Royal&apos;s castle-storming rout</a>:</p><blockquote>The winning rally also had innocuous roots: a bloop single by [Salvador] Perez, a stolen base by pinch-runner Jarrod Dyson, a productive groundout by Alex Gordon that moved Dyson to third and a line single to left by pinch-hitter Christian Colon, who was making his first appearance in the postseason.<p></p>

<p>Then the floodgates opened. Doubles by Alcides Escobar and Lorenzo Cain brought home four runs, sending fans toward the exits and leaving the Royals to await the coronation. That came when Wade Davis struck out Wilmer Flores for the final out, sending the Royals storming out of the dugout.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>While the Royals were popping champagne in the visitors locker room, Terry Collins was giving a grim-faced post-game press conference.

I want it bad. You&apos;ve got to leave me in.&apos; I said, &apos;Matt, you&apos;ve got us exactly where we wanted to get.&apos; He said, &apos;I want this game in the worst way.&apos; So, obviously, I let my heart get in the way of my gut.
