<p>The backgrounds of the two young NJ men who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141658/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/06/two_men_with_alleged_terror_ties_ar.php">arrested earlier this week</a> for allegedly plotting to travel to Somalia and kill American troops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141658/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/in_high_school_nj_terror_suspect_wa.php">have been scrutinized</a>, but now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141658/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/nyregion/12suspects.html?pagewanted=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times takes a look</a> at the formative years of Mohamed Mahmood Alessa and Carlos Almonte: &quot;Their stories began like many others: troubled teenagers who scare and mystify their neighbors; run-ins with the police while still in high school; parents who cannot compete with the sense of belonging or purpose their boys find elsewhere.&quot; </p>

<p>Alessa&apos;s parents, &quot;who began taking him to psychiatrists at age 6 and medicating him in a vain struggle to control his moods&quot;&#x2014;he stopped taking medication and seeing therapists about three years ago, agreed to be interviewed. (Both suspects&apos; families reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141658/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/07/families_of_nj_terror_suspects_aide.php">cooperated with the feds</a>.) His mother, who previously said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141658/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/nj_terror_suspects_mom_says_hes_cra.php">he was &quot;crazy,&quot;</a> said, &quot;Of course we tried everything we could. We couldn&#x2019;t just keep him at home,&quot; but also admits that she and her husband spoiled him.  She showed the Times a tender picture:</p><blockquote>About two weeks ago, Ms. Alessa snapped a picture of her son that she keeps on her cellphone, a reminder of a serene moment in their home. It shows Mohamed lying on a floral quilt, snuggling Princess Tuna, his cat.<p></p>

<p>He wanted to take the cat with him to Egypt, but his mother said no, and they argued. When he headed to the airport, he went instead with a big bag of candy from his parents&#x2019; deli. The F.B.I. seized the candy, his mother said. </p></blockquote><br>

<p>As for Almonte, his conversion to Islam, after being caught with a knife at school and drinking in the park, shocked his Dominican family: &quot;On a Facebook page started in October 2008, Mr. Almonte posted long quotations from medieval Islamic scholars and present-day radicals like Abu Qatada, considered by many countries to be a terrorist, and the jihadist cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri. Mr. Almonte was also outraged at the treatment of Muslim prisoners accused of terrorism... He posted a photo of himself at a Dec. 28, 2008, protest in Manhattan, holding a sign saying &apos;DEATH TO ALL JUICE,&apos; with the word &apos;ZIONIST&apos; written faintly above &#x201C;JUICE.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>In court on Thursday, Almonte was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141658/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/11/2010-06-11_jersey_jihadist_spells_out_hate_death_to_all_juice.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+(NY+Local)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">reportedly silent and &quot;frazzled-looking&quot;</a> while Alessa &quot;acted like a clown, laughing and smirking.&quot;</p>
