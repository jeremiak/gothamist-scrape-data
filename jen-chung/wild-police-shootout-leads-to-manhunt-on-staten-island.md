<p>The police have reportedly apprehended a suspect who was on the loose after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723051808/http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2017/01/cops_fired_several_shots_at_su.html#incart_2box_silive-homepage-featured">&quot;wild&quot; shootout in the Charleston section</a> of Staten Island between officers and two allegedly armed suspects earlier this morning. The other suspect&#x2014;who was described as wearing a &quot;heavy ballistic vest&quot;&#x2014;was taken into custody after the shooting.</p>

<p>Around 1:10 a.m., police say they received two calls&#x2014;one at the 123rd Precinct stationhouse and the other to 911&#x2014;about gunshots near Androvette Street and Arthur Kill Road, by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723051808/http://www.daddyosbbqbar.com/">DaddyOs BBQ</a>. A sergeant and police officer arrived at the scene in a marked car, and NYPD Assistant Chief Edward Delatorre said that while canvassing the area by Kreischer Street and Androvette, the officers &quot;noticed two males. One male fled into the woods and the other male, just about the same time, came from&#x2014;what we believe to be, this is all soft information right now came from the side of a building and he turned on them and drew a weapon. The weapon was a 9mm Glock 26.&quot;</p>

<p>The officers then fired several times, striking the suspect, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723051808/http://nypost.com/2017/01/05/nypd-in-shootout-with-two-men-on-staten-island/">who the NY Post identifies</a> as Patrick Allen, 24. Delatorre said Allen was shot several times in the left leg, once in his left leg, and may have caught a bullet in the &quot;heavy ballistic vest&quot; he was allegedly wearing. Allen is currently in stable condition at Staten Island University Hospital.</p>

<p>When police searched for the second suspect who ran into the woods, they found &quot;what appears to be an AR 15 semi-automatic rifle, evidence of several shells that may have been fired in that area in the woods, which is right off the street itself, and... a large hunting knife,&quot; Delatorre said. </p>

<p>The NYPD conducted a frantic manhunt for the second suspect. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723051808/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/person-shot-police-involved-shooting-s-article-1.2935112">Daily News transcribed</a> the police radio transmission: &quot;I&apos;ve got one perp down, one perp outstanding. He&apos;s got a brown jacket running into the woods. I need aviation right now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Local and state police were on nearly every street in the neighborhood as multiple NYPD helicopters roared overhead,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723051808/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Reports-of-Police-Involved-Shooting-on-Staten-Island-409737855.html">according to NBC New York</a>. </p>

<p>He was found at 6:30 a.m., &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723051808/http://abc7ny.com/news/armed-and-dangerous-suspect-on-loose-on-staten-island/1687304/">walking on Ellis Road, off of Arthur Kill Road</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>A source tells the Post that the Charleston bus depot nearby &quot;was put on lockdown, leaving 40 to 50 MTA employees stranded there and buses unable to go in or out.&quot;</p>
