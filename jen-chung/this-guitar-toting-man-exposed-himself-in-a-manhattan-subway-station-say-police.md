<p>Police are looking for a guitar-toting man accused of exposing and touching himself in front of a subway rider inside a Harlem subway station last month. The victim was able to take pretty clear photographs of the suspect.</p>

<p>Cops say the incident occurred around 4:30 p.m. on March 1st at the 145th Street 1 train station. According to the NYPD, a 31-year-old woman was walking on the southbound platform &quot;when she was approached by an individual who asked for directions in Spanish. The victim soon after realized that the individual was using his hands to touch his exposed private parts at which time she ran away from the individual in an attempt to seek aid.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was able to take his picture, and the man fled on a southbound 1 train, police say.</p>

<p>The suspect, who is wanted for public lewdness, is described as being about 45 years old, 130 pounds and 5&apos;5&quot;, with grayish black hair. He was last seen wearing a dark jacket, blue jeans and dark shoes with a light blue shirt and blue tie and playing a dark colored guitar slung across his chest.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
