<p>Hey, remember the woman from Tennessee who brought her fully-loaded .22 caliber pistol to the 9/11 Memorial who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040705/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/dont_bring_your_gun_to_the_911_memo.php">was arrested after asking security where she should check it</a>? Because even though she had a permit in Tennessee, she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040705/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/31/after_911_memorial_gun_arrest_ny_po.php">didn&apos;t have a permit to carry in NYC</a>?  Well, Meredith Graves no longer faces the mandatory minimum of 3 1/2 years in prison because she just got a &quot;no-jail, misdemeanor deal,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040705/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/tenn_woman_gets_gun_jail_deal_after_dofHcAmB3njjQb8nYTQWXP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">according to the Post</a>. </p>

<p>Graves, a medical student, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge.  Her lawyer Daniel Horwitz said, &quot;We&apos;re hoping that wherever she ends up practicing, this is the kind of disposition where licensing boards have a lot of discretion... She&apos;s happy that this ordeal is over and she&apos;s looking forward to getting on with her life and her career as a doctor.&quot; He added, &quot;It was completely inadvertent. She lives a very hectic life... working nights and then mornings. Somehow, the bag got packed, and the gun was in there.&quot;</p>

<p>NYC law enforcement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040705/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/20/tennessee_rep_threatens_nyc_drivers.php">was criticized for its harsh laws</a>, but as mayoral spokesman Marc LaVorgna said, &quot;Common sense also includes checking gun laws before traveling&#x2014;something even the NRA tells people to do.&quot;<br>
