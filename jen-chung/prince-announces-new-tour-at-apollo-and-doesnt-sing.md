<p>When you hear that Prince will be giving a press conference at the Apollo Theatre, it makes sense to expect that the Purple One might do something flashy, perhaps even perform a song, right?  Especially when a gold-plated electric guitar is on stage?  But yesterday, The Artist Formerly Known As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322220846/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Symbol_Album">TAFKAP</a> simply announced a new tour&#x2014;Welcome 2 America&#x2014;featuring different artists like Maceo Parker and Janelle Monae. Prince will the emcee for the concerts and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322220846/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/prince-announces-america-concert-series/story?id=11886308">will perform</a> with the New Power Generation, telling the press, &quot;<strong>Bring your friends, bring your children, and bring foot spray, because it&apos;s going to be funky.</strong>&quot; But he didn&apos;t answer any questions, nor did he give any information on where the concerts would be, when they would be (aside from starting on a &quot;purple day in December&quot;) or how much tickets would cost.</p>

<p>Other tidbits:  Prince introduced Geoffrey Canada, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322220846/http://www.hcz.org/">Harlem&apos;s Children Zone</a> educator to the stage, and encouraged people to see the education reform documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322220846/http://www.waitingforsuperman.com/">Waiting For Superman</a>. After Prince left, BET president Stephen Hill explained the gold guitar would be auctioned off, with proceeds benefiting the Harlem Empowerment Zone, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322220846/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/10/at_the_apollo_theater_in_new_y.html">Star-Ledger&apos;s Tris McCall wrote</a> that the audience clapped at that news: &quot;The crowd of journalists and Prince fans who crowded into the landmark theater wouldn&apos;t have minded applauding for a song or two, too....  Prince, one of the great pop musicians of the past fifty years, is a reliably thrilling concert performer. He does, however, have a reputation for inscrutability that this press conference did nothing to dispel.&quot;</p>
