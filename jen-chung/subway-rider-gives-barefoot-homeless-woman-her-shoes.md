LOL&quot;</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A woman heading home from work in Midtown decided to take off her boots and give them to a barefoot homeless woman on a 3 train earlier this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032138/https://www.facebook.com/thekbhart/posts/10205250961739787?pnref=story">She shared photos on Facebook and explained</a>, &quot;You see, I can buy another pair of shoes tomorrow... It&apos;s the middle of November and she has no where to go, so the least I could do is give her a pair of shoes.&quot; What would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032138/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/10/nypd_homeless_solution.php">Police Commissioner Bratton think</a>?</p>

<p>Brown, 26, an assistant at an investment firm, says she was initially reluctant to write about the Monday night encounter on social media; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032138/http://www.today.com/kindness/subway-rider-inspires-us-all-offering-barefoot-homeless-woman-her-t56726">she told Today</a>, &quot;I wasn&apos;t doing it for attention, but people started coming up to me saying, &apos;That was the most beautiful thing I&apos;ve ever seen.&apos; Everybody was so kind. You want people to pass those things on, and see something like that and do something themselves.&quot; And there was another person who showed his kindness as well&#x2014;here&apos;s Brown&apos;s account:</p>

No socks, shoes or anything. I asked her what shoe size she wore and we were the same. I gave her the shoes off my feet and they fit perfectly. She couldn&apos;t have been more gracious. So I stood on the subway for 15 min in my mixed matched socks, then right before I got off the subway a gentleman offered me an extra pair of socks to go over top of my small thin ones. You see, I can buy another pair of shoes tomorrow. And he probably has plenty of socks at home. It&apos;s the middle of November and she has no where to go, so the least I could do is give her a pair of shoes. So, I walked 6 blocks home in socks getting strange looks and comments made about me... but now she&apos;s able to wear a pair of shoes each day and suffer a little less. Pay it forward y&apos;all. And shout out to the guy who gave me the extra socks! They helped a ton!</blockquote>In an interview with the Daily News, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032138/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-yorker-barefoot-homeless-woman-shoes-subway-article-1.2440107">Brown explained</a>, &quot;Usually on the subway I&#x2019;m like, &#x2018;No one look at me, no one talk to me,&#x2019; I&#x2019;m just on my phone like everyone else,&quot; but the woman&apos;s condition cut through her protective bubble: &quot;Her toes were crossed over each other and freezing, and I couldn&#x2019;t imagine not having something on my feet.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Brown emphasized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032138/http://abc7ny.com/society/woman-on-subway-takes-off-her-shoes-gives-them-to-barefooted-homeless-woman/1092264/">she wanted to share a message of compassion</a>, &quot;Right now there&apos;s so many terrible things happening, I mean absolutely terrible things happening, and I wanted to share some positive energy. I wasn&apos;t trying to do that to pat my own back, I just wanted to be like this was really cool, this was an awesome moment for me, and I wanted to share with other people. And I can&apos;t believe how something so small turned into something so great.&quot;</p>
