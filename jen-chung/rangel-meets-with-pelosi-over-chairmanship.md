<p>After reports yesterday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09152008/news/regionalnews/pelosi_asks_rangel_to_step_down_from_com_129228.htm">asked Representative Charles Rangel to step down</a> as the chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, his fate is unclear.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/85872/rangel-keeps-chairmanship-on-house-committee/Default.aspx">NY1 reports</a> he&apos;s keeping the chairmanship, while Politico reports that Pelosi says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/16/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4452040.shtml">no decision has been made</a>.</p>

<p>Rangel, Pelosi and other House members met yesterday afternoon to discuss Rangel&apos;s problems related to income <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/05/rangels_75000.php">not reported on his Dominican Republic villa</a> as well as from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/rangels_taxes_keep_turning_up_mangl.php">sale of a home in D.C.</a>  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09162008/news/regionalnews/charlie__just_quit___pelosi_129321.htm">NY Post reported</a> after the meeting, Rangel wouldn&apos;t discuss it, but did say  &quot;Do to me what you want, I&apos;m not talking&quot; before &quot;bizarrely rattling off his name, rank and serial number from his Korean War days.&quot;</p>

This morning, Pelosi said, &quot;I don&apos;t think that decision has been made. We have a lot of confidence in Mr. Rangel and when we have news on that we will let you know what it is, but that decision has not been made.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the sentiment from the media seems cast:  Besides the Post&apos;s continuous coverage of every little step Rangel makes, even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/opinion/15mon1.html?hp">NY Times published an editorial</a> asking that Pelosi remove Rangel from the chairmanship, finding his claim that he couldn&apos;t get more details about the villa&apos;s rental income because people he called were speaking Spanish &quot;offensive.&quot;  And U.S. News &amp; World Report&apos;s Sam Dealey f<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124338/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/sam-dealey/2008/09/15/sorry-charlie--rangel-makes-more-excuses-for-his-failure-to-pay-taxes.html">ound this Rangel excuse &quot;priceless&quot;</a>:  &quot;While over the years I delegated to my staff the completion of my annual House financial disclosure statements, I had the ultimate responsibility.&quot;</p>
