<p>Late Wednesday night, four people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313015721/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/12/four_shot_at_soho_music_club_sobs.php">were shot at the Soho nightclub S.O.B.&apos;s</a>, right before rapper Fat Trel was about to perform. The Washington DC-based performer&apos;s manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313015721/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/nyregion/4-in-audience-shot-at-club-in-soho.html?ref=nyregion">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;It was chaos. I heard shots, and I immediately ran to my artist,&quot; but also added, &quot;It had nothing to do with us. We don&#x2019;t bring that sort of attention. Our fan base is mainly females.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313015721/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/clubgoers-stage-soho-shooting-article-1.1453767">Daily News reports</a> that it might have been semi-related to Fat Trel&#x2014;or at least his manager: &quot;..several clubgoers demanded to join a headlining rapper onstage and promote their own music, police sources said Thursday...four men attempted to get on stage with [Fat Trel]... As the four men and Fat Trel&apos;s manager argued, someone pulled a 9 mm. handgun and blasted the crowd, wounding the four and sending 400 patrons scrambling for cover.&quot;</p>

<p>Richardine Bartee told the Times, &quot;The gunshots came from the stage, and it went into the crowd,&quot; and refers to some people from NJ that apparently might have been part of the chaos in a video she posted:</p>

<p>The shooter fled, and police are still investigating the incident. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313015721/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/09/xxl-staff-gives-firsthand-account-sobs-shooting-fat-trel-show/">staffer with XXL wrote</a>, &quot;Okay, I arrived at SOB&#x2019;s around 10:30 p.m. As I went inside I was patted down and my bag was searched as soon as I got to the door. The security is always on point when it comes to searching attendees, so the outcome of the night was a real head-scratcher for everyone. Now I lived in D.C. for a couple of years and been to a couple of Fat Trel concerts. He&#x2019;s an artist I enjoy and love to see live. I sensed immediately that the place was definitely filled with tension, which I later found out was a result from a couple of fights that happened earlier on in the night.&quot; </p>

<p>Fat Trel posted this video to Instagram:</p>
