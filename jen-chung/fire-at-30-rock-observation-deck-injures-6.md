<p>A fire broke out last night inside an observation deck at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. According to the FDNY, six people were injured.</p>

<p>The Top of the Rock observation deck is made up of three floors, the 67th, 69th, and 70th (no 68th as the 67th is double height), and it&apos;s frequently used by NBC shows, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015737/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/11/video_jon_hamm_jimmy_fallon_photobo.php">The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015737/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/13/officials-6-injured-in-fire-on-30-rock-observation-deck/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;A fire department spokesman says the fire started just after 7:30 p.m. Sunday and was under control about a half hour later. He says the injuries were caused by embers from the fire falling onto the victims.&quot;</p>
