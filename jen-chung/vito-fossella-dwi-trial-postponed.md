Fossella was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051031/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/02/fossella_dwi.php">pulled over</a> by police in Alexandria, VA in May, and it turned out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051031/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/04/press_descends.php">woman who picked him up from the police station</a> was his mistress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051031/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/08/vito_fossella_a.php">who he had a love child with</a>.  The Staten Island politician&apos;s lawyer is continuing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051031/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/26/fossella_will_t.php">question the reliability of the equipment</a> used to test Fosella&apos;s breath.  Fosella will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051031/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/20/vito_fossella_a_2.php">not be running for re-election</a>, and the second Republican (the first died) chosen to run for his seat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051031/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/15/former_assemblyman_picked_to_run_fo.php">is not a popular choice</a>.</p>
