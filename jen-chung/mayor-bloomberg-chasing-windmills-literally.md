Or maybe those wind turbines could be a lot closer.  From his speech at the Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas:</p><blockquote>Perhaps companies will want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers, or use the enormous potential of powerful off-shore winds miles out in the Atlantic Ocean, where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land-based windfarms can. Windfarms located far off our shores, some evidence shows, could meet 10 percent of our city&apos;s electricity needs within a decade.</blockquote>He emphasized, &quot;We don&apos;t generate a lot of electricity in New York City. But we can work on using less. And in New York, we&apos;re determined to do what no other city has ever attempted, and that is to keep our energy usage at or near its current level even as our population grows,&quot; and added, &quot;<strong>I think it would be a thing of beauty if, when Lady Liberty looks out on the horizon, she not only welcomes new immigrants, but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean windfarm</strong>.&quot;<p></p>

<p>While no specific bridges or buildings have been singled out for wind turbines (and even Bloomberg admitted it wasn&apos;t a sure thing)--but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111017011745/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/nyregion/20windmill.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a> &quot;the city was eyeing the generally windy coast off Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island for turbines.&quot;  And Rohit Aggarwala, director of Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, tells the Times smaller building turbines can be &quot;so small that people think they are part of the design...If rooftop wind can make it anywhere, this is a great city. We have a lot of tall buildings.&#x201D; </p>

<p>NYU director environmental studies Dale Jamieson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111017011745/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08202008/news/regionalnews/breezy_does_it__hizzoner_125263.htm">told the Post</a>,&quot;This isn&apos;t a wild idea at all. Wind energy is something we know how to do.&quot;  And last month, the New Yorker&apos;s Elizabeth Kolbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111017011745/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/08/19/2008-08-19_big_green_apple_mayor_says_answer_to_ene.html">wrote about a Danish community</a>&apos;s &quot;victory over carbon emissions,&quot; which includes using windmills.</p>
