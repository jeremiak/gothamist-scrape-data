<p>Are you feeling a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/bernie_sanders_plans_prospect_park.php">Berned out</a>? Then get ready for Hillary Clinton, who will be in New York City tomorrow with a speech at the Reverend Al Sharpton&apos;s National Action Network Convention and then an organizing event in the Bronx.</p>

<p>Clinton&apos;s remarks at the NAN 25th Anniversary Convention, held at the Sheraton Times Square, are open to the public <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/http://www.nationalactionnetwork.net/convention/">who register here</a>. She&apos;ll be speaking at 12:15 p.m. Back in 2007, Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/20/the_reverend_al.php">spoke at the &quot;Sharpton primary&quot;</a> as did lesser-known then-Senator Barack Obama, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/22/obama_at_the_sh.php">didn&apos;t win over the crowd</a> as much as Clinton. </p>

<p>Then, at 7 p.m. (doors open at 5 p.m.), Clinton will be at the Dreiser Loop Community Center at 177 Dreiser Loop in the Bronx. The public <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/events/view/UFKTJWS2OXI5LBVA/">can RSVP here</a>.</p>

<p>The Bronx event is at the same time as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/bernie_sanders_plans_prospect_park.php">Bernie Sanders&apos; big Washington Square Park rally</a>-slash-Vampire Weekend concert. Clinton has had fewer big events in New York, presumably because she&apos;s been our senator for years and a known personality for decades&#x2014;not to mention the fact that she&apos;s been campaigning for a year (!):</p>

<p>She is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/decision-2016/2016/04/11/ny1-baruch-college-poll--trump-leads-rivals-by-43-percentage-points.html">leading Sanders by 13 points</a> in the latest NY1/Baruch College poll. The two candidates will debate on April 14 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; CNN will be broadcasting the showdown, which starts at 9 p.m. </p>

<p>The New York State primary is on April 19 and is opened to registered Democrats and Republicans... as long as the NY State Board of Elections <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234747/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/voter_confusion_primary_ny.php">has your information correct</a>.<br>
