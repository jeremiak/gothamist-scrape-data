                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_09_donnydickson.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061358im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_donnydickson.jpg" width="375" height="318"> <br> <i style=" width:375px; ;display:block"> Donovan Dickson (Facebook)</i></div> A 24-year-old teacher at a NJ private school killed himself last week when he jumped off the George Washington Bridge. On Friday, October 4th, Donovan Dickson landed on the Manhattan side near the Little Red Lighthouse, and was pronounced dead. Now sources tell the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061358/http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2013/10/teacher_at_peddie_school_in_hightstown_leaps_to_his_death_as_authorities_investigate_sex_allegations.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Times of Trenton reports</a> that on the very same day, &quot;county detectives showed up on&quot; the campus of the Peddie School &quot;to conduct an investigation into allegations of sex between a teacher and a teenage student.&quot;<p></p>

<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061358/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/unionleader/obituary.aspx?n=donovan-s-dickson-donny&amp;pid=167423049&amp;fhid=4703">obituary for Dickson says</a>, &quot;Born on March 9, 1989, Donny was a sweet and beautiful boy with a bright outlook and a contagious positive manner, who had grown into a wonderful adult, loved and admired by his students and colleagues at the Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J., where he taught math and coached boys cross-country, track, and wrestling.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mercer County Prosecutor&apos;s Office spokeswoman said, &quot;Detectives were sent to the Peddie School last Friday to assist Hightstown in investigating allegations of inappropriate sexual contact between a teacher and a student,&quot; but the Times notes, &quot;Authorities would not say whether the two events were connected, or whether [Dickson] was the target of the investigation by Hightstown police and county detectives.&quot; Peddie also refused to comment about the investigation and Dickson.</p>

<p>No charges were filed in the underage sex case.  In his Class of 2011 speech at Middlebury, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061358/http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/commencement/waddell_commencement/dickson">Dickson said</a>, &quot;In five, 10, 15, or some larger-multiple-of-five years from now, I know that many of us will be able to come back to reunion, reconnect with old friends and be able to proudly say that we were here as members of the Class of 2011.&quot; </p>
