<p>Sanford Weill, the former chairman of Citigroup, bought a 6,437-square foot apartment at ultra-luxury building 15 Central Park West for over $43 million in 2007.  Now, he&apos;s selling the full-floor home, which has sweeping views of the park, for $88 million.  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011551/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204358004577028560297692548.html?mod=rss_newyork_main">tells the Wall Street Journal</a> that he and his wife &quot;don&apos;t need as big an apartment as we did. We are downsizing a little bit.&quot;  Also, right now is &quot;a pretty good time&quot; for the 1% &quot;to be quiet&quot;&#x2014;and he&apos;s going to donate the proceeds of the apartment sale to charity.</p>

<p>Weill, who has made hundreds of millions and donated hundreds of millions, says they will move to a smaller apartment on a lower floor in the same building.  The WSJ reports, &quot;Given the soaring resale prices for some high-floor apartments at the building, brokers said a record-breaking sale is possible for Mr. Weill&apos;s apartment despite the gloomy economic picture. Mr. Weill said New York remains a powerful draw for international buyers.&quot;  </p>

<p>Weil, who grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, added, &quot;We are not leaving the city and giving up the wonderful opportunity to be New York City residents and New York City taxpayers. New York has been very good to us.&quot;</p>
