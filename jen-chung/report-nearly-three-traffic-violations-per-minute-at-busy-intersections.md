<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_08_taxitotaed.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081447im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_08_taxitotaed.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>After studying four intersections for 38 hours, Transportation Alternatives, the bicycling, walking and public transit advocacy group, has released a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081447/http://transalt.org/newsroom/releases/3398">report with suggestions for the NYPD</a> on reducing &quot;the most dangerous driving behaviors.&quot;  Some of the findings: &quot;Traffic law violations occur three times every minute (157 times an hour) per intersection&quot; and &quot;<strong>On average, each intersection had 24 Failure to Yield violations per hour. Failure to Yield is the second most frequent human factor in causing motor vehicle crashes</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>TransAlt noted that right now, the NYPD only measures the number of summons issued, which doesn&apos;t track what percentage of drivers failing to yield or running red lights.  The group studied the intersections at 96th Street and Broadway (Manhattan), 73rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue (Queens), Smith Street and 9th Street (Brooklyn) and Prospect Place and Carlton Avenue (Brooklyn)&#x2014;which were selected based on factors like the &quot;existence of all major transportation modes at the site, including subway and/or bus access, car and pedestrian traffic&quot; and &quot;high vehicle and pedestrian traffic at the site.&quot; Another stat: &quot;<strong>Over 38 hours of surveying, no summonses were issued for any moving violations, although they would have netted a total of $478,645 if apprehended.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Among TransAlt&apos;s recommendations: The NYPD should identify the 50 most-crash prone intersections and monitor them and launch traffic violation complaints by 311.

And the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081447/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/08/25/2009-08-25_accidents_waiting_to_happen_drivers_run_amok_at_intersections_around_new_york_sa.html">told the Daily News</a> they are doing a good job already and that they &quot;expect fewer than 260 traffic-related fatalities this year, marking another all-time low,&quot; (which actually still sounds like 260 too many). </p>
