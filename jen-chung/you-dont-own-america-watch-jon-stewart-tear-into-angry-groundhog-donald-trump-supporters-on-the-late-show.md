<p>Jon Stewart returned to the <em>Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> for a searing, nearly 10-minute long takedown of Donald Trump, Fox News, and delusional Trump supporters last night. It was a beautiful thing; in explaining the final night of the Republican National Convention, Stewart succinctly set the scene: &quot;I thought Donald Trump was going to speak. Ivanka said that he was going to come out. She said he was really compassionate and generous, but <strong>then this angry groundhog came out and he just vomited on everybody for an hour</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>He continued, &quot;But the Republicans appear to have a very clear plan for America, and they&#x2019;ve articulated it throughout the convention. One, jail your political opponent. Two, inject Rudy Giuliani with a speedball and Red Bull enema. And then, three, spend the rest of the time scaring the holy bejeezus out of everybody.&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart, who retired last year to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914064937/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/02/photos_video_jon_tracey_stewart_sav.php#photo-1">help save animals</a> but appeared on Monday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914064937/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/19/jon_stewart_colbert.php"><em>Late Show</em> to help Colbert kick off his RNC coverage,</a> took over Colbert&apos;s desk and took shots at Fox News for demonizing President Obama and then praising Trump for the same issues they have with Obama. He also called (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914064937/http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/01/27/sean-hannity-sides-with-foxs-roger-ailes-over-t/208220">Roger Ailes defender</a>) Sean Hannity &quot;Lumpy.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914064937/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/arts/television/jon-stewart-late-show-colbert-trump-sean-hannity.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1">NY Times has the transcription of Stewart&apos;s blistering monologue</a>, but here&apos;s one part we particularly enjoyed, where he elegantly contrasted the Republicans&apos; &quot;Blue Lives Matter&quot; sloganeering with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914064937/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/jon_stewart_zadroga_911.php">their refusal to support NYC-area cops</a> with the 9/11 first responders bill:</p><blockquote>Either Lumpy and his friends are lying about being bothered by thin-skinned, authoritarian, less-than-Christian readers-of-prompter being president. Or they don&#x2019;t care, as long as it&#x2019;s their thin-skinned prompter-authoritarian-tyrant-narcissist. You just want that person to give you your country back. Because you feel that you&#x2019;re this country&#x2019;s rightful owners. There&#x2019;s only one problem with that. This country isn&#x2019;t yours. You don&#x2019;t own it. It never was. There is no real America. You don&#x2019;t own it. You don&#x2019;t own patriotism. You don&#x2019;t own Christianity. You sure as hell don&#x2019;t own respect for the bravery and sacrifice of military, police and firefighters.<p></p>

<p>Trust me, I saw a lot of people on the convention floor in Cleveland with their &#x201C;blue lives matter&#x201D; rhetoric, who either remained silent or actively fought against the 9/11 first responders&#x2019; bill reauthorization. I see you and I see [audio cut for obscenity].</p></blockquote><p></p>
