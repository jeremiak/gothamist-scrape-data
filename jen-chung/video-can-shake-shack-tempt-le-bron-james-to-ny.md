title: Video: Can Shake Shack Tempt LeBron James To NY?
---

<p>After three-week vacation, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart came back last night.  Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James was the interview guest, and Stewart made a plea from suffering Knicks fans, hinting that King James could come to New York and enjoy the splendors of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204405/http://www.shakeshacknyc.com/">Shake Shack</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204405/http://amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</a>.  Oh, and an &quot;I Love NY&quot; mug.</p>

<p>James made a &quot;Shaq Shack&quot; joke&#x2014;referring to his new teammate&#x2014;but let&apos;s face it: LeBron apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204405/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/01/let_the_lebron_dreams_begin.php">really loves the Yankees</a>, so a 2010 move isn&apos;t <em>that</em> far-fetched, is it?
