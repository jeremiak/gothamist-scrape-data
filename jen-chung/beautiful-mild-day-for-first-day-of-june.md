WCBS 2 meteorologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811091456/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/nyc.weather.forecast.2.971612.html">Elise Finch says</a>, &quot;We are looking at, still, some very mild conditions...We start with lots of sunshine. The day will be a little cool to start, but we&apos;re expecting a high of 73 degrees. We&apos;re going to have breezy conditions for your Monday, [but] all-in-all, a very nice day - plenty of sunshine out there.&quot; Unfortunately, tomorrow will be cloudy (or partly cloudy) with a chance of showers in the evening; the temperature will hits the 80s before the front moves in, though. There may be showers on Wednesday morning as well.
