And many are recalling the summer of 1991, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623031005/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/19/gothamist_histo_1.php">the Crown Heights riots shook the city</a>.  </p>

<p>Last month, a 20-year-old black man, Andrew Charles, the son of a police officer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623031005/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/05/16/2008-05-16_cops_hunt_hasidic_emt_in_brooklyn_attack.html">was attacked by a group of white men</a> believed to be part of the Hasidic anti-crime patrol, Crown Heights Shmira.  Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes said, &quot;You can&#x2019;t have a group, whether it&#x2019;s the Bloods, Crips or Shmira, acting like vigilantes,&quot; which angered Jews.  </p>

<p>Then last Friday, a 14-year-old Jewish teen Alon Sherman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623031005/http://www.wnbc.com/news/16287985/detail.html">beaten and robbed of his wallet, cell phone, watch and bike</a>, seeming by a group of black teens in retaliation of Charles&apos; attack.  That has led to hundreds of Hasidic Jews protesting the Sherman&apos;s attack and Hynes&apos; characterization of them.</p>

<p>Some black and Jewish Crown Heights residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623031005/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/threat-of-another-riot-in-crown-heights/76856/">told the Sun</a> they think &quot;officials are overreacting&quot; with their rallies that attempt to ease racial tensions and, today, a 14-year-old was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623031005/http://wcbstv.com/local/brooklyn.police.suspects.2.730293.html">arrested for Sherman&apos;s beating</a>.  He will be charged as an adult.  </p>
