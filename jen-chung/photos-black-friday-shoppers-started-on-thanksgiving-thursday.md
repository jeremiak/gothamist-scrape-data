It&apos;s the day after Thanksgiving, which means that some people have been shopping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011425/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/14/macys-thanksgiving-store-hours/17244435/">since 6 p.m. last night</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011425/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_%28shopping%29">According to lore/Wikipedia</a>, the term &quot;Black Friday&quot; came about because of the horrible traffic after Thanksgiving and because retailers used to say that they could turn profitable (aka be &quot;in the black&quot;) because of the big sales on the day after the holiday. But now, thanks to online shopping and other sales (hell, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011425/http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/walmart-black-friday-week?utm_source=tny&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=dailyemail&amp;mbid=nl_112814_Daily2&amp;CNDID=2924811&amp;spMailingID=7320349&amp;spUserID=MjY0MzU4MjE2NDgS1&amp;spJobID=562990763&amp;spReportId=NTYyOTkwNzYzS0">Walmart had a <em>week</em> of Black Friday sales</a>), it&apos;s not as big a deal anymore. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011425/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/29/business/early-shoppers-line-up-for-black-friday-deals.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times checked out the scene in a Boston suburb</a>:</p><blockquote>Casey Brefka, 28, who was waiting in line for Best Buy at Watertown, said he had grown up in Ohio, now lived in Allston, and wanted to see how the Black Friday scenes compared.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I got used to the crowds in Ohio, so one of the things is like, &#x2018;Oh, how many people are going to be here when we pull into the parking lot?&#x2019; And I was kinda disappointed. Like, there weren&#x2019;t that many.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Brefka, who works for the Department of Public Health, said he did most of his shopping online. But he showed up around midnight Thursday in hopes of landing a 50-inch Panasonic LED HDTV for $200 - a deal available only in store.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011425/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/black-friday-shoppers-brawl-chaos-surrounds-shopping-article-1.2026675">there were still brawls</a> across the country. Back in 2008, a Black Friday stampede <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011425/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/28/li_walmart_employee_killed_in_black.php">killed a Walmart worker on Long Island</a>.</p>

<p>P.S.

In 2012, it was the following Tuesday.&quot;</p>
