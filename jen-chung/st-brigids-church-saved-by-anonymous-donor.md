<p>It&apos;s a $20 million miracle for an East Village church <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309054014/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/11/st_brigid_is_do.php">slated for demolition</a>!  An anonymous donor has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309054014/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=81865">given a multi-million donation to the struggling parish and its school</a>:  There&apos;s $10 million for the restoration of the the church, $2 million for a parish endowment and $8 million to support St. Brigid&apos;s school and other Catholic schools.</p>

<p>With a cornerstone laid in 1848, St. Brigid&apos;s is one of the oldest houses of worship in Manhattan, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309054014/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--churchsaved0521may21,0,1857122.story">archdiocese closed it in 2001</a> (the parish was closed in 2004).  The fight to save it has been going on for 2 years (see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309054014/http://savestbrigidsnow.netfirms.com/">Save St. Brigid&apos;s Now website</a>).   </p>

<p>While the donor is anonymous, Archbishop of NY Edward Cardinal Egan did tip off it was a man who met with him in a private meeting,  &quot;This magnificent gift will make it possible for Saint Brigid&#x2019;s Church to be fittingly restored with its significant structural problems properly addressed. The two additional gifts, to create an endowment for the parish and to support the parish school, are a powerful testament to the donor&#x2019;s goodness and understanding.&quot;</p>
