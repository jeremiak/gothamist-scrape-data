</div></div><p>Yesterday afternoon, hundreds of people&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162430/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hE-j9cGPeL-81pa5NhW9Qy8oN58gD9ACNMA00">AP estimates 1,000</a>&#x2014;gathered in Times Square to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162430/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/28/health_care_rally_in_times_square_t.php">rally for health care reform</a>.  And many of those there invoked the memory of late Senator Edward Kennedy in appealing for a single payer system&#x2014;signs mentioned Kennedy, such as &quot;TeddyCare For All.&quot;</p>

<p>President Obama briefly mentioned Kennedy&apos;s fight for health care in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162430/http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Eulogy-for-a-Lion/">his eulogy for the legislator yesterday</a>, saying, &quot;We can still hear his voice bellowing through the Senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium, a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers&apos; rights or civil rights,&quot; and added, &quot;We do not weep for him today because of the prestige attached to his name or his office.  We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who persevered through pain and tragedy -- not for the sake of ambition or vanity; not for wealth or power; but only for the people and the country that he loved.&quot;  However, Kennedy&apos;s niece Maria Shriver said on Meet the Press (which airs this morning) that she thinks her uncle&apos;s death will help give momentum to the push for health care reform.</p>
