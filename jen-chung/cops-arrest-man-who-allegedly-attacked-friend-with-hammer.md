<p>A day after his image was released by the police, the man accused of attacking his friend has turned himself in</p>

<p>Police said that a 41-year-old man told his wife he was meeting a friend just after midnight on Friday. When he got back home at 3:30 a.m., the man returned to his Bronx home with &quot;numerous lacerations, bumps and bruises to his head,&quot; told his wife, &quot;I love you,&quot; and then went unconscious. </p>

<p>The NYPD say that the victim was attacked with a hammer and then asked for the public&apos;s help in locating Michael Dilello and the 43-year-old surrendered yesterday morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015554/http://nypost.com/2014/07/19/man-who-attacked-friend-with-hammer-surrenders/">The Post reports</a>,  &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t immediately clear what sparked the violence and the NYPD would not say where the near-fatal attack initially took place.&quot;</p>

<p>Dilello was charged with attempted murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. </p>
