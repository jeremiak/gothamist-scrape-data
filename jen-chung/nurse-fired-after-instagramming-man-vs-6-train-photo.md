										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_06_manv6.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115432im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_06_manv6.jpg" width="640" height="485"> <br> <i> Via NY Med</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A nurse at New York Presbyterian Hospital was fired for posting a photograph on her Instagram profile showing an empty trauma room, with the hashtag &quot;#Manvs6Train.&quot;</p>

<p>The story was detailed on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115432/http://abc.go.com/shows/ny-med">ABC docuseries <em>NY Med</em></a> which follows doctors, nurses and other staffers at both New York Presbyterian and Newark University Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115432/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/arts/television/ny-med-documentary-series-returns-on-abc.html?_r=0">In a review of the show</a>, the NY Times TV critic Neil Genzlinger (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115432/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/really_jerry_seinfeld_defends_reall.php">who hates the word &quot;Really&quot;</a>) wrote, &quot;With all the blood and close-up surgery on display, it&#x2019;s surprising that perhaps the most startling moment in the premiere has nothing to do with a medical procedure. It involves a nurse, Katie Duke, first seen in the 2012 season. She is abruptly fired. The reason won&#x2019;t be spoiled here, but given that this hospital is allowing itself to be filmed for prime-time network television, it seems ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115432/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/nurse-firing-highlights-hazards-social-media-hospitals/story?id=24454611">Duke told ABC News</a>, &quot;I got a call at the end of my shift telling me I was being let go after seven years in the ER.&quot;</p><blockquote>Duke claims she was told by her supervisor that she had not breached hospital policy or violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a law known as HIPAA that protects patient privacy.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I was told I was being fired for being insensitive,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>Duke also claims that the photo was not even hers, but rather reposted from a doctor&#x2019;s Instagram page. The doctor - who also works for the hospital - was not reprimanded, she said.</p>

<p>New York Presbyterian declined to comment on Duke&#x2019;s firing or anyone else&#x2019;s involvement.</p></blockquote>Duke, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115432/http://www.officialkatieduke.com/">has other endorsement opportunities</a>, insists she did nothing wrong and was just showing what hospital staffs experience. She did admit, &quot;If you hung around nurse&#x2019;s station and heard the way we talk about injuries, life and death you might get the wrong impression but it&#x2019;s just a coping mechanism... Now I check my posts so no one gets offended or thinks I am a cold-hearted person.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Nowadways, Duke seems to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115432/http://instagram.com/thekatieduke">post a lot of selfies</a>.</p>
