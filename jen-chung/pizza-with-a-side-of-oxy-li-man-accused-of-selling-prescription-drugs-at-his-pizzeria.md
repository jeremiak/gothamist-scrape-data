<p>The Suffolk County Police say that over a three-month period, Miceli sold drugs, like Oxycodone, on numerous occasions to an undercover cop at his West Babylon restaurant.  Miceli, 50, will be arraigned today.</p>

I&apos;m sorry but you cannot run a business depending upon your mood swings!&quot;).</p>
