					<p>Dallas police officers were fired upon during a peaceful protest: Five were killed and seven others were injured in what appeared to be an ambush. One suspect was killed after an hours-long standoff when police officers; Dallas Police Chief David Brown told reporters this morning that the suspect claimed he was upset at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://dcist.com/2016/07/president_obama_all_americans_shoul.php">recent police shootings</a> and white people, &quot;The suspect said he wanted to kill white people &#x2014; especially white officers.&quot;</p>

<p>The shootings, which also injured two civilians, started at 9 p.m., while hundreds were marching through Dallas&apos; downtown to protest fatal police shootings of civilians across the country. Around the end of the march route, the ambush took place. &quot;Chief Brown said that four people armed with rifles were believed to have carried out the attacks. They positioned themselves in triangulated locations near the end of the route the protesters planned to take,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/us/dallas-police-shooting.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-ab-top-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">the NY Times reported</a>. </p>

<p>Disturbing videos showed the violence and panic to flee the scene:</p>

<p> Police Chief Brown stated earlier today that they believed &quot;two snipers shot ten police officers from elevated positions during the protest/rally.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://www.fox4news.com/news/171359952-story">Three people are in custody</a> but are not cooperating with authorities.</p>

<p>A fourth suspect was trapped at the parking garage of El Centro College and was in a standoff with authorities. At 12:30 a.m., Brown said, &quot;He has told our negotiators that the end is coming and he&apos;s going to hurt and kill more of us&#x2014;meaning law enforcement&#x2014;and that there are bombs all over the place in this garage and in downtown.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/07/07/shots-fired-during-downtown-dallas-protests/">From KDFW</a>:</p><blockquote>[C]ommunications broke down and police were left with few options that were safe.<p></p>

<p>Police sent a bomb robot in with an explosive device, and detonated it near the suspect. &#x201C;The suspect is deceased as a result of detonating the bomb,&#x201D; Brown said. Earlier reports that the suspect killed himself were said to be inaccurate.</p>

<p>During the negotiation process, Brown explained, the suspect gave some insight into his thought process. &#x201C;The suspect said he was upset about &#x2018;Black Lives Matter.&#x2019; He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect said he wanted to kill white people &#x2014; especially white officers.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The suspect also reportedly said that authorities would &#x201C;eventually find the IEDs.&#x201D; That led to an extensive sweep of the Dallas area, which has so far turned up no explosives. Brown added, &#x201C;The suspect stated he was not affiliated with any groups and stated that he did this alone.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Brown said, &quot;We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was. Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The suspect is deceased as a result of detonating the bomb.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The slain officers include four Dallas Police officers and one officer for the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/officers-killed-wounded-dallas-ambush-identified-article-1.2703872">one was a newlywed</a>. A civilian victim was a mother who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://nypost.com/2016/07/08/mother-wounded-while-shielding-son-during-dallas-sniper-attack/">protected her son from the gunfire.</a></p>

<p>President Obama, who the day before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://dcist.com/2016/07/president_obama_all_americans_shoul.php">spoke about the shootings of civilians by police</a>, said, &quot;We still don&#x2019;t know all the facts.  What we do know is that there has been a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.  Police in Dallas were on duty, doing their jobs, keeping people safe during peaceful protests.&quot;</p><blockquote>For now, let me just say that even as yesterday I spoke about our need to be concerned, as all Americans, about racial disparities in our criminal justice system, I also said yesterday that our police have an extraordinarily difficult job and the vast majority of them do their job in outstanding fashion.  I also indicated the degree to which we need to be supportive of those officers who do their job each and every day, protecting us and protecting our communities. <br>
 <br>
Today is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices that they make for us.  We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. And in the days ahead, we&#x2019;re going to have to consider those realities as well.</blockquote>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133013/http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20160708-large-swath-of-downtown-dallas-west-side-closed-today-as-other-businesses-events-shutter-and-call-off-plans.ece">large part of Dallas&apos;s downtown remains closed</a>.<p></p>

Johnson had served in the U.S. Army Reserve, two U.S. officials said. A neighbor said there are police cars outside Johnson&apos;s home. Wayne Bynoe, the neighbor, told CNN that Johnson lived with his mother and &apos;keeps to himself.&apos;&quot;</p>
