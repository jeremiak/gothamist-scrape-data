<p>A small plane crashed into the yard of a home in East Patchogue this morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619223258/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/one-dead-in-east-patchogue-small-plane-crash-officials-say-1.8473541">Newsday reports</a>: &quot;Brookhaven Town Supervisor Edward P. Romaine said the pilot was killed, and three people in the house hit by the plane seem to be unharmed, he said, but they are being evaluated for potential shock.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the plane crashed between the house and the backyard playground at around 9 a.m. Then the plane caught fire, which damaged the house. Houses two blocks away from the crash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619223258/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Plane-Crash-Small-Suffolk-County-East-Patchogue-Police-Fire-263441421.html">were cleared as a precaution</a>. </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear where the plane came from; the airport in Shirley had no take-offs or landings scheduled at the time. Newsday has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619223258/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/one-dead-in-east-patchogue-small-plane-crash-officials-say-1.8473541">dramatic photograph showing the wreckage</a>.</p>
