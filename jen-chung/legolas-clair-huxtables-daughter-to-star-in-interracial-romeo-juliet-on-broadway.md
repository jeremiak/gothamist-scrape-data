<p>A new, modern-day version of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> will be staged on Broadway later this year&#x2014;and Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad will be the famously tragic lovers. Which means that this version of Shakespeare&apos;s play will be interracial.  </p>

<p>Director David Leveaux <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101005/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/orlando-bloom-condola-rashad-to-star-in-romeo-and-juliet-on-broadway/?smid=tw-nytimesarts&amp;seid=auto">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;They could have been any number of different ethnicities...The two actors I wanted to be together producing sparks just happened to be those two and I followed my nose in casting the families.&quot; Which then prompted him to &quot;make the Capulets an all-black clan and the Montagues all-white to reflect real life rather than make a comment on race.&quot;</p>

<p>Rashad, the daughter of Phylicia Rashad, will be seen on Broadway very soon in <em>The Trip To Bountiful</em>, which also stars Cicely Tyson. She was also nominated for a Tony for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101005/http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/watch-17-minutes-of-stick-fly-highlighting-condola-rashads-tony-nominated-performance">her performance</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101005/http://www.stickflybroadway.com/"><em>Stick Fly</em></a>. Bloom, of course, is known for his roles as Legolas in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and that guy who isn&apos;t Johnny Depp in the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> films. </p>
