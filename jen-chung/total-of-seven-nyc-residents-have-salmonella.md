<p>For the past few weeks, more and more cases of salmonella connected to tainted tomatoes have been reported across the country, forcing restaurants--especially national chains--to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171444/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/10/salmonella_scar.php">reconsider the role of raw tomatoes on their menus</a>.  Tomatoes grown in New York state <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171444/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/11/local_tomato_growers_cashing_in_on.php">do not seem to be affected</a> and other types of types of tomatoes are still safe, such as grape tomatoes (the unsafe ones: raw red plum, red Roma, and red round tomatoes), people are worried and going on raw tomato sabbatical.  </p>

<p>NYU School of Medicine associate professor Marc Siegel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171444/http://www.newsday.com/news/opinion/ny-opxxx5728922jun16,0,6843339.story">had a good column in Newsday</a> explaining why tomatoes are good for you and why the salmonella issue is about contamination, not an issue inherent with the produce. Tere&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171444/http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/tomatoes.html">latest from the FDA on the tomato situation</a> and here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171444/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cd/cdsalm.shtml">NYC Health Department on salmonella</a>--wash your produce thoroughly!</p>
