Comptroller Bill Thompson and City Councilman are facing off in the Democratic mayoral primary; Councilmen Bill De Blasio and Eric Gioia, former Public Advocate Mark Green and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel are fighting for the PA spot; and Council members Melinda Katz, John Liu, David Weprin and David Yassky are vying to be Comptroller.  The winner must get 40% of the vote, or there will be a run-off. Only registered voters can vote in the primary; for more information, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211727/http://www.vote. nyc.ny.us/">Board of Elections</a> and check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211727/http://gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20090908/200/3007">Gotham Gazette&apos;s Guide for the Last Minute (Primary) Voter</a>.
