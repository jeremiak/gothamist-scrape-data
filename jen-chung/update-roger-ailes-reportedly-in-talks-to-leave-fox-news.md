<p>While a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/maria-bartiromo-roger-ailes-gretchen-carlson-1201811345/">number of female</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://www.people.com/article/jeanine-pirro-defends-roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-gretchen-carlson">Fox News </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://www.people.com/article/greta-van-susteren-defends-roger-ailes-agianst-sexual-harassment-allegations">personalities have defended</a> the network&apos;s CEO Roger Ailes, one of the channel&apos;s highest profile stars, Megyn Kelly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/14/fox-colleagues-mad-that-megyn-kelly-isn-t-speaking-up-for-roger-ailes.html">has been silent</a> about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/06/gretchen_carlson_roger_ailes.php"> sexual harassment lawsuit</a> that Ailes is facing. Now New York magazine&apos;s Gabriel Sherman is reporting that there&apos;s been a reason for her lack of comment: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/sources-kelly-said-ailes-sexually-harassed-her.html">Because she was sexually harassed by Ailes, too</a>. <b>UPDATE</b>: Various reports suggest that Ailes is working on an exit from Fox News. More below.</p>

<p>Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit accusing Ailes of damaging her career after she refused to sleep with him and of refusing to take her complaints about discriminatory behavior from him and her Fox &amp; Friends co-host Steve Doocy seriously. Ailes has emphatically denied the claims, but Fox News&apos;s parent company 21st Century Fox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/11/gretchen_carlsons_ailes.php">hasn&apos;t given a full-fledged show of support for Ailes</a>, saying, &quot;The Company has seen the allegations against Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy. We take these matters seriously. While we have full confidence in Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy, who have served the company brilliantly for over two decades, we have commenced an internal review of the matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Sherman, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AD6O6BU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">wrote a book about Ailes</a>, reported on Monday that Fox News parent company owner Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, who are taking over leadership of the company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/murdochs-have-decided-to-remove-roger-ailes.html">are in agreement that Ailes needs to leave</a>: </p><blockquote>After reviewing the initial findings of the probe, James Murdoch is said to be arguing that Ailes should be presented with a choice this week to resign or face being fired. Lachlan is more aligned with their father, who thinks that no action should be taken until after the GOP convention this week. Another source confirms that all three are in agreement that Ailes needs to go. </blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/sources-kelly-said-ailes-sexually-harassed-her.html">Today, Sherman writes</a>, &quot;According to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox&#x2019;s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York-based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Kelly&#x2019;s comments to investigators might explain why the Murdochs are moving so quickly to oust Ailes... Kelly, who has become something of a feminist icon thanks to her tangles with GOP nominee Donald Trump, is seen by many inside Fox as the future of the network. She&#x2019;s currently in contract negotiations, and given that Bill O&#x2019;Reilly has said he&#x2019;s considering retirement, Fox can&#x2019;t afford to lose her.

<p>According to two sources, Monday afternoon lawyers for 21st Century Fox gave Ailes a deadline of August 1 to resign or face being fired for cause. Ailes&#x2019;s legal team &#x2014; which now includes Susan Estrich, former campaign manager for Michael Dukakis &#x2014; has yet to respond to the offer. Ailes has also received advice on strategy from Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani, sources say.</p></blockquote>Sounds like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/10/rudy_giuliani_says_the_black_kid_wh.php">Ailes has a</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/14/donald_trump_is_a_disgusting_sexist.php">real dream team</a>.<p></p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re very encouraged by the reported development that Fox News has relieved employees of any non-disclosure agreements they may have in place so they can talk freely about their own experiences at Fox under Roger Ailes,&quot; Allan Ripp, spokesman for Carlson&apos;s legal team, told us. He added, &quot;We are obviously supportive of anyone who has been the target of sexual harassment in the workplace.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Gretchen Carlson just posted a video to Twitter, thanking her supporters:</p>

<p><b>UPDATE, 5:30 p.m.</b>: Various outlets are reporting that Ailes is negotiating an exit. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/roger-ailes-fox-news-out-1201817638/">Variety says</a> that he is &quot;leaving the 21st Century Fox-owned cable outlet in the wake of a bevy of sexual-harassment allegations leveled at him, according to a person familiar with the situation while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020247/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/business/media/roger-ailes-fox-news-murdoch.html?emc=edit_na_20160719&amp;nlid=46902116&amp;ref=cta">NY Times said that he&apos;s &quot;negotiating his departure&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>It is dated for July 22, which would be Friday, the day after the Republican National Convention ends. </p>

<p>21st Century Fox, which owns Fox News, Tweeted this less-than-confident message about Ailes&apos; standing:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">21CF statement: Roger is at work. The review is ongoing.
