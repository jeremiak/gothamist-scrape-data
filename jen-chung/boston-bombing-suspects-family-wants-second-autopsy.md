<p>The Massachusetts medical examiner&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/05/03/boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-tamerlan-tsarnaev-died-from-gunshot-wounds-blunt-trauma-according-death-certificate/HqbOisq2mQerevXscHn06J/story.html">issued the death certificate</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/boston_marathon_bombings_terrorism.php#photo-1">Boston bombing</a> suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://gothamist.com/tags/tamerlantsarnaev">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a>, stating that he died from &quot;gunshot wounds to the torso and extremities and from blunt trauma to the head and torso.&quot; </p>

<p>Tsarnaev, 26, was caught and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/one_boston_bomb_suspect_is_dead_as.php">died from police gunfire in the early hours of April 19</a>. Also, the certificate says he was run over and dragged by a car&#x2014;police say that his younger brother and fellow bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev drove over his brother&apos;s body while trying to get away from police. Dzhokhar was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/massachusetts_authorities_give_upda.php">caught on the night of April 19</a>.</p>

<p>A Tsarnaev family spokesperson tells CNN that they have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/04/us/boston-attack/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">requested a second independent autopsy</a>. It&apos;s unclear what they are hoping to find, but the brothers&apos; parents have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/25/boston_bomb_suspects_parents_blame.php">insisted their sons were not involved</a>. But it was recently reported that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, told the FBI that he and his brother had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/boston_marathon_bomb_suspects_origi.php">originally planned to strike on July 4th</a> (and considered suicide attacks) but decided to target the Boston Marathon instead after making bombs from pressure cookers. </p>

<p>The funeral home handling Tamerlan Tsarnaev&apos;s body is having difficulty finding a burial location, with many cemeteries concerned about reprisal. Funeral home owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/05/04/funeral-home-one-wants-bury-bomb-suspect/x7JUpywe9KIBDOXuaxkMqI/story.html">Peter Stefan said</a>, &#x2018;&quot;My problem here is trying to find a gravesite. A lot of people don&#x2019;t want to do it. They don&#x2019;t want to be involved with this. I keep bringing up the point of Lee Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh or Ted Bundy. Somebody had to do those, too.&quot; Stefan will ask the government to find a burial site if none can be found.</p>

<p>In the meantime, &quot;al-Qaeda&#x2019;s Inspire magazine and other radical Islamist material&quot; have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/investigators-sharpen-focus-on-boston-bombing-suspects-widow/2013/05/03/a2cd9d28-b413-11e2-baf7-5bc2a9dc6f44_story.html?hpid=z1">reportedly been found</a> on the computer of Tamerlan Tsarnaev&apos;s wife, Katherine Russell. Her lawyer has previously claimed she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/wife-boston-bombing-suspect-dark-lawyer-article-1.1323925">knew nothing of the plot</a> and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/04/22/katherine_russell_tsarnaev_tamerlan_tsarnaev_s_wife_hasn_t_spoken_with_police.html">emphasized that she worked 70-80 hours a week</a> as a home health care aide while her husband cared for their child at home.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20130502/NJNEWS18/305020020/Tamerlan-Tsarnaev-called-wife-after-FBI-released-photos"> FBI says that Tamerlan Tsarnaev called his wife</a> after the agency released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/video_here_are_the_two_boston_marat.php">photographs of him and his brother as suspects</a> in the bombing, but Russell has stopped cooperating with the FBI.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507062410/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/us/path-from-social-butterfly-to-suspects-widow-in-hijab.html?hp">Times has a long feature</a> about Russell&apos;s transformation from &quot;social butterfly&quot; from a comfortable upbringing to a woman so in love with a boxer from Cambridge that she converted to Islam and struggled wit her husband, living on public assistance at times. A relative said, &quot;I think she believes in Islam. I don&#x2019;t think she was coerced. I think she&#x2019;s faithful to the religion.&quot;</p>
