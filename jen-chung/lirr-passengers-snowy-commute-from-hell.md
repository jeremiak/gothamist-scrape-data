While some people couldn&apos;t navigate some roads because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021220350/http://wcbstv.com/local/long.island.snow.2.1386265.html">&quot;tired&quot; snow plow drivers</a>, the saga of 150 Long Island Rail Road passengers takes the cake.<p></p>

The train, which was already delayed by the snow and ice and car that was stuck in its path, broke down 140 yards from the Wyandanch station at 5 a.m. and remained there for hours until it made it at 8:13 a.m. &quot;With no electricity, the only bathroom broken and falling temperatures, passengers passed the time arguing, plotting escapes and calling loved ones, the media and the LIRR.&quot;  Some passengers announced they were opening windows to escape, so the conductor called the MTA police and backup arrived to keep the passengers inside and from opening windows.  </p>

<p>News 12 heard the pleas of passengers, who said there was no heat (one passenger was a two-year-old), begging to be rescued: </p>

<p>LIRR president Helena Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021220350/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091222/BIZ90/912229989/-1/NEWS"> apologized for the incident</a> and said that there would be a &quot;a full-scale review&quot; of the incident.  Apparently the rescue locomotive that was first sent to help the train got stuck on a frozen rail and then the LIRR had to find another one (and its engineer) to help push the train those remaining 140 yards.</p>
