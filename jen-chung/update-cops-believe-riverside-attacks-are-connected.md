The police say a 48-year-old woman who was walking her dog in the park, when, at 6:20 a.m. and West 98th Street and Riverside Drive, a man walked up behind her, struck her on the back of her head, threw her to the ground and kicked her in the chest and stomach.  <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526212943/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/08/cops_have_person_of_interest_in_riv.php">Another attack occurred that same day</a>, but at 6 a.m. at 120th Street in the park, near the tennis courts: 19-year-old Barnard student Marisa Cortright was grabbed from behind, punched in the face, and slammed into a concrete wall. She suffered bleeding to the brain, a fractured cheekbone, and lacerations to the head, neck and face; her iPod was also taken.  </p>

<p>Police released a sketch of the suspect in the 98th Street attack.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526212943/http://www.1010wins.com/Police-Investigate-Second-Attack-in-Riverside-Park/7652383">According to 1010WINS</a>, &quot;Police say the suspect is believed to be in his 20s, about 5&apos; 8&quot; tall with a thin build. He was last seen wearing blue shorts with blue and white boxers.&quot;  The <a href="a 6-foot-2, heavyset black man in his mid-40s wearing a bright blue, long-sleeved shirt and black pants who was seen leaving the park">man in the police sketch</a> for the 120th Street attack is described alternately as a &quot;person of interest&quot; and a &quot;suspect&quot; (a police officer at the NYPD press office said he could be considered &quot;both&quot;)&#x2014;a 6-foot-2, heavyset black man in his mid-40s wearing a bright blue, long-sleeved shirt and black pants who was seen leaving the park. Police, at this point, do not think the attacks are related.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: <em>Now</em> cops think the two attacks are related.  It&apos;s believed the man in the 98th Street sketch attacked Cortright at 120th Street.  </p>
