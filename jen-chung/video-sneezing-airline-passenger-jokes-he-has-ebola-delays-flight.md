<p>While the authorities are taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012823/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/07/ebola_nyc_doh.php">concerns about Ebola seriously</a>, one airline passenger decided it would be hilarious to blame his sneezing on the deadly virus. A man traveling from Philadelphia to the Dominican Republic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012823/http://www.diariolibre.com/dl-english/2014/10/09/i829181_punta-cana-and-public-health-clear-false-rumor-passenger-with-ebola.html">reportedly announced</a> on a US Airways flight, &quot;I have Ebola, you are all screwed!&quot; </p>

<p>According to a passenger on the flight, Patrick Navarez, &quot;Once we landed in Punta Cana we were told by the flight attendants that there was a situation and that a passenger may have been in Africa and had Ebola. She was certain it was a hoax but they did not take any chances and had a full hazmat crew board the plane and take the passenger off. It was later confirmed that the passenger was never in Africa and after 2hrs we were finally able to get off the plane.&quot;</p>

<p>Authorities in Punta Cana <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012823/http://gawker.com/passenger-pulled-from-u-s-airways-plane-after-yelling-1644486184">also confirmed</a> it was just a totally inappropriate thing to say. Paola Rainieri, spokesperson for the company that owns the airport, told Fox News Latino &quot;that the airplane was held on the tarmac for nearly two hours until medical and airline officials determined there was no risk to the 200-plus passengers.&quot;</p><blockquote>Rainieri described the incident as a &#x201C;joke of poor taste&#x201D; by the passenger, who had not traveled to Africa recently. According to Rainieri, the man&apos;s passport showed that the last trip he had taken anywhere close to Africa was a 2012 trip to Europe.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know why he did it, but he thought it would be a cute joke that would not be so serious,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Thankfully it was only a scare.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>The video is much easier to watch knowing it was a hoax. A flight attendant said, &quot;I think the man that has said this is an idiot. I&#x2019;ll say that straight out.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Some local NYC airline cabin workers who are not unionized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012823/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/09/laguardia_airport_workers_striking.php">are striking over concerns about exposure to Ebola</a>.</p>
