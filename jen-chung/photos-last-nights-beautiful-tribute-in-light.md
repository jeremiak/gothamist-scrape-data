<p>The installation remains powerful when viewed from a distance&#x2014;seeing the light from downtown, leading to the sky&#x2014;reminds us a little more of everyone and everything that was lost on that day. </p>

<p>The ethereal installation, which involves high-powered lights at a lower Manhattan location, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013751/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/03/anne_pasternak_executive_director_creative_time.php">commissioned by Creative Time</a> after the attacks. Artists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013751/http://creativetime.org/projects/1799-2/">Julian Laverdiere and Paul Myoda</a> had proposed the twin beams of light for a NY Times Magazine feature and the Tribute was first lit for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013751/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/11/nation.remembers/index.html">six month anniversary of the attacks</a>. </p>

<p>Creative Time aptly described the memorial as &quot;an ethereal surrogate for the absent towers, the lights&#x2019; white luminescence not only replaces the void in New York&#x2019;s skyline with a sense of memory and the possibility of hope and rebirth, but its ghostly presence is also a moving commemoration of the thousands of men and women who died on September 11, 2001.&quot;</p>

<p>The funding for Tribute In Light has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013751/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/the_tribute_in_lights_future_looks.php">imperiled in the past</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013751/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/11/photos_last_nights_tribute_in_light.php#photo-1">is now under management</a> of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. </p>
