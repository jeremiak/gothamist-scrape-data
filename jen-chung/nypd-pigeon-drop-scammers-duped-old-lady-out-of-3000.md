<p>Con artists are ruthless, happily targeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020072903/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/06/brooklyn_man_arrested_for_massive_g.php">elderly people</a> to make some fast money. The NYPD is asking for the public&apos;s help in locating a pair who got an 81-year-old woman to give up $3,000 in the timeless pigeon drop scam.</p>

<p>The setup, which has many variations, usually involves two con artists who approach their mark claiming to have found a wallet/bag/something full of money. The confidence men (or women) then lure their mark into an argument about the item&apos;s worth or attainability, persuading the mark that he or she can get a piece of the action. At some point it&apos;s usually suggested that all three put deposits down to prove they&apos;re committed to sharing the money. Of course, the other two people are in on it together and the victim is left with a worthless item and lightened wallet.</p>

<p>According to the police, last Monday, December 1st, the 81-year-old woman was outside her Astoria home when a man and a woman approached her around 8:45 a.m. </p><blockquote>The suspects stated to her, in sum and substance, that they had found a large amount of money and that she could have $70,000 of it, all the victim had to do was prove to the bank that she had $3000 in cash. The victim brought the female suspect to her apartment building and gave her the $3000 with the suspects promising that they would return with her $70,000.</blockquote>Police say the male suspect is a black male, 35, 6&apos; tall and weighing 200 pounds, while the female suspect is 5&apos;5&quot;, weighing 160 pounds. The cops also released surveillance video of the female suspect:<p></p>
