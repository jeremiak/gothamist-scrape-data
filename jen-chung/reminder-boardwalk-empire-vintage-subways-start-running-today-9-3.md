<p>For you subway enthusiasts, as well as those who take the 2 and 3 lines, a gentle reminder: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111027045512/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/boardwalk_empire_is_bringing_back_o.php#photo-1">The MTA is running a 1920&#x2019;s train</a> on the express 2/3 track in Manhattan&#x2014;starting today&#x2014;every Saturday and Sunday this September, between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. between 42nd and 96th Streets.  It&apos;s all part of HBO&apos;s promotion of its drama, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111027045512/http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire">Boardwalk Empire</a></em>, which is set in Prohibition-era Atlantic City.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111027045512/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/09/02/boardwalk-empire-train-on-track/">According to Metropolis</a>, when HBO came to the MTA asking for a &quot;nostalgic&quot; marketing idea, the MTA offered to run the vintage train.  HBO is paying $150,000 for the four-weekend promotion and wil decorate the interior of the train with images of Nucky Thompson, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111027045512/http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire/cast-and-crew/nucky-thompson/index.html#/boardwalk-empire/cast-and-crew/nucky-thompson/bio/nucky-thompson.html">Atlantic City power player</a> played by beloved Brooklyn resident Steve Buscemi.  </p>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, during the weekend of September 24 and 25, actors hired by HBO folks will be on the streets to distribute complimentary MetroCards in the vicinity of the Times Square-42nd and 72nd street stations. </p>
