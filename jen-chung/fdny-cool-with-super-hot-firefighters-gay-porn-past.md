<p>After revealing that a new firefighter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011513/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-new-fdny-firefighter-starred-gay-porn-flicks-article-1.2021025">has &quot;starred in at least 10 gay porn films,&quot;</a> the Daily News now wants you to know that rookie Jonathan Jesensky isn&apos;t in trouble for it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011513/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/fdny-fine-rookie-firefighter-gay-porn-article-1.2022839">FDNY spokesman Jim Long said</a>, &quot;There will be no discipline for this individual. Since he became an EMT and advanced to being promoted to paramedic, then to becoming a firefighter he has performed admirably.&quot; And for a rookie, he sure knows how to... handle a hose?</p>

<p>The News noted that Jesensky, a former Marine and model, apparently &quot;came clean about his adult film past before he was hired by the city &#x2014; and there&#x2019;s no plan to end his budding civil service career.... The city&#x2019;s uniformed forces do not hire people with a serious criminal past for law-enforcement jobs. But the city&apos;s strict civil service law &#x2014; which includes age and fitness requirements &#x2014; does not bar candidates who have posed nude or starred in X-rated films.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2014_11_jwest.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011513im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_11_jwest.jpg" width="640" height="600" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Still, the News gleefully detailed his filmography:</p><blockquote>Jesensky starred in at least 10 hardcore movies, including titles like &quot;Semper Bi,&quot; &quot;Ripe,&quot; and &quot;Paramedics.&quot;<p></p>

<p>He wears scant military and EMT gear on some of the movie posters and prominently displays a stomach tattoo that says in Aramaic words, &#x201C;My god, my god, why has thou forsaken me&apos; &#x2014; what Jesus Christ shouted from the cross during crucifixion.</p>

<p>But Jesensky tells people he&apos;s not gay and that his porn work was just a job.</p>

<p>&quot;He was gay for pay,&quot; one online fan of his work proclaimed.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Jesensky will be working in the Bronx, and one future colleague told the News, &quot;Whatever, I don&apos;t care. I haven&apos;t met him yet, but I don&apos;t care.&quot; Good attitude!</p>

<p>In a 2008 interview, while he was working on his modeling career, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011513/http://www.ohlalamag.com/en/2008/05/ohlala-intervie.html">Jesensky said</a>, &quot;[L]ove is also the hardest thing I have ever attempted to chase. I am not your average character, and have a very, I mean very colorful past which we will not get into at this moment, so to find someone to love me whole heartedly with all my flaws and without judgment of my past is very difficult, I know that finding love is no easy task for anyone, and I hope someday I will have it again.&quot;</p>
