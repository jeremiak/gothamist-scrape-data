										<p>A Staten Island family is mourning the death of 49-year-old Aissatou Diallo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014946/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/woman_fatally_struck_while_standing.php">who was thrown to her death</a> from the Brooklyn Queens Expressway after an allegedly drunk driver hit a disabled car she was standing beside. Her son says he chased the driver, who tried to flee on foot. </p>

<p>Diallo was heading home from a wedding in Queens when a relative driving another car, a 1997 Toyota RAV4, got a flat tire shortly before 3 a.m. on Monday. Police say that Diallo got out of the Chevy she was in&#x2014;the Chevy&apos;s driver pulled up in front of the Toyota near Meeker and Morgan Avenues&#x2014;and went to help the relative. </p>

<p>While she and other relatives were standing by the cars, a 2011 BMW heading west &quot;struck the Chevy from behind which struck the pedestrians, causing [Diallo] to be thrown over the right barrier and fall to the roadway below. The BMW continued forward striking the Toyota before coming to final stop,&quot; according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>Witnesses said the driver, later identified as Vladimir Menin, a 43-year-old NJ resident, fled on foot. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014946/http://abc7ny.com/traffic/woman-standing-outside-car-fatally-struck-by-another-car-on-bqe/1488958/">The victim&apos;s nephew Saliou Diallo said</a>, &quot;We pulled him back to the crime scene, and we held him there until the police came. But you can tell. I could smell the liquor all over him.&quot;</p>

<p>Diallo&apos;s son Abdouile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014946/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-fatally-struck-brooklyn-queens-expressway-article-1.2769852">told the Daily News</a> he also helped keep Menin at the scene, &#x201C;I was so angry. My first intent was to throw him over. But then I remembered I&#x2019;m not a barbarian. My mom wouldn&apos;t have wanted that.&quot;</p>

<p>He added that Menin claimed he wasn&apos;t driving, though they saw him get out of the driver&apos;s side, &quot;This guy was really drunk. His words were complete gibberish.&quot;</p>

<p>Diallo was pronounced dead at Elmhurst Hospital, while eight others from the Chevy and Toyota were also taken there for evaluation.</p>

<p>Menin was taken to Woodhull Hospital for minor injuries and was later charged with manslaughter, aggravated vehicular homicide, DWI, reckless driving and aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle.</p>
