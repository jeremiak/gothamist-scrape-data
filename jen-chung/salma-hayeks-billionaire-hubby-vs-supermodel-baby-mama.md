										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_04_lindae.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095331im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_lindae.jpg" width="400" height="292" class="image-left"> </span>Bona fide supermodel Linda Evangelista has been in court this past week, demanding that her billionaire baby daddy, fashion industry magnate Francois-Henri Pinault, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095331/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/02/supermodel_linda_evangelista_wants.php">pay her $46,000/month to cover the cost</a> of caring for their five-year-old son August.  The model, who famously uttered about herself and cohorts Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington back in the 1990s, &quot;We don&apos;t wake up for less than $10,000 a day,&quot; now she says she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095331/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/salma-hayek-feared-carrying-child-syndrome-article-1.1072935">won&apos;t walk the catwalk for less than $100,000/day</a>. 1% problems?</p>

<p>Evangelista will continue her testimony on Monday, but what makes the case even more tabloid-friendly is that Pinault is now married to actress Salma Hayek (Pinault and Evangelista&apos;s affair was prior to his relationship with Hayek, or something) and he <em>and</em> Hayek had a child in 2008. Pinault claims that he tried to discuss paternity payments with Evangelista&apos;s lawyers, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095331/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/model_mom_linda_evangelista_takes_rnM9VLy3QGgTOaG9KVeBqJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">got no response</a>. His lawyers also said that Evangelista got pregnant on purpose. </p>

<p>Pinault&#x2014;whose company owns or co-owns brands like Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent and Puma&#x2014;admits that he didn&apos;t acknowledge he was August&apos;s father until Hayek gave birth, explaining, &quot;My wife was pregnant.. For five months we were told the baby was Down Syndrome... I ask Linda to postpone my recognition (of Augie) until after the birth of Valentina.. It was very complicated situation. My wife almost lost the baby.&quot;  </p>

<p>Valentina Pinault was born healthy, and Pinault has put a $12 million California mansion in trust for his daughter.  Evangelista wants him to do the same for August, plus pay the $46,000/month to cover nannies, bodyguards, and armed drivers. On the other side of the case, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095331/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/salma-hayek-feared-carrying-child-syndrome-article-1.1072935">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Pinault admitted he spent $100,000 on a fancy watch for himself in 2010 but couldn&#x2019;t remember what he spent on the &apos;piano thing&apos; he bought Augie for Christmas. He also couldn&#x2019;t recall what he bought his son for his fourth birthday.&quot; </p>
