										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_02_30rockstal.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609074636im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_30rockstal.jpg" width="360" height="390" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609074636/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/09/canadian_woman_arrested_for_alleged.php">Canadian woman accused of stalking Alec Baldwin</a> managed to send him all-caps emails, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609074636/http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/09/showbiz/alec-baldwin-stalking/">according to the criminal complaint</a>.  Genevieve Sabourin&apos;s missives to the 30 Rock star allegedly read, &quot;I NEED TO START MY NEW LIFE, WITH MY NEW NAME, WITH MY NEW CARRIER IN MY NEW COUNTRY HELP MY NEWLY HUSBAND, YOU!&quot; and &quot;I NEED YOU NOW, PLEASE ALEC COME AND PICK ME UP NOW. I AM LESS THAN 10 MIN AWAY FROM YOU TONIGHT. SAY I DO TO ME&quot; and &quot;I&apos;M EXISTED ABOUT THAT PORTION OF THE PROCESS, CREATING GENEVIEVE BALDWIN AND GET ALL OF WHAT I WANT IS THE BEST PART.&quot;</p>

<p>Sabourin, 40, was arrested after repeatedly trying to approach Baldwin at his home in the Hamptons and at his home in Manhattan (he wasn&apos;t there).  She apparently served as a unit publicist for the 2002 movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, in which Baldwin had an uncredited role, but it&apos;s unclear if they met during that film.  Sabourin has told police they were lovers (she wanted to have his baby), but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609074636/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/alec_gal_sex_stalk_Mvus3Hne1MUG9ZbueTYlBP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">according to the Post&apos;s sources</a>, Baldwin admitted that he &quot;twice took her to dinner in 2011&quot; but he said their relationship was strictly professional and not at all physical.  </p>

<p>Of course, Baldwin is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609074636/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/03/alec_baldwin_1.php">now engaged to 28-year-old yoga teacher Hilaria Thomas</a>, and that news allegedly sent Sabourin over the edge, bombarding Baldwin with calls and texts (a source said Baldwin changed his number).  The Post tried to get a comment but, &quot;Baldwin wouldn&#x2019;t stop to talk to a reporter from The Post yesterday morning as he pulled his vintage navy-blue Mercedes sedan into his Hamptons driveway, chatting on his cellphone.&quot;  Driving and talking on the cellphone?! For shame!</p>

<p>Also, Post columnist Andrea Peyser is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609074636/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ladies_when_the_cad_away_run_20mMbD5triGZFsbnIYzcFI">worried about Thomas</a>: </p><blockquote>Here was a poor, misunderstood schlemiel just trying to help the career of a woman so clearly smitten with him. Baldwin had no choice. He had to wine and dine Sanbourin. Platonically, of course!<p></p>

<p>Baldwin &#x2014; whose illustrious record also includes screaming at his 11-year-old daughter, &#x201C;You thoughtless little pig&#x201D; &#x2014; seems to have a recurring problem with women in positions of authority, or with the ability to muck up his life.</p>

<p>No telling if this is, as Sabourin alleges, an affair gone sour. Or, as Baldwin claims, just a big, successful Hollywood star helping out a gal in need. No strings attached, natch.</p>

<p>Either way, he&#x2019;s got a lot of explaining to do to his young doormat-in-training.</p>

<p>Run, Hilaria!</p></blockquote>Baldwin himself couldn&apos;t help but mention his alleged stalker on Twitter:<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Isn&apos;t it odd when an accused stalker is in handcuffs, being taken away by the cops, yet smiles for the cameras?</p>&#x2014; AB (@alecbaldwin) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609074636/https://twitter.com/alecbaldwin/status/189703212532629505" data-datetime="2012-04-10T13:15:45+00:00">April 10, 2012</a></blockquote>
