<p>The high-ranking NYPD official who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115729/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/13/michael_ameri_suicide.php">found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot to the head</a> was worried about the widening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115729/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/fbi_de_blasio_nypd.php">FBI probe about police corruption</a>, according to sources. The feds reportedly went to Inspector Michael Ameri&apos;s main office for the NYPD Highway Unit and pulled files on Thursday; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115729/http://nypost.com/2016/05/13/cop-questioned-in-nypd-corruption-probe-kills-himself/">a source told the Post</a>, &quot;He was very distraught about the visit. He felt his career was in jeopardy, and he couldn&#x2019;t deal with the stress and not knowing when everything was going to come to a head.&quot;</p>

<p>Another said that Ameri &quot;felt his career was in jeopardy.&quot;</p>

<p>Ameri was found in his car yesterday, parked at the Bergen Point Golf Course in West Babylon, Long Island. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115729/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/high-ranking-nypd-kills-long-island-golf-article-1.2636360">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Ameri was recently questioned for at least the second time at some point this week by FBI agents investigating the ongoing scandal involving a pair of businessmen with ties to Mayor de Blasio, sources told the Daily News.&quot; </p>

<p>The businessmen, Jeremy Reichberg and Jonah Rechnitz, both donors to Mayor Bill de Blasio, are under suspicion of offering money and gifts to various police officials in exchange for security details, helicopter displays and other favors. Nine police officers have been demoted so far.</p>

<p>Ameri, a divorced father of one, was questioned by the FBI about police escorts, and the Post reports, &quot;A source said a spooked Ameri had recently distanced himself from Brooklyn&#x2019;s Orthodox Jewish community. &apos;Right before the Jewish holidays, Ameri told people close to him that he was very worried about the probe,&apos; the source said, &apos;and he cut ties with people who the feds were looking at, namely [Alex] &#x2018;Shaya&#x2019; Lichtenstein. He actually told a high-ranking officer in the highway division to stay away from Shaya, cut off all communication.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Lichtenstein, a leader of Boro Park Shomrim, the ultra-Orthodox volunteer patrol group, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115729/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/a_volunteer_officer_with_the.php">arrested for allegedly bribing police for gun licenses</a> days before Passover.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115729/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/high-ranking-nypd-kills-long-island-golf-article-1.2636360">The News says</a> Ameri initially did not appear bothered by his name being mentioned in the probe but &quot;Something changed dramatically in the days after he was first mentioned on April 5. Ameri had been asked specifically by FBI agents about providing police escorts and crowd control for Orthodox Jewish funerals in Brooklyn, according to a source.&quot;</p>

<p>A Post source said, &quot;The FBI went to his station house [Thursday] to get the escort logs. After that, someone called him.&quot;</p>

<p>Roy Richter, head of the &#x200E;President at NYPD Captains Endowment Association, told the Post that he spoke to Ameri on Thursday that he didn&apos;t have to worry, a recent visit from Internal Affairs was &quot;focused mostly on a lieutenant who had just put in retirement papers. The lieutenant, one of Ameri&#x2019;s closest friends, was cleared for retirement on Friday.&quot;</p>

<p>Richter said, &quot;There was always that fear and concern and that worry. I thought I put those fears and concerns to rest. It&#x2019;s obvious I didn&#x2019;t.&quot;</p>

<p>Ameri was admired by safe streets advocates when he was the commanding officer of the 78th Precinct, which covers Park Slope, where he ushered in a program that had plainclothes police officers pose as pedestrians and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115729/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/27/that_pedestrian_you_just_cut_off_is.php">ticket drivers who failed to yield to pedestrians</a>. </p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio, who represented the neighborhood as a Council Member and still has a home there, said, &quot;We are saddened to learn of the passing of Inspector Michael Ameri. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.&quot;</p>
