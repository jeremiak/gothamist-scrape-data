					<p>The 71st Annual Tony Awards celebrated a musical about a shy high school student dealing with tragedy and a play about what led to the 1993 Oslo Peace Accord between Israel and Palestine, as social media sensation <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> and Lincoln Center&apos;s <em>Oslo</em> won Best Musical and Best Play respectively on Sunday night.</p>

<p>To no one&apos;s surprise, <em>Hello Dolly!</em>, the revival of the beloved Jerry Herman musical starring Bette Midler, won Best Revival of a Musical, plus Best Actress in a Musical for Midler, while the last of August Wilson&apos;s plays to finally premiere on Broadway, <em>Jitney</em>, was named Best Revival of a Play. </p>

<p>The ceremony lacked a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212300/http://gothamist.com/tags/tonyawards">&apos;Hamilton&apos;-esque blockbuster</a> this year to bring excitement to the show, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212300/http://nypost.com/2017/04/13/with-just-weeks-to-go-the-tonys-still-cant-find-a-host/">was without a host</a> until pretty recently. Kevin Spacey, who is performing as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212300/https://www1.ticketmaster.com/kevin-spacey-as-clarence-darrow-flushing-new-york-06-15-2017/event/1D00529BF105A569">Clarence Darrow</a> at Arthur Ashe Stadium later this week, gamely stepped up, but relied perhaps a bit too much of impressions (Johnny Carson! Bill Clinton!) and bits: </p>

<p>It was the appearance of John Mulaney and Nick Kroll that made one wonder what could have been if George and Gil hosted the show instead: </p>

<p>Also: The Rockettes appeared TWICE in the TV broadcast, probably because the show was being held at Radio City Music Hall, but it&apos;s sad that James Earl Jones&apos; Lifetime Achievement Award wasn&apos;t important enough to be televised:</p>

<p>The most energetic performance of the night&#x2014;the Tonys are a vehicle for shows to get a little free marketing&#x2014;was from <em>Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812</em>, the musical based on <em>War &amp; Peace</em> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212300/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/photos_kill_your_cell_phone_and_tak.php#photo-1">started off-Broadway</a>. </p>

<p>The show, which had 12 nominations, won two technical awards. The big winner of the night was <em>Evan Hansen</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212300/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/theater/2017/06/the_dissembling_liar_at_the_center_of_broadway_hit_dear_evan_hansen.html">the ethically slippery hit</a>, which also won Best Actor, Best Featured Actress, Best Book, Best Score and Best Orchestration. </p>

<p>The one moment everyone was waiting for was Midler&apos;s win, and she delivered the kind of acceptance speech you&apos;d expect from her:</p>
