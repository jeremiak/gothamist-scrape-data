<p>As he was being handcuffed, the suspect, identified as Raul Nunez, 32, struggled with the cops, Shane Farina, 38, and Jason Maass, 28.  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;<strong>All three went to the ground. During the struggle, one of the officer&apos;s guns came loose...Nu&#xF1;ez grabbed it, stood up and fired at both officers while they were on the ground.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Nunez ran up the station&apos;s escalator, firing at the cops once again, but another plainclothes police officer, Lt. Gary Abrahall who had been supervising Farina and Maass, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506004856/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/nyregion/22cops.html?ref=nyregion">was up there and confronted him</a>.  Nunez fired three times at Abrahall, who was not hit; Abrahall then fired back at Nunez, hitting him in the leg and torso.   </p>
