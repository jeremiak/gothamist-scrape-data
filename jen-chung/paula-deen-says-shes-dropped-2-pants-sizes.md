<p>Paula Deen is feeling &quot;good&quot; and actually exercising these days.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165856/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/report_paula_deen_has_diabetes.php">famous butter-lover</a> confirmed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165856/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/video_paula_deen_confirms_she_does.php">she has had Type 2 Diabetes</a> for years and at this past weekend&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165856/http://2012.sobefest.com/">South Beach Food and Wine Festival</a>, she told People, &quot;I&apos;ve dropped two pant sizes!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165856/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20574010,00.html">According to People</a>, &quot;Her new healthier regime includes walking 30 minutes every day - and now having portions half the size of those she used to eat.  Even so, as Deen - who also hosted a brunch for fans that included a <strong>menu of fried chicken and waffles, jambalaya cooked by her husband and a strawberry margarita mousse</strong> prepped by chef Robert Irvine - told her fans during her cooking demo, she still isn&apos;t sure how much she weighs.&quot;  Deen said, &quot;We don&apos;t own a scale in our house. Every six months I go for a physical and find out. Now it&apos;s time to see the doctor. She&apos;ll be so happy if I&apos;ve lost weight.&quot;  She also claims that she&apos;ll be offering &quot;lighter versions&quot; of her food.</p>

<p>Deen also told the crowd, &quot;It&apos;s amazing how good getting up and moving makes you feel.&quot;  And if you have the fortitude, here are some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165856/http://bites.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/02/28/6155039-paula-deen-gets-wild-at-the-south-beach-wine-and-food-festival">2011 pictures of Deen licking butter off Irvine&apos;s stomach and, uh, riding him</a>, which launched the <a href="pauladeenridingthings.com">&quot;Paula Deen Riding Things&quot; website</a>.</p>
