<p>Yesterday, NJ Governor Chris Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DOK8NW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_5?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER">revealed that he had secret stomach surgery</a> to help him lose weight back in February. While he insists he didn&apos;t do this for a potential White House run, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/05/surgery_gives_christie_better.html#incart_m-rpt-1">everyone knows otherwise</a>. Anyway, one doctor thinks he could get down to 250 pounds by 2016!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/nyregion/patients-say-gastric-band-procedure-wont-guarantee-weight-loss.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times got down to brass tacks</a>:</p><blockquote> Looking at Mr. Christie&#x2019;s photograph, Dr. Jaime Ponce, president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, estimated that his weight could range from 350 to 450 pounds.<p></p>

<p>If Mr. Christie did well, he could lose about 150 pounds by 2016, Dr. Ponce said. &#x201C;That would put him in a 250 range,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s still going to be looking like a big guy, but not overweight like he is now.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>So basically Christie could lose nearly an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/https://www.google.com/search?q=barack+obama+weight&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=barack+obama+weight&amp;aqs=chrome.0.59j0l3j62l2.1728j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Obama&apos;s worth of weight</a>. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/chris_new_way_of_wife_oEvYeiNABWOM76nG8NHUlI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Christie said</a> that Jets coach Rex Ryan&apos;s weight loss was inspiring. Ryan had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/rex_ryan_feeling_fine_after_lap_ban.php">lap band surgery in 2010</a>, and Christie, who has lost 40 pounds so far,  recalled, &quot;He said, &#x2018;Gov, it works great. Look at me! You believe this? It&#x2019;s amazing &#x2014; I&#x2019;m not hungry.&apos; I was thinking to myself: I could not conceive of not being hungry.&#x201D; Uh, Governor Christie, just keep in mind that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/31/are_jets_touchdowns_inversely_propo.php">Jets touchdowns have been inversely proportional to Ryan&apos;s weight</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, perhaps as a way to distract people from the lap band news, Christie&apos;s office released a video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205123209/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/23/would_you_buy_chris_christies_belov.php">about his infamous fleece</a> going missing:</p>
