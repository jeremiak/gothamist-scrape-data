<p>After the release of a surveillance video showing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013135653/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/12/video_solange_attacks_jay-z_in_stan.php">Solange Knowles attacking brother-in-law Jay Z</a> while Beyonce just stands COMPLETELY still in an elevator, The Standard hotel has announced it has found the viral video hitmaker&#x2014;aka the employee who sold the video to TMZ for a rumored $250,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013135653/http://pagesix.com/2014/05/13/solange-was-crazy-drunk-and-out-of-it-during-jay-z-attack/?_ga=1.13998706.439279612.1320980827">Page Six reported yesterday</a> that the video was being shopped around to various outlets for around $250,000. A source said, &quot;There are only a handful of people who&#x2019;d have access to that tape. The Standard owns that tape.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013135653/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/beyonce-jay-z-used-to-solange-outbursts-tantrums-happened-before-2014135">Us Weekly was told by a Standard staffer,</a> &quot;The video was recorded on a cell phone from the monitors in the back room.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013135653/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Standard-Hotel-Jay-Z-Solange-Beyonce-Elevator-Fight-NYC-259325961.html">The Standard said it fired the employee</a> for &quot;breaching the security policies of the hotel and recording the confidential CCTV video.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013135653/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/solange-knowles-hit-jay-z-rachel-roy-sources-article-1.1791892">Some sources claim</a> that Solange was drunk when she raged at Jay Z, apparently because he was going to a Met Gala after-party thrown by Rihanna without Beyonce (or Solange). Further, Solange was allegedly upset that fashion designer Rachel Roy was getting &quot;close&quot; to her brother-in-law. </p>

<p>However, The Daily Show&apos;s Senior Beyonce Correspondent Jessica Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013135653/http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/05/the-daily-show-has-a-new-theory-about-the-solangejay-z-elevator-video/370931/">thinks the video was staged</a>, &quot;That so-called security cam footage is nothing but another brilliant Queen Bey marketing campaign... Didn&apos;t you notice anything weird about that video ... Something weird about Beyonc&#xE9;? She&apos;s standing still.&quot; <br>

<p>Williams pointed out, &quot;This is Beyonc&#xE9;. It doesn&apos;t matter what she&apos;s wearing, Beyonc&#xE9; is never not moving. The woman is pure kinetic energy personified. If that elevator video were real, she&apos;d be all up in it, arms waving, feet flying, fists pumping, booty bumping. She&apos;d be like a Ninja Turtle meets a Rockette.&quot;</p>

<p>Thankfully, it seems the two sisters are mending fences, if Solange&apos;s Instagram is any guide:</p>
