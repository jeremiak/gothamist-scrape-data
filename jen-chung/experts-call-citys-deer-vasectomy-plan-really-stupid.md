<p>Last week, the de Blasio administration unveiled their plans to manage Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/10/in_six_years_deer_population_o.html">exploding deer population</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/10/staten_island_deer_population.php">giving every single male deer a vasectomy</a>. However, some experts are questioning their solution&#x2014;a Cornell University ecologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/experts_think_citys_staten_isl.html">told the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;It&apos;s difficult for me to come up with all the reasons why this is a really stupid plan. It&apos;s ridiculous from the onset.&quot;</p>

<p>The city hopes to perform vasectomies over the next three years in order to bring down the deer population by 10-30%. But biologists say this really won&apos;t do anything. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://nypost.com/2016/05/14/plan-to-give-deer-vasectomies-will-result-in-sex-crazed-beasts/">The Post</a> painted this vivid picture:</p><blockquote>In reality, female white-tailed deer go into heat in the autumn rutting season. They emit a powerful scent that attracts males, who chase them and battle each other until every last doe is pregnant. Normally, the rut lasts a month or two. But with bucks shooting blanks, the does will go into heat repeatedly throughout the fall and winter. The hot-to-trot does could attract bucks from near and far for many more months &#x2014; including still-potent potential mates swimming over from New Jersey.</blockquote>Al Cambronne, who has written about deer, said that their mating habits are &quot;more random and promiscuous and chaotic&quot; than the city assumes, adding, &quot;One buck can breed many doe.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Cornell ecologist Dr. Paul Curtis said that when he and colleagues conducted a study (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://wildlifecontrol.info/deer/Documents/IDRM_12-5-2014.pdf">PDF</a>) about managing deer numbers in suburban areas, performing vasectomies on bucks was very difficult, explaining that the biggest ones that have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/experts_think_citys_staten_isl.html">widest ranges don&apos;t respond to sedatives</a>, &quot;We could only do three vasectomies&#x2014; it wasn&apos;t safe for the deer and wasn&apos;t safe for us,&quot; and described the process as &quot;stressful&quot; for the bucks.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://nypost.com/2016/05/14/plan-to-give-deer-vasectomies-will-result-in-sex-crazed-beasts/">Other possible courses of action</a> would be sterilizing does (which is expensive); contraceptive for does (which don&apos;t last very long); and euthanizing part of the herd. The current deer vasectomies plan has been endorsed by NYCLASS, a prominent donor to Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211000/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/22/nyclass_subpoenaed.php">that is now being probed by the FBI</a>.</p>

<p>A City Hall spokesperson told the Post, &quot;We are very confident in our proposal. It&#x2019;s a smart approach that can be implemented quickly, before the problem increases.&#x201D;</p>
