<p><em>Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232833/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/why_weiner_isnt_pulling_out.php">Anthony Weiner&apos;s boring email to supporters</a>, spiced up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232833/http://thedirty.com/2013/07/exclusive-anthony-weiner-sex-messages-post-scandal-with-another-woman-not-huma-abedin/">with his sexts, via The Dirty</a>, interspersed throughout. Can you handle this much Weiner/Carlos Danger?</em></p>

<p>Friend, <em>What are you wearing? Much for me to take off? I&apos;d hold you by the throat</em>  </p>

<p>When I decided to run for mayor this year I knew it would be tough. <em>You may want to be wet. He&apos;s huge for you today.</em></p>

<p> I knew that the mistakes of my personal life would make things difficult for me and for my family.  <em>God I want to take u from behind in front of a mirror. I want to see your face and feel your pussy spasm as u cum with me deep in you.</em></p>

<p>From the very beginning, some people insisted that I shouldn&#x2019;t even be allowed to run. <em>I make me insane. More! I&apos;m gonna cum again. So hard.</em></p>

<p>I believe that question should be left to the voters.  <em>Would you let me cum on those perfect tits?</em></p>

<p>This fight is too important to leave New Yorkers without a choice. <em>So you won&apos;t tell me what picture of me you like the most or turned you on the most? only tv?</em></p>

<p> And I want to give them the power to decide who their Mayor will be. <em>God I would hit that so hard. Your pussy would beg for mercy.</em></p>

<p>I have waged a campaign focused on fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it there. <em>Tell me about your pussy. smooth?</em></p>

<p> I published a book of 64 ideas on everything from lowering taxes on New York families to creating the first ever single-payer health care plan for our city. <em>Standing behind you. Lathering with one hand. Fingering u with the other.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232833im_/http://gothamist.com/upload/2013/07/smooth.jpg" width="640" height="264" alt="smooth.jpg"></p>

<p>Day after day, I&#x2019;ve visited citizens who have been hungry for a voice after years of feeling marginalized or ignored. <em>Taking a shower. Wanna join me?</em></p>

<p>New Yorkers responded in resounding ways. They volunteered for our campaign. They submitted their own ideas. They made thousands of small donations. And they showed up on street corners, subway stations and community centers to say hello or give me a piece of their mind. <em>Wet? Put on some shoes. I would spread your ass so my cock hit deep.</em></p>

<p>Now, with 47 days left until the primary, some powerful voices are making it clear that they still don&#x2019;t want me to run. Yesterday&#x2019;s news has given them fresh fodder.<br>
I owe it to you to try to explain. <em>I walk right up to you and bend down grab the back of your hair and put my tongue deep in your mouth. </em></p>

<p>Sending these embarrassing messages to women online, whom I never met, was a personal failing that was hurtful to my wife and a part of my life that Huma and I have put behind us. <em>So you won&apos;t tell me what picture of me you like the most or turned you on the most? only tv?</em></p>

<p>These things I did, as you have read in the papers, didn&#x2019;t happen once. <em>Sadly my pics are out there to look at. have you ever.</em></p>

<p>It was a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time in our marriage. <em>I was reading your tweets and looking at your pics. so i though id hold your wrists to settle you down.</em></p>

<p>After a lot of reflection, some professional help, and a general reorientation of my life, Huma has given me a second chance. <em>So i walk into a hotel room and you are at the end of the bed. </em></p>

<p>I will never stop being grateful for that.<em> Naked except for some amazing fuckme shoes.</em></p>

<p>Before and after announcing my run for Mayor, I repeatedly answered every question about these mistakes. <em>Your legs are spread.</em></p>

<p>I was clear that these relationships took place over an extended period of time with more than one person.<em> Your feet are flat on the ground you are leaning slightly forward looking completely in charge.</em></p>

<p> I regret not saying explicitly when these exchanges happened. <em>I said i was hard. help me.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232833im_/http://gothamist.com/upload/2013/07/heshuge.jpg" width="640" height="460" alt="heshuge.jpg"></p>

<p>But the bottom line is that the &#x201C;news&#x201D; today is about my past life. <em>You grab my cock, still holding your hair and still kissing you. I stand you up.</em></p>

<p>Some people may find my personal life reason not to listen to me. <em>I&apos;ve found the perfect woman. gorgeous, sexy and like a bit of my crazy.</em></p>

<p>I completely understand that some may not ever even consider voting for me. <em>I like to whisper in your ear while I make love to you. That ok?<br>
</em><br>
 But I&#x2019;m going to keep trying to bring them around and earn their support. <em>I&apos;m deeply flawed</em></p>

<p>This fight is too important to give up, because I&#x2019;ve had embarrassing personal things become public. <em>You are a fantasy to me. Have you made yourself cum about me recently.</em></p>

<p>This campaign isn&#x2019;t about me. It&#x2019;s about a great city that is beginning to lose its mantle as the Capital of the Middle Class. <em>Why r u awake? What are you thinking about today? How do you look?<br>
</em><br>
 It&#x2019;s about the challenge of finding affordable housing, a good job with benefits and a public school that attracts the greatest teachers and produces the smartest kids. <em>If I met you in a bar and tried to talk to you. would I have a chance.</em></p>

<p> This race for Mayor isn&#x2019;t about me. It&#x2019;s about you. And I&#x2019;ll never lose sight of that. <em>Still holding your hair. now standing, i take my other hand and finger your pussy. its wet. soaked. i turn you around and bend you over the back of a chair. your pussy is asking for it.</em></p>

<p>New Yorkers don&#x2019;t quit, and I&#x2019;ll never quit on you. <em>I must have cum thinking about you and looking at you 100 times. how does that make you feel? gross?</em></p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Anthony <em>Carlos</em></p>
