Zurana Horton, 34, was killed when picking up a child from P.S. 298 in Brownsville, at Pitkin Avenue and Watkins Street, and apparently died trying to shield other youngsters.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170305/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/hero_mom_taken_from_these_kids_7GBmmrvloq33PIIJvA3EEP">One of Horton&apos;s children told the Post</a> that she actually walked by the crime scene, not realizing her mother was the victim, &quot;I was wondering where my mother was. I found out later [the body] was my mother. My little sister [Alexis] said, &#x2018;Mommy died. She got shot.&#x2019;&quot;<p></p>

Members of both gangs told The Post that they consider themselves the modern-day Bloods and Crips -- and sources say their violent feud has been raging for several years.&quot; Apparently residents are too afraid to call 911 and say the violence is worse at night, when the gangster &quot;do not hesitate&quot; to shoot.</p>

<p>While neighbors said that Horton, who had 13 living children (a 14th died of pneumonia a few years ago), was pregnant, but the ME&apos;s office said that she was not.  Still, the tragedy is huge, as her children (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170305/http://www.nypost.com/rw/nypost/2011/10/23/news/web_photos/web_shooting.jpg">10 pictured here</a>) will be split up between Horton&apos;s mother and her ex-boyfriend, Oniel Vaughn, the father of eight of the children, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170305/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/23/2011-10-23_mom_of_killed_pregnant_hero_struck_with_grief_.html">who told the Daily News</a>, &quot;She gave her life for those kids, and she would have done it all again because that&apos;s just the kind of person she was. She was worried about the violence. She said she wanted to move and buy a house for her kids. Those kids were her life.&quot;  He added, &quot;I didn&apos;t tell the younger kids yet. The older ones know. They&apos;re devastated.&quot;</p>
