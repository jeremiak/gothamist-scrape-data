                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_08_serialaron.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823023122im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_serialaron.jpg" width="640" height="360"> <br> <i> Via WCBS 2</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Hours after revealing they were looking for someone who set <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823023122/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/video_cops_seek_serial_arsonist_in.php">five fires in Queens</a>, the NYPD arrested one Devon Page. The 22-year-old Queens resident was charged with arson.</p>

<p>All the fires were set on Sunday morning, the first being the torching of a SUV that happened to belong to former City Councilman Eric Gioia. Gioia, who doesn&apos;t think he was targeted, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823023122/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/19/police-former-city-councilmans-car-torched-in-apparent-random-arson-attack/">told WCBS 2</a> the fire outside his Sunnyside home was frightening, &quot;We thought one of our kids had fallen out of bed, but it was such a loud sound we thought maybe our daughter in the top bunk fell out of bed. So I got up and looked in her room - she was still laying in bed. So I opened my son&#x2019;s door - he&#x2019;s ten months old - and I saw a huge fireball outside his window.&quot; Gioia jumped on top of the crib and &quot;yelled to my wife to get the girls, and ran out of the house.&quot;</p>

<p>Police found other rubbish fires in the area.</p>
