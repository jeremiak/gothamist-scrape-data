<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830043054/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/22/stone_cold_hunks_save_nyc.php">no heroic models in sight</a>, a pair of teenagers were able to pull themselves out of a pond in Central Park after falling through the ice last night. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830043054/http://nypost.com/2017/03/19/selfie-crazed-teens-keep-falling-through-frozen-central-park-pond/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;Two teenage boys, ages 15 and 13, were attempting to take a selfie on top of the frozen body of water when they fell through the ice at around 7 p.m. Sunday.&quot; Last month, a group of teens were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830043054/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/21/central_park_teens_ice.php">rescued from the frigid Central Park pond</a> after falling through ice during an attempted selfie.</p>

<p>The teens then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830043054/http://pix11.com/2017/03/20/2-teens-fall-through-ice-on-frozen-pond-in-central-park-nypd/">encountered some EMTs on 60th Street</a> and were taken to Mount Sinai St. Luke&apos;s Hospital, where they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830043054/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/teens-plunge-ice-central-park-pond-article-1.3002931">are listed in stable condition</a>.</p>

<p>The mother of one of the teens who fell in the pond in February reacted with appropriate incredulity in an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830043054/http://abc7ny.com/news/teens-saved-after-central-park-ice-fall-describe-rescue/1765437/">after the incident</a>, telling ABC 7, &quot;A selfie? On the ice? Why would you think of a pond to go into to take a selfie, knowing that it&apos;s warm and the ice is melted?&quot;<br>
