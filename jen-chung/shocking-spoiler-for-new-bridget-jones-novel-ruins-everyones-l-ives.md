---


                            
                            
                            
                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_09_bunnybrid.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063742im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_bunnybrid.jpg" width="640" height="402"> <br> <i> You&apos;re going to need at least an e-cigarette when you read this part of the book.</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The publishing world&#x2014;and possibly Renee Zellweger&apos;s agent&#x2014;was excited when Helen Fielding announced she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063742/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/05/v_good_new_bridget_jones_novel_comi.php">working on a third Bridget Jones novel</a>. The book is set in present day London, and Fielding had explained, &quot;My life has moved on and Bridget&#x2019;s will move on, too... I hope people will have as much fun reading it, as I am writing it.&quot; Now, an excerpt in Britain&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063742/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1317896.ece">The Sunday Times Magazine reveals</a> a major plot point that is rocking the world of many Bridget Jones fans. <strong>Warning, SPOILERS ahead</strong> and they are v. v. not good.</p>

<p>BBC News doesn&apos;t care about spoilers, so its headline was &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063742/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24323108">Bridget Jones&apos; fans horror at death of Mark Darcy</a>.&quot; That&apos;s right: Fielding has killed off Bridget Jones&apos; knight-in-shining-armor (lawyer-in-bespoke-suits) Mark Darcy, after Bridget and Mark got married and had two kids, Mabel and Billy. The depressing detail is revealed in a flashback. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063742/http://metro.co.uk/2013/09/29/bridget-jones-fans-in-for-a-big-shock-in-new-book-mad-about-the-boy-4127005/">Metro explains</a>, &quot;Instead, Mad About The Boy, penned by Helen Fielding, will revolve around 51-year-old Bridget&#x2019;s adventures as a cougar as she embarks on a relationship with 30-year-old toy boy, Roxter, after meeting him on Twitter five years after Darcy&#x2019;s death.&quot; </p>

<p>The news has literally ruined the lives of some singletons/one-time singletons:</p>

<p>This is either horrible&#x2014;you don&apos;t see Jane Austen killing off Mr. Darcy in the second sequel to &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice,&quot; do you?&#x2014;since the books were frothy fantasy or it&apos;s brilliant because what else is going to happen&#x2014;Mark cheats on her, Miranda-and-Steve in <em>Sex and the City</em> the movie style? Of course, apparently Daniel Cleaver is still around in the third book...</p>
