<p>A 69-year-old was shot and killed during a Brooklyn home invasion this morning. Police are currently looking for three suspects.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, three suspects approached a 71-year-old woman who was outside of her house at 379 Rugby Road. They forced her inside, demanded money, tied her up and, police say, went upstairs, only to be confronted by the woman&apos;s brother. The suspects apparently shot the man in the head and then fled on foot.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Kings County Hospital where he died.</p>
