<p>A woman was awakened last Saturday morning by a man who broke into her Brooklyn apartment and nearly raped her. Police say the man gained access to the victim&apos;s home by climbing in through the fire escape window. He also allegedly exposed himself to the woman.</p>

<p>The incident happened on Saturday, March 25th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033548/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170329/bushwick/police-nypd-arrest-flash-groper-burglar-arrest-expose-flash">According to DNAinfo</a>, the suspect &quot;startled her awake by exposing himself at her bedside, police said. The terrified 30-year-old woke up about 6:45 a.m. inside her apartment near Greene and Irving avenues and screamed when she saw the stranger, who police said slim and wearing a black hooded jacket, towering beside her bed.&quot; </p>

<p>Her roommate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033548/http://abc7ny.com/news/police-man-creeps-into-womans-room-using-fire-escape-in-attempted-rape/1825578/">came into the room</a> in response to her screaming, and the intruder reportedly fled through the front door.</p>

<p>One woman who just moved to Bushwick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033548/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Man-Sneaks-up-Fire-Escape-Window-Flashes-Sleeping-Woman-417532183.html">told NBC New York</a>, &#x201C;I&apos;m definitely going to lock both my locks, that&apos;s for sure. I&apos;m glad I have gates on my building.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say the suspect is in his 20s and is around 5&apos;9&quot; and 120 pounds. He was last seen wearing a black-hooded jacket and blue jeans.</p>
