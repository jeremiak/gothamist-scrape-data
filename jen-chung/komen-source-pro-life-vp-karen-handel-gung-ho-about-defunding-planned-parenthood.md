Komen Foundation decided to defund</a> breast cancer prevention programs at Planned Parenthood, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/05/karen-handel-susan-g-komen-decision-defund-planned-parenthood_n_1255948.html">Huffington Post reports</a> that a Komen source says vice president for public policy Karen Handel was the &quot;main force behind the decision to defund Planned Parenthood and the attempt to make that decision look nonpolitical.&quot; The source said, &quot;Karen Handel was the prime instigator of this effort, and she herself personally came up with investigation criteria. She said, &apos;If we just say it&apos;s about investigations, we can defund Planned Parenthood and no one can blame us for being political.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>When news of Komen&apos;s decision was made public last week (the group told Planned Parenthood in December), Komen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/will_women_drop_support_of_susan_g.php">was attacked by critics</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/04/planned_parenthood_raised_3_million.php">Planned Parenthood raised millions</a>.  After miserable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/actually_planned_parenthood_made_65.php">attempts to spin the situation</a> and realizing that many supporters felt betrayed, Komen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/03/breaking_after_growing_backlash_kom.php">reversed its decision and said it would fund Planned Parenthood</a>.  For now.</p>

<p>Prior to working for Komen, which is the country&apos;s largest breast cancer charity, Handel had run for governor of Georgia, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://web.archive.org/web/20100921093610/http:/blog.karenhandel.com/2010/07/karen-handel-on-life-and-planned-parenthood/">wrote for her campaign blog</a>:</p><blockquote>First, let me be clear, since I am pro-life, I do not support the mission of Planned Parenthood. During my time as Chairman of Fulton County, there were federal and state pass-through grants that were awarded to Planned Parenthood for breast and cervical cancer screening, as well as a &#x201C;Healthy Babies Initiative.&#x201D;  The grant was authorized, regulated, administered and distributed through the State of Georgia.  Because of the criteria, regulations and parameters of the grant, Planned Parenthood was the only eligible vendor approved to meet the state criteria.  Additionally, none of the services in any way involved abortions or abortion-related services.  In fact, state and federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions or abortion related services and I strongly support those laws.  Since grants like these are from the state I&#x2019;ll eliminate them as your next Governor.</blockquote> The HuffPo continues, &quot;Emails between Komen leadership on the day the Planned Parenthood decision was announced, which were reviewed by HuffPost under the condition they not be published, confirm the source&apos;s description of Handel&apos;s sole &quot;authority&quot; in crafting and implementing the Planned Parenthood policy.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Komen had claimed that the House investigation into Planned Parenthood&apos;s use of government funds, one headed by a pro-life Republican, was why it couldn&apos;t fund the group.  The source said, &quot;Komen&apos;s been dealing with the Planned Parenthood issue for years, and you know, some right-wing groups would organize a protest or send out a mailing every now and then, but it was on a low simmer. What Karen&apos;s been doing for the past six months is ratcheting up the issue with leadership. Every time someone would even mention a protest, she would magnify it, pump it up, exaggerate it. She&apos;s the one that kept driving this issue.&quot; </p>

<p>Now that the pink veil has been lifted, there has been much scrutiny on Komen.  Today, the Washington Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/komen-spends-lavishly-on-salaries-and-promotion/2012/02/06/gIQAVw4qtQ_blog.html">looked at executive salaries</a>:</p><blockquote>James Abruzzo, a management and global business instructor at Rutgers Business School, said the picture that emerges from the documents raises several concerns.<p></p>

<p>First, he said, Brinker&#x2019;s duals roles at Komen may hobble the decision-making process. &#x201C;When you have a chairman who&#x2019;s also the president, you have a lack of checks and balances,&#x2019;&#x2019; Abruzzo said. &#x201C;The founder generally populates the board with friends and associates.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>Indeed, Brinker&#x2019;s son, Eric Brinker, serves on the Komen board.</p>

<p>The fact that Komen is making severance payments to four top executives is also a cause for concern about the way the organization is run, Abruzzo said.</p>

<p>As for Komen&#x2019;s salary and first-class travel, while it may be deserved, it probably sends the wrong message to potential donors, he added.</p>

<p>&#x201C;When you&#x2019;re trying to raise money from other people, it sends a bad signal,&#x2019;&#x2019; he said.</p></blockquote>And the Daily Beast suggests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201170850/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/06/komen-incites-women-s-tahrir-square-moment.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29">this is a women&apos;s &quot;Tahrir Square&quot; moment</a>.<p></p>
