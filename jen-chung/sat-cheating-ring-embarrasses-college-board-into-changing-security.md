At a hearing today,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180456/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/sat-scandal-will-lead-to-beefed-up-security-1.3271251"> Newsday reports</a> the testing service promised to make &quot;a sweeping review of the system that safeguards testing of students, along with new security measures that could include taking digital photos of all test takers.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>Right now, the College Board gives the SAT to over 2 million students around the world annually.  President Gaston Caperton told the NY State Senate&apos;s Higher Education Committee that some new procedures will be in place by the November 5 SAT. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180456/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/29/students_accused_of_cheating_on_sat.php">scandal emerged</a> last month when Great Neck High School graduate Samuel Eshagahoff was arrested for fraud and criminal impersonation for allegedly accepting thousands to take students&apos; SATs for them.  </p>

<p>Great Neck High School principal Bernard Kaplan blasted security procedures, pointing out students can take the tests at a school other than their own and can fake IDs, &quot;Make up a school, put any name you like and your picture on the card, sign that name and pick a mascot for good luck. In fact, if you want to cover yourself, you don&apos;t even have to go to the site you requested ... you can go as a walk-in to any site that you desire using that made-up ID.&quot; Kaplan&apos;s suggestion: Students should take the exam at their own schools and if they want to go to a different school, the district must validate their reasons.  </p>

<p>State Senator Kenneth LaValle (R), who heads the Higher Education Committee, was unhappy about the cheating scandal and suggested that some students&apos; parents may have been complicit, &quot;Where and how did the students get the cash?&quot; to pay Eshaghoff the alleged $2,500 to take the test. &quot;Who knew about this, and when did they know about it?&quot;</p>
