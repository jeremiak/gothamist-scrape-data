However, the 27-year-old&apos;s mother said, &quot;He is sick and has a history of mental illness. He never harmed anyone and hasn&apos;t done anything other than write articles on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>Justin Massler, who changed his name to Cloud Stormchaser, had been visiting his mother in Reno; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214093946/http://www.rgj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2010100317017">Reno Gazette-Journal reported</a>, &quot;Reno police said NYC police were en route to Reno Wednesday to take custody of Massler, who is accused of using the Internet to stalk Trump.&quot; </p>

<p>While her son desperately hoped to be saved by Trump, at least based on his most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214093946/http://ivankatrumpfanblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/ivanka-trumps-office-view.html">recent blog entry,</a> in which he told of sleeping on church steps apparently across the street from Trump&apos;s office, Randee Massler said, &quot;He hasn&apos;t come anywhere close to Ivanka Trump. He&apos;s like a 10-year-old who has a crush on a movie star.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214093946/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/03/ivanka_trump_saved_from_terrif.html">Daily Intel  ventures</a>, &quot;We&apos;re sure there&apos;s more to this story that was unsettling to Ivanka&apos;s people. Maybe the fact that he stalked Tucker Max first, for example.&quot;  Also, it seems less gross than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214093946/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/03/17/2010-03-17_bret_michaels_admits_to_fantasizing_about_donald_trumps_daughter_ivanka_during_a.html#ixzz0iRWxFMwJ">Bret Michaels fantasizing about her</a>.  </p>
