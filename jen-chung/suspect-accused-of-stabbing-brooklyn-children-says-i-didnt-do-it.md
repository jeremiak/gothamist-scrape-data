<p>Mikayla Capers is at New York-Presbyterian, recovering from multiple stab wounds, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://nypost.com/2014/06/08/child-stabbed-recovering-but-wont-talk-about-ripper/">and her aunt told the Post</a>, &quot;She has not talked about what happened... It is too soon right now.&quot;</p>

Both children, who were headed to get ices, were stabbed repeatedly. P.J. died from his wounds and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/07/funeral_for_stabbed_6-year-old_east.php#photo-1">mourned at a funeral on Friday</a>. </p>

<p>It&apos;s also believed that St. Hubert is involved in the fatal May 30th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/05/chelsea_subway_attack_may_be_linked.php#photo-1">stabbing of 18-year-old</a> Tanaya Grant Copeland, also in East New York, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/04/man_stabbed_repeatedly_at_west_18th.php">June 4th stabbing of a man</a> at the West 18th Street subway station in Manhattan. St. Hubert was found, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/04/nypd_identifies_suspect_in_brutal_b.php">after a huge police manhunt</a>, in Queens on Thursday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/06/suspect_in_brooklyn_childs_killing.php">scrawling &quot;$ Killzz I will B&quot;</a> with a smiley face on a stop sign.

<p>St. Hubert has numerous arrests and was just released on parole on May 23rd, after serving five years for choking his mother. He was transferred to Bellevue Hospital yesterday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/accused-child-killer-daniel-st-hubert-carted-bellevue-hospital-article-1.1821587">the Daily News reports</a>:</p><blockquote>[His sister Judith Perry] said he appeared lucid and only had one thing on his mind &#x2014; clearing his name.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t do it,&#x201D; he told his sister.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s managing,&#x201D; said the 29-year-old Perry, who believes the city Department of Correction sent her brother to Bellevue because of his &#x201C;documented mental illness.&#x201D; <br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s hanging on, but he says he can&#x2019;t take this too long because he knows he&#x2019;s innocent,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>St. Hubert claimed the guards transporting him to the hospital abused him by banging his head against the wall and tightening the cuffs until they hurt him.</p>

<p>&#x201C;His hand is swollen,&#x201D; Perry said. &#x201C;He doesn&#x2019;t like the situation he&#x2019;s in. He feels it&#x2019;s unfair that they are ... judging him guilty without even giving him a fair trial.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>However, police linked him to the crimes after finding his DNA at the crime scene. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617134507/http://online.wsj.com/articles/nypd-identifies-suspect-in-fatal-brooklyn-stabbing-of-prince-joshua-avitto-1401926692">Wall Street Journal reported</a>, &quot;The city Office of the Medical Examiner received the knife Sunday and spent about 36 hours processing the DNA&#x2014;considered to be a fast turnaround, a second law-enforcement official said. The DNA lifted from the knife was uploaded into a state offender registry, the official said. A match was found on Wednesday and turned over to the NYPD.&quot;</p>

<p>And Prince Joshua&apos;s brother, Sharod Jean-Pierre, told the News, &#x201C;[Hubert&apos;s] still gonna be able to eat, sleep, talk to people. My little brother isn&#x2019;t going to be able to do that anymore. I want him to stay at Rikers. I want him to suffer.&#x201D;</p>
