<p>Yesterday, the NY Post reported that an online ISIS magazine recommended the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011933/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/07/photos_new_macys_thanksgiving_day_p.php#photo-1">90th annual</a> Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011933/http://nypost.com/2016/11/13/isis-calls-thanksgiving-day-parade-an-excellent-target/">as an &quot;excellent target</a>.&quot; One federal law enforcement source told the tabloid that he is not aware of any specific, credible threats against the parade, but the NYPD nevertheless held a press conference in the afternoon, with Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011933/http://nypost.com/2016/11/15/nypd-ramps-up-thanksgiving-day-parade-security-amid-isis-threat/">reassuring</a> the public: &quot;Come to the Thanksgiving Day Parade, bring the family, have a good time. I always go and always bring mine.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD also reiterated that they are ready. &quot;This is an element that we had factored into plans for the Thanksgiving Day parades in years past,&quot; Miller said. &quot;As you may recall from last year, the route was lined with hundreds of blocker cars at intersections very much we do in a presidential route.&quot; Last year&apos;s Thanksgiving was a few weeks after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011933/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/13/nypd_counterterrorism_teams_deploye.php#photo-1">the Paris terror attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Miller also mentioned that after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011933/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/15/84_killed_in_france_during_bastille.ph">the Nice terror attack</a> the department visited 135 locations that rent trucks under 26,000 pounds, &quot;where you wouldn&apos;t require possession of a commercial driver&apos;s license,&quot; and officers told the rental companies about &quot;suspicious behavior and characteristics&quot; of potential renters.</p>

<p>A federal law enforcement source told the Post that the ISIS magazine&apos;s suggestion of a lone wolf targeting the parade was &quot;nothing new &#x2014; and if anything, show the group&#x2019;s diminishing reach, given that it has to increasingly rely on one-man freelancers to spread the hate.&quot; The source added, &quot;I definitely would have been notified [if such a threat existed].&quot;<br>
