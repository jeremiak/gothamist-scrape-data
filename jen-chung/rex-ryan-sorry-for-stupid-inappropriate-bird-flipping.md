										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2010_01_ryan2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050655im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_01_ryan2.jpg" width="300" height="208"> <br> <i>Left: Ryan after the AFC Championship Game loss; right: Ryan losing it in Miami</i></div> Unfortunately for Jets coach Rex Ryan, what happens in Miami doesn&apos;t stay in Miami, thanks to technology.  When apparently provoked at a mixed martial arts event (yes, a mixed martial arts event), Ryan flipped the bird and someone&#x2014;naturally&#x2014;caught the gesture on his cellphone.  Now the NFL is looking into whether it will fine Ryan.<p></p>

<p>Dave Hildenbrand took the photo and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050655/http://miamiherald.typepad.com/sedano-says/2010/01/rex-ryan-gettin-his-mma-on.html">sent it to the Miami Herald</a>, writing, &quot;Here&apos;s a pic of the Jets&apos; coach as he smiles and flicks off two of my friends at a recent MMA show in SouthFlorida.  They identified themselves as Dolphin fans and thus this is his reaction.  You tend to expect some sort of a class from a head coach, or at least you used to...&quot;  It&apos;s suggested that Ryan, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050655/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4875336">taunted Miami residents</a> by saying the Jets would beat the Dolphins twice next season, was repeatedly bombarded with &quot;over-the-top&quot; comments&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050655/http://www.sportsbybrooks.com/source-ryan-showed-restraint-in-face-of-abuse-27739">Sports by Brooks reports,</a> &quot;We&#x2019;re talking multiple f-bombs, m-f bombs and the obligatory comments about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050655/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/rex_ryan_and_his_reported_7000_calo.php">Ryan&#x2019;s weight</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Hildenbrand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050655/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ryan_sorry_after_he_flips_bird_to_7Ev6MIDNfnExNPscVyjPxN">tells the NY Post</a> that Ryan &quot;was walking by us after the event and a couple buddies of mine said some things like, &#x2018;Dolphins rule, Jets suck.&#x2019;  [Ryan] looked at us and said, &#x2018;Go f--- yourselves,&#x2019; and then he gave us the finger.&quot;  He added, &quot;He was being a smart ass. That didn&#x2019;t surprise me seeing the way he coaches and how he talks.&quot;</p>

<p>Ryan issued a statement, &quot;It was stupid and inappropriate. I wouldn&apos;t accept that type of behavior from one of the coaches or players and it&apos;s unacceptable from me. I apologize to the Jets organization, the National Football League and NFL fans everywhere.&quot;  And Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum said, &quot;Rex showed extremely poor judgment, and his conduct was inappropriate. He knows he was wrong, has apologized and we have accepted his apology. Any other actions regarding this incident will be addressed internally by the organization.&quot;</p>

<p>Herschel Walker, the former football player, was one of the fighters at the event&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050655/http://www.miamiherald.com/1510/story/1455479.html">and won</a>!</p>
