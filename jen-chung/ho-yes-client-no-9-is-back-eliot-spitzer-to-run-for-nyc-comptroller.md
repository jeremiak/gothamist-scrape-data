</div></div>					<p>It might only be July 7, but it sure feels like Christmas to NYC political watchers&#x2014;or anyone who wants to re-live one of the most stunning downfalls in New York political history (well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/crying_weiner_admits_to_sending_exp.php">before this one</a>)&#x2014;because former Governor Eliot Spitzer has announced he&apos;s running for NYC Comptroller. At this time, we&apos;d like to remind everyone what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/client_9_paid_4.php">escort service booker said of Spitzer</a>: <strong>He &quot;would ask you to do things that, like, you might not think were safe - you know - I mean that ... very basic things.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/nyregion/spitzer-seeks-ballot-for-city-comptrollers-race.html?hp&amp;_r=0">told the NY Times tonight</a>,&quot;I&#x2019;m hopeful there will be forgiveness, I am asking for it.&quot; According to the Times, &quot;Spitzer, a Democrat, said he was eager to plunge back into politics and believed he could revolutionize the often-overlooked city office into a new model for government accountability and shareholder activism.&quot; Here&apos;s a tagline, on us: &quot;The only thing I like to nail more than prostitutes is corrupt government officials!&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, Spitzer left office in early 2008 (who was only sworn in as governor in January 2007)  after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/governor_spitze_1.php">connected to an international prostitution ring</a>, whose escorts cost from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/07/international_e.php">$1,000 to $7,000 an hour</a>. Notably, an investigation found that Spitzer&#x2014;referred to as Client No. 9&#x2014; had booked a 22-year-old prostitute, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/12/spitzers_kriste.php">Jersey girl Ashley Dupre</a>, in Washington D.C. </p>

<p>If he can collect 3,750 signatures by Thursday for his petition, Spitzer will be matched against Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, a well-liked former state lawmaker who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://politicker.com/2013/02/scott-stringers-endless-endorsement-pile-grows-with-1199/">running unopposed so far</a>. Spitzer will also be riding his credentials as the &quot;Sheriff of Wall Street&quot; from his days as NY Attorney General. Spitzer claims to the Times that a woman came up to him recently:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I appreciate what you did when you were in office,&#x201D; he said she told him. &#x201C;Nobody is perfect; I hope you run again.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Mr. Spitzer added: &#x201C;It happens all the time. People who walk with me on the street say, &#x2018;People really do want you to get back in.&#x2019;&quot;</p></blockquote>Spitzer also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/love-gov-eliot-spitzer-run-city-controller-article-1.1392529">spoke to the Daily News</a>, &quot;I love public service. I believe in it and hope I will be given a second chance.... After being out of office for five years, thinking deeply, reflecting on what I was able to do when I was in government&#x2026;I&apos;m going to try and seek the controller&#x2019;s office and ask to the public to consider me.&quot; He also said his family supported his decision but &quot;refused to discuss reports that he is living apart from his wife, Silda.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/eliot-spitzer-is-nothing-like-anthony-weiner">Buzzfeed&apos;s Ben Smith warns </a>against comparing Spitzer to Weiner: </p><blockquote>But Spitzer has basically nothing in common with Weiner, aside from their low body fat, and shared (and lightly observed) Jewish faith. Weiner is a talented politician who left Congress with no major legislative accomplishments and everything to prove. Spitzer was a major force in American public life for eight years despite having no particular talent for politics. Weiner&#x2019;s online romances brought him down because they were weird. Spitzer&#x2019;s ordinary sin &#x2014; any number of politicians have survived prostitution scandals &#x2014; ended his tenure as governor because his governorship was already going terribly.<p></p>

<p>The question about Weiner is whether, as Mayor, he will be able to turn his talent for communications into leadership, something he&#x2019;s never done &#x2014; but the sort of thing that can happen when you&#x2019;re mayor, as it did to Ed Koch.</p>

<p>The question for Spitzer is whose head he will take off first.</p></blockquote>Politico&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/eliot-spitzer-political-comeback-93804.htm">Maggie Haberman points out</a>:<blockquote>What may help Spitzer, if he is able to get on the ballot, is the fact that down-ballot races in the city tend to be won largely on name recognition. Stringer is far from the household name that Spitzer is, and voters don&#x2019;t view the job as important as mayor.<p></p>

<p>What&#x2019;s more, while Weiner&#x2019;s crotch-picture scandal has a creepy factor, Spitzer&#x2019;s involved the world&#x2019;s oldest profession, and he did not exacerbate the personal damage by clinging to his office. And unlike Weiner, Spitzer has a long list of accomplishments in office to point to.</p></blockquote>Is it crazy to have a write-in campaign for former NJ Governor James McGreevey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202715/http://gothamist.com/2004/08/13/mcgreevey_steps_down_citing_extramarital_affair.php">to run for Public Advocate</a>? Sure he lives in NJ, but don&apos;t we need a scandal trifecta? <p></p>
