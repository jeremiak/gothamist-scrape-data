<p>Our subways need a lot of maintenance, and that means riders need to deal with some inconveniences as the MTA gets to work between now and April 16 on a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413043111/http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/servChanges_EF.htm">major track renewal and component replacement project along the Queens Boulevard Line</a>.&quot;  This means Manhattan-bound E and F customers that board between Sutphin Boulevard (F) and 75th Avenue (E, F) stations will need to to back-ride Queens-bound trains and then change for Manhattan-bound trains at non-affected stations. According to the MTA, &quot;This will add about ten minutes to a rush-hour trip.&quot;</p>

<p>The MTA adds, &quot;The track closure will be in effect 24 hours a day as the tracks and support equipment are completely replaced with new ties, tie blocks, plates and rails.&quot; Which means that the workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413043111/http://gothamist.com/tags/fastrack">can get the work done faster</a>.  </p>

<p>The Manhattan-bound trains will bypass the Sutphin Boulevard (F), Briarwood-Van Wyck Boulevard (EF) and 75th Avenue (EF) stations.  One rider who uses these station understands that the MTA needs to do its work, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413043111/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/07/major-subway-disruptions-in-queens-in-effect-today-until-april-16/">complained to WCBS 2</a> that there was only a little sign at the token booth warning riders, &quot;Do you think I&#x2019;m really just looking at this little sign here? I buy a monthly so I don&#x2019;t even come to the booth.&quot;</p>

<p>More from the MTA:</p><blockquote>E and F riders at 75th Avenue wishing to travel towards Manhattan must board a Queens-bound train, travel to the Union Turnpike-Kew Gardens station and transfer to a Manhattan-bound train.<p></p>

<p>E and F riders at Briarwood-Van Wyck Boulevard must board a Queens-bound train and travel to the Jamaica-Van Wyck (E) or Parsons Boulevard (F) stations to transfer to a Manhattan-bound train.</p>

<p>F riders at Sutphin Boulevard (F) must board a Queens-bound train and travel to Parsons Boulevard (F) to transfer to a Manhattan-bound train.</p></blockquote>You can get more details at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413043111/http://travel.mtanyct.info/serviceadvisory/">NYC Transit Service Advisory</a>.<p></p>
