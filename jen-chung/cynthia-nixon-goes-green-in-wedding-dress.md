<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_05_cnixon.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529213814im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_05_cnixon.jpg" width="300" height="400" class="image-right"> </span>After many seasons of being given the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529213814/http://www.hbo.com/sex-and-the-city/inside/the-look/slideshow/miranda-hobbes.html">worst wardrobe selections</a> on <em>Sex and the City</em>, it&apos;s always a relief when we see Cynthia Nixon looking gorgeous.  And she looked amazing in the wedding photograph that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529213814/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/28/cynthia_nixon_marries_girlfriend_ch.php">she and wife Christine Marinoni</a> released to the public.  </p>

<p>Nixon and Marinoni, who have been together since 2003 and have a baby boy (Nixon also has two children from a previous marriage), were married on Sunday in New York.  According to People, &quot;Nixon, 46, wore a flowing, pale green gown by Carolina Herrera and carried a bouquet of white peonies. Marinoni, 45, wore a suit with a darker green tie for the ceremony.&quot;</p>

Still, the wedding dress of the year&#x2014;so far&#x2014;seems to be Silicon Valley bride <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529213814/http://sfist.com/2012/05/23/priscilla_chan_bought_wedding_dress.php">Priscilla Chan&apos;s Claire Pettibone gown</a>.</p>
