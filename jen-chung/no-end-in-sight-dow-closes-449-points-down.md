<p>After it became clear the government&apos;s bailout of AIG <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221009/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/17/stocks_fall_as_anxiety_persists.php">wouldn&apos;t stop investors from being worried</a>, the Dow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221009/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/18markets.html?hp">closed 449 points down</a>.  Some quotes:<br>
</p><ul><li>&quot;There&apos;s a clear fright to the market right now,&quot; said Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNY ConvergEx Group, a New York stock brokerage. &quot;It&apos;s a virus that&apos;s running through the market. If investors don&apos;t know what a firm&apos;s exposure is [to bad credit bets], they&apos;re just running away.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221009/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122164849424947571.html">WSJ</a>)<br>
</li><li>&quot;What does tomorrow bring? Will it start spilling over into consumers? Will there be runs on the banks? There&apos;s a million things going on,&quot; said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets. &quot;Hopefully, we&apos;ll see a capitulation soon when everybody throws in the towel.&quot;  (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221009/http://www.cnbc.com/id/26755041">CNBC</a>)<br>
</li><li>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a growing sense that there&#x2019;s no end to this in sight,&#x201D; Edward Yardeni, the investment strategist, said.  (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221009/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/18markets.html?hp">NY Times</a>)<br>
</li><li>&quot;There is paralysis,&quot; says [Todd] Clark [trader at Nollenberger Capital Partners]. &quot;Everyone is afraid that the credit crisis won&apos;t go away. It&apos;s like the financial sector has been in a serious car accident and the government is treating the patient with band aids instead of surgery.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221009/http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2008-09-17-stocks-wednesday_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip">USA  Today</a>)</li></ul>With all the panic, gold prices rose to $850.50, its biggest one day price increase since 1980.  <p></p>
