He was the president of the Transit Workers Union Local 100 who made the decision to lead its members on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122710/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/20/strike_2.php">two-and-a-half day</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122710/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/22/transit_strike_6.php">transit strike in 2005</a>.  More recently he&apos;s been vice president in charge of strategic planning at TWU, but now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122710/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ex-twu-boss-roger-toussaint-leaves-cushy-job-work-subway-article-1.1016930?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports</a> he was at the MTA&apos;s Brooklyn office to be &quot;reinstated as a track workers... [He] filed paperwork and took a physical required of any employee seeking to return after an extended absence, sources said.&quot;  And when told of the news, a TWU official said, &quot;Holy s---.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to the News, &quot;The move further fueled speculation that Toussaint, 55, was plotting to again run for Local 100 president, a position he held from 2001 to 2009.&quot;  Toussaint is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122710/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/toussaint-will-not-seek-re-election/">mortal enemies </a>with current TWU president John Samuelssen, who is in the middle of negotiating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122710/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/report_mta_contract_gives_time_off.php">with the</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122710/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/mtaunion_talks_will_resume_on_thurs.php">MTA for a new contract</a>.  The TWU official said, &quot;The last thing we need is infighting in the local when we&#x2019;re in a difficult contract fight.&quot; Seriously&#x2014;and Samuelssen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122710/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/union_head_transit_strike_remains_o.php">hasn&apos;t ruled out a strike</a>!</p>

<p>On the other hand, a union source suggest to the News &quot;that &quot;Toussaint may be taking the necessary steps to get paid for unused vacation or sick time before retiring with full benefits.&quot;  But here&apos;s how the positions differ: &quot;At TWU International, Toussaint earned $180,000 a year. Perks included a union car, world travel and a subsidized apartment in Washington. A track worker earns up to $29 an hour. The only travel is by subway, between crew rooms and job sites.&quot;</p>
