<p>The sister of the two men who allegedly bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013 was arrested yesterday.</p>

<p>Ailina Tsarnaeva is accused of threatening a New York City resident. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014122/http://nypost.com/2014/08/27/boston-bombers-sister-in-custody-on-reported-bomb-threat/">According to the NY Post</a>, Tsarnaeva &quot;allegedly phoned the woman at her Harlem home on Monday and warned her to keep her distance or face explosive consequences. &apos;Leave us alone. I know people who can put a bomb on you,&apos; Tsarnaeva, 23, allegedly said.&quot; Tsarnaeva&apos;s boyfriend, George Briones, is reportedly &quot;embroiled in a bitter custody dispute with his ex over their three kids.&quot;</p>

<p>The ex called the police, and Tsarnaeva, who lives in North Bergen, NJ, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014122/http://7online.com/news/sister-of-accused-boston-marathon-bombers-arrested/284040/">surrendered at the 30th Precinct yesterday</a> and was charged with aggravated harassment. She was then released.</p>

<p>Authorities say that her brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014122/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/21/officials_believe_boston_bombers_li.php">carried out a plot</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014122/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php#photo-1">bomb the finish line</a> of the Boston Marathon, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014122/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/17/all_three_fatalities_in_boston_bomb.php">killed three people</a> and injured hundreds more.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a firefight with police while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014122/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/20/after_exchanging_gunfire_boston_bom.php">found hiding in a boat</a>.</p>
