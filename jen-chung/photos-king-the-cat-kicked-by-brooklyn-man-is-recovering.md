<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001920/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/07/kicked_cat_found.php">animal rescuers found the cat</a> that was cruelly kicked by a Brooklyn man, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001920/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/cops_arrest_brooklyn_man_for_kickin.php">act that was captured on video</a>. The cat, named King, was treated at the ASPCA&apos;s Bergh Hospital, and now there&apos;s an update.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2014_05_king2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001920im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_05_king2.jpg" width="300" height="200"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> King (ASPCA)</i></div> The ASPCA says: <p></p>

<blockquote>King, a one-year-old male cat who was at the location and matches the appearance of a cat witnessed to have been brutally kicked in a video posted on Facebook on May 5, 2014, was brought to the ASPCA Animal Hospital by the NYPD on May 6, 2014 for emergency veterinary care. He is currently recovering at the ASPCA Animal Hospital and will continue to receive treatment and close monitoring as he heals. 

<p>It is still too soon to discuss a timeline for King&#x2019;s adoptability, but we appreciate the strong public outpouring of interest in this case, and hope it raises awareness of both wanton animal cruelty and the vulnerability of homeless animals. Right now, the best way people can help cats like King is to visit the ASPCA Adoption Center -- or any local shelter -- and meet homeless animals equally deserving of loving families.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The police investigation is ongoing, so the ASPCA cannot give any further information. Andre Robinson, 21, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001920/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/cops_arrest_brooklyn_man_for_kickin.php">arrested and charged with aggravated animal cruelty</a>. He was released without bail. </p>
