The footage shows the gunman firing multiple times; the 37-year-old male victim was shot in the torso and legs.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 1:10 a.m. on August 2, the suspect and victim got into an argument at 1439 Webster Avenue. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015103/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-shot-multiple-times-shooting-rap-video-bronx-article-1.1889779">Daily News reported</a> the pair were filming a rap video at the store, and got into an argument about who was actually the star; the store owner also said they were drunk.</p>

<p>At one point, police say the suspect took out his gun and fired at the victim repeatedly. (Note how he continues to hold his drink.) Then he beats the victim on the head with the gun before fleeing. Others inside the bodega walk by the victim without helping. The victim is in critical condition at Lincoln Hospital. </p>
