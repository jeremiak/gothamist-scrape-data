A Long Island rabbi invited a number of figures to speak at a panel this weekend, but one invitee&#x2014;the Reverend Al Sharpton&#x2014;has various Jewish groups, as well as Rosenbaum&apos;s relatives, up in arms.<p></p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s just an absolute disgrace,&quot; said Norman Rosenbaum, the brother of Yankel Rosenbaum, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202936/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/crown_hts_fury_38tR1JfphLH4X9An8W8VYL">to the Post</a>, adding that Sharpton&apos;s &quot;vile rhetoric incited the rioting.&quot; The Post reminds, &quot;Sharpton was criticized at the time for saying, in a eulogy for Gavin, that he wasn&apos;t killed by a car accident but by &apos;the social accident of apartheid.&apos; He led 400 protesters, chanting &apos;No justice, no peace&apos; despite pleas by then-Mayor David Dinkins for calm.&quot;  But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202936/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/18/2011-08-18_anger_at_sharpton_invitation.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Rabbi Marc Schneier insisted</a>, &quot;It&apos;s an opportunity to have a frank and open exchange, and to clear the air. It is not a discussion about Crown Heights [in 1991]. It&apos;s about the state of black and Jewish relations 20 years later,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202936/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/08/17/family-of-crown-heights-riots-victim-incensed-rev-al-sharpton-was-invited-to-speak-at-panel/">adding</a>, &quot;So the discussion will involve Rev. Sharpton&#x2019;s connection with the Jewish community today.&quot;</p>

<p>Assemblyman Dov Hikind said of Sharpton, &quot;This is not a person who has brought people together. This is a guy who was divisive, racist and has never addressed the issue. He is the last person who should be at this forum.&#x201D;  For his part, Sharpton might skip the whole thing, telling the Daily News, &quot;I may or may not go. I refuse to play into their extremism. If it is not an event that will heal, it is not an event that I will partake in.&quot;</p>
