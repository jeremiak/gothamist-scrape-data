</div></div><p>Yesterday afternoon, Derek Jeter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123600/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/09/derek_jeter_homers_to_become_first.php">hit a home run to mark his 3,000 career hit</a>&#x2014;all of them as a Yankee&#x2014;and the ball was caught in the left field bleachers by Christian Lopez, a 23-year-old upstate NY resident.  Lopez, who is 6&apos;5&quot;, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123600/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/sports/pro/baseball&amp;id=8241577">described the moment</a>, &quot;I was taking a picture, hoping he would hit it, and the next thing I know, it&apos;s in the air and I see my dad diving across a crowd of people. My dad missed it, because he has awful hands. The next thing I know, I just saw the ball roll in front of me and I jumped on it. It was instinct.&quot; Also instinct: His decision to give the ball to Jeter!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123600/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/jeter_blasts_his_way_into_baseball_5g65PCpHZAjqG6PlbCu8XI">Lopez said</a>, &quot;I saw the ball roll in front of me and I jumped on it. I was like &apos;Whoa this it, this is my chance!&apos; I played football ... and I&apos;ve gotten a couple of fumbles and I&apos;ve been at the bottom of the pile a couple of times.&quot; As soon as he emerged with the ball, security whisked him away to meet the Yankees and press.</p>

<p>Experts estimated that the 3,000th run ball could earn six figures, but Lopez said, &quot;Mr. Jeter deserved it.  I&apos;m not going to take it away from him. He&apos;s worked so hard for 15 years or so.&quot;  In exchange for the ball, Lopez is receiving season tickets and other gifts, but he admitted, &quot;My boss actually talked to me today. She said, &apos;You&apos;re going to keep the ball from me? You&apos;re fired.&quot;&apos;</p>

<p>Lopez had received the tickets to the game as a gift from his girlfriend, who bought them for $65 each on Stubhub; he also took his dad and another friend.  His father Raul Lopez said, &quot;When I saw the ball went to him, I covered him. I knew it would be crazy, because I saw the Barry Bonds thing. You know it&apos;s going to be crazy because it&apos;s history.&quot; [Fun fact: The Barry Bonds home run ball <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123600/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/08/mets_fan_catche.php">was caught by a Mets fan</a>!]  </p>

<p>As for Jeter himself, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123600/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/sports/baseball/jeter-relentlessly-consistent-reaches-3000-hits-with-a-home-run.html?ref=sports">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;[This] puts Jeter ahead of the pace set by Pete Rose, the career hits leader, who retired at age 45 with 4,256. Jeter is signed for two more years, with a player option for 2014, but he said Thursday that Rose was not on his radar.  &apos;You have to play another five years and get 200 hits to get that extra thousand,&apos; Jeter said. &apos;You&#x2019;re talking about a long, long time. You never say never, but it&#x2019;s not something that&#x2019;s on my mind.&apos;&quot; </p>
