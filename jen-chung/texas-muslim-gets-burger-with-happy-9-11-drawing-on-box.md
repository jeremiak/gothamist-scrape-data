<p>They say, &quot;Don&apos;t mess with Texas,&quot; but what if a Texas bar serves a Muslim customer a burger with &quot;Happy 9/11&quot; written on a take-out box, complete with a drawing of a plane heading to the Twin Towers on the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks? That&apos;s what happened to customer Tarek G., who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161342/http://www.yelp.com/biz/petrol-station-houston#hrid:jrlTUh6e9XbO5hVFrVGfEA">recounted the experience on the Petrol Station&apos;s Yelp review</a>.  Tarek says that he&apos;s had great food there, but...:<br>
</p><blockquote>I arrived to have a few beers with a friend of mine, and we were happy to see a nice mix of beers on tap.  After the second, we called it quits and I decided to order a burger to go and take home to finish watching the Cowboys game.  When the burger came out, &quot;Happy September 11th&quot; was written on the box, with the &quot;11&quot; being the WTC and a plane flying towards it.  <p></p>

<p>Today is September 11th - and personally I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a nice way to honor the nearly 3,000 people who died that day 10 years ago.  I said as much to the bartender, and asked him to please take the burger away and give me a refund.  He sort of scoffed and proceeded to speak with his manager, and within earshot, called my friend and I &quot;assholes&quot; for complaining about what he clearly thought was funny.  To be fair, the manager came over and provided me with a refund, but no apology or explanation.  A bit stunned, we finished our beers and left it at that.  Before leaving, I asked to get in touch with the owner so that I could voice my concerns - the manager asked me to leave my information, at the same time confessing that the &quot;joke was f&amp;$cked up&quot;.  I did - and explained to him that I wasn&apos;t trying to cause a scene, but that as a person who worked near WTC that day I found it incredibly offensive.  Still no apology or interest in finding out who was behind it.  I left, frustrated that something so simple could not be resolved or even discussed with the very people who should want to understand why it was offensive. </p>

<p>As I walked out, I heard from behind the bar &quot;Allahu Akbar...&quot;  repeated several times.  Now maybe it&apos;s bad luck for them that I happened to be working near WTC and that I also happen to be a muslim (admittedly not the best muslim) - but as an American first and foremost, I find that kind of cavalier attitude offensive at best, and when coupled with the fact that it was coming from a service provider, prejudiced and anti-American at worst.  </p></blockquote>Petrol Station owner Ben Fullelove <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161342/http://houston.eater.com/archives/2011/09/12/petrol-station-employee-fired-after-offensive-september-11th-illustration-causes-negative-yelp-revie.php">told Eater Houston</a> that the employee was fired, &quot;So obviously now, we&apos;re trying to distance ourselves from the employee involved in it, and that&apos;s not how we do business. I talked to the guy [the customer] and that meant more to me than anything else. I understand the damage that gets done to your business, but I have to know for myself that we&apos;re ok with that guy. I got a chance to shake his hand and apologize to him and that means a lot more to me than the damage to my business,&quot; adding, &quot;You can&apos;t control every aspect of your business. An employee made a stupid mistake...well, not even a mistake, he did something really, really retarded and he got fired. You can only spin it so many ways after that.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Tarek updated his Yelp review to say he had forgiven the restaurant, &quot;I was able to speak to the owner and have a good conversation about my experience at Petrol.  He assured me the person(s) responsible will be terminated and the underlying issues will be addressed in short order.  He sounded sincere and I appreciated his swift response once he was notified of the issues by the local community.  For my part, I am looking forward to putting this to rest - I suppose only time will tell if the changes stick.  I&apos;m hopeful they will.&quot;</p>
