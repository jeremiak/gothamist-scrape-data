Residents also chipped in for the rental fee to make sure the kings get to bring the gold, frankincense and myrrh in style.  The Three Kings Day Parade starts at 11 a.m. at 106th Street &amp; Third Avenue; the route goes up Third, across 116th, down Lexington and will ultimately end 115th &amp; Park (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109174315/http://www.elmuseo.org/PDF/ThreeKingsDay_%20RegistrationINFO_09.pdf">PDF with details</a>).</p>
