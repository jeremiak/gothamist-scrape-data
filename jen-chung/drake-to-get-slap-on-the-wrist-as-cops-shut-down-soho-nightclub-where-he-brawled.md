Yesterday, the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/16/drake_may_or_may_not_be_arrested_fo.php">claimed that singer Drake would be arrested</a> for his role in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/15/chris_brown_and_drakes_club_clash_c.php#photo-1">fight with fellow singer Chris Brown</a> at Soho club WiP.  But TMZ disputed that and it turns out they were right: Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/drake_due_for_rap_on_the_wrist_3b1fz9enyCI9B8xmgBdk2K?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Post says</a> that Drake will turn himself in and get a &quot;slap on the wrist&quot;&#x2014;probably a desk appearance ticket for reckless endangerment.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/drake-prepares-show-cops-find-rapper-started-soho-bar-brawl-chris-brown-article-1.1096940?localLinksEnabled=false">The Daily News added</a>, &quot;&apos;You don&#x2019;t make an appointment to get arrested,&apos; the police source told the Daily News. &apos;If we were going to arrest him, we&#x2019;d go out and get him.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>At least five people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/chris_brown_tweets_photo_of_injured.php">were injured in the Thursday morning melee at WiP</a>, which was apparently started when Brown ordered a bottle to be sent to Drake&apos;s table. Then Drake allegedly sent Brown a note saying something along the lines of &quot;I&apos;m f---ing the love of your life,&quot; referring to Rihanna. One witness&#x2014;who was with Brown&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/15/chris_brown_and_drakes_club_clash_c.php">claims that Drake and his group went over to Brown</a>, &quot;They were giving him [Brown] the middle finger. They got into each other&#x2019;s faces and were shouting at each other. Chris told Drake to f--k off, and the next thing I could hear is the sound smashed glass and mayhem started.&quot;  A model who had been with Brown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/my_wild_night_with_chris_B4HwI27Tk8AtkbdaXy6JEI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post that it&apos;s all Drake&apos;s fault</a>, &quot;I think Drake&#x2019;s entourage are cowards for throwing bottles at girls. I&#x2019;ve lost all respect for Drake. Chris Brown acted like a gentleman to all the girls there. Chris tried to protect me and my friend.&quot;</p>

<p>Last night, at his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/drake-prepares-show-cops-find-rapper-started-soho-bar-brawl-chris-brown-article-1.1096940">concert at Jones Beach</a>, Drake said, &quot;<strong>When I woke up this morning, I had to think about a lot of things. But the only thing I gave a f--- about was that I was in New York City tonight.</strong>&quot; Aubrey, go back to Degrassi and take remedial geography!</p>

<p>In the meantime, WiP is getting the NYPD treatment: Its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/15/chris_brown_and_drakes_club_clash_c.php">manager was arrested</a> (for unrelated noise violations, but many expect he was questioned about the fight) and cops shut it down yesterday. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cops_shut_down_drake_chris_brown_HnbDyi8RBreZRddKnhPyDM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">Post has a hilarious photograph of sad clubgoers plus some golden quotes</a>:  One tourist said she and friends were here to celebrate a birthday,&#x201C;This is crap. It ruined her birthday, we&#x2019;re pretty angry,&quot; while another out-of-towner said, &quot;We heard it was a really cool club and thought to come by. We&#x2019;re all dressed up nice for this place and now we have to go to a regular bar.&quot;  Uhh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144923/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/photos_tourist_claims_she_was_hit_b.php">talk to this tourist about going to WiP</a>.</p>
