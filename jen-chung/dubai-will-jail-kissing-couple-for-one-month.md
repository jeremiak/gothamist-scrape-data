According to the AP, &quot;The pair landed in court after an Emirati woman complained about the public kiss, which the couple insisted was just a peck on the cheek. They were arrested in November and convicted of inappropriate behavior and illegal drinking.&quot; The AP adds, &quot;Last month an Indian couple was sentenced to three months in jail for exchanging steamy text messages.&quot;  Keep that in mind, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030231/http://nyuad.nyu.edu/">NYU Abu Dhabi</a> students.</p>
