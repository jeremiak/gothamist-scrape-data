<p><img alt="2008_10_bloomb06.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054119im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_10_bloomb06.jpg" width="250" height="271" class="left">Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054119/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/nyregion/06limits.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">NY Times reports</a> that billionaire Ronald Lauder opposes Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s and the City Council&apos;s plan for legislation to permanently extend term limits from two four-year terms to three four-year terms.  But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054119/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10062008/news/regionalnews/mike__lauder_strike_one_shot_term_deal_132300.htm">NY Post reports</a>\ that Lauder, who help fund the initiatives to introduce term limits in the first place, made a deal with Bloomberg where Lauder would &quot;support legislation...in exchange for a guaranteed seat on a Charter-revision commission.&quot; </p>

<p>Lauder told the Times, &quot;If there is a permanent change, I will fight it.  As far as I am concerned, it&#x2019;s a one-time only exception. That is it.  It took a lot of emotion even to extend term limits this once.  I was opposed to even extending it once.&quot;  And he referred to his somewhat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054119/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/30/term_limits_proponent_blesses_third.php">bombshell announcement that he wanted Bloomberg to come back</a> for another term, in spite of his opposition to extending term limits, &quot;<strong>For the love of this city, I will do it once, but that is it</strong>.&#x201D;  Gee, thanks!  But anyway, it seems that changing term limits for one term only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054119/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2008/10/bloomberg-on-lauders-misunders.html">might not stand up to the legal challenge</a>.</p>

<p>The Post has this Lauder quote: &quot;I believe we can make a once-only exception. If they try to make it a permanent three terms, the voters, by referendum, would have to vote it back to two terms - and I would put my money behind making sure that happens.&quot; And, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054119/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/10/05/2008-10-05_term_limit_deal_ronald_lauder_agrees_to_.html">from the Daily News</a>: &quot;<strong>The voters of New York by a margin of 75% want two terms and nothing more. I want Mayor Bloomberg to have a third term. The city needs him.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Maybe City Councilman John Liu put it best, when he told the Post, &quot;<strong>Obviously, one billionaire is bending over backwards to get another billionaire on board.</strong> Never before have I seen such a vivid exposure of how much control the New York elite still tries to exert.&quot;  And when the Observer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054119/http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/billionaire-mayor-listens-billionaire-citizens-demands">asked political consultant Hank Sheinkopf</a> about the matter, he explained, &#x201C;<strong>Billionaires talk to billionaires in a common language that you and I don&#x2019;t understand.</strong>&quot;</p>
