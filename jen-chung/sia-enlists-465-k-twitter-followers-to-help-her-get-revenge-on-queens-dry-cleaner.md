<p>The Australian singer-songwriter Sia whose best known for the haunting song &quot;Breathe Me&quot; (used in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045207/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNwARV9tPUw">final montage for <em>Six Feet Under</em></a>) had a very bad experience with a dry cleaner. And so, as part of her coping mechanism, she asked her 465,000-some Twitter followers to write bad reviews on the Queens businesses&apos; Yelp page, because when you&apos;re famous, nothing feels better than using your celebrity to get back at a small business.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>BEST SUGGESTION!!

<p>The Yelp page for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045207/http://www.yelp.com/biz/metropolitan-garment-cleaning-jamaica">Metropolitan Garment Cleaning</a>, located in Ozone Park, has six reviews now, all from today and all from people who do not live in New York&#x2014;some don&apos;t even live in the U.S.! While some reviews are clearly jokes (&quot;I was murdered here. Would not recommend&quot;), some are a tad more sensational: &quot;They are the worst people on earth. The &apos;laundry Nazis.&apos; Do yourself a favor and do whatever it takes to AVOID this place! I swear I gave them my clothes to wash (which were white) and they came back to me pink! Not the cute pink the ugly pink.  How people can be so awful at their jobs idk, but they were. I would rather soak my clothes in bleach than send them here. STAY AWAY!!&quot;</p>

<p>We called Metropolitan Garment Cleaning, to inquire if they had any prank calls or angry complaints. An employee told us, &quot;We have a lot of customers. What can you do?&quot;</p>

<p>Asked about the onslaught, Yelp spokeswoman Kayleigh Winslow told us, &quot;Reviews of businesses on Yelp should be about the first-hand customer experience. Non-germane, media-fueled reviews typically violate Yelp&apos;s Content Guidelines and Yelp has policies in place to deal with these events: once brought to our attention, our user operations team will remove reviews determined to violate our Terms of Service <http: www.yelp.com="" static?p="tos"> and Content Guidelines <http: www.yelp.com="" guidelines="">, including reviews that are not based on a first-hand consumer experience.&quot;</http:></http:></p>

<p>As for Sia, the singer has finally found the light:</p>

<p>Now, can she explain that thing she did with Lena Dunham?</p>
