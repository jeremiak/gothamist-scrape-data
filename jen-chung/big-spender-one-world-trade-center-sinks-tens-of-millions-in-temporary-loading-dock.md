<p>On the heels of a report that One World Trade Center is now the world&apos;s most expensive building, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120311074144/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/30/one_world_trade_center_now_the_most.php">costing an estimated $3.8 billion</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120311074144/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/realestate/commercial/it_one_world_class_foul_up_at_wtc_2Snra3p1QYqeqbRrVxw5pO">Post now says a delay with the skyscraper&apos;s underground loading dock</a> &quot;can&#x2019;t be finished in time for [Conde Nast] and other tenants to use the planned 13 cargo bays to move in equipment to build out their space... As a result, the PA is scrambling to construct a temporary, above-ground loading dock with just five bays. The unexpected change in plans will add &apos;tens of millions&apos; of dollars to the cost of building 1 WTC, sources said.&quot; And the temporary PATH station is at fault!</p>

<p>See, the temporary PATH station at the WTC site is blocking the most direct path. And it actually seems like a big clusterfuck:</p><blockquote>The route, starting at the VSC, turns east beneath Liberty Street, then north beneath Greenwich Street &#x2014; and then west through what&#x2019;s now the temporary PATH terminal toward 1 WTC.<p></p>

<p>The temporary PATH station can&#x2019;t be dismantled until the huge, way-behind-schedule Hub is completed &#x2014; which can&#x2019;t happen before 2015.</p>

<p>Even after the temporary train station is taken down, the PA still won&#x2019;t be able to build the underground road from Greenwich Street to 1 WTC until a foundation is installed for the proposed Performing Arts Center, which would stand where the PATH station is now.<br>
Sources said the loading dock problem wasn&#x2019;t recognized until about a year ago. Why it took so long to figure it out was unclear.</p></blockquote>While the Post isn&apos;t sure if the temporary loading dock is part of the $3.8 billion figure, &quot;tens of millions&quot; would be equivalent to 1-2% of the big number.  <p></p>

<p>Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120311074144/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/design_flaw_could_at_new_world.html">told the AP</a>, &quot;Several years there was a design miss. Should it have been caught? The answer is, probably.&quot; Who wants to bet on a price tag over $4 billion?</p>
