<p>The Primary Day polls have closed and early reports suggest what was expected&#x2014;that Public Advocate Bill de Blasio has a sizable lead over nearest rivals City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Comptroller Bill Thompson. </p>

<p>You can watch the votes come in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://project.wnyc.org/election2013/">on this nifty WNYC map</a>, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/nyregion/results-of-new-york-citys-mayoral-primaries.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a> de Blasio &quot;won far more votes than any other candidate in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, according to exit poll results.&quot; Further, the exit polls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://projects.nytimes.com/live-dashboard/nyc-primary#sha=d4c13a2d7">suggest that de Blasio had broad support</a>:</p><blockquote>Men, women, blacks, whites, Hispanics, all age groups, liberals, those with and without a college education, all income categories, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, residents of all boroughs except the Bronx &#x2014; they all chose Mr. de Blasio over his opponents. He shows particular strength among those who call themselves very liberal, among college graduates, and among those who want the next mayor to move the city in a different direction from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</blockquote> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://liveblog.nydailynews.com/Event/Brawl_for_the_Hall_New_York_Primary_Election_Day_Sept_10_2013">Daily News adds</a>, &quot;Bill de Blasio has a large lead over Bill Thompson and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, according to an exit poll by Edison Research. The pollster, who did an exit poll for the Daily News and other outlets said, &apos;It is possible, but not certain that de Blasio could hit the 40% threshold and avoid a runoff.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323595004579065932134242114.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;Early exit poll results in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor showed Public Advocate Bill de Blasio far ahead of his opponents and potentially surpassing the 40% threshold to secure his party&apos;s nomination without a runoff.&quot; The AP&apos;s polling director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/https://twitter.com/PDColford_AP/status/377605893216825344">doesn&apos;t think</a> de Blasio can avoid a runoff. Some exit polls, though, say de Blasio has 43%, Thompson 25% and Quinn 18%.</p>

<p>The mood at de Blasio&apos;s party&#x2014;at the Bell House in Brooklyn&#x2014;is festive (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/https://twitter.com/yoavgonen/status/377590865239101442">there is reportedly a VIP area</a>):</p>

<p>However, things at Quinn&apos;s watch party location are less upbeat. Politicker&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/https://twitter.com/colvinj/status/377604513542447104">Jill Colvin Tweeted</a>, &quot;Quinn Spox acknowledges there may be a sense of &apos;Bloomberg fatigue,&apos; sounding glum.&quot;</p>

<p>It can&apos;t be as tiresome as having Sydney Leathers show up to Anthony Weiner&apos;s party:</p>

<p>The Public Advocate race is down to State Senator Daniel Squadron and City Council Member Letitia James (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/https://twitter.com/NYDNHammond/status/377608542154272768">too close to call</a>) while Scott Stringer<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ex-gov-spitzer-rival-stringer-face-primary-tues"> leads&#x2014;for now&#x2014; former governor</a> Eliot Spitzer in the Comptroller race.</p>

<p><b>Update 10:44 p.m.</b>: Anthony Weiner has conceded (after sneaking through to his party in Midtown via a McDonald&apos;s). &quot;Now sadly we did not win this time, but I could not be more proud of the campaign we ran,&quot; Weiner told supporters. &quot;We had the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.&quot; He thanked his campaign&apos;s staffers, including poor communications director Barbara Morgan (who was bombarded with way too many questions about crotchshots, we&apos;re sure)&#x2014;he referenced Morgan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/weiners_spokeswoman_trashes_ex-inte.php">coining of the term &quot;slutbag&quot;</a> by saying, &quot;She mastered new levels in salty language.&quot;</p>

<p>With 68% of the precincts reporting, de Blasio has 39.3%, Thompson has 26% and Quinn has 15.%.</p>

<p><b>Update 10:55 p.m.</b>: The AP projects that Joe Lhota is the GOP mayoral primary winner. Right now, with 82% of precincts reporting, Lhota has 26,746 votes and 52.1% of the vote while John Catsimatidis has 21,175 votes and 41.2% of the vote.</p>

<p><b>Update 11:42 p.m.</b>: Manhattan Borough President Stringer has won the Comptroller race, with 51.92% of the vote to Spitzer&apos;s 48%. </p>

<p>However, in the mayoral race, de Blasio has been hovering just under the runoff-proof 40%&#x2014;prompting Thompson to wait for all votes to be counted. He told the crowd at his watch party, &quot;For everyone who&apos;s been counted out...tonight is for you!&quot; He added, &quot;We&apos;re gonna win this race!&quot; and &quot;Three more weeks!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update 12:07 a.m.</b>: De Blasio and his family greeted the crowd at the Bell House. The candidate thanked his supporters and team and spoke about offering an &#x201C;unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era&quot; to many cheers. Then they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914171800/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/03/bill_de_blasio.php">did the Smackdown</a>.</p>

<p>With 97% of precincts reporting, de Blasio has 40.2% to Thompson&apos;s 26.1%. Quinn, who had 15.5%, conceded earlier in the evening, &quot;This is was a hard fought race. We took a lot of knocks. We were up against a lot of odds. But I am proud of the race we all ran.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update 12:23 a.m.</b>: Also, there will be a runoff for the Public Advocate Race because James and Squadron both have about 33% of the vote.
