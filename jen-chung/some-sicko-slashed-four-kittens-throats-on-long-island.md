                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_09_kittensli.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102301im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_kittensli.jpg" width="300" height="218" class="image-right"> </span>A horrible discovery was made behind a business in Riverhead, Long Island this week: The bodies of four kittens with slashed throats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102301/http://www.longisland.com/articles/10-04-13/throats-of-four-kittens-slashed-on-long-island.html">were thrown over a fence</a> into the rear yard of an auto repair business. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102301/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/spca-4-kittens-with-throats-slashed-found-in-riverhead-1.6192519">Newsday reports</a> that a worker found them scattered, in small puddles of blood. A co-owner of Riverhead Brake Service told the paper, &quot;He thought it was a couple of rags on the ground. They were so tiny, they didn&apos;t even have a lot of blood in them.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102301/https://suffolkspca.org/">Suffolk County SCPA</a> head Roy Gross believes they were probably left between Monday 5 p.m. and Tuesday 6:30 a.m. &quot;They&apos;re small, little smaller than the size of your hand,&quot; Gross says. &quot;The slaughter of these innocent kittens, when their eyes haven&apos;t even been opened to the world yet, we find this very disturbing.&quot;</p>

<p>The Suffolk County SPCA is offering a $1,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person(s) responsible for the deaths. Anyone with information is asked to call the SPCA at 631-382-7722. All calls will be kept confidential.</p>
