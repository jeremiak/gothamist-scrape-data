The JetBlue terminal was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141502/http://www.1010wins.com/-Grenades--Evacuate-Terminal/3007677">evacuated</a>, only for the grenades to turn out to be World War II grenade replica paperweights.  Next time, mail them!  JetBlue is having an opening ceremony for its new Terminal 5 today.  And yesterday, a Newark Airport terminal was<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141502/http://www.wnbc.com/news/17523910/detail.html?dl=headlineclick"> evacuated after many &quot;false positives&quot;</a> on a suspicious bag, which was eventually deemed safe.</p>
