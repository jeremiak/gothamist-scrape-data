<p>With the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104609/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/ny_auto_show_2013_start_tomorroware.php">NY Auto Show opening</a> today, the NYPD is having its yearly worry that gangs will take part in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104609/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/05/easter_night_violence_in_times_squa.php">violent ritual</a> on Easter Sunday. A &quot;high-ranking cop&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104609/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130329/new-york-city/nypd-plans-flood-times-sq-as-easter-sunday-gang-wilding-feared">told DNAinfo&apos;s Murray Weiss</a>, &quot;The top item on our plate this weekend is the car show. There will be hundreds of extra officers on duty, particularly from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. when the car show lets out.&quot;</p>

<p>Over the years, Easter Sunday has become an unofficial &quot;Gang Initiation Day,&quot; with the Auto Show drawing gang members (and wannabes) to midtown Manhattan. In 2006, 200 gang members <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104609/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/11/gangs_may_be_hunting_for_more_than.php">reportedly flooded Times Square</a>, with three stabbings and, in 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104609/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/05/easter_night_violence_in_times_squa.php">four people were shot</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104609/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/10/bloomberg_wont_stand_for_times_squa.php">2010 violence was so bad</a> that Mayor Bloomberg called it a &quot;wilding.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104609/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-trolling-wilding-plans-easter-article-1.1302226">According to the Daily News</a>, the NYPD is scouring Facebook and other social media for chatter about gang members&apos; possible Times Square plans. DNAinfo adds, &quot;Sources say even executives involved in the [auto] show avoid the Midtown area. Many are forsaking the neighborhood altogether, staying at hotels in Downtown Brooklyn rather than near the Javits or Times Square.&quot;</p>
