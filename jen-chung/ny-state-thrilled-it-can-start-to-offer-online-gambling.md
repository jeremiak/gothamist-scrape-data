<p>Forget the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404173656/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/29/uplifting_photos_of_happy_gamblers.php#photo-1">opening of the new &quot;racino&quot; in Queens</a>: New York State gamblers will soon be able to lose money through the Internet!  The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404173656/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/us/online-gaming-loses-obstacle-at-justice-department.html?hp"> NY Times reports</a> that as part of a Friday news dump, &quot;The Justice Department has reversed its long-held opposition to many forms of Internet gambling, removing a big legal obstacle for states that want to sanction online gambling to help fix their budget deficits.&quot;  <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404173656/http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Hearing-airs-tribes-issues-with-Internet-gambling-2274724.php"></a><br>
See, New York State and Illinois were curious whether they could offer online gaming, and sought clarity on the &quot;Wire Act of 1961, which prohibits wagering over telecommunications systems that cross state or national borders&quot;&#x2014;specifically, whether the act &quot;prevented those states from using the Internet to sell lottery tickets to adults within their own borders.&quot;    The Justice Department decision has now &quot;opened the door for states to allow Internet poker and other forms of online betting that do not involve sports. Many states are interested in online gambling as a way to raise tax revenue.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404173656/http://nylottery.org/wps/portal">New York Lottery</a> director Gordon Medenica told the Times, &quot;We&#x2019;ve been waiting for a couple years. We&#x2019;re thrilled that this ruling has now come down and confirmed that our legal analysis was correct all along,&quot; and that besides adding two more jackpot games, the NY Lottery will &quot;allow New York residents to buy single-draw tickets online for the first time.&quot;  </p>

<p>Plus, as Massachusetts&apos; state treasurer points out, &quot;This will put additional pressure on Congress and others to allow online poker and other Internet gambling,&quot; an issue Native American tribes are weighing in on, too. Merry Christmas, y&apos;all,</p>
