<p>Yesterday, police in Yonkers were called to an awful sight: The bodies of 25-30 dead cats inside plastic bags were hanging from a tree in an empty lot on Overlook Terrace. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000237/http://www.vocativ.com/underworld/crime/30-dead-cats-found-hanging-tree-yonkers/">According to Vocativ</a>, &quot;Their bodies had been stuffed in plastic bags and either hung on the tree itself or scattered around its base, in what appears to be a ritualistic display. The grisly scene was called in by employees from the Department of Public Works, who stumbled across the bags when they arrived to tidy up the lot.&quot;</p>

<p>The lot is apparently a place where people regularly dump empty bottles and other trash. One resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000237/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/2014/04/24/dead-cats-bags-found-hanging-trees-yonkers/8108041/">told the Journal News,</a> &quot;That place is always dirty so when you see a bag there, it&apos;s nothing new... You see rats running out of there. It looks like a race... Sometimes you confuse the rats for the cats.&quot;</p>

<p>In investigation is currently underway. Ernest Lungaro, director of humane law enforcement at the Westchester SPCA, said &quot;Some were severely decomposed. We got a couple that were still fresh, within the last few weeks maybe.&quot; Vocativ reports, &quot;[N]ecropsies performed last night on three feline victims reveal the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, with no evidence of poison. Bats, shovels and other heavy instruments were also found near the corpses.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone with information is asked to call Yonkers police at 914-377-7724 or the SPCA&#x2019;s Animal Cruelty Hotline at 914-941-7797.</p>
