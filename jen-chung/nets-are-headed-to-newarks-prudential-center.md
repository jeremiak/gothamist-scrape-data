The Nets will pay $4 million to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority &#x2014; which could be offset in part by advertising, suite revenues and other credits.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, the Nets are waiting to move to downtown Brooklyn&#x2014;or so they say&#x2014;to the long-promised arena at the Atlantic Yards, whose development had been on hold until an Appeals Courts swept away developer Bruce Ratner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724112309/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/24/appeals_court_clears_way_for_atlant.php">eminent domain worries</a>.  The Nets would be playing in Newark until the downtown Brooklyn arena is ready, and Nets president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724112309/http://www.nba.com/nets/news/Yormark_Statement_Newark_100218.html">Brett Yormark said</a>, &quot;This temporary move not only gives our fans a state-of-the-art arena with the first-class amenities common in most NBA buildings, but also provides our players with a great atmosphere in which to play. <strong>Additionally, before we make our permanent move to Brooklyn, this interim relocation to Newark enables us to continue our goal to further regionalize the team, not only in Essex and Union Counties, but also in New York City due to the direct mass transit access available between Manhattan and the Prudential Center.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The Star-Ledger says the Nets could be playing in Newark as early as this spring.  Legend has it that the Brooklyn arena will open in 2012.</p>
