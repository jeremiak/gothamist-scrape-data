<p>Police have released surveillance video of the man who is wanted for questioning in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030631/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/01/lb_spumoni_gardens_killed.php#photo-6">killing of a beloved Brooklyn pizzeria owner</a>. </p>

<p>Last Thursday, Louis Barbati, 61, was shot outside his Dyker Heights home at 76th Street and 12th Avenue. Police think it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030631/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/02/spumoni_gardens_2.php">may have been a botched robbery</a>, because he was found with $10,000 in cash on him at the time. However, Barbati previously had a high-profile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030631/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/12/you_want_some_mob_war_with_your_lb.php">feud with a former employee</a> he accused of stealing his pizza sauce recipe and allegedly got a Colombo crime family mobster (related to him by marriage) involved.</p>

<p>The video shows a man wearing sunglasses, shorts and a dark hoodie:</p>

<p>Barbati&apos;s family is offering a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030631/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/03/slain-pizzeria-owner-reward/">$50,000 reward for information</a>. His wife was inside the home when Barbati was shot; a relative said that was &quot;still blood under her fingernails from trying to save his life. She thought it was a firework, it&#x2019;s a nightmare.&quot;<br>

A police source told the Post</a>, &quot;They don&#x2019;t know who did it yet. This case will take some time. Someone will talk sooner than later - they always do.&#x201D;</p>
