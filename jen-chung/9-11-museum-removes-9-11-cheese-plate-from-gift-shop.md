<p>Exit through the gift shop: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/22/photo_finally_you_can_buy_a_911_che.php#photo-1">tacky decorative cheese plate</a> in the shape of the U.S., with hearts where the 9/11 attacks occurred, is no longer for sale at the National 9/11 Museum&apos;s gift shop.</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/18/families_offended_by_crass_insensit.php">backlash</a> about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/http://nypost.com/2014/05/18/outrage-over-911-museum-gift-shops-crass-souvenirs/">whether some items were crass</a>&#x2014;like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/https://www.911memorial.org/catalog/darkness-hoodie.html">&quot;Darkness Hoodie&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/http://www.buzzfeed.com/stevekandell/the-worst-day-of-my-life-is-now-new-yorks-hottest-tourist-at">rescue vests for dogs</a>&#x2014;museum officials insisted the items were necessary for revenue. But now they are doing an about-face.</p>

<p>Last week, during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/22/911_museum_censorship.php">our eventful visit</a> to the musuem, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/22/photo_finally_you_can_buy_a_911_che.php#photo-1">noticed the cheese plate</a> (&quot;Never forget...to take your Lactaid&quot;). Now, 9/11 memorial foundation president Joe Daniels <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706105408/http://online.wsj.com/articles/9-11-museum-takes-action-on-criticisms-1401324223">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that victims&apos; families would be consulted about what items are sold, &quot;Once the public starts coming in, you learn so much. We in no way presume to get everything right. We will accept that criticism, absolutely.&quot; He also said visitors wanted a souvenir to remind them of the visit. The WSJ offered some perspective from other museums:</p><blockquote>Gene Caliwag, president of a nonprofit that runs a bookstore at the Pearl Harbor memorial in Hawaii, said the gifts his group sells must meet &quot;the old red-face test: Would we be embarrassed by this thing?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Kari Watkins, executive director of the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum, said the opening of the 9/11 museum was bound to evoke a range of responses.</p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s no way you can please everyone all the time,&quot; she said, adding that the 9/11 museum store was tasteful overall, though the decorative platter did give her pause.</p></blockquote>Also, the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum doesn&apos;t have a cafe.<p></p>
