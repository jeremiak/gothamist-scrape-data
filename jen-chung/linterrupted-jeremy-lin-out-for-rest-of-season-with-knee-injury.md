<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://gothamist.com/tags/linsanity">Linsanity</a> has come to an end, at least for this season: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://gothamist.com/tags/jeremylin">Knicks sensation Jeremy Lin</a> will undergo knee surgery to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-jeremy-lin-weeks-partially-torn-meniscus-surgery-article-1.1053925">repair a partially torn meniscus in his left knee.</a>&quot;  Time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/14/jeremy_lins_toughest_match-up_god_v.php">blame Sports Illustrated</a>, RIGHT?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/sports/basketball/jeremy-lin-to-have-knee-surgery-will-miss-rest-of-regular-season.html?_r=1&amp;hp">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;He will have arthroscopic surgery in the next few days and is expected to miss six weeks, wiping out the rest of the regular season and probably the first round of the playoffs &#x2014; assuming the Knicks qualify... The revelation of Lin&#x2019;s injury came a week after he initially complained of soreness in the knee, in a March 24 victory over Detroit. A magnetic resonance imaging examination, performed Monday, showed what the team called a small, chronic tear &#x2014; meaning the injury had been present for some time.&quot;  What&apos;s worse is that other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/video_hobbled_knicks_talk_beautiful.php">players on the team are hobbled</a>, too.</p>

<p>The undrafted Harvard grad who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/27/knicks_sign_asian-american_guard_an.php">picked up by the Knicks</a> on waivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7759848/jeremy-lin-new-york-knicks-surgery-torn-meniscus">spoke to reporters today</a>, &quot;I can&apos;t really do much. Can&apos;t really cut or jump, so it&apos;s pretty clear that I won&apos;t be able to help the team unless I get this fixed right now. It&apos;s disappointing for me, it&apos;s hard to watch the games and I think I&apos;d want to be out there obviously more than anything right now. But hopefully, it&apos;s a six-week rehab process but I tend to heal fast, so hopefully I can come back as soon as possible and still contribute this season hopefully.&quot; [Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://www.nba.com/video/channels/nba_tv/2012/03/31/20120331_lin_presser.nba">link to video of the press conference</a>.]</p>

<p>He added, &quot;If this was done very early in the year, obviously ... I don&apos;t know where my career would be. I could be, would be definitely without a job and probably fighting for a summer league spot. But having said that, this happening now hurts just as much, because all the players, we really put our heart and souls into the team and into season, and to not be there when it really matters most is hard.&quot;</p>

<p>The 23-year-old will be a free agent this summer; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/lin_to_undergo_knee_surgery_out_OSofWERfErcKzUpsphCJUN">according to the Post</a>, &quot;The Knicks may need to use their full $5M mid-level exception to re-sign him and that would torpedo their chance at Steve Nash. Lin said his first choice is re-signing. He may not have a choice since the Knicks can match another team&#x2019;s offer and teams can&#x2019;t outbid the Knicks because he falls into under the Gilbert Arenas Rule.&quot;</p>

<p>Lin&apos;s unexpected popularity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/last_nights_action_harvards_lin_lea.php">occurred in early February</a> and thirst to see the league&apos;s only Asian-American player helped to the unthinkable: End a Time Warner dispute with Cablevision and get people interested in the Knicks.  Lin just signed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231307/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/20/video_volvos_are_suddenly_linsane.php">an endorsement deal with Volvo</a>.</p>
