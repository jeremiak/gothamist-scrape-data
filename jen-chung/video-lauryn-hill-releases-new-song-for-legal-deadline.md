<p>Lauryn Hill is due<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130508211403/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Lauryn-Hill-Sentence-Tax-Evasion-New-Jersey-206237851.html"> in court today for sentencing in</a> her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130508211403/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/07/the_tax_miseducation_of_lauryn_hill.php">unpaid tax mess</a>. Two weeks ago, she made a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130508211403/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/lauryn_hill_confirms_record_hill_to.php">deal to pay off some of the taxes</a> and to release more music through Sony Music, and last night she released her first song.</p>

<p>Hill, 37, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130508211403/http://mslaurynhill.tumblr.com/post/49613417504/hello-all-here-is-a-link-to-a-piece-that-i-was">posted the song</a>, &quot;Neurotic Society Compulsory Mix,&quot;  on her Tumblr, writing:</p><blockquote>Here is a link to a piece that I was &#x2018;required&#x2019; to release immediately, by virtue of the impending legal deadline. I love being able to reach people directly, but in an ideal scenario, I would not have to rush the release of new music&#x2026; but the message is still there. In light of Wednesday&#x2019;s tragic loss (of former label mate Chris Kelly), I am even more pressed to YELL this to a multitude that may not understand the cost of allowing today&#x2019;s unhealthy paradigms to remain unchecked!</blockquote>Kelly, half of the 1990s one-hit wonder, Kris Kross, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130508211403/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/kris_krosss_chris_kelly_found_has_d.php">died last week</a>.<p></p>

<p>Hill faces up to three years in prison (one year per charge); her lawyer is hoping for probation. The musician <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130508211403/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/09/lauryn_hill_explains_tax_evasion_i.php">has previously claimed</a> she was being &quot;manipulated and controlled by a media protected military industrial complex with a completely different agenda.&quot;</p>
