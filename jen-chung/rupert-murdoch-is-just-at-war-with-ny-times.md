<p>Murdoch, who has been gearing up the Wall Street Journal to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913135816/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/_rupert_murdoch_wants_to.php">compete with the Times</a> with NY coverage, also said, &quot;No, I&apos;m not at war with the world&quot;&#x2014;just the Times, Microsoft and Google (the latter two companies raise the 79-year-old&apos;s ire when it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913135816/http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/newspapers/murdoch_continues_to_rage_against_the_times_the_google_157607.asp?c=rss">comes to posting content</a> from News Corp. owned sites).</p>

<p>He also claimed that Fox News was more balanced than CNN or MSNBC because Fox News has both right- and left-leaning personalities. When asked to name a liberal Fox News voice, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913135816/http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/blogs/yeas-and-nays/Murdoch-tries-to-identify-Dems-at-Fox-News_-fails-90108437.html">he said</a>, &quot;Greta van Susteren is certainly close to the Democratic Party, she just doesn&apos;t cover really political stories, she is just a great journalist who goes after any story she can get.&quot; </p>
