<p>Many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/clinton_won_but_america_lost.php">New Yorkers</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/trump_clinton_election_nightmare.php">have been</a> on edge since November 9th, and hate crimes in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/15/hate_crimes_trumps_amerikkka.php">country</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/nypd_hate_crime_stats.php">NYC</a> have spiked dramatically since Trump&apos;s election. Today, Mayor Bill de Blasio will hold a speech at Cooper Union&apos;s Great Hall to discuss the current climate of worry.</p>

<p>Last week, the mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/de_blasio_trump_stop_and_frisk.php">met with President-elect Donald Trump</a>, and, among other topics, discussed how Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/trump_deport_2_million_people.php">proposed deportations</a> would &quot;create a rift&quot; between police and communities, and &quot;flew in the face of all that is great in New York City, a city of immigrants, a place that has succeeded because it&apos;s been open for everyone and has built generation after generation of immigrants.&quot; De Blasio added that he reiterated to Trump that NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/de_blasio_vows_protection_for_undoc.php">would protect undocumented New Yorkers</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, NY Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022137/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/20/cuomo_inspiring_speech_against_hate.php">promised New Yorkers he would lead New York State</a> to fight for our values and against hate:</p><blockquote> We must stand up and say, &quot;You spread fear and we will spread love.&quot;<br>
We will stand up and say, &quot;You try pull us apart and we will stand stronger for each other.&quot;<br>
We will stand up and say, &quot;Yes we are black, white and brown - but we are one.&quot;<br>
We will stand up and say, &quot;We are gay and straight - but we are one as a community.&quot;<br>
We will stand up and say, &quot;Yes we are Christian, Muslim and Jews - but we are one.&quot;<br>
We will say, &quot;Yes we are individuals but we are also one community. One family.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>
