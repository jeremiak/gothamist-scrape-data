										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2011_05_mcd34.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034454im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_05_mcd34.jpg" width="300" height="217"> <br> <i>Google Street View of the McDonalds on 8th Avenue between West 34th and 35th Streets</i></div> Yesterday, a man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034454/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/06/man_stabbed_at_midtown_mcdonalds.php">stabbed outside</a> the McDonald&apos;s on 8th Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets in midtown Manhattan, and now it turns out the victim was a security guard for the fast food restaurant. Why does a McDonald&apos;s need a guard, when it&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034454/http://gothamist.com/tags/shamrockshake">Shamrock Shake season</a>? Well, some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034454/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/security_guard_gets_mcslashed_Dcl7kokoUu6c8zwnkryHGJ">allege that the location is a haven for drug dealers</a> and their transactions.<p></p>

<p>One customer complained to the Post, &quot;They sell everything in there. It&apos;s a one-stop shop. That&apos;s why they have a security guard.&quot;  The Post says the guard came between two men having an argument outside the restaurant, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034454/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/06/2011-05-06_mcdonalds_security_guard_stabbed_in_midtown_bloody_brawl_spills_onto_sidewalk.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Dozens of onlookers watched in horror - others took pictures with their cell phones - as the guard tried to fight off his attacker.&quot; The guard apparently used his cane to fight off the attacker, even after he was thrown to the ground, but the attacker managed to stab him twice.</p>

<p>Another customer told the News, &quot;(The security guard) always has problems with people wanting to come in and go to the bathroom to do drugs, so he has to say no a lot. He probably just said no to someone and it went wrong after that.&quot;</p>
