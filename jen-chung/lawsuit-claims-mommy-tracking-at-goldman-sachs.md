										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_babyboom.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134154im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_babyboom.jpg" width="200" height="275" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, a former Goldman Sachs vice president sued the firm for scuttling her to the &quot;mommy track&quot; when she was pregnant.  Charlotte Hanna&apos;s lawyer wrote, &quot;When Ms. Hanna decided to take the &#x2018;off-ramp&#x2019; provided by the firm to devote time to her children, there was no &#x2018;on-ramp&#x2019; that enabled her to return to full-time employment. The &#x2018;off-ramp&#x2019; was a direct path to a mommy-track that ultimately derailed Ms. Hanna&#x2019;s career.&quot;</p>

<p>Hanna worked part-time after having her first child (Goldman has a program allowing new mothers to do that), but then things went south, she claims.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134154/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2417890320100324">According to Reuters</a>, &quot;Hanna, a Manhattan resident, alleged that after her 2005 return from her first maternity leave, Goldman demoted her and made her feel unwelcome in what had become a &apos;boys-only&apos; club.&quot; Then, in February of last year, she says she was fired a week before returning from her second maternity leave.</p>

<p>Her lawsuit, which claims Goldman violated the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134154/http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm">U.S. Family Medical Leave Act</a>, allows contends that 75% of the women in her group who were terminated had taken maternity leave; her lawyer also wrote, &quot;Goldman Sachs views working mothers as second-class citizens.&quot;</p>
