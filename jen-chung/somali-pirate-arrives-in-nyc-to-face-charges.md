The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083416/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/04/20/2009-04-20_somali_pirate_arrives_in_ny_for_trial.html">Daily News reports</a> that he &quot;look[ed] young, gaunt and clueless about the federal charges he faces&quot;&#x2014;he will be arraigned this morning in federal court.  <p></p>

<p>Wal-i-Musi was one of four pirates who tried to hijack the Maersk Alabama in the Horn of Africa.  The ship&apos;s crew members were able to take back the ship, but the pirates, armed with machine guns, took Captain Richard Phillips <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083416/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/11/us_container_ship_captain_remains_p.php">as a hostage</a>.  Shortly Wal-i-Musi agreed to be taken to a Naval destroyer monitoring the pirates&apos; boat, Navy Seals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083416/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/pirates_vow_no_mercy_on_future_amer.php">killed the remaining pirates and rescued Phillips</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083416/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04212009/news/regionalnews/its_jolly_roger__165490.htm">According to the Post</a> (which calls him the &quot;JOLLY ROGER&quot; because he smiled at one point for photographers, sources say that the &quot;kidnapping and other charges [he faces carry] a maximum of life in prison.&quot; </p>

<p>Musi&apos;s mother Adar Abdirahman Hassan, who says her son is only 16 though investigators say he is 18, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083416/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/04/21/nyregion/AP-US-Piracy-Suspect.html?hp">told the AP</a> that her son was drawn to piracy by &quot;gangsters with money&quot; and asked President Obama for help, &quot;<strong>I appeal to President Obama to pardon my teenager; I request him to release my son or at least allow me to see him and be with him during the trial.</strong>&quot;  The director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083416/http://somalijusticeadvocacy.org/">Somali Justice Advocacy Center</a> said the pirate&apos;s family had asked for help; Omar Jamal said, &quot;What we have is a confused teenager, overnight thrown into the highest level of the criminal justice system in the United States out of a country where there&apos;s no law at all.&quot;</p>

<p>A Chicago lawyer (and Brooklyn Law grad) Michael Passman told the Daily News that it&apos;s been 100 years since the last piracy trial, adding Wal-i-Musi may have difficulties finding a lawyer, &quot;Anyone who ever defended one of these cases has been dead for 100 years.&quot;</p>
