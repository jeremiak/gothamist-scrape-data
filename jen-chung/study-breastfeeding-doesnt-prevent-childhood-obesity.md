<p>More and more women are being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://gothamist.com/tags/breastfeeding">encouraged to breastfeed</a> after giving birth, from local, state and federal governments to the American Academy of Pediatrics promoting benefits like the nutritional properties and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/why-breastfeeding-is-important/index.html">sheer convenience</a>. But one oft-mentioned upside&#x2014;that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/AAP-Reaffirms-Breastfeeding-Guidelines.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token">childhood obesity risk can  be lowered</a>&#x2014;is now being questioned in a new study.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/breastfeeding_does_not_reduce.html#incart_river_default">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;Researchers looked at nearly 14,000 healthy infants in Belarus, and concluded that improving the exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding did not result in a lower risk of obesity among the children at age 11.5 years.&quot; The new study, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1667089">in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a>, says, &quot;Breastfeeding has many advantages but population strategies to increase the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding are unlikely to curb the obesity epidemic.&quot; </p>

<p>The study does add, &quot;Although breast-feeding is unlikely to stem the current obesity epidemic, its other advantages are amply sufficient to justify continued public health efforts to promote, protect and support it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://www.womenshealth.gov/news/HealthDay/EN/2013/Mar/12/674347.html">HealthDay News reports</a> that Montefiore Medical Center&apos;s Dr. Deborah Campbell, director of the division of neonatology, doesn&apos;t think these findings can be translated to the U.S.&apos;s population, because Belarus has more homogenous ethnic and racial background: &quot;They also have universal health care, and a population with higher education levels than the United States. These differences make it difficult to translate these findings to a U.S. population, she said.&quot;  She also added that there was some overlap with the different groups in the study and that diet and physical activity levels of the children obviously play a role in children&apos;s obesity levels. </p>

<p>So: Breastfeed your babies if you can, since it&apos;s great for them and can be for you as well. But if you can&apos;t breastfeed them, don&apos;t feel bad&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/05/male_doctor_stands_up_for_breastfee.php">you&apos;re not alone</a>. Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161548/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/soda_ban_begins_tomorrow_with_poten.php">don&apos;t drink sodas over 16 ounces</a>.</p>
