<p>Police say a man wearing a Santa hat forcibly touched two women at a Manhattan subway station last month.</p>

<p>The incidents occurred at the 23rd Street R/W station in the Flatiron District, between 7 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., on February 8th. According to the NYPD, the suspect first approached a 32-year-old woman who was on the platform and &quot;grabbed her buttocks.&quot; </p>

<p>She exited the station, and then the man allegedly stuck around and grabbed the buttocks of a 34-year-old woman on the stairs that lead to the street level. The second victim also left the station.</p>

<p>The groper eventually left the station, walking west on West 22nd Street. Investigators, who say both victims reported the incidents separately at later times, released images of the suspect (photos above).<br>
