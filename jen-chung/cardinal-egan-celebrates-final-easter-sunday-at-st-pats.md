<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_cardegan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163327im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_cardegan.jpg" width="230" height="285" class="image-left"> </span>Edward Cardinal Egan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163327/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04132009/news/regionalnews/egan_saviors_the_moment_164169.htm">told worshippers at St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral yesterday</a>, &quot;We are here for a passing moment of eternity.&quot; The 77-year-old was discussing the world&apos;s problems during his final Easter Sunday mass as head of the New York Archdiocese, &quot;Life can appear unfair and pointless, but Easter gives meaning to the reality of life.&quot;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163327/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-nyegan0413,0,6410839.story">standing room-only crowd of 2,700</a> was on hand to hear Egan, who, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163327/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/nyregion/13egan.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times noticed</a>, &quot;made sure to acknowledge the large number of Hispanics who have joined the archdiocese, which serves parts of New York and the northern suburbs.&quot;  The Times added that Egan, who had been hospitalized for a gastrointestinal virus last week and was told he needed a pacemaker, &quot;<strong>looked healthy, especially for a 77-year-old man with an ailing heart.</strong> His cheeks were rosy and his stride noticeably firm, though occasionally he held onto the lectern, as if to support himself.&quot;</p>

<p>Egan will retire in days as Archbishop Timothy Dolan will be installed as his successor on Wednesday.  Dolan arrived in New York last night, but not before giving his final mass to Roman Catholics in Milwaukee.  One parishioner there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163327/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/04/12/2009-04-12_egan_and_dolan_in_holiday_farewells.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;New York is so lucky to get him. He&apos;s very warm; he&apos;s sincere; he means everything he says, and you will feel that.&quot;  And Egan, who will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163327/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04122009/news/regionalnews/egans_french_bliss_164037.htm">tend to a small mission in Midtown</a> during his retirement, assured reporters, &quot;You&apos;re going to like [Dolan] very much. He&apos;s going to talk to you much more than I do.&quot;</p>
