<p>Andrew Madoff, the surviving son of Ponzi mastermind Bernard Madoff, died at age 48. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013943/http://www.cnbc.com/id/101937292">According to CNBC</a>, he passed away this morning from lymphoma.</p>

<p>His brother, Mark Madoff, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013943/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/11/bernard_madoffs_son_mark_found_dead.php">killed himself in his Soho apartment in 2010</a>, over the enduring trouble from their father&apos;s scandal. While Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty to his multi-billion-dollar scam and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013943/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/29/bernard_madoff_sentenced.php">is currently serving a 150-year sentence</a>, Andrew and Mark Madoff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013943/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/16/madoffs_sons_hey_were_victims_too.php">insisted they were victims also</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013943/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/finally_madoffs_sons_brother_niece.php">though they allegedly benefitted</a>&#x2014;Mark to the tune of $67 million and Andrew with $60 million.</p>

<p>In 2011, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013943/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/bernard_madoffs_wife_son_continue_t.php">to promote a book about their family</a>, Andrew Madoff and mother Ruth Madoff appeared on the Today Show and 60 Minutes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013943/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/bernard_madoffs_wife_son_continue_t.php">to proclaim their ignorance</a>. He told Matt Lauer, &quot;From the beginning we have not really been able to speak. We were so vilified by the tabloids,&quot; but also admitted, &quot;I completely understand the way people feel.&quot;</p>
