<p>The announcement that golf superstar Tiger Woods will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165237/http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=4921899">speaking publicly for the first time</a> tomorrow since his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165237/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/28/report_wife_scratched_tiger_woods_f.php">car accident</a>-turned-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165237/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/02/tiger_woods_admits_transgression_le.php">extra marital affair-scandal</a> has sent the media into a new frenzy. Woods&apos; agent Mark Steinberg said, &quot;While Tiger feels that what happened is fundamentally a matter between him and his wife, he also recognizes that he has hurt and let down a lot of other people who were close to him. He also let down his fans. He wants to begin the process of making amends, and that&apos;s what he&apos;s going to discuss.&quot;</p>

<p>However, two groups he is upsetting:  PR flacks and journalists!  Because Woods won&apos;t be taking questions and is only allowing a select group of reporters to the first stop of his forgiveness tour, they are furious. Ketchum PR executive Nick Ragone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165237/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/arrogant_move_catches_flack_flak_fOXxyxm6x19csJA4tBvQDM">tells the Post</a>, &quot;This is a sham, through and through. The fact that he isn&apos;t allowing questions and is positioning his friends and handpicked reporters as props is the height of arrogance... At some point, he&apos;s going to have to speak to the media -- he can&apos;t hide behind this fa&#xE7;ade. He&apos;s got to do the real thing. At some point, he&apos;ll be shamed into doing a true mea culpa.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165237/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/02/18/2010-02-18_its_about_saving_his_image_not_answering_questions.html">Daily News&apos; Mike Lupica agrees and writes</a>, &quot;If speaking this way is the best Woods can do, he should skip us and go directly to the golf course.</p>

<p>It did not go without notice that Woods&apos; 11 a.m. press conference is timed, as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165237/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/sports/golf/18tiger.html?ref=sports">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;during the third round of the $8.5-million match-play tournament sponsored by the first company to disassociate itself from&quot; Woods&#x2014; Accenture (one golfer, upon hearing the news, &quot;curs[ed] loudly&quot;). And Radar reports that Woods will indeed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165237/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/02/tiger-woods-set-return-golf">&quot;ease&quot; back onto the PGA tour</a>.</p>
