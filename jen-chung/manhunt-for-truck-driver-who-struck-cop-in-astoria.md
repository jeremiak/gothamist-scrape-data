<p>A police officer was hit by a truck driver who then fled a Queens intersection last night. And it all started over the report of a stolen pocketbook.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, a 49-year-old woman reported that a man in his 60s had robbed her, dragging her as he took her pocket book. The man had been driving a black Ford pickup, which was apparently stolen in Florida. </p>

<p>Just before 9 p.m., police, in a marked police car, noticed a truck matching the description of the vehicle in the robbery at Broadway and Crescent Street. Officers pulled over the truck, but the driver struck one of them and then drove off. Some reports suggest the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006151619/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9216035">police fired</a> shots at the truck, though the NYPD DCPI says that&apos;s undetermined at this time.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006151619/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/22/cop-hospitalized-after-being-struck-by-truck-in-queens-intersection/">witness said the injured police officer</a> seemed &quot;pretty hurt but he looked pretty conscious to me. It was like four officers to keep him calm because he was laying down and then they put him in the ambulance.&quot;</p>

<p>Police searched for the suspect, with no luck (the Queensboro Bridge was even temporarily shut down). The truck was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006151619/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/22/cop-hospitalized-after-being-struck-by-truck-in-queens-intersection/">found abandoned</a> at 37th Ave and 24th Street, and it seems the driver fled on foot. According to WABC 7, &quot;The suspect is described as a white male, about 225 pounds between 50 and 60 years old. He has a heavy build, was wearing glasses and had short, cropped hair.&quot;</p>
