<p>A man biking in midtown Manhattan was seriously injured when a hit-and-run truck driver struck him this morning.</p>

<p>Police confirmed that the cyclist was biking near West 40th Street and 8th Avenue when a garbage truck driver hit him around 4:30 a.m. The cyclist was taken to Bellevue Hospital and is expected to survive, but an NYPD spokesperson said this morning he would &quot;probably lose a leg.&quot;</p>

<p>The cyclist had reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111209/http://abc7ny.com/news/bicyclists-leg-injured-in-midtown-hit-and-run/1523469/">been biking south</a> on 8th Avenue, while the driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111209/http://nypost.com/2016/09/23/cyclist-might-need-leg-amputation-after-hit-and-run/">kept going east</a> on West 40th Street.</p>
