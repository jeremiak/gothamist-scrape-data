The Transit Workers Union, which is planning a mass protest today, says that 202 workers are turning in their IDs today (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122837/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7608125">WABC 7 reports</a> 194 are station agents).  The MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122837/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/03/mta_lays_off_500_station_agents.php">issued the layoff</a>s to deal with its huge deficit.  TWU president John Samuelson told NY1, &quot;Our members that lost their health insurance, we just came up with a plan within ourselves and we all kicked in $10 a pay period just to keep our 3,500 members that are laid off with health insurance all right. It shows you the fortitude of our membership and it was done in a very quick motion.&quot;</p>
