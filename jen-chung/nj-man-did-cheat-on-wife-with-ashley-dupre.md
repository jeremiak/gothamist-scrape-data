										<p><img alt="2008_07_dupreearle.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045957im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_07_dupreearle.jpg" width="254" height="224" class="left">The married NJ asphalt company executive admitted to the NY Post that he did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045957/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07262008/news/regionalnews/ho_broken__shamed_nj_big_fesses_to_krist_121652.htm">have an extramarital tryst with Spitzer hooker</a> Ashley Dupre earlier this week.  Thomas &quot;TJ&quot; Earle said, via a lawyer, &quot;I&apos;m very ashamed.&quot;</p>

<p>Earle was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045957/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/24/ashely_dupre_returns_to_nycwith_mar.php">noticed at the Gramercy Park Hotel</a> with Dupre on Tuesday, thanks to paparazzi hoping for a glimpse of the hotel&apos;s celebrity guest, Lindsay Lohan.  Though some speculated Earle told his wife that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045957/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07252008/news/regionalnews/wife_trusts_kristen_pal_121451.htm">he was set up</a>, his lawyer told the Post, &quot;TJ has accepted full responsibility - he&apos;s not blaming anyone else...TJ never said he was set up. <strong>He does not feel used by Ashley one bit</strong>.&quot; Well, it is pretty passive-aggressive to go to a celebrity-magnet hotel with an infamous hooker.</p>

<p>What makes things a little worse is the fact that Earle apparently celebrates his anniversary with his wife at the same hotel each year.  His lawyer added his client is &quot;very, very sorry for what happened, and he&apos;s trying to work through this privately.&quot;  Of course, that means the Post is examining whether Alisa Earle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045957/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07262008/news/regionalnews/alisa__ashleys_tank_warfare_121658.htm">is copying Dupre&apos;s style</a>.  The tabloid noted Mrs. Earle &quot;[proved] she could easily compete with Dupre&apos;s hooker-high platforms&quot; by &quot;[wearing - and drawing] attention to her long, tanned legs - with a pair of sexy, 3-inch-high, open-toed sandals.&quot;</p>
