The driver allegedly stepped on the gas when police approached, and the woman jumped out of the van, authorities said.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the police were pursuing the vehicle because it was allegedly operating as an illegal cab. The van continued on for two miles and then crashed near the Van Wyck.
