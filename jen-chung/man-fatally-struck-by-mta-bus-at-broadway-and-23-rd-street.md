<p>Late last night just before 11:44 p.m., a pedestrian was struck by a MTA bus on East 23 Street, between Broadway and Madison Avenue.  Police say that the victim, 21-year-old Amos Velez, was unresponsive and unconscious; when EMS arrived, they pronounced him dead.  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405153030/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bus_kills_batali_worker_QVOKpfjiMz7azazVyDbJ4L?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">Post reports that Velez was a busboy</a> at Eataly, located at Fifth and 23rd street.</p>

<p>It seems that Velez was in the middle of 23rd Street crossing from the north side to the south side when the X27 bus hit him.  A witness told the Post, &quot;He didn&#x2019;t even stand a chance.&quot; The Post adds, &quot;The victim was headed to a nearby bar to meet up with friends after they finished working. A sobbing woman on the scene was wailing, &apos;I can&#x2019;t believe it, he&#x2019;s gone, he&#x2019;s gone.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>No criminality is suspected.</p>
