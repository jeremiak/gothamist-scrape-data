</div></div>					<p>Veto-palooza is over&#x2014;for now.  Yesterday, Governor David Paterson completed his marathon of vetoing 6,709 line items that the Assembly and Senate added to his budget.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165817/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/02/top_five_infuriating_comments_made.php">madness began on Thursday</a>, with Paterson offering his initials to veto over 4,000 porky items; yesterday&apos;s session was at the Governor&apos;s Mansion, with Paterson knocking out about 2,000 items. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165817/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/07/just-in-time-for-the-long-week.html">According to the Daily Politics</a>, &quot;That&apos;s more than $500 million in additional spending he slashed as well as nearly $200 milliion more in member items approved in previous years but still not paid by the state.&quot;</p>

<p>But there may be more vetos on the way, because the Legislature loves to submit last minute bills.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165817/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gov_keeps_pen_poised_for_even_more_hxbqdbFeufEEwTbj2xpkIM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a>, &quot;The Legislature typically passes a flurry of special-interest-backed bills in the last days of the legislative calendar, when late-night sessions and the sheer volume of activity allow many measures to fly under the radar. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan), for instance, passed 607 bills between June 1 and July 1, compared to 1,196 for the entire year.&quot; </p>

<p>And for fun, here&apos;s video of Assemblyman Jose Rivera (D-Bronx) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165817/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/02/top_five_infuriating_comments_made.php">referring to E.T. and how he wants to go home</a> (that part is around 2:25):</p>
