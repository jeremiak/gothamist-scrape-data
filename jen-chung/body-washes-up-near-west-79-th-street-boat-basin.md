<p>Just north of children playing in Little League games and diners at the popular Boat Basin Cafe, a body washed up near the north dock of the boat basin at West 79th Street around 1 p.m.  The police blocked off the path by the Hudson River, creating a logjam of bicyclists, joggers, and walkers.  Some commented that there seemed to be a lot of jumpers, lately, referring to the two George Washington Bridge suicides&#x2014;NJ chef/reality show participant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160309/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/27/hudson_river_doa_floater_idd_as_rea.php">Joseph Cerniglia</a> and Rutgers University student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160309/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/rutgers_students_appalled_over_vide.php">Tyler Clementi</a>.  </p>

<p>The police tell us the body was a white male, age 56. One man, a sailboat owner who wasn&apos;t allowed onto the pier due to the investigation, told us that he was concerned the body could be someone from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160309/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/nyregion/19boat.html">marina community</a>.  </p>

<p>Dead bodies that rise to the surface in water&#x2014;referred to as &quot;floaters&quot;&#x2014;apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160309/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/nyregion/24floaters.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">tend to appear</a> more in springtime, &quot;In the winter... the cold water temperature slows the decomposition of a body. As the temperature rises in the spring, decomposition speeds up, producing gases that make the body buoyant and bring it to the surface.&quot;</p>
