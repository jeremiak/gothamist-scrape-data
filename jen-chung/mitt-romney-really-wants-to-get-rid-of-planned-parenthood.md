<p>As Mitt Romney is raising money at the Walfdof-Astoria today (don&apos;t worry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200603/http://www.politicker.com/2012/03/14/occupy-wall-street-protests-mitt-romney-at-the-waldorf-astoria/">there are Occupy Wall Street protesters on the scene!</a>), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200603/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/dems-hit-romney-on-planned-parenthood-funding/">Democrats are trying to raise money</a> off his remarks to a St. Louis TV station where he said, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200603/http://gothamist.com/tags/plannedparenthood">Planned Parenthood</a>, we&apos;re gonna get rid of that.&quot;</p>

<p>Romney was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200603/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/13/when-romney-says-get-rid-of-planned-parenthood-he-means/">discussing how he would reduce the deficit</a>, &quot;You get rid of Obamacare, but there are others. Planned Parenthood, we&apos;re gonna get rid of that. The subsidy for Amtrak, I would eliminate that. The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, both excellent programs, but we can&apos;t afford to borrow money to pay for these things.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200603/http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/why-wont-big-oil-subsidies-die.html">Big oil subsidies</a>, though, are probably worth it!</p>

<p>The Romney campaign senior advisor Eric Fehrnstorm said, &quot;He singled out some areas of the budget he would eliminate or curtail, all in the name of achieving a balanced budget,&quot; but deputy Obama campaign manager Stephanie Cutter said, &#x201C;Mitt Romney&#x2019;s comments today that he would &#x2018;get rid of&#x2019; Planned Parenthood show how low he is willing to go to pander to the most extreme elements of the Republican base. Planned Parenthood is a vital health care provider for millions of American women, giving them affordable access to life-saving services like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings.&quot;</p>
