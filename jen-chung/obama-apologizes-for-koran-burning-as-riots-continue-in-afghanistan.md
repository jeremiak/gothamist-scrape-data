<p>Violence continued in Afghanistan over outrage that NATO forces had &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224164036/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/world/asia/nato-commander-apologizes-for-koran-disposal-in-afghanistan.html">burned undisclosed number of Korans</a>.&quot;  While NATO commanding general John Allen apologized earlier this week, today two American soldiers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224164036/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/nato-troops-killed-afghanistan-koran-burning-violence-article-1.1027388">were killed by an Afghan man upset by the burning</a>.  Now, President Obama has apologized to Afghan President Harmid Karzai, expressing &quot;deep regret&quot; and noting, &quot;The error was inadvertent.&quot;</p>

<p>In Laghman province, over 600 people marched into the provincial capital of Mihtarlam chanting &quot;Death to America&quot;.</p>

<p>Afghan sources said the protests in Laghman had turned violent and had been growing since the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>A police official speaking to the AFP news agency said thousands of protesters besieged the headquarters of a provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in the provincial capital.</p>

<p>&quot;People had come from all over Laghman. They attacked the PRT, they climbed up the walls, they set fire to something there, I think a container,&quot; the police official said.<br>
