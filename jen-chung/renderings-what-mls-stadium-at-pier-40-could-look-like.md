</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/1jicmd/leaked_renderings_of_the_proposed_mls_stadium_on/">uploaded renderings</a> of a proposed MLS stadium at Pier 40 on Manhattan&apos;s west side to Reddit. But what does it mean? Does it mean moneybags new team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/major_league_soccer_makes_it_offici.php">NYC FC</a>, is looking for a new home in Manhattan? </p>

<p>Our Dan Dickinson reached out for comment from Dan Courtemanche, MLS EVP of Communications, who confirmed, &quot;This rendering was a conceptual design that Major League Soccer produced when considering Pier 40 as a potential soccer stadium.&quot; Now, the question is when &quot;when&quot; was&#x2014;last year? Last week? There has been community uproar about a MLS stadium in Flushing, Queens (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/major-league-soccer-won-coming-queens-pol-article-1.1394221">plan seems dead</a>) and there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/bronx_bp_diaz_lobbies_for_nyc_fc_st.php">support from the Bronx Borough President</a> to put one in his borough. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/explore-the-park/locations/pier-40">Pier 40</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://thevillager.com/2012/08/09/pier-40-sinking-the-park-faces-closure-trust-warns/">crumbling pier</a> at Houston and the Hudson River, needs about $200 million in repairs. A new stadium would costs hundreds of millions more. </p>

<p>While some Redditors were excited (&quot;Geez. I got quite the shiver down my spine just thinking about it. Seriously needs to happen&quot; and &quot;This would be the most impressive stadium for MLS or any other sports in US history. Nothing can top this location&quot;), others weren&apos;t very impressed with the stadium&apos;s design: One Redditor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://reddit.com/user/drballoonknot">drballoonknot</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214308/http://i.imgur.com/JN8zfKc.jpg">compared it to a toilet seat</a>.</p>
