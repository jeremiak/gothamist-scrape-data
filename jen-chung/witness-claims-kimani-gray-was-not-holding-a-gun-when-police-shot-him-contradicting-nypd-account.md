<p>As protesters continue to condemn the fatal police shooting of a Brooklyn teen, one witness has come forward to say that cops did not seem justified in killing 16-year-old Kimani Gray. Tishana King<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/witness-claims-16-year-old-killed-cops-hands-article-1.1286981"> told the Daily News that she witnessed the confrontation</a> from her third-story window in a neighboring building, and she tells the tabloid, &quot;I&#x2019;m certain he didn&#x2019;t have anything in his hands.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/cops_fatally_shoot_16-year-old_gunm.php">Police said</a> that on Saturday night, at around 11:30 p.m., two Brooklyn South Anti Crime plainclothes officers had been on patrol when they noticed young males near 473 East 52nd Street. According to the NYPD&apos;s statement, the cops noticed one &quot;break away from the group upon noticing the police. The male... adjusted his waistband and continued to act in a suspicious manner. The officers exited their unmarked auto and attempted to engage the suspect, who turned on them, and pointed a .38 caliber revolver at the officers. Both officers fired at the suspect, striking him about the body.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/brooklyn_violence_during_protest_bl.php">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly had emphasized</a>, &quot;We have three [civilian] witnesses, two of which said that one of the officers shouted &apos;Don&apos;t move&apos; and &apos;Freeze.&apos; Two witnesses also said they heard officers say, &apos;What do you have in your hands?&apos;&quot; However, King, a medical records clerk at Kings County Hospital, said that after the shooting, one of the cops put his hands on his head and said, &quot;Oh, God!&quot; She told the News, &quot;His partner went over to him and put his hand on his shoulder and said, &apos;Are you okay, buddy?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_02_kimangray.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_02_kimangray.jpg" width="239" height="262" class="image-right"> </span>During her interview with the police hours after the shooting, the News reports that she &quot;never said a word about whether Gray was carrying a gun.&quot; The News listened to the NYPD&apos;s taped interview with King and reports that &quot;detectives and Internal Affairs Bureau investigators never asked directly if King saw Gray with a gun, and a police source said NYPD policy precludes asking such leading questions.&quot; Their source explained, &quot;They&#x2019;re just asked to say what happened in as much detail as they can remember.&quot; </p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/witness-claims-16-year-old-killed-cops-hands-article-1.1286981">King tells the News</a> that when she saw the cops get out of their car, &quot;Kimani started backing up. The cop took out his gun and started firing at Kimani.&quot; She noted that she was able to see clearly because of the streetlamp (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/witness-claims-16-year-old-killed-cops-hands-article-1.1286981">see photo of her perspective</a>), &quot;His (Gray&#x2019;s) hands were down. I couldn&#x2019;t believe he let off (fired) his gun. There was no reason. No false move.&quot; However, the News&apos; police source says King never said anything about the teen backing up with his hands.</p>

<p>The NYPD hasn&apos;t identified the police officers involved in the shooting&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/riot_wary_flatbush_turns_into_ghost_fEmHgOn4KGGlEXSEpJGHaK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">the Post reports</a>, &quot;It emerged that the two cops who fired at Gray, who was black, are both minorities. One, a sergeant is a dark-skinned Egyptian who identifies himself as black. He fired four times. The other, a Hispanic officer, fired seven times.&quot; (It&apos;s unclear how many times the teen was hit.)  </p>

<p>A Monday night vigil to remember Kimani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/dozens_riot_over_nypds_fatal_shooti.php">turned violent</a> when a &quot;splinter group&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/brooklyn_violence_during_protest_bl.php">separated and trashed stores</a> and beat up people. A vigil last night was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130312/east-flatbush/second-vigil-for-kimani-gray-postponed-after-night-of-violence#.UT_xNmdouuo.twitter">largely peaceful</a>, though perhaps that was because there were many police officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164424/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9023785">in riot gear as well as mounted cops</a>. </p>

<p>A source tells the Post that a &quot;Bloods offshoot, the Outlaws, ordered a hit on any city cop in retaliation for Gray&#x2019;s death.&quot; It&apos;s believed that Kimani, who had an arrest history, was a member of the Bloods. The source said, &quot;They [police] have intelligence that they [the gang members] put a hit out on a cop. They want a life for a life.&quot;</p>
