Here, the defendant sought to use fear and intimidation to obtain business, rather than honest competition. Such efforts will always be met with the full force of the law.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Federal prosecutors said that Frank DiMattina (aka &quot;Frankie D&quot; and &quot;Frankie Ariana&quot;)  forced a rival caterer, Walter Bowers, to withdraw his bid from a lucrative school lunch program at  St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School.  DiMattina allegedly showed a gun and said he would have Bowers beaten up. According to the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office, &quot;As part of the threat, DiMattina also told the victim to warn his business partner, a bagel store owner, that DiMattina would &apos;burn down his bagel stores&apos; if the victim and his partner did not withdraw their bid.&quot; </p>

<p>DiMattina&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619172255/http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2012/01/staten_island_caterer_frank_di_1.html">told the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;We&#x2019;re very upset for his family, his wife and three children. He does intend to appeal the verdict, but Judge [Jack B.] Weinstein gave him a very, very fair trial.&quot;  DiMattina was allowed free on $2 million bail (so his existing employees aren&apos;t out of a job) but he faces up to 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619172255/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/caterer-mob-ties-cooked-article-1.1002141">Daily News adds</a>, &quot;The feds had dubbed the DiMattina probe &quot;Sausage and Eggs&quot; because he&apos;s associated with longtime Genovese soldier John (Johnny Sausage) Barbato and his wife is related to former Genovese underboss Venero (Benny Eggs) Mangano.&quot;</p>
