<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119005648/http://www.missamerica.org/competition-info/national-contestants.aspx?state=New+York&amp;year=2012&amp;GO=GO!">Miss New York</a> Kaitlin Monte was named second runner-up (aka third place) at the Miss America pageant in Las Vegas.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119005648/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/wisconsin-ices-york-amercia-2012-crown-article-1.1006354?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Miss Wisconsin edged out Miss Oklahoma and Miss New York Saturday night to become Miss America 2012 &#x2014; in what hopefully will not be an omen for Sunday&#x2019;s Giants/Packers playoff game in Green Bay.&quot;  </p>

<p>While Miss Wisconsin was asked whether Miss America should voice political positions (basically, Laura Kaeppeler said no, because Miss America represents everyone) and Miss Oklahoma was asked whether the government should be able to have a say in what kids eat (Betty Thompson answered, &quot;...I believe that parents should be the ones who are teaching their children how to eat and then it wouldn&apos;t be the government&apos;s responsibility to have to step in&quot;), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119005648/http://www.huliq.com/12291/there-she-miss-america-2012">Monte was asked </a>whether Occupy Wall Street protesters had a valid point.  Monte said, &quot;<strong>Occupy Wall Street brought discourse....If they&apos;re going to come up and complain about a problem, they have to come up with solutions, too. You can&apos;t just say there is a problem without trying to troubleshoot.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Monte, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119005648/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-01-07/news/30603065_1_miss-america-crown-personal-trainer-theater-classes">speaking out against bullying recently</a>, received a $1,000 scholarship and won the fitness competition.  Yesterday before the pageant, Monte <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119005648/http://www.facebook.com/kaitlinmonte">wrote on her Facebook page</a>, &quot;You are all incredible. Thanks for sending so much love! Tonight I am a winner because, win or not, the work I am doing will continue. You have made me feel like Miss America already and I will behave as such no matter how the cards fall. This year was the start of the rest of my life. I am indebted to your beautiful support. Thank you for helping me turn my life into one of service. </p>
