For this appearance, he wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015444/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/27/shia_labeouf_allegedly_called_cop_a.php#photo-1">wearing a t-shirt with holes</a> but a suit.</p>

<p>LaBeouf, 28, was charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct at Studio 54, where he was allegedly smoking inside the theater and grabbing actors&apos; butts. When police took him to the precinct, he reportedly told cops, &quot;F-k you. I&#x2019;ll f-k you up!&#x201D; and was spitting, so police put a face mask on him. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015444/http://pagesix.com/2014/06/26/shia-labeouf-arrested-for-disorderly-conduct/">Post added</a> that LaBeouf called one cop a &quot;f-g&quot; and said, &quot;I have millions and millions of dollars and attorneys/ I&#x2019;m going to ruin your career.&quot;</p>

<p>The actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015444/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/28/then_10_weirdest_parts_of_shia_labe.php">was in Times Square before his arrest</a>: He had four strawberry margaritas and watched the World Cup at the Iguana bar, chatted with some people and then chased a homeless man for the homeless man&apos;s food. Days after his arrest, LaBeouf&apos;s publicist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015444/http://laist.com/2014/07/01/shia_labeouf_might_have_checked_him.php">said he checked into rehab</a>.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015444/http://pagesix.com/2014/07/24/shia-labeouf-in-court-over-cabaret-meltdown/?_ga=1.12011828.1242379602.1295536070">the Post reports</a>, &quot;In an unusual move, the actor marched straight over to Assistant District Attorney Alyssa Russell and shook her hand upon entering the courtroom. He didn&#x2019;t have to wait long to go before the judge: His was the first case called.&quot; Russell told the judge, &quot;Defense counsel and I are discussing a possible resolution in this case.&quot;</p>

<p>The judge agreed to adjourn the case until September 10.</p>
