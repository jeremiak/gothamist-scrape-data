<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302001503/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/19/pregnant_poehler_poaches_palins_par.php">Saturday Night Live spoofed</a> her limited media interaction, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin did give one TV interview while in NYC: She sat down with My9&apos;s Brenda Blackmon for a segment that aired last night.  My9 is sister station to Fox 5--both are owned by the News Corp.</p>

<p>Palin said while she loves different parts of the country, the toughest part about the campaign &quot;has been the shots taken against the kids&#x2014;against the family.  They&#x2019;re my kids.<strong>  The mama grizzly bear in me comes out makes me want to rear up on my hind legs and say &#x2018;wait a minute.&#x2019;</strong>   It&#x2019;s a little bit unfair there.   It has nothing to do with taking the country in a new direction.&#x201D;  But she said they were weathering through it and knows you need to tough in a national campaign.  </p>

<p>When Blackmon brought up former Secretary of State <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302001503/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/19/colin_powell_endorses_barack_obama.php">Colin Powell&apos;s reservations about her experience</a>, Palin &quot;begged to differ&quot; and cited her executive experience, also noting the vision she shares with John McCain.  As for Saturday Night Live, she said she would do it again &quot;in a heartbeat,&quot; calling SNL &quot;nice and welcoming environment... We need more of these days. When it is just fun.&quot;</p>
