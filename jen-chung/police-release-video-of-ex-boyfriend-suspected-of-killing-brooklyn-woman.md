<p>On Wednesday night, two girls found their mother fatally shot in a Brownsville apartment. Investigators are now searching for the father of one of the girls.</p>

<p>Sellis Gonzales&apos;s two daughters, ages five and 15, found their mother dying in their Chauncey Street apartment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926095554/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/girls-find-brooklyn-mom-shot-dead-suspect-dad-missing-article-1.1462058">According to the Daily News</a>, Gonzales was shot three times in the head and three times in the torso; she was pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital. Apparently her boyfriend Eric McCormick, the father of the five-year-old, had given the girls $8 to buy chicken. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;They go, and when they come back, the door is ajar and the woman is on the floor.&quot;</p>

It was very panicky, very hectic. They didn&apos;t really know what to do,&quot; adding that she stayed with the girls while they waited for the ambulance. The News reports that the older daughter called her grandmother, &quot;My mother is on the floor covered in blood.&quot;</p>

<p>The police released video of McCormick, 40, describing him as being 5&apos;8&quot; and 225 pounds. Gonzales&apos;s mother Ursula Gonzales told the News, &quot;We know it was him. This was not the first time he hurt her. He&#x2019;s a control freak. He&#x2019;s controlling and abusive,&quot; recounting about her daughter was beaten while pregnant. The victim&apos;s brother added that his sister had an order of protection but it expired.</p>
