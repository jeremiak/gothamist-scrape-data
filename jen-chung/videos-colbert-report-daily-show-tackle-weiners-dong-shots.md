</div></div>					<p>Last night, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report tackled the greatest story of our time involving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232819/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">mayoral candidate</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232819/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">nasty sexts using the name &quot;Carlos Danger.&quot;</a> As Stephen Colbert said, &quot;Has this man never heard of Snapchat?! <strong>Your dong shot disappears seconds after you send them</strong>&#x2026; I have been told.&quot;</p>

<center><iframe width="512" height="288" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232819if_/http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=gd_p5vqghvzsekeykfbcxg" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Colbert, who introduced the segment by saying &quot;the thinkable happened,&quot; skewered Weiner for claiming that he and wife Huma Abedin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232819/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/anthony_weiner_carlos_danger.php">worked through their issues</a>, &quot;<strong>Yes, together, both he and his wife have worked through their mutual roles in him sending pictures of his crank.</strong>&quot; He got uncomfortable reading the sexts&#x2014;and then took on Weiner&apos;s alter ego Carlos Danger, &quot;I assume it was to avoid using a ridiculous name like Anthony Weiner.&quot; Colbert also had some animation ready:</p>

<center><iframe width="512" height="288" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232819if_/http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=dppu8en_hnwtt58h6wrhia" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Over at The Daily Show, John Oliver was confused, &quot;He did it again? Why did he even need to do that? Who did he think had possibly not seen his photo from last time?&quot; and then questioned Weiner&apos;s earlier claims that more photos were surface, &quot;Hold on, let me get this straight. You&#x2019;re spinning this by saying, &#x2018;See, I was right all along, I made a promise that there was more sleaze out there and I am a man of my word.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>Oliver also utilized some props (dildos), &quot;This is all a lot of fun. The problem is New Yorkers have to vote for a mayor in 48 days. So we need to know how long ago candidate Weiner fell off the dick wagon and whether we can trust him at all to get back on it... What is clear at this point is this is beyond just a series of jokes-though it is definitely also that &#x2026; He&#x2019;s addicted to running for office. And if he could just give that up, he could live a full, productive life as an internet sex freak.&quot;</p>

<p>But what does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232819/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/14/video_weiners_waxed_bod_bothers_jon.php">Weiner friend Jon Stewart think</a>?</p>
