This morning, Governor David Paterson said that the bailout will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125041050/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2008/09/paterson-bailout-will-be-1-tri.html">probably cost more like $1 trillion</a>, but at least it&apos;ll restore consumer confidence.  (Or increase <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125041050/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/business/25voices.html?hp">public outrage</a>!)  Congressional leaders will be meeting with President Bush and Senators John McCain and Barack Obama.  </p>
