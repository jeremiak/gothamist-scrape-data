<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiquestrausskahn">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a>, the former head of the International Monetary Fund and leading French politician, pleaded not guilty to charges to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/imf_head_denied_bail_lawyers_sugges.php#photo-1">sexually assaulting a maid</a> at a Time Square hotel on May 14.  When he walked into the courthouse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/strauss-kahn-appears-in-court/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">witnesses told CityRoom </a>that protesters from the hotel workers union yelled, &quot;Shame on you!&quot;</p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn is accused of trying to rape a housekeeper, a 32-year-old African immigrant who lives in the Bronx, and then forcing her to perform oral sex on him in his suite.  Police believe the accuser&apos;s story as the defense claims the encounter was consensual and has more recently insinuated the accuser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/27/dsks_lawyers_suggest_accuser_is_not.php">is not credible</a>. The allegations have rattled France, for both images of Strauss-Kahn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/bloomberg_thinks_perp_walks_are_fin.php">perp walk</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/imf_heads_perp_walk_horrifies_the_f.php">court appearances</a> and raising questions of powerful figures and preying on women.</p>

<p>After being held at Rikers&#x2014;and even being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/imf_head_is_on_suicide_watch_accuse.php">put on suicide watch</a>&#x2014;the 62-year-old international political figure is currently out on $6 million bail and living in a $14 million Tribeca townhouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/dominique_strauss-kahn_moves_to_swa.php">that rents for $50,000/month</a>.  Strauss-Kahn must also pay for his $200,000/month security, but that shouldn&apos;t be a problem since his wife is a billionaire.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608100511/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/nyregion/the-strauss-kahn-case-sizing-up-a-legal-clashs-many-facets.html?adxnnl=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;adxnnlx=1307372412-8Sf2Z5jjEOaZiQUwqnszCw"> NY Times has a lengthy article</a> looking at the case and suggests that a plea deal is highly unlikely. A former prosecutors says, &quot;This is a case that&#x2019;s going to trial. You&#x2019;re not going to offer him a plea that&#x2019;s a nonjail disposition &#x2014; Vance would look foolish if he did that. And the defendant, he&#x2019;s got a perception of himself that doesn&#x2019;t permit him to stand up and say, &#x2018;I raped that woman.&#x2019;&quot; It&apos;s also questionable whether Strauss-Kahn&apos;s past alleged questionable incidents with women will be admissible.</p>
