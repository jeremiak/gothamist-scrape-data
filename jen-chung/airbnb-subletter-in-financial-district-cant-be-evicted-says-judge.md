<p>There are many lingering questions about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194206/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/21/airbnb_will_hand_over_hosts_records.php">legality of New Yorkers</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194206/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/01/airbnb_wars_rage_on.php">using Airbnb to sublet</a> their apartments, but now a Manhattan Housing Court judge has ruled in favor of a tenant who was being threatened with eviction.</p>

<p>Kimberly Freeman has a two-bedroom at 33 Gold Street (monthly rent: $2350) and was subletting the place for $200/night&#x2014;which her landlord did not appreciate. So Gold Street Properties moved to evict her, citing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194206/http://tenant.net/Other_Laws/MDL/mdltoc.html">Multiple Dwelling Law</a>. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194206/http://nypost.com/2014/06/18/judge-nixes-illegal-airbnb-subletters-eviction/">according to the NY Post</a>, Justice Jack Stoller interpreted NYC&apos;s Multiple Dwelling as being &quot;&apos;generally aimed at the conduct of owners of property, not tenants.&apos; Previously, landlords operated under the assumption that tenants profiting off unlawful sublets was a &apos;noncurable&apos; offense, meaning renters could not right the wrong to dodge eviction.&quot;</p>

<p>Stoller wrote, &quot;The court does not find that the enactment of statues &#xAD;designed to prevent rental property from being used for hotel purposes prevents respondent from being able to cure such &#xAD;activity.&quot; He did have one small consolation for landlords: Once a landlord tells a tenant to stop subletting, they must.</p>
