<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011412/http://7online.com/news/4-people-shot-outside-baby-shower-in-east-flatbush/416608/">More than 20 shots were fired</a> outside a catering hall in East Flatbush last night. Four people were injured, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011412/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brooklyn-East-Flatbush-Baby-Shower-Shooting-NY-4-Hurt-284301441.html">three attendees of the baby shower</a> inside the hall.</p>

<p>The violence broke out in front of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011412/http://www.remsenhall.com/">Remsen Hall</a>. According to the Daily News, &quot;The gunshots rang out around 8:30 p.m., shortly after 70 guests poured into the hall on Remsen Ave. near Lenox Road in Brownsville to celebrate the pregnancy, police and witnesses said. Well-wishers carrying gifts were turned away from the crime scene, witnesses said.&quot;</p>

<p>The victims were a 22-year-old man who was shot in the chest; a 22-year-old woman shot in the arm; a 21-year-old man shot in the leg; and a 20-year-old man shot in the shoulder. All are expected to survive. </p>

<p>Police are investigating the shooting and looking to see if it&apos;s linked to the baby shower. A local pastor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011412/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/nyregion/4-wounded-in-shooting-at-a-baby-shower-in-brooklyn.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;It don&#x2019;t make no sense. I think that there&#x2019;s a better way to resolve our conflicts without pulling out a gun.&quot;</p>
