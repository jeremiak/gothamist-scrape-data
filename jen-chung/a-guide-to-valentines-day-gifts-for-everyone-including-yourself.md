title: A Guide To Valentine's Day Gifts For Everyone (Including Yourself)
---

	
										<p>Valentine&apos;s Day is around the corner&#x2014;are you cringing at the prospect of trying to navigate the admittedly over-commercialized holiday yet? Remember: it can also be a day to celebrate people aside from romantic partners that you love and care for... including yourself! We have a few suggestions to brighten February 14th in big and little ways.</p>

<p><strong><u>THE OLD CLASSICS</u></strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2017_01_beyflowers.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_01_beyflowers.jpg" width="640" height="495"> <br> <i> &quot;The Bey&quot;</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>ROSES</strong>: One of the legends of how flowers became so closely associated with Valentine&apos;s Day is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://www.proflowers.com/blog/the-history-of-valentines-day">Charles II of Sweden popularized</a> the Persian art of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://hendry.ifas.ufl.edu/HCHortNews_FloralLexicon.htm">&quot;language of flowers&quot;</a>, allowing for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://www.blossomflower.com/languageFlowers.cfm">conversations</a> to take place without letters. Roses mean many things, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://www.doghausblooms.com/flowers-lexicon/">&quot;love,&quot; &quot;passion&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot;</a>, and have therefore become a standard for this Hallmark holiday. UrbanStems has a lovely variety of Valentine&apos;s Day bouquets, like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/https://urbanstems.com/products/the-adele">$35 Adele</a> and this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/https://urbanstems.com/valentines">$80 Bey arrangement</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2017_01_chocolate.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_01_chocolate.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">Pucker up</span></p>

<p><b>CHOCOLATE</b>: The other Valentine&apos;s classic is chocolate, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://www.thehappychocolatier.com/2012/02/so-why-do-we-give-chocolate-for-valentines-day/">which apparently came to fame</a> in part because chocolate has long been considered an aphrodisiac and because a certain Richard Cadbury designed a heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine&apos;s Day in the 19th century. Go for gusto with this Kissing Game from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://www.mrchocolate.com/shop/the-kissing-game">Jacques Torres</a>, which includes 25 milk and dark chocolate bonbons, like Rose Taittinger Champagne Kiss truffles, along with playful messages. </p>

<p><b>CHAMPAGNE</b>: As Bette Davis said in a movie, &quot;There comes a time in every woman&apos;s life when the only thing that helps is a glass of champagne.&quot; And John Maynard Keynes said, &quot;My only regret is that I have not drunk more champagne in my life.&quot; Thus, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/riedel-set-of-2-o-stemless-champagne-glasses?ID=1494624&amp;CategoryID=65938#fn=sp%3D1%26spc%3D172%26ruleId%3D78|BA%26slotId%3D12%26kws%3Dchampagne%20flutes%26searchPass%3DexactMultiMatch">pair of stemless Riedel champagne flutes</a> ($24.95), plus a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013857/http://www.wine.com/v6/Veuve-Clicquot-Brut-Yellow-Label/wine/528/Detail.aspx">bottle of Veuve-Clicquot</a> ($55.99), would be an elegant way to toast the day.</p>
