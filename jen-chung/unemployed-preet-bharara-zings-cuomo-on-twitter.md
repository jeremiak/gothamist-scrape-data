<p>Now that former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/11/us_attorney_preet_bharara_fired_by.php">out of a job</a>, he has more time to devote himself to the fine art of Twitter burns. Yesterday, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/https://twitter.com/PreetBharara/status/841000145630175232">offered this tart observation</a> that sent NY State politics nerds into a frenzy: &quot;By the way, now I know what the Moreland Commission must have felt like.&quot;</p>

<p>The Moreland Commission was created in 2013 by Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/23/cuomos_corruption_commission_finds.php">to investigate corruption</a>, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140424/BLOGS04/140429924/cuomo-on-moreland-tampering-its-my-commission">prematurely disbanded by Cuomo</a> after it apparently got too close to Cuomo himself. Before it was dissolved, the commission found evidence of corruption that ultimately helped Bharara win convictions against then-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos.  </p>

<p>Bharara and the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office did investigate the closing of the commission, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/11/no_moreland_cuomo_preet.php">ultimately ended the probe</a>, with Bharara saying, &quot;After a thorough investigation of interference with the operation of the Moreland Commission and its premature closing, this office has concluded that, absent any additional proof that may develop, there is insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime.&quot;</p>

<p>His office was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/nyregion/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio.html">investigating Mayor Bill de Blasio&apos;s fundraising</a>.</p>

<p>Sources told Sherman that prosecutors &quot;have been offering witnesses immunity to testify before a federal grand jury that&#x2019;s already been impaneled... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/nyregion/preet-bharara-us-attorney.html?mtrref=nymag.com">Trump&#x2019;s short list</a> to replace Bharara includes Marc Mukasey &#x2014; who just happens to be former Fox News chief Roger Ailes&#x2019;s personal lawyer.&quot;</p>

<p>The NY Times has an article about how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170831100728/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/nyregion/preet-bharara-politics-us-attorney.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">Bharara hasn&apos;t been ruled by politics</a> during his stint at a U.S. Attorney&#x2014;one of the first investigations he oversaw was for a donor with ties to Bharara&apos;s old boss, Senator Chuck Schumer. And there&apos;s some color on his relationship with Cuomo: &quot;Mr. Bharara&#x2019;s investigation clearly stuck with Mr. Cuomo as well. In the lead-up to Mr. Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, Mr. Cuomo, who has done little to hide his frustration with Mr. Bharara, told a Trump adviser in passing that the prosecutor was &apos;a bad guy,&apos; saying, &apos;Preet is not your friend,&apos; according to a person familiar with the discussion. (A Cuomo spokeswoman denied that the governor had made such a statement.)&quot;</p>
