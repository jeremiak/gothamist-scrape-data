<p>Developer Bruce Ratner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131229023139/http://gothamist.com/tags/atlanticyards">Atlantic Yards</a> project &quot;cleared a major hurdle,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131229023139/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/12/16/2009-12-16_ratner_sells_bonds_to_score_nets_arena_funding.html">according to the Daily News</a>, by selling $511 million in tax-free bonds for the arena&apos;s financing yesterday. Apparently the bonds were selling like hotcakes&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131229023139/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/sports/basketball/16nets.html">NY Times says</a> they were sold out in two hours, &quot;Indeed, the demand for the bonds from institutional investors far outstripped what was available and belied the project&#x2019;s tortured history and court challenges.&quot;</p>

<p>The News explains, &quot;Ratner had to beat the clock to sell the bonds because the IRS has barred using such tax-free financing for sports stadiums starting Jan. 1. The rest of the $904 million arena will be paid for by state and city subsidies and private investment.&quot;  Ratner, who is expected to both complete the &quot;master closing&quot; for the project as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131229023139/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/23/russians_will_own_most_of_brooklyn.php">sale of an 80% stake </a>in the Nets this week,  said, &quot;The overwhelming support from investors is a good sign of confidence in this project and in the city.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course, opponents of the project organized a protest&#x2014;Develop Don&apos;t Destroy Brooklyn and Willets Point United <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131229023139/http://dddb.net/php/latestnews_ArchiveDate.php">dumped &quot;junkyard bonds&quot;</a> outside of Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s on Monday.</p>
