<p>Bill Cosby is a revered and towering figure in comedy and TV, but young comedian Hannibal Buress took him to task for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063212/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/16/bill-cosby-don-lemon_n_3935801.html">views on African-American culture</a>, along with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063212/http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/timeline-of-the-abuse-charges-against-cosby.html">many accusations</a> that Cosby sexually assaulted women&#x2014;&quot;You raped women, Bill Cosby,&quot; Buress said from the stage.</p>

<p>During a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063212/http://www.phillymag.com/ticket/2014/10/17/hannibal-buress-bill-cosby-rapist">set last week at the Trocadero in Philadelphia</a>, Buress talked about Cosby, a Philadelphia native, and how there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063212/http://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/the-new-bill-cosby-biography-doesnt-mention-the-past-sexual#1ay0fp1">lawsuit from 13 women</a> accusing the comic elder statesman of sexual assault. Buress told his audience:</p><blockquote>Thirteen? And it&#x2019;s even worse because Bill Cosby has the fucking smuggest old black man public persona that I hate. Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the &#x2019;80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom. Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches. I don&#x2019;t curse on stage. Well, yeah, you&#x2019;re a rapist, so, I&#x2019;ll take you sayin&#x2019; lots of motherfuckers on Bill Cosby: Himself if you weren&#x2019;t a rapist. &#x2026;I want to just at least make it weird for you to watch Cosby Show reruns. &#x2026;I&#x2019;ve done this bit on stage, and people don&#x2019;t believe. People think I&#x2019;m making it up. &#x2026;That shit is upsetting. If you didn&#x2019;t know about it, trust me. You leave here and Google &#x2018;Bill Cosby rape.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s not funny. That shit has more results than Hannibal Buress.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>In 2006, Philadelphia Magazine published an article, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063212/http://www.phillymag.com/articles/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde/">&quot;Dr. Huxtable, Mr. Hyde&quot;</a>, which includes a disturbing story from Beth Ferrier, a former lover of Cosby&apos;s from the mid-1980s. She met up with him after their affair in Denver: &quot;He said, &apos;Here&#x2019;s your favorite coffee, something I made, to relax you.&apos; She drank it and soon began to feel woozy. Several hours later, she woke up in the backseat of her car, alone. She didn&#x2019;t know what had happened. Her clothes were a mess, her bra undone. Security guards came and said Cosby told them to get her home. She confronted him at his hotel. &apos;You just had too much to drink,&apos; he told her.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Buress was on Howard Stern&apos;s SiriusXM show today, and Stern said the remarks about Cosby were &quot;right on.&quot; Buress said, &quot;It&apos;s just information that&apos;s out there,&quot; adding that it was the first time any bit of his went viral. &quot;It was unexpected,&quot; Buress explained, noting that it&apos;s different to see his words printed, with the &quot;energy&quot; taken out and non-fans reading it. &quot;I said it and I gotta stand on it&#x2026; but it&apos;s a different thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Buress also joked, &quot;Nobody&apos;s putting out the bit I do about taking a shit on an airplane&#x2026; Nobody cares about my edgy TSA material.&quot;</p>
