<p>An upstate man&apos;s decision to dump his future bride by text message <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220121931/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-back-53-000-ring-article-1.1748227">has proven expensive</a>. When Christa Clark replied, &quot;Your doing this through a text message????&quot;, the response she got from Louis Billittier Jr. was, &quot;Plus you get a $50,000 parting ring. Enough for a down payment on a house.&quot;</p>

<p>The dickish response convinced NY State Supreme Court Justice Russell P. Buscaglia that the ring wasn&apos;t part of the marriage deal. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220121931/http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/state-supreme-court/judge-rules-jilted-woman-can-keep-53000-diamond-engagement-ring-20140405">According to the Buffalo News</a>, &quot;The state&#x2019;s established law normally sides with would-be grooms. They have a legal right to claim the ring back if there is no marriage, even if the groom calls off the wedding... Buscaglia called Billittier&#x2019;s description of the ring as a &apos;parting ring&apos; an indication the ring had become a gift that no longer involved a contract for marriage.&quot;</p>

<p>There were other texts from Billittier demanding the ring back, as well as payment for wedding-related costs, including one that said, &quot;You by law have to give it back. You&#x2019;re nowhere near the person I thought you were. You don&#x2019;t deserve it.&quot; But Justice Buscaglia ruled, &quot;Changing his mind was &apos;giver&#x2019;s remorse.&apos; Many gifts are given for reasons that sour with the passage of time... Once a gift is given, it is irrevocable.&quot;</p>

<p>The 2.97-carat diamond ring is worth $53,000. </p>
