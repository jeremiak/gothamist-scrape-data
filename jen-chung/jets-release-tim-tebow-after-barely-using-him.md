<p>A year after insane fanfare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152743/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/26/tim_tebow_introduced_as_a_jet_in_bi.php">when he was first signed</a>, the New York Jets announced today that they released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152743/http://gothamist.com/tags/timtebow">Tim Tebow</a>. Coach Rex Ryan said in a statement, &quot;We have a great deal of respect for Tim Tebow. Unfortunately, things did not work out the way we all had hoped.  Tim is an extremely hard worker, evident by the shape he came back in this offseason. We wish him the best moving forward.&quot; No kidding&#x2014;that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152743/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/29/shirtless_tim_tebow_is_better_than.php">July 28 photo of shirtless Tebow running</a> from a practice field may have been peak Tebow-as-a-Jet!</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152743/http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/jets/jets-cut-tim-tebow-1.5159434?cmpid=Breaking_News_newsletter">Newsday points out</a>, &quot;Following a poor training camp, Tebow was expected to be used in multiple capacities for the Jets, most prominently in a much-hyped wildcat package that never saw much success. Tebow finished the 2012 season 6-for-8 for 39 yards and had 32 carries for 102 yards. When the team finally removed struggling starter Sanchez, it was [Greg] McElroy who replaced him, as Tebow was dealing with a rib injury.&quot; </p>

<p>This past weekend, the Jets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152743/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/27/sanchise_over_jets_draft_qb_geno_sm.php">drafted quarterback Geno Smith</a> in the second round, raising questions that Sanchez&apos;s and Tebow&apos;s reigns might be over.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152743/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/9222870/new-york-jets-cut-tim-tebow">ESPN New York has the accounting</a>: &quot;The final Tebow bill: It cost the Jets a fourth-round pick and $1.5 million in salary, plus another $2.5 million they had to pay the Denver Broncos to satisfy part of the trade agreement.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyway, here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152743/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/tim_tebow_jets_1.php">Tebow&apos;s top 8 moments with the Jets</a>.</p>
