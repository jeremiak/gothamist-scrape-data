<p>Today, New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502070613/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/27/photos_the_space_shuttle_enterprise.php#photo-1">got the Enterprise space shuttle</a>, but <em>some</em> people are trying to rain on New Yorkers&apos; spacegasm by calling the shuttle a &quot;fake.&quot;  Of course, the outcry of the prototype shuttle coming to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum is nothing new (in fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502070613/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/intrepid_3.php">it&apos;s about a year old</a>), but DCist, smug about its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502070613/http://dcist.com/2012/04/spacegasm_yep_that_was_a_space_shut.php#photo-1">decommissioned space shuttle Discovery</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502070613/http://dcist.com/2012/04/smell_ya_later_shuttle.php">points out</a> that the Discovery has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502070613/http://dcist.com/2012/04/shuttle_transfer_piece.php#photo-1">actually been used in space missions</a> while the &quot;Enterprise has been in D.C. since NASA decommissioned it in 1985. The shuttle was put on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center in November 2004.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a sampling of the anti-Enterprise sentiment on Twitter:</p>
