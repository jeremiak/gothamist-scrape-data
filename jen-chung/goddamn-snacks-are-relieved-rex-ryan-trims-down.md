(New York Jets)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Guess someone&apos;s been busy <em>not</em> bulking up during the off-season! Garrulous Jets coach Rex Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://www.newyorkjets.com/photos-and-videos/photo-gallery/ALR-Walk-to-Cure-Lupus/f6e52923-c8db-4690-b033-5da4e0fb0a16#a68adeb8-d66c-4f49-a104-1163f1f31e9b">showed off a slimmer physique</a> at the team&apos;s ALR Walk to Cure Lupus this past weekend. And the Internet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/https://twitter.com/#!/Steiny31/status/202390443084890112">is stunned</a>.</p>

<p>In early 2010, it was suggested that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/rex_ryan_and_his_reported_7000_calo.php">Ryan was an emotional eater</a>&#x2014;&quot;The coach celebrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/18/last_nights_action_j-e-t-sjetsjetsj.php">Sunday&apos;s triumph over the San Diego Chargers</a> by scarfing down a cheesesteak and a beer on the charter flight back home. He was then offered a choice of barbecue chicken, flank steak or a Cobb salad.&quot;&#x2014;and the Post guesstimated his daily diet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ryan_worth_his_weight_in_gold_Fy1W4Ect6LCWRfP7Rl5q2I">to be 7,000 calories a day</a>, which would be the equivalent of 33 McDonald&apos;s hamburgers, 26 Starbucks caramel frappucchinos, 34 Hershey milk chocolate bars&#x2014;basically gaining an extra ten pounds a week, since one&apos;s daily diet should be about 2,000 calories.</p>

<p>A few months later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/14/rex_ryan_has_gastric_bypass_surgery.php">Ryan got lap-band surgery</a> and later said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/26/rex-ryan-weight-loss-coac_n_514442.html">lost about 40 pounds</a> (but he still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://deadspin.com/5602765/rex-ryan-loses-weight+loss-contest-despite-having-lap+band-surgery">lost a weight-loss contest with players</a>!). Lately, he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163225/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/video_jets_pepsi_max.php">been looking better</a>, but these latest pictures of Ryan show him to be in fighting form. Now, let&apos;s go and eat a goddamn bowl of baby carrots!</p>
