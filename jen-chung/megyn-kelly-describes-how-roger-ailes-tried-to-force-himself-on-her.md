<p>Megyn Kelly, the Fox News star who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106115857/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/megyn_kelly_newt_gingrich.php">too nasty for some Trump surrogates</a>, has been updating her memoir in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106115857/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/roger_ailes_officially_forced_out_o.php">wake of Fox News founder Roger Ailes&apos;s exit</a>. According to a report, Kelly describes how Ailes allegedly tried to kiss her multiple times while insinuating her job was on the line.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106115857/http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/roger-ailes-sexual-assault-megyn-kelly-fox-news-tell-all-book/">Radar obtained excerpts from Kelly&apos;s memoir</a>, <em> Settle for More</em>, which describes what happened when she was first hired as a legal correspondent at the DC bureau in 2005:</p><blockquote><p></p>

<p>She writes that she was informed by her managing editor that she&#x2019;d &#x201C;captured the attention of Mr. Ailes&#x201D; and she was summoned to the first of a series of meetings in his Manhattan office.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Roger began pushing the limits,&#x201D; she alleges. &#x201C;There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger&#x2019;s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me &#x2014; veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the &#x2018;very sexy bras&#x2019; I must have and how he&#x2019;d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.&#x201D;</p>

<p>He offered to advance her career &#x201C;in exchange for sexual favors,&#x201D; she writes, and even though she says she rejected &#x201C;every single one,&#x201D; she claims he tried &#x201C;physical advances.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But in January 2006, she claims, he &#x201C;crossed a new line &#x2014; trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.&#x201D; When she shoved him away, she alleges, &#x201C;he asked me an ominous question: &#x2018;When is your contract up?&#x2019; And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Kelly did report Ailes, and the harassment stopped within months. &#x201C;Crossing him was a major risk, but what if &#x2014; God forbid &#x2014; he was still doing it to someone?&quot; she writes. </p>

<p>Ailes only left the network in July of this year after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106115857/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/02/gretchen_carlson_ailes_update.php">bombshell harassment allegations</a> from former Fox News personality Gretchen Carlson. While some Fox News employees spoke out to defend Ailes (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106115857/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/09/i_was_wrong_geraldo_rivera_sorry_fo.php">regret it</a>), Kelly did not speak publicly and apparently was instrumental in assisting the internal investigation by detailing her experiences being allegedly harassed by Ailes. </p>

<p>Numerous women have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106115857/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/09/six_more_women_say_they_were_sexual.php">accused Ailes of predatory behavior</a>, as well as encouraging a locker room atmosphere where their bodies are inspected at Fox News. Ailes has denied all allegations. </p>
