<p>The Mayor started giving to groups through the Carnegie Corporation after its president (and his friend) Vartan Gregorian suggested it in the wake of the 2001 downturn.  And while the donations were anonymous, it was an &quot;open&quot; secret the money came from Bloomberg; back in 2008, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722070609/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/nyregion/13charity.html?_r=2&amp;emc=tnt&amp;t&amp;oref=slogin">Times called</a> a $60 million gift &quot;funneling another enormous set of ostensibly anonymous grants to hundreds of arts and social services groups.&quot;  One recipient whose Hell&apos;s Kitchen theater group received $400,000 of the no-strings attached money since 2002 said, &quot;The really scary thing is the threat of it going away.&quot;  </p>

<p>Bloomberg is apparently focusing his attention on the Bloomberg Family Foundation, which has a more national (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722070609/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/20/bloomberg_moves_his_money_from_frie.php">hello, 2012?</a>) focus, but the Times says, &quot;two people familiar with the mayor&#x2019;s charitable work said that his family foundation could eventually provide grants to the groups.&quot;  Gregorian said of the mayor, &quot;<strong>He shares Andrew Carnegie&#x2019;s notion that the person who dies rich dies disgraced, because he does not have the imagination to reinvest the money into society.</strong>&quot;</p>
