<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="2010_07_schulers.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_schulers.jpg" width="250" height="179"> <br> <i>Photograph of Diane Schuler with her husband Danny, son Bryan and daughter Erin</i></div> Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/celluloid_zeros_fVKeVSoc1EF4yyJmo910FK">NY Post reported</a> that a film production company had paid the family of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://gothamist.com/tags/dianeschuler">Diane Schuler</a> $100,000 &quot;to exhume her body and test the remains to see whether she suffered a stroke.&quot;  Naturally, there&apos;s anger over the deal, because Schuler was, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/04/witnesses_taconic_crash_driver_was.php">according to toxicology reports</a>, drunk and high when she was driving the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway and ultimately crashed into another car, killing herself, her daughter, her three nieces and three passengers in another car.  The son and brother of two victims in the other car said, &quot;It&apos;s pretty pathetic that [Danny Schuler]&apos;s cashing in on his wife -- the murderer who killed seven innocent people. It&apos;s disgraceful.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Diane Schuler had been returning to her Long Island home from a camp site when the crash occurred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/26/head-on_crash_in_westchester_leaves.php">on July 26, 2009</a>; the only survivor was her son Bryan. After the tox reports were released, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/07/taconic_crash_moms_family_continues.php">her husband defended her</a>, saying, &quot;She is not an alcoholic and my heart is rested every night when I go to bed,&quot; and insisting she was sober before driving, suggesting instead <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/15/schulers_husband_takes_denials_to_t.php">that she had a stroke</a> or a condition related to her diabetes.  </p>

<p>Danny Schuler&apos;s lawyer Dominic Barbara confirmed that he brokered the deal with Liz Garbus&apos;s and Rory Kennedy&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://www.moxiefirecracker.com/index.php">Moxie Firecracker Films</a>.  Moxie Firecracker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145114/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/diane-schuler-s-husband-paid-for-movie-deal-1.2142008">told Newsday</a> that the $100,000 figure was incorrect, &quot;A modest stipend was paid for activities related to the making of the film. It is not uncommon to pay for materials and research when making an investigative film.&quot; And Barbara says the money will go into a trust for Bryan.  </p>
