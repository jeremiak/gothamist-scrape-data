<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708011851/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/photos_video_last_nights_wild_light.php#photo-1">Wednesday&apos;s big storm</a>, last night saw even more rain, which caused flash flooding and downed trees.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708011851/http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=PNSOKX&amp;e=201407040342">According to the National Weather Service</a>, for the 12-hour period ending at 11 p.m. last night, Central Park saw 1.78&quot; of rain. At 7:37 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708011851/https://twitter.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/484843277922086912">the NWS Tweeted</a>, &quot;Central Park (#NYC) received .25&quot; in 5 minutes this hour! That&apos;s a 3&quot;/hr rate! VERY heavy rain. Turn Around, Don&apos;t Drown!&quot; Outside NYC, some areas in NY, NJ and Connecticut saw over 2.5&quot;. </p>

<p>The 1, 2, 3 trains were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708011851/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hurricane-arthur-ny-rain-expected-article-1.1854583">delayed last night due to flooding</a> at the West 79th Street station. Of course, the fast rate of rainfall caused the usual problems at other stations:</p>

<p>A tree fell onto the Metro-North tracks Danbury, which had commuters waiting an hour for another train, and flights were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708011851/http://7online.com/traffic/thunderstorms-delay-flights-stall-cars-and-down-trees/154776/">delayed for a few hours</a>. </p>

<p>Today, the weather will be in the 70s but the National Weather Service warns of &quot;Heavy Downpours&quot; and dangerous rip currents.</p>
