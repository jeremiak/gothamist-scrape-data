</div></div>					<p>Americans all over the country are heading to their polling places to cast their votes for President as well as a number of other races.  Polls opened at 6 a.m. in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and they close at 8 p.m. in NJ and CT and at 9 p.m. in NY.  </p>

<p>Based on anecdotes, the predictions of high voter turnout are coming true. Overall, we&apos;re hearing that lines were forming early in the morning. Some confusion may be due to people not knowing what district they are in (some polling sites have voting multiple districts--you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115151/https://voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us/votersearch.aspx">look up your district here</a>) and some waits are from only one voter registration book being available or issues with how lines split by the alphabet (A to L here, M to Z there) are handled by poll workers.</p>

<b>Updated</b>: Here&apos;s video of a crazy line snaking around the block outside a Greenwich Village polling site, taken by Stacy Horn at 11 a.m.  Stick it out till near the end for a glimpse of a well-known indie actor who will be guest-starring on 30 Rock later this season.</p>

<p>And here&apos;s a video of the wild line outside P.S. 9 in Brooklyn&apos;s Prospect Heights neighborhood; the video is taken at 6:30 a.m. and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115151/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/early-lines-reported-at-many-polling-places/">CityRoom estimated</a>, that at 6 a.m., there were 400 people on line.<br>

<p>And here are some readers&apos; accounts--more after the jump, as well as other information, and you can tell us about your experience by leaving a comment or sending us an email or photos at tips(at)gothamist(dot)com:<br>
</p><ul><li>A poll worker on the Upper West Side said there was a small line waiting for him and his fellow workers at 5:30 a.m.<br>
</li><li>A voter in Jersey City said he arrived just before 6 a.m. and ended up being the 31st person to vote.<br>
</li><li>At 117th Street and 5th Avenue in Harlem, Joe Schumacher reports that people who arrived at 6:15 a.m. only got out of the polling site at 8 a.m.: &quot;<strong>A poll worker came out and explained that there are two machines but only one book.  The book has to be passed between the booths which slowing everything down.</strong>&quot;<br>
</li><li>From Greenpoint:<blockquote>I thought I would be ahead of the curve by getting up at 6am to go to the polls first thing.  Although sure enough, at 6:05 there were already about 40 people at the polls.  So I go ahead and show them my card and get in line, when at 6:07 someone announces that the voting booth in my line is broken.  The woman at our booth who was in the bathroom can&apos;t believe this, comes over, and says very loudly &quot;Oh no it&apos;s not broken, that just what it looks like when they vote Republican.&quot;  And I&apos;ll tell you, that was one embarrassed conservative walking out of the booth.  Two minutes later the next crisis is announced when someone exclaims &quot;we have no paper ballots!&quot; Once again our confident leader tells them that if they had read their instructions they would know they are located at the BACK of the booth.  And didn&apos;t they even read their instructions??</blockquote></li></ul><p></p>
