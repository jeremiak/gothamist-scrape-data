<p>To celebrate the 100th anniversary of North Korea&apos;s founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161522/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung">Kim Il-Sung</a>&apos;s birth, a lavish celebration was held today, including fireworks, goose-stepping soldiers and a speech by the founder&apos;s grandson and the country&apos;s new leader, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161522/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/kim_jong-ils_body_lies_in_state_as.php">Kim Jong-un</a>.  Too bad that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161522/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/north_koreas_failed_missile_launch.php">rocket failed to launch</a>!  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161522/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/world/asia/kim-jong-un-north-korean-leader-talks-of-military-superiority-in-first-public-speech.html?hp">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;In his first speech in public since assuming the leadership of North Korea, Kim Jong-un said Sunday that his &apos;first, second and third&apos; priorities were to strengthen the military, and he declared that superiority in military technology was &apos;<strong>no longer monopolized by imperialists</strong>.&apos;&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161522/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/new-n-korean-leader-kim-speaks-publicly-for-first-time/2012/04/14/gIQAk9mLIT_story.html?hpid=z2">Washington Post reports</a>, &quot;Kim&#x2019;s Sunday speech lasted about 20 minutes. He spoke assuredly but fixed his eyes on his notes. He wore a dark Mao suit, and when he finished, he remained on the observation deck overlooking Kim Il Sung square, clapping and saluting while he watched a massive military parade.&quot;</p>

<p>The young leader (he&apos;s either 28 or 29) said, &quot;<strong>Let us move forward to final victory</strong>,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161522/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/04/20124153576824453.html">Al Jazeera says</a>, &quot;While its contents were uncontroversial, the speech itself was a big surprise after many years of silence from Kim&apos;s father when he presided over similar events. Commenting on Kim Jong-un&apos;s speech, Choi Jong-kun, a professor at Yonsei University in the South Korean capital, Seoul, said it was aimed at assering his leadership. &apos;He is trying to emphasise his legitimacy as a leader, and demonstrate where his power base is,&apos; he told Al Jazeera.&quot; </p>

<p>And what&apos;s one way to show power? Military precision marching, also known as goose-stepping. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161522/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GOOSE_STEP?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-04-15-14-39-54">AP has some history</a>:</p><blockquote>European historian Norman Davies writes that the stiff-legged step originated in the Prussian Army in the 17th century. In &quot;Europe: A History,&quot; Davies wrote that the march was meant to send &quot;a clear set of messages&quot; through the synchronicity of the marchers, their high kicks and their chins held high, a message that &quot;Here, quite literally, was the embodiment of Prussian militarism.&quot; He said critics were the ones who dubbed it the goosestep.<p></p>

<p>Different armies varied the height of the kicks in their marching as the precision step made its way around the world. Perhaps the most well-known example of its usage is by the Nazis in Germany.</p></blockquote><p></p>
