</div></div><p>Do you remember when Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18108978/">dressed in drag and sang</a>, &quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. President?&quot; Did you know that Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/16/mayor_bloomberg_40.php">wore a headband and legwarmers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/29/mayor_mike_lets_out_his_colorful_se.php#photo-1">danced with crustaceans</a>&#x2014;and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/28/trippy_man_hippie_bloomberg_meets_s.php#photo-1">fist pumped with Snooki and the Situation</a>?  It&apos;s all been for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://innercircleshow.org/">Inner Circle Show</a>, where the city&apos;s political reporters roast mayors and raise money for charities.  This year&apos;s show, <em>Meet the Focker-Uppers</em>, is this Saturday night and songs are definitely referencing Bloomberg&apos;s recent greatest hits, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/07/blizzard_sends_bloombergs_approval.php">blizzageddon</a> with &quot;There&apos;s No Business Like Snow Business&quot; and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/fightin_irish_pissed_over_bloomberg.php">Irish-are-inebriated</a> remark in &quot;When Irish Guys Are Drinking.&quot; We hope they bring up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://gothamist.com/tags/bikelanes">bike lanes</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/11/insane_bloomberg_posse.php">magnets</a>...and Bloomberg may doing a little <em>Spider-Man: <strike>How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying</strike> Turn Off the Dark</em> for his act.</p>

<p>National and state politics also get skewered (Paladino anyone?), and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/03/roll-up-for-the-inner-circle-show">Daily Politics explains</a>, &quot;The Inner Circle consists solely of members of the press doing their theatrical best.  Since its founding in 1923, the Inner Circle has enforced a strict &apos;No Professional Talent&apos; rule. Hizzoner doesn&apos;t adhere to that rule, performing a fully staged song-and-dance rebuttal accompanied by top-notch pros from a top Broadway show every year.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/bloomberg-may-spoof-spider-man-at-charity-event/">According to Arts Beat</a>:</p><blockquote>For Saturday night&#x2019;s annual Inner Circle charity dinner, which will feature skits performed by the City Hall press corps and the mayor, Mr. Bloomberg is planning to work some elements from &#x201C;Spider-Man&#x201D; into his act &#x2014; including, if the technical elements jell, Hizzoner flying from the balcony to the stage in the Hilton New York&#x2019;s grand ballroom, according to two people who work on &#x201C;Spider-Man&#x201D; and have been briefed on the mayor&#x2019;s plans. The two people would only speak on condition of anonymity because Mr. Bloomberg has always insisted on keeping the nature of his performance plans a secret.<p></p>

<p>The Mayor&#x2019;s office hasn&#x2019;t sought flying advice from the &#x201C;Spider-Man&#x201D; production, nor has he borrowed a costume, the two people said, and it was not clear on Thursday if he would actually appear in Spidey&#x2019;s red, white and blue. The mayor&#x2019;s spokesman, Stu Loeser, declined to comment about Mr. Bloomberg&#x2019;s plans.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the &#x201C;Spider-Man&#x201D; production, Rick Miramontez, said in response to questions on Thursday: &#x201C;The mayor&#x2019;s office keeps his Inner Circle Dinner plans very much under wraps, so we&#x2019;re in the dark. If he were to don the Spidey outfit, everyone at &#x2018;Spider-Man&#x2019; would be delighted, of course. And we know he&#x2019;d look good in tights.&#x201D;</p></blockquote> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://www.innercircleshow.org/?page_id=8">tickets are pricey</a>&#x2014;the reduced balcony tickets are $500; everything over $75 is tax deductible (and there&apos;s a cocktail hour, four course dinner, two shows and a collectible program)&#x2014;but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030549/http://www.innercircleshow.org/?p=48">causes are good</a> (charities include Committee to Protect Journalists, Achilles International, Coalition for the Homeless).  And check out the reporters practicing one of the Act One scenes:<p></p>
