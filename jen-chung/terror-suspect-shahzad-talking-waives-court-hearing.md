</div></div><p>Faisal Shahzad, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/04/times_square_car_bomb_suspect_alleg.php">Pakistani naturalized U.S. citizen</a> who was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, and other federal crimes for allegedly leaving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/01/times_square_closed_after_police_fi.php">car bomb in Times Square</a>, has reportedly waived his right to a rapid court hearing.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/nyregion/06bomb.html?hp">According to the NY Times,</a> &quot;The disclosure that Mr. Shahzad has waived his right to a speedy arraignment suggests that he is continuing to provide valuable information to the office of Preet Bharara.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Taliban in Pakistan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/05/2010-05-05_pakistan_taliban_praises_faisal_shahzad_time_sq_bomb_try_says_no_link_but_more_l.html">praised Shahzad&apos;s botched car bomb</a> but denied a link to their group, adding, &quot;Right now, America is the biggest enemy of Islam. We have sent out mujahedeen to America and you will soon see the results.&quot;  However, investigations are looking at whether Shahzad, who admitted to learning bomb-making in Pakistan, did have links to the Taliban. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/taliban_lackey_Su3wybDRpAYfahVx03zskI">The Post reports</a> that the 30-year-old allegedly wanted to bomb Times Square in &quot;retaliation for US drone attacks that wiped out the leadership of his beloved Taliban.&quot; </p>

<p>While there are questions about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/terror_suspect_shazad_was_on_no-fly.php">lapses that nearly led to Shahzad&apos;s escape</a>, authorities pointed out that he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/nyregion/05tictoc.html">apprehended 53 hours</a> after his Nissan Pathfinder was found in Times Square. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that while Jack Bauer can find the bad guys in 24 hours, &quot;In the real world, 53 is a pretty good number.&quot;  </p>

<p>Authorities were able to zero in on his life in Connecticut, which the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-times-square-bomb-faisal-shahzad-conn-0505,0,4402510.story">Courant calls &quot;mundane&quot;</a> until his arrest: &quot;He earned a business degree from the University of Bridgeport, started a family and bought a three-bedroom home in the suburbs.&quot; One thing that helped confirm that the person who left the SUV in Times Square lived in a Bridgeport apartment: The keys left in the ignition of the SUV fit in the apartment&apos;s door.  Shahzad&apos;s landlord told reporters that Shahzad, who was on a train back to Connecticut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130420033925/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/nyregion/05profile.html?ref=nyregion">called him on Saturday</a> saying he lost his key, &quot;He looked nervous. But I thought, of course he&#x2019;s nervous, he just lost his keys.&quot;</p>
