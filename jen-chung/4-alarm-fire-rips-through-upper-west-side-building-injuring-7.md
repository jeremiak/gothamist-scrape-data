					<p>A huge fire broke out in a Manhattan apartment on the Upper West Side and 170 firefighters responded to what ended being a four-alarm blaze. </p>

<p>The fire began at 509 Amsterdam Avenue but spread to a neighboring building. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104734/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Upper-West-Side-Building-Fire-Amsterdam-Avenue-Jacobs-Pickle-414758673.html">according to NBC New York</a>, &quot;The fire started on the third floor of 509 Amsterdam Ave., then got into a shaft and shot up through the fifth floor, then spread to the building next door, no. 511, FDNY Chief of Department James Leonard said.&quot; </p>

<p>On the ground floor of 509 Amsterdam Avenue is Jacob&apos;s Pickles, while 511 Amsterdam has E&apos;s Bar.
