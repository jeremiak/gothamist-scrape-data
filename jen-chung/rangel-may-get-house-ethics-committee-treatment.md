This comes as his 1972 Mercedes Benz, long unused, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117101848/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09192008/news/nationalnews/tow_nailing_charlie_parker_129802.htm">towed from a House parking garage</a>!</p>

<p>Yesterday the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117101848/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182008/news/regionalnews/big_wheel_benz_the_rules_129646.htm">Post reported</a> that the Benz was covered by a tarp (its NY State registration expired in 2004) and had been there for years.  The Post found &quot;House rules forbid use of the garage for long-term storage more than 45 days,&quot; and suggests that the free space should have been reported as &quot;imputed income.&quot; Rangel only said, &quot;I told you I am not discussing that.

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117101848/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/washington/19memo.html">NY Times reports</a> that Rangel chose to &quot;ride out the storm&quot; and not cede his chairmanship because there are other House Republicans--under actual criminal investigations--who haven&apos;t resigned as chairs of their committees.  The Washington Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117101848/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2008/09/look_who_voted_to_punish_rep_c.html?hpid=news-col-blogs">has an amusing roundup</a> of the corrupt/allegedly corrupt who voted for and against Rangel losing his chairmanship.</p>
