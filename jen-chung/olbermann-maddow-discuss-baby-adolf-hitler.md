<p>Last night, on Countdown with Keith Olbermann, the number 1 news story was the topic that suddenly gripped a nation: The saga of ShopRite refusing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161225/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/17/no_shoprite_cake_for_baby_hitler.php">inscribe a cake for little Adolf Hitler Campbell</a>.  Olbermann was charmed by Wal-Mart&apos;s statement explaining why they agreed to provide a cake and then brought in fellow MSNBC talk show host Rachel Maddow to riff on the subject.</p>

<p>The Express-Times, which reported on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161225/http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/index.ssf?/base/news-0/122923112231930.xml&amp;coll=3">uniquely named child on Sunday</a>, finds that many people are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161225/http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/index.ssf?/base/news-1/1229576716306690.xml&amp;coll=3">sympathetic towards the Campbell children</a>, but not the parents.  There&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161225/http://photos.lehighvalleylive.com/gallery/4424/Adolf%20Hitler%20Campbell">a gallery of photographs</a> showing Adolf Hitler Campbell&apos;s birth certificate and the extent of his father&apos;s Nazi-admiring ways.  </p>
