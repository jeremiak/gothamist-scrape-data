<p>The Nassau County DA&apos;s Office announced that three high-ranking police officials were indicted on charges that they &quot;conspired to and intentionally prevented the arrest of a teenager whose father was a financial benefactor of the police.&quot;  Deputy Police Commissioner William Flanagan&#x2014;who retired last night as word of the indictment came down&#x2014;as well as Deputy Chief of Patrol John Hunter and former deputy commander Alan Sharpe have pleaded not guilty to the damning accusations. Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302021940/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/three_nassau_county_police_treatment_uJoZEFDsa8SNPzFjHgyS4K">how the Post characterized it</a>, &quot;A Manhattan accountant wined and dined top Nassau County cops to to the tune of $17,000&apos; at pricey Long Island eateries as he literally called the shots in their eager efforts to kill a burglary probe into his druggie son.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in May 2009, thousands of dollars worth of electronics equipment were stolen from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore. Zachary Parker, then 18 and a civilian member of the Nassau police ambulance unit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302021940/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/da-3-ex-ncpd-commanders-conspired-to-prevent-arrest-1.3569315">stole the equipment</a>, but he was never arrested, apparently thanks to his father Gary Parker&apos;s maneuvering. </p>

So the teen was never arrested&#x2014;until last fall by the DA&apos;s office, and the Post reports he has been &quot;pulled over no less than 20 times by cops for motor vehicle infractions that went unwritten by police.&quot;</p>

<p>Gary Parker, the accountant, is, the Post says, &quot;a police booster who later served on a private foundation co-founded by then-Commissioner [Lawrence] Mulvey that is trying to raise $25 million to build a new police academy&quot; and allegedly expressed his gratitude to Flanagan by sending him &quot;over-the-top&quot; gift cards. </p>

<p>Flanagan&apos;s lawyer said, &quot;Is it suspicious that individuals make friends, that police officers have friends, and that deputy commissioners have friends? No, it&apos;s not suspicious at all.&quot; The investigation was sparked by the Long Island Press story, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302021940/http://www.longislandpress.com/2011/03/31/nassau-county-police-department-selling-preferential-treatment/">Is Nassau County Police Department Selling Preferential Treatment?</a>, from March 2011.  </p>
