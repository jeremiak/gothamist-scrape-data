New York State lawmakers, including Senators Schumer and Clinton, announced yesterday that they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308230926/http://www.wnbc.com/news/16613262/detail.html">going to introduce a resolution to rename</a> part of U.S. Route 20 after Russert.  The section they want to rename runs in front of the Buffalo Bills&apos; stadium--Russert grew up in Buffalo and was an unabashed fan of the Bills, as well as the Sabres.  </p>

<p>His favorite musician and friend, Bruce Springsteen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308230926/http://www.brucespringsteen.net/news/index.html">dedicated &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to Russert during a concert in England</a>, saying, &quot;He was always a strong voice for honesty and accountability in American government .. but beyond that he was a lovely presence, a good father, husband, and good guy. He was a regular at many E Street Band shows and I&apos;m going to miss looking down and seeing that big smiling face in the crowd.&quot;</p>

<p>And yesterday&apos;s Meet the Press broadcast was a gathering of Russert&apos;s friends, fellow journalists and political pundits.  Led by Tom Brokaw and including Gwen Ifill, Maria Shriver and political strategists James Carville and Mary Matalin (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308230926/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/06/15/2008-06-15_meet_the_press_moderator_tim_russert_eul.html">they broke down during the taping</a>), they remembered Russert&apos;s drive, tenacity, and generous spirit.  You <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308230926/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25174922/">can see video here</a>, and the photo at right is of Russert&apos;s son Luke touching his chair on the Meet the Press set.</p>

<p>This morning, Luke Russert went on the Today show to discuss his father&apos;s passion for work and family.  Russert had celebrated Luke&apos;s graduation from Boston College with a trip to Italy; he had just returned from the trip and was at NBC&apos;s Washington bureau, working on Sunday&apos;s show, when he collapsed last Friday.
