<p>Hey, people who don&apos;t really like NJ Governor Chris Christie: If you heckle him while he&apos;s got an ice cream cone in his hand, Christie will hulk out.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103109/http://www.tmz.com/2012/07/06/chris-christie-governor-jersey-shore-video-boardwalk-fight/">TMZ has video of a cone-frontation</a> in Seaside Heights. Basically, a passer-by criticized Christie&apos;s education policy, prompting Christie to yell, &quot;You&apos;re a real big shot ... you&apos;re a real big shot shootin&apos; your mouth off.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the man yelled,  &quot;Nah, just take care of the teachers!&quot; and Christie followed the man, &quot;Keep walkin&apos; away ... really good ... keep walkin&apos;.&quot;</p>
