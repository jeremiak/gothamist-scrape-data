<p>Fitzharris said, &quot;I think it was probably just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the kid, and this man chose to give him this opportunity.&quot; While it&apos;s unclear if Shepard was speeding, he said, &quot;I would suspect it was excessively fast.&quot;</p>

<p>Shepard&apos;s father, who owns an autobody shop, told Newsday that his son loved Lamborghinis and was going to join the Army Rangers before becoming a police officer: &quot;He had his whole future planned out.&quot;<br>
