Calls to 911 had been made about a stabbing and when police arrived, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018105051/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8393262">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said</a> that Yvonne Hines &quot;came to the door with a rag covered in blood and there was a body on the floor.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Apparently there had been other violent incidents between Hines and son Sean Hines.  WABC 7 reports, &quot;Close friends call this the devastating end of years of abuse in this home,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018105051/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/woman-is-questioned-in-killing-of-son-18-on-upper-west-side/">CityRoom described one from June</a>: The son attacked the mother with a hammer, while the mother had a knife (both were arrested). When she was being taken into custody, Yvonne Hines claimed her husband (Sean&apos;s stepfather) had killed her son.</p>

<p> A neighbor told WABC 7, &quot;I didn&apos;t think she would actually murder her son,&quot; while others remembered Sean as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018105051/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/16/2011-10-16_mother_charged_with_stabbing_18yearold_son_to_death.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">sweet kid who stayed out of trouble</a>. Another told the Daily News that Yvonne Hines was &quot;was always slamming the door, always in the hallway yelling,&quot; adding, &quot;She was screaming at him to find a job. He wouldn&apos;t even talk back. He would just sit there. He was very quiet, very shy.&quot; </p>

<p>One of Sean&apos;s friends said, &quot;It&apos;s just heartbreaking someone could do that to their son, like where&apos;s your heart?&quot;</p>
