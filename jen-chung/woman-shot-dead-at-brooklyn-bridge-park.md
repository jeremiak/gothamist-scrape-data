<p>No arrests have been made. The investigation is ongoing, and we&apos;ll update as more information becomes available.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Captain Sergio Centa, who heads the 84th Precinct, sent an email to some residents last night, saying that they believe Marks was killed due to an &quot;ongoing domestic dispute&quot;&#x2014;and not as a result of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105403/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/18/brooklyn_bridge_park_pier_2.php">issues at Pier 2</a>:</p><blockquote>Last night at approximately 9:30 PM, a 23 year old female was shot and killed inside of Brooklyn Bridge Park near the Atlantic Avenue entrance adjacent to Pier 6. We believe this shooting was the result of an ongoing domestic dispute. The victim worked at a location inside of the park and she was confronted as she left work. We have no reason to believe that this incident was related to any of the issues we have had in the park this year such as overcrowding and/or unruly crowds. We will continue to increase our patrol coverage within the park using all available resources including the 25 Police Officers permanently assigned to the Park.</blockquote><br>
