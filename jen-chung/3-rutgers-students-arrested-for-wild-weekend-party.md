<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100742/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/riot_police_respond_to_rutgers_stud.php">crazy partying in New Brunswick, NJ</a> that involved couch burning, big crowds and, eventually, cops pepper-spraying people, has now resulted in arrests. Three Rutgers students, plus an 18-year-old were hit with charges ranging from aggravated assault on police to underage consumption of alcohol.  </p>

<p>The festivities began on Saturday as Rutgers students and their friends began to celebrate Delafest, an all-day street party, but devolved when the cops were called to break up the crowds and stop the couch burning. No permits had been issued, but barricades were set up in the streets by partiers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100742/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130415/NJNEWS/304150051/4-Rutgers-students-arrested-New-Brunswick-Delafest-melee?nclick_check=1">One student told MyCentralJersey</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m still shocked that all these things occurred, like a couch getting burned in the middle of the street with 100 people circling around it. Come on. Whoever saw that happening?&quot; and believed that Mother Nature was partly to blame, &quot;The nice weather definitely had a lot to do with it. People from all over the campus came here.&quot;</p>

<p>Rutgers interim vice chancellor of Undergraduate Academic Affairs Gregory Jackson issued a statement bemoaning the unsanctioned event, saying it &quot;send[s] the wrong impression of our students, the vast majority of whom are focused on a strong finish to their academic year... I cannot too strongly warn you about how a careless moment can change your life for good. Let me remind you of a sobering reality: you do not want to end your career before it has begun by being charged with a felony.&quot; On the other hand, partying is awesome:</p>
