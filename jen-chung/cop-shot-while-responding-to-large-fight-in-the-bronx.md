</div></div>					<p>Earlier this morning, an anti-crime unit police officer was shot in the ankle in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said that Sherrod Stuart and his partner were &quot;respond[ing] to numerous 911 calls reporting a large fight in the street with guns, bats, and knives at 2505 3rd Avenue.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred at around 2:10 a.m., and Stuart is now recovering at Lincoln Hospital. Bratton said at press conference:</p><blockquote>As the officers arrived at the scene, they encountered a male subject and pursued him. As backup units arrived the officers engaged in a gunfight during which Police Officer Stuart was struck in the right foot. He returned gunfire, striking the male suspect four times. A .380 semi-automatic firearm was recovered at the scene. Three additional firearms were recovered in a subsequent search of the area around 137th Street and 3rd Avenue where the initial 911 calls came in.<p></p>

<p>The injured police officer was removed to Lincoln Hospital where he is in stable condition. The suspect was also taken to Lincoln Hospital and is listed in serious condition at this time.</p></blockquote>Bratton identified the suspect as Christopher Rice, 19, and said that the investigation so far &quot;indicates that this subject has a criminal history of five prior arrests, including an arrest just yesterday on a charge of fare beating, a charge in which he was released from court at 11p.m. last night&#x2014;three hours before the shooting.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The police released an image of Stuart, 25, smiling and giving two thumbs up from his hospital bed during Commissioner Bratton&apos;s visit.</p>

A cop came by and then there were shots.&quot; A worker in the area said he heard around &quot;15 shots.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio, who attended the press conference along with Patrolmens Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, said, &quot;This young man as you heard, just four years on the job, he already has a very, very impressive career in terms of the work he&apos;s done, getting to the anti-crime unit. He had distinguished himself already. In this situation, he distinguished himself further with his quick thinking and his brave actions and thank God his injuries are not life threatening.&quot;</p>
