<p>A man suspected of breaking into a woman&apos;s Brooklyn apartment and threatening her&#x2014;&quot;Do you want me to rape you or kill you?&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021347/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/26/woman_raped_in_bushwick_armed_attac.php">before raping and robbing her</a> has been arrested. And apparently he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021347/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-house-cleaner-arrested-assaulting-client-pad-article-1.2764692">was her house cleaner</a>.</p>

<p>The assault occurred at 1:30 a.m. on July 25, inside an apartment near DeKalb Avenue and Wilson Avenue in Bushwick. The police say the 29-year-old victim was &quot;sleeping when she heard her door being opened at which time an unknown male approached her displaying a silver firearm then proceeded to forcibly rape the victim and remove some personal items of the victim before fleeing in an unknown direction.&quot; </p>

<p>Romaric Guiebre, 20, was charged with assault, burglary, criminal sexual act, grand larceny, unlawful imprisonment, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021347/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-house-cleaner-arrested-assaulting-client-pad-article-1.2764692">The Daily News reports</a> he apparently found a spare key near the victim&apos;s door to enter her home:</p><blockquote> Guiebre had worked in the woman&#x2019;s apartment...eight days earlier, and at 1:30 a.m., the victim awoke to the sound of the door opening, prosecutors said.<p></p>

<p>Guiebre grabbed her neck, took out a gun and threatened, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to kill you,&#x201D; Assistant District Attorney Tziyonah Langsam said at Guiebre&#x2019;s arraignment Wednesday.</p>

<p>The sicko then bit her nose, tied her up, blindfolded her with a bedsheet and sexually assaulted her, Langsam said. Before leaving, he allegedly took her debit card and withdrew $400 from her account.</p></blockquote>Guiebre is being held on $100,000 bail. <p></p>
