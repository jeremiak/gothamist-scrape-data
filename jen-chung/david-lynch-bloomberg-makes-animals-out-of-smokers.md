<blockquote>Q. What else shaped your musical tastes?

<p>A. Obviously Elvis Presley and all the artists in the &#x2019;50s, like Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison and the Fleetwoods, the Platters, the Everly Brothers. It just drives me crazy just to say the names. Jimi Hendrix I think is a guy that everybody loves, but what he did is, he took the power of the &#x2019;50s and in my mind really amplified that power and took it to another level, just incredibly.</p>

<p>Q. How old were you when you started listening to that? How did it affect you?</p>

<p>A. 10. I started smoking. I [had] started before that, but I took it more seriously.</p>

<p> Q. Do you still smoke?</p>

<p>A. I quit smoking in December. I&#x2019;m really depressed about it. I love smoking, I love fire, I miss lighting cigarettes. I like the whole thing about it, to me it turns into the artist&#x2019;s life, and now people like Bloomberg have made animals out of smokers, and they think that if they stop smoking everyone will live forever.</p>

<p>Q. So do you think your creativity will be drained as a nonsmoker?</p>

<p>A. I had quit smoking during &#x201C;Eraserhead.&#x201D; I quit for 21 years. I made a lot of films and paintings and stuff during that time, I think it&#x2019;ll be O.K. </p></blockquote>And Lynch knows about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522010255/http://youtu.be/Ud-eiDxeJj4">people treating others like animals</a>. Anyway, the Times interview also reveals that Lynch loves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522010255/http://gothamist.com/2005/06/30/the_gothamist_band_interview_au_revoir_simone.php">Au Revoir Simone</a>!<p></p>
