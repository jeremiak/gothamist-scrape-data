According to Moraima Camacho, Junior High School 190 principal Marilyn Grant said &quot;that it wasn&apos;t their fault that it was something they had to do. She doesn&apos;t consider it doodling.&quot;<p></p>

<p>When her teacher saw her doodling/defacement of school property with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120504/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/02/06/2010-02-06_grade_for_common_sense_f_.html">lime green magic marker</a>, an assistant principal called the cops and Gonzalez was hauled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120504/http://wcbstv.com/watercooler/handcuffed.for.doodling.2.1473975.html">away in <em>metal</em> handcuffs</a> (and not plastic handcuffs that authorities use on adult protesters!) to the police precinct across the street. Camacho told WCBS 2, &quot;As soon as I saw her take off the handcuffs I said, &apos;No, what are you &#x2026;&apos; and (the officer) was like, &apos;sorry, this is the procedure. We have to do this.&apos;... <strong>My daughter was humiliated! Humiliated!</strong>&quot; Plus, Gonzalez is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120504/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/02/06/2010-02-06_grade_for_common_sense_f_.html">reportedly throwing up</a> after the trauma.</p>

<p>The Department of Education admitted that Grant made a mistake and said Gonzalez&apos;s suspension would be lifted (the student still faces 8 hours of community service, a book report and an essay) and the NYPD agreed handcuffing the girl was going a little too far.  The NYCLU&apos;s executive director Donna Lieberman said &quot;This should be a wakeup call to the mayor&quot; (the group has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120504/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/09/nypd_wrongly_arresting_students_nyl.php">already sued the city</a> for excessive arrests of students).  Still, Camacho was worried that the incident means her daughter will have a permanent police record, but &quot;an NYPD spokesman told CBS 2 HD no files are being maintained on the 12-year-old. &quot;</p>
