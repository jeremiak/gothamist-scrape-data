<p>Rep. Charles Rangel, the long-serving Democratic Congressman from Harlem, is reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/rangel_reportedly_trying_to_settle.php">still</a> in talks with the House Ethics Committee to settle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/charles_rangel_charged_with_house_e.php">charges</a> ahead of today&apos;s trial.  However, there&apos;s a big sticking point: Rangel apparently doesn&apos;t want to admit he did anything unethical.  A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rangel_deal_breaker_3dM37XIhn9yiq1o1hWFFVO">told the NY Post</a>, &quot;He feels, I think very strongly, that he has not done anything that was wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>The exact charges have not been disclosed (that&apos;s for the trial, which involves four Democrats and Republicans as judges and would begin at 1 p.m.), but it&apos;s believed the charges are related to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/11/congressman_charles_rangel_and_his.php">four (!) rent-stabilized apartments</a>, not reporting income and/or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/05/rangels_75000.php">taxes on</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/24/investigations_launched_into_rangel.php">various properties</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/rangels_taxes_keep_turning_up_mangl.php">sales</a> and preserving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/26/gop_wants_ethics_investigation_into.php">tax loophole worth $500 million</a> for an oil executive donating money to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/13/ccny_to_delay_opening_reception_for.php">CUNY graduate school named after him</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/nyregion/29rangel.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reminds us all</a> Rangel has admitted that not reporting the income on his tax returns was a mistake, but &quot;denied any wrongdoing for&quot; his bounty of cheap apartments or trying to save an oil executive half a billion.</p>

<p>While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer haven&apos;t commented directly about Rangel&apos;s troubles, but the Times says, &quot;Representative George Miller of California, a close ally of Ms. Pelosi, urged Mr. Rangel to settle the case.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/28/2010-07-28_charlie_rangel_struggles_to_pull_off_deal_to_save_job_rep_amid_ethics_violation_.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">according to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Rangel&apos;s mindset was so far removed from his increasingly worried colleagues&apos; perspective that until recently he even dreamed of recapturing th<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130120/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/02/rangel_may_not_keep_his_house_chair.php">e Ways and Means Committee chairmanship</a> he was forced to give up last spring.&quot;</p>

<p>Rangel&apos;s fellows Dems are definitely hoping for a deal: A New York Democratic leader told the Post, &quot;I don&apos;t wish ill on Charlie, but he has a tough decision to make. If it goes to trial, the Republicans will be against him and the Democrats would be reluctant to cut him a break. This is not a jury trial.&quot;</p>
