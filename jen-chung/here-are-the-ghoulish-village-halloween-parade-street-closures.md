</div></div>					<p>Saturday Halloween means <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307222712/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/26/halloween_party_guide_2015.php">PARTY HALLOWEEN</a> in NYC, and the biggest event of the night is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307222712/https://www.halloween-nyc.com/">Village Halloween Parade</a>. Here are the street closures, so you know where to watch (or where it will be a little too spooky to cross the street):</p>

<blockquote> Formation:
6th Avenue between Spring Street and Canal Street
Dominick Street between Varick Street and 6th Avenue
Sullivan Street between Broome Street and Spring Street
Broome Street between Sullivan Street and Varick Street
Spring Street between Sullivan Street and Varick Street

<p>Route:<br>
6th Avenue between Spring Street and West 18th Street</p>

<p>Dispersal:<br>
West 16th Street between 5th Avenue and 7th Avenue<br>
West 17th Street between 5th Avenue and 7th Avenue<br>
West 18th Street between 5th Avenue and 7th Avenue</p>

<p>Miscellaneous: (At NYPD&#x2019;s Discretion)<br>
West 10th Street between 6th Avenue and Greenwich Avenue</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>If you&apos;d like to participate in the parade, you need to show up in costume at the starting point at 6th Avenue at Canal Street between 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. (Police will not let you join the parade from further along the route.) </p>

<p>In Brooklyn, the big parade is the Park Slope Halloween Parade&#x2014;the parade forms at 14th Street, between 8th and 7th Avenues, with the route on 7th Avenue between 14th and 3rd Streets; the parade disperses on 3rd Street between 7th and 5th Avenues.</p>
