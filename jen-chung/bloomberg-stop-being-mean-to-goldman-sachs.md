<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="121810bloombergdeal.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317065322im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jsaxena/121810bloombergdeal.jpg" width="250" height="328" class="image-left"> </span>Do you know who, besides Lloyd Blankfein, really wants the pile-on of Goldman Sachs to stop?  Mayor Bloomberg!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317065322/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mayor-bloomberg-piling-goldman-sachs-ridiculous-article-1.1040670">During his radio show this morning</a>, he commented on the very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317065322/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/goldman_sachs_exec_calls_firm_toxic.php">NY Times op-ed written by a disgruntled</a> ex-employee who said the firm put profits before clients: &quot;I don&apos;t know whoever said what... But even if it was said, it&apos;s a few people and, you know, Goldman Sachs is a firm that&apos;s been around for well over a hundred years and it&apos;s a great firm... It&apos;s my job to stand up and support companies that are here in the city that bring us a tax base that employ our people and I&apos;m going to do that.&quot;</p>

<p>Greg Smith resigned from his position as a director in Goldman&apos;s London office on Wednesday&#x2014;and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317065322/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html?_r=4&amp;pagewanted=all"> explained his reasoning for leaving after 12 years in the Times op-ed</a>, &quot;Culture was always a vital part of Goldman Sachs&#x2019;s success. It revolved around teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, and always doing right by our clients. The culture was the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients&#x2019; trust for 143 years. It wasn&#x2019;t just about making money; this alone will not sustain a firm for so long. It had something to do with pride and belief in the organization. I am sad to say that I look around today and see virtually no trace of the culture that made me love working for this firm for many years. I no longer have the pride, or the belief.&quot;  Now, &quot;It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as &apos;muppets,&apos; sometimes over internal e-mail.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Bloomberg:  It turns out he also visited Goldman Sachs yesterday.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317065322/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-15/mayor-bloomberg-meets-with-goldman-employees-after-smith-op-ed">According to, uh, Bloomberg Businessweek</a>: &quot;&apos;The mayor stopped by to make clear that the company is a vital part of the city&#x2019;s economy, and the kind of unfair attacks that we&#x2019;re seeing can eventually hurt all New Yorkers,&apos; said Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor. Bloomberg visited the firm [at] about 11 a.m. and met with Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and numerous employees, Loeser said.&quot;</p>
