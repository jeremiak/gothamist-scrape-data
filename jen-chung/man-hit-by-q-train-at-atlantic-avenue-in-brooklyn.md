<p>The Post reports that it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104514/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/man_struck_and_injured_by_train_ZGkW3Ad73LgsA5WaYIoV3J?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Brooklyn">doesn&apos;t appear that he was pushed</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104514/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130515/prospect-heights/man-struck-by-train-at-atlantic-avenue-terminal">DNAinfo reports</a> that the victim may have been &quot;relieving himself near the tracks.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104514/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/30/video_man_pees_inside_subway_train.php">People, please just hold it</a> till you get to a real bathroom!)
