Based on the trajectory of the bullets fired into Jorge Martinez&apos;s van (one struck him in the head), it&apos;s suspected that the gunman was aiming from a rooftop.  Now a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807040339/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/slay_was_target_practice_cops_zHYPbuwKjyUASj934nh3vI">tells the Post</a>, &quot;He must&apos;ve been testing out his gun. He fired a few times at a parked car and then fired at a moving vehicle, thinking he&apos;d scare the driver.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807040339/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/09/06/2010-09-06_brooklyn_sniper_who_shot_and_killed_deliveryman_jorge_martinez_may_have_been_tes.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Police found other cars on the block pockmarked with bullets and towed one away as evidence.&quot;  A cop said, &quot;<strong>If he had no problem shooting at cars like that, he&apos;s the kind of guy that doesn&apos;t care about human life</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>The police found nine 9-mm shell casings on the roof of the Marlboro Houses and now they are seeing if it matching the bullets fired at Martinez&apos;s van and other cars.  Residents told the News &quot;a party in a seventh-floor apartment known for drug use was going on at the same time as the shooting - right below the part of the roof from which the bullets were apparently fired,&quot; and one said, &quot;It&apos;s scary. Every weekend you can hear shots, all the time.&quot; </p>

<p>Martinez was an Ecuadorean immigrant had two teenaged children.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807040339/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/09/06/2010-09-06_person_we_loved_most_deliverymans_children_mourn_at_scene_of_slaying.html">One of his children said</a>, &quot;He was a great guy, the best dad ever. He was like a hero to me... He was the person we loved most in the world... We don&apos;t know who did this to my dad. He was working to give us the best future. <strong>He was simply delivering bread. This is just not fair. He didn&apos;t deserve this at all.</strong>&quot;</p>
