<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_09_chavez.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093001im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_chavez.jpg" width="240" height="217" class="image-left"> </span>A few years back, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez famously proclaimed from the U.N. General Assembly podium that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093001/http://gothamist.com/2006/09/21/bush_leaves_new.php">President Bush was the &quot;devil&quot;</a> and the podium area still smelled like sulfur because W. had been speaking up there.  But this time around, Chavez said, &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t smell of sulfur, anymore. It&#x2019;s gone. No, it smells of something else. It smells of hope.&quot;  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093001/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/chavez_says_he_smells_hope_not_the_gmHX3nh7wzBNGetwpIYAnO">Post adds</a> that Chavez also referred to the 43rd President by saying, &#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093001/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/14/bush_makes_surprise_trip_to_iraq_ge.php">anybody throw a shoe at me</a>.&quot;  And Chavez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093001/http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/09/24/chavez.venezuela.united.nations/index.html">said of President Obama</a>, &quot;I hope God will protect Obama from the bullets that killed Kennedy. I hope Obama will be able to look and see, genuinely see, what has to be seen and bring about a change.&quot;</p>

<p>Last night, Chavez got to rub shoulders with leftie celebrities, at the premiere of Oliver Stone&apos;s documentary <em>South of the Border</em>. The director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093001/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-stone-doc1-2009sep01,0,6813572.story">told the LA Times </a>earlier this month that he wanted to change perceptions of Chavez, who is &quot;an extremely dynamic and charismatic figure. He&apos;s open and warmhearted and big, and a fascinating character.&quot; Apparently Courtney Love thinks so&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093001/http://www.movieline.com/2009/09/when-courtney-met-hugo-a-south-of-the-border-love-story.php">Movieline says</a> she was really &quot;frisky&quot; when meeting him.</p>
