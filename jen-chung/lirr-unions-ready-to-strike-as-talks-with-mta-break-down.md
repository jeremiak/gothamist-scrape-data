<p>A Long Island Rail Road strike is looking likelier as the MTA and labor unions accused each other of not negotiating properly&#x2014;so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015725/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/12/mta_readies_for_possible_lirr_strik.php">keep those contingency plans handy</a>.</p>

<p>United Transportation Union President Anthony Simon, the workers&#x2019; chief negotiator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015725/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/14/talks-to-resume-between-mta-lirr-unions/">said the MTA rejected the union&apos;s counteroffer</a>, &quot;At this point, it is absolutely regrettable to say that we have come to a complete impasse. The MTA has not come with a counteroffer at all and is not moving.&quot;</p>

<p>MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast said there&apos;s a &quot;gulf&quot; between the agency and the union. Here&apos;s the WSJ on what&apos;s being argued over:</p><blockquote>The MTA&#x2019;s latest offer would have afforded 17% raises over a term of seven years. All current employees would pay 2% of their regular pay toward health-care costs, up from no contributions. Under the authority&#x2019;s proposal, it would take new employees longer to reach top pay levels. New employees would contribute 4% of their pay toward health-care costs. And unlike current employees, they would also have to keep contributing to their pensions after 10 years on the job.<p></p>

<p>The LIRR unions haven&#x2019;t publicly disclosed their latest counteroffer to the MTA. But federal mediators, in siding with the unions, had recommended 17% in wage bumps over a shorter term of six years. The federal mediators&#x2019; also recommended requiring current LIRR employees to contribute 1% of their regular pay toward health-care in 2010, with their contributions escalating to 2.25% in 2015.</p></blockquote>Prendergast complained that the LIRR union was bucking the trend of other unions across the country <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015725/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/18/no_fare_increases_as_mta_subway_uni.php">in health care contributions</a>. He also described the union&apos;s threat of a strike as a &quot;tool that&apos;s used to try and attract attention to an issue... If we&apos;re acknowledging that these highest paid employees in the industry are going to get the highest raise in the region, let&apos;s find a way to pay for it.&quot;<p></p>

<p>UTU president Simon said that a strike will begin at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday: &quot;Riders should be aware that the winding down of service will begin well before then, perhaps as early as Wednesday, as the railroad needs to secure its equipment.&quot;</p>
