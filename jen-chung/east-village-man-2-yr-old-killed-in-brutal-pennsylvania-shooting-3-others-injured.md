Plumber Paul Shay, 64, and his wife, Pratt professor Monica Shay, 58, who live on East 10th Street, were seriously wounded&#x2014;Monica Shay is not expected to survive&#x2014;while their nephew Joseph Shay, 43, was killed in Douglass Township.  Also slain was 2-year-old Gregory Erdmann III, the son of Joseph Shay&apos;s girlfriend Kathryn Erdmann, who  was wounded.

He was released in 1998, state records show. More recently, he was imprisoned for nearly two years in New York for grand larceny - the theft of $1,000 or more. He was released about a year ago, according to state records.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Joseph Shay had recently been living with his aunt and uncle in the East Village; a neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405071316/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/family_bloodbath_rQ5QqDVTDvATSYsfARovSI">told the Post</a>, &quot;He was just coming out of jail, and Paul took him in. He gave him a place to work at his company, A Real Good Plumber.&quot; Another told the Daily News that he had a confrontation with a man in the Shays&apos; East 10th building last week, &quot;They weren&apos;t shouting, but it was a weird confrontation.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: There&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405071316/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/20110704_SWAT_team_surrounds_Trainer__Pa__home.html">standoff outside a house in Trainer, Pennsylvania</a>&#x2014;&quot;Tear gas and percussion bombs were fired by a police SWAT team into a two-story townhouse.&quot; Apparently there may be a connection to the shooting.</p>
