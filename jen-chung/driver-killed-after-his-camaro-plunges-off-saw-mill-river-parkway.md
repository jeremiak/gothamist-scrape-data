<p>A man died early this morning after crashing his car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095833/http://pix11.com/2014/07/30/1-dead-after-car-falls-from-overpass-in-dobbs-ferry/">through a Saw Mill River Parkway guard rail and plunging 35 feet</a>.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the Ashford Avenue Bridge in Dobbs Ferry. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095833/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/2014/07/30/man-killed-ashford-avenue-bridge-dobbs-ferry/13350367/">According to the Journal News</a>, &quot;The victim&apos;s identity was not released, but police said he was driving a 2010 Chevrolet Camaro northbound on the parkway when he exited at Exit 17 and drove off the bridge about 12:10 a.m. The man was the only person in the car. No other injuries were reported.&quot;</p>

The man, who was driving a newer Dodge Charger, repeatedly told officers he was there because he believed his friend had been killed, but, when pressed, could not or would not name the friend. Whether he had any involvement in the crash was not yet clear.&quot;</p>

<p>The bridge is being inspected for damage.<br>
