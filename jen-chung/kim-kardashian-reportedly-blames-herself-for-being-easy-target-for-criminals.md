<p>Parisian authorities continue to investigate the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/02/kanye_kim_meadows_fest_paris_nyc.php">$10 million gunpoint jewelry robbery of Kim Kardashian</a>, which some suspect might be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/04/kardashian_jewelry_heist_inside_job.php">an inside job</a>. Apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://www.tmz.com/2016/10/04/kim-kardashian-surveillance-video-cellphone-robbery/">no surveillance cameras actually faced</a> the exclusive hotel where the heist took place, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3821772/Kim-heist-robbers-not-caught-CCTV-security-camera-inside-outside-building-facing-away-police-resort-asking-local-businesses-filmed-it.html">camera at a nail salon may have footage</a>&#x2014;via a mirror&#x2014;of the robbers.</p>

<p>The incident happened just after 2 a.m. on Monday, when Kardashian was in Paris for its Fashion Week. Kardashian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/kim_kardashian_west_paris_robbery.php">was tied up and gagged</a> after two men, who were allegedly dressed like police officers, stormed her suite at the H&#xF4;tel de Pourtal&#xE8;s and took millions in jewelry, including a multi-million dollar diamond ring. Her bodyguard was not present, because he was accompanying her sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner to a nightclub. Her husband Kanye West was performing at the Meadows Festival in NYC when he was told about the robbery, prompting him to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/02/kanye_kim_meadows_fest_paris_nyc.php">end his set early.</a> </p>

<p>Kardashian returned to NYC, and has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://www.tmz.com/2016/10/05/kim-kardashian-concierge-robbery-witness/">been speaking with French police by phone</a> about the concierge who was forced by the robbers (there were a total of five suspects) to open her suite. From TMZ:</p><blockquote>-- The concierge was handcuffed when he opened the door to her apartment.<br>
-- As she put it, &quot;He opened the door and led them [the robbers] up and was in there the whole time.&quot;<br>
-- Kim told police she engaged the concierge in conversation, saying, &quot;Are we gonna die?&quot; He calmly responded, &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;<br>
-- Kim, we&apos;re told, made a point to cops that the concierge was extremely calm, despite being cuffed and held at gunpoint.<br>
-- Kardashian says when the robbers left the apartment they took the concierge with them and deposited him in the lobby where his hands were still cuffed.</blockquote><p></p>

The robbery comes as various parties have been victim-blaming Kardashian for being too flashy with her jewelry and making her movements too known to her millions of followers on social media. A former member of the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; robbery crew, made up of Serbians, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/04/an-ex-pink-panther-on-his-old-crew-blamed-for-robbing-kim-kardashian.html">told the Daily Beast</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Kim Kardashian is very active on social media. She likes to expose what she has. She had a diamond ring that&#x2019;s worth $4-5 million. She puts it on social media and therefore everybody else knows about it. This happened to her at this hotel she stayed in. I&#x2019;m happy that&#x2019;s she not hurt and happy that she didn&#x2019;t have her family there, like her kids. She helped the bandits, the ones that pulled the caper off, because she advertises what she has. Everybody knows that Kanye gave her that ring. She wears it with pride...

<p>Everybody knows that Kim Kardashian is an easy target. She&#x2019;s by herself and you know who the people are that work in the service industry in Paris and all over Europe. These are the Croatians and Serbians. These are the waiters, door men, and cleaning people. They work in the modeling industry. And they have friends that have friends that have friends.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s so easy to pick up a phone and say hey Kim Kardashian is here in room so and so. You know how fast they can set this up? They know the area. They know the hotel because she came there a couple of times already. They just waited for her and they knew she was coming for fashion week. This was a preplanned inside job and they pulled it off. </p></blockquote><p></p>

If you are that famous and you put all your jewelry on the net, you go to hotels where nobody can come near to the room. You cannot display your wealth and then be surprised that some people want to share it with you.&quot;</p>

<p>There have been some people with even wilder theories as well&#x2014;a Daily News columnist believes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-paris-robbery-good-true-article-1.2815747">this is just a plot line for her reality show</a>, while a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://nypost.com/2016/10/04/why-its-so-hard-to-trust-the-kardashian-who-cried-wolf/">Post writer opines</a>, &quot;As the biggest &apos;reality&apos; star of the past two decades, Kim Kardashian has become famous for her ability to control her own reality and to define it for us, to control her own narrative. The very notion of some aspect of her story being out of her control seems, ironically, unreal,&quot; and cites online commenters as proof there&apos;s skepticism about the crime. </p>

<p>Other publications such <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/when-women-signify-too-much?mbid=social_twitter">as the New Yorker</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/https://theawl.com/female-trouble-8fa395b3daec#.kgkcwb1o9">The Awl</a> have written pieces defending Kardashian and exploring the difficulty of being a female celebrity.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-west-blaming-herself-after-robbery-doesnt-want-kanye-replace-ring/">A source tells People</a>, &quot;Kim&#x2019;s in shock and blaming herself. She&#x2019;s tearing herself up that she Snapchatted the ring so much and wore it all the time. This incident is making her question everything. How she dresses, what she does.&quot;</p>

<p>Kardashian, West and their children are reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013442/http://therealdeal.com/2016/08/31/kim-and-kanye-score-free-tribeca-penthouse-through-airbnb/">holed up in their free Tribeca penthouse</a>, courtesy of Airbnb.</p>
