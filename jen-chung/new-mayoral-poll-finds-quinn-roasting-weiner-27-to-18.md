<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822020236/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/weiner_spitzer_now_frontrunners_in.php">recent mayoral polls</a> showing that disgraced former Congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822020236/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/weiner_swells_to_slight_lead_over_q.php">Anthony Weiner was leading</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822020236/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/07/12/nyregion/mayoral-polls.html">eroding her support</a>, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822020236/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/christine-quinn-launch-launch-major-tv-ad-campaign-article-1.1401782?localLinksEnabled=false">is launching a new ad blitz</a>. But now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822020236/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/nyregion/voters-approve-of-citys-progress-poll-finds-but-seek-empathetic-mayor.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">NY Times/Siena College poll</a> shows her with a hefty lead!</p>

<p>According to the Times, &quot;The poll found that among Democratic voters, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, is leading the field, with support from 27 percent, followed by Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman, who was supported by 18 percent. Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller, were each backed by 11 percent of Democratic voters, while John C. Liu, the current comptroller, had support from 7 percent.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, 61% of voters think that empathy&#x2014;&quot;a candidate&#x2019;s ability to understand the needs and problems of ordinary New Yorkers&quot;&#x2014;was critical in selecting the next mayor. One respondent, a 32-year-old female freelance film editor in Brooklyn, told the Times, &quot;I feel over all she will be fairly similar to Bloomberg, but that she&#x2019;s willing to go further in terms of making the city better for middle- and lower-class people, especially in terms of child care and education. She thinks more compassionately than the other candidates, and will govern more compassionately.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Weiner has as much support as Quinn from &quot;Brooklyn residents, parents, union households, and voters 65 and older.&quot; One 62-year-old woman from Queens explained, &quot;I like Anthony Weiner. I think he&#x2019;s really smart and concerned about helping put together things for the city.&quot;</p>
