<p>A little girl left alone at the Port Authority Bus Terminal yesterday morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119033331/http://nypost.com/2016/11/15/abandoned-girl-leads-cops-to-dead-mom-in-possible-love-triangle-gone-bad/">worried good Samaritans</a> who took her to a police station. Authorities subsequently discovered that the five-year-old&apos;s mother had been killed in a Connecticut apartment.</p>

<p>The girl, who was found before 10 a.m., allegedly said that her father, Elmer Gomez Ruono, 32, left her at the station, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119033331/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/local/article/Large-police-presence-at-Stamford-apartment-10613731.php">Stamford police said</a> that surveillance video shows them entering the station from a bus. </p>

<p>The child&apos;s parents had recently separated and the girl and her mother had moved from Flemington, NJ to Stamford, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119033331/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/5-Year-Old-Girl-Found-Alone-Port-Authority-Bus-Terminal-401163885.html">according to NBC New York</a>: &quot;Police said there were a few friends and family over the small one-bedroom apartment Sunday night and that there was some sort of domestic dispute after guests left the party, and that&apos;s when [the mother] was killed.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119033331/http://abc7ny.com/news/search-on-for-father-after-girl-abandoned-at-terminal-mother-found-dead/1607598/">WABC 7 reports</a> that, according to sources, &quot;the girl did not appear harmed or traumatized, but they believe she may have been witnessed some of the crime.&quot;</p>

<p>It appears the girl&apos;s mother, a 30-year-old Guatemalan national, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119033331/http://patch.com/connecticut/stamford/stamford-police-investigate-possible-homicide">died in a struggle</a>.</p>

<p>Stamford police caption Richard Conklin said, &quot;We know very, very little because they only moved here within the last day or two from New Jersey. We are struggling to come up to speed on this very rapidly.&quot;</p>

<p>Police are seeking Ruono.</p>
