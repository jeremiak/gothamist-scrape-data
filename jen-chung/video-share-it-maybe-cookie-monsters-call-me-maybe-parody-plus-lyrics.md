<p>We have known that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506133814/http://www.sesamestreet.org/">Cookie Monster</a> is a fan of Carly Rae Jepsen&apos;s &quot;Call Me Maybe,&quot; after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506133814/http://twitter.com/sesamestreet/status/214821338983043073">he Tweeted</a> last month, &quot;Me just met you. Dis is crazy. But me love cookies! Gimme, maybe?&quot;  And now Cookie Monster has put his own stamp on the infectious song with his version, &quot;Share It Maybe&quot;:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506133814if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/-qTIGg3I5y8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Clearly, it&apos;s a nod to Jepsen&apos;s low-fi, classroom instrument version of the song she did with Jimmy Fallon and The Roots (see it below), with a little bit of The Office thrown in. Who cares if toddlers will get it&#x2014;<em>their parents and baby-sitters will love it</em>!  Anyway, here&apos;s a rough transcription of &quot;Share Me Maybe&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>Me got a wish on me mind
It is a chocolate chip kind 
Me look at you and me tell
You may have snickerdoodle 
Me trade me soul for a bite
Me spell it out black and white 
Me look at you and me see
You like an elf in a tree                  

<p>You, cookie-showing, and me hunger growing<br>
Let&apos;s get skim milk flowing <br>
We&apos;ll start this snack going baby </p>

<p>Hey, me just met you<br>
And this is crazy <br>
But you got cookie <br>
So share it maybe <br>
It&apos;s hard to look at<br>
Your snack baby<br>
But you got cookie<br>
So share it maybe</p>

<p>Hey, me just met you<br>
And this is crazy <br>
But you got cookie <br>
So share it maybe <br>
Cuppy-cake with frosting <br>
It don&apos;t phase me<br>
But you got cookie<br>
So share it maybe</p>

<p>You took you time with the bite <br>
Me trying to stay polite<br>
Me start to really freak out <br>
Please someone call the girl scout <br>
Me no grumble or grouse <br>
It&apos;s taking toll on me house<br>
Me going off me rocker<br>
Please give me Betty Crocker </p>

<p>You, cookie-showing, and me hunger growing<br>
Let&apos;s get skim milk flowing <br>
We&apos;ll start this snack going baby </p>

<p>Hey, me just met you<br>
And this is crazy <br>
But you got cookie <br>
So share it maybe <br>
It&apos;s hard to look at<br>
Your snack baby<br>
But you got cookie<br>
So share it maybe</p>

<p>Hey, me just met you<br>
And this is crazy <br>
But you got cookie <br>
So share it maybe <br>
Pie and ice cream <br>
It don&apos;t phase me<br>
But you got cookie<br>
So share it maybe</p>

<p>Before you came into me life<br>
Me missed you so bad, <br>
Me missed you so bad, <br>
Me missed you so, so bad<br>
Before you came into me life<br>
Me missed you so bad, <br>
And you should know that, <br>
Me missed you so, so bad<br>
Bad&#x2026; bad&#x2026; bad&#x2026; bad&#x2026;</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s hard to look at your snack, baby <br>
But you got cookie, so share it maybe <br>
Hey, me just met you<br>
And this is crazy<br>
But you got cookie<br>
So share it maybe<br>
Chocolate pudding<br>
It no phase me<br>
But you got cookie<br>
So share it maybe</p></blockquote>So, this can be the last &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot; parody, right?<p></p>
