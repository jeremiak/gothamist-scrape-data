					<p>After a week of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085333/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/smell_it_stinky_corpse_flower_set_t.php">anxious waiting</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085333/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/25/stink_flower_delay.php#photo-1">and breathless anticipation</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085333/http://www.nybg.org/exhibitions/2016/corpse-flower.php">New York Botanical Garden&apos;s <em>Amorphophallus titanum</em></a>&#x2014;the CORPSE FLOWER&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085333/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/28/corpse_flower_is_here_2016.php">is finally blooming</a> for you to see and smell, but only another 24 hours, give or take.</p>

<p>The NYBG had been cultivating eight Amorphophallus titanum plants, and last week, one sprouted a spike that flowers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085333/http://www.chicagobotanic.org/sites/default/files/images/titan/Life-Cycle-of-the-Titan-Arum.jpg">most years, it&apos;s just a plant with leaves</a>). Marc Hachadourian, Director of the Nolen Greenhouses for Living Collections at The New York Botanical Garden, told us, &quot;It&#x2019;s a real botanical oddity that most people don&#x2019;t even know exists much less have an opportunity to see one in person.  The plant has a bit of a legendary status in the botanical and horticultural community because of it being one of the largest flowers in the world and for a long time being a rarity in cultivation. Of course after 9 years of care in our greenhouses finally getting the plant to bloom is a celebration of our patience as much as horticultural skill.&quot;</p>

<p>The corpse flower started blooming around 4 p.m. yesterday, and has a brief (only up to 36 hours) window of powerful stench before it wilts. Photograph Sai Mokhtari visited the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory for a glimpse last night and said it barely smelled when she first got there, but by the time she left, &quot;The smell was really starting to become more intense &#x2014;especially when you got close to the flower. Like rotting overcooked cabbage.&quot;</p>

<p>One admirer was Facetiming a friend to show him the flower, she added he &quot;had taken the week off from work so that he would be available in case the flower started to bloom.&quot; </p>

<p>Another visitor to the NYBG was a construction worker, who said he came straight to the Bronx from his lower Manhattan construction site. &quot;He figured he could forgo the post-work shower by standing next to the stink flower,&quot; Mokhtari notes. &quot;He went straight for the flower and sat in front of it for three hours until they kicked him out, and he&apos;s hoping rain will cancel work tomorrow so he can come back.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ll have more about the flower later. But if you can head to the NYBG today, there are extended hours today, 9 a.m.-8 p.m., just for Stinky.</p>
