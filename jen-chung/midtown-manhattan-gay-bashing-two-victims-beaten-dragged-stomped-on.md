                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_04_victimsgaybach.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232932im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_victimsgaybach.jpg" width="371" height="252"> <br> <i style=" width:371px; ;display:block"> Photos of the victims (WABC 7)</i></div> The Port Authority Police have arrested two men for allegedly attacking a pair of gay men in Midtown early this morning.  This comes after the Sunday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232932/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/knicks_fans_accused_of_beating_up_g.php">attack of two gay men</a> a few blocks away, apparently by Knicks fans yelling gay slurs.<p></p>

<p>The two victims were unable to get into an after-hours billiards club on West 32nd Street, and then about five men started to yell slurs at them and beat them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232932/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Gay-Couple-Attacked-Hate-Crime-Bias-MSG-PATH-Station-33rd-Street-206950961.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;The couple tried to flee, and the men followed them and continued the attack. Police say they stomped on one of the men and dragged and kicked the other. The group ended up outside the PATH station on 33rd Street, where Port Authority police broke up the beating.&quot;</p>

<p>The victims suffered facial injuries and were treated at Bellevue. The police arrested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232932/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9097853">Asllan Berisha, 21, and Brian Ramirez, 21</a>, and charged with hate crimes of felony assault, according to WABC 7. Additionally, the other suspects fled. </p>

<p>City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said, &quot;I am outraged by this string of assaults. These vicious assaults are not reflective of the diversity that defines New York City. Our city prides itself on its inclusiveness, and hateful slurs and physical attacks against anyone, for any reason, go against the very fabric of what makes our City great. I thank the NYPD Hate Crime&#x2019;s Task Force and the PAPD for their continued work to identify and bring those responsible for these heinous attacks to justice, and urge all New Yorkers to stay alert, safe and vigilant.&#x201D;</p>
