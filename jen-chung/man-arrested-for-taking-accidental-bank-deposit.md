Newsday reports that Carlos Morales&apos; account was &quot;mistakenly credited&quot;&#x2014;which really means &quot;A bank teller had erroneously deposited these funds.&quot;  Morales withdrew the money over a five-month period and Nassau County&apos;s Crimes Against Property Squad said even though Capitol One &quot;contacted the defendant on numerous occasions asking the defendant to return the funds,&quot; Morales didn&apos;t respond.  He is now charged with grand larceny.  Also, if the ATM &quot;accidentally&quot; gives you more money than it should, report it and return it or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507212524/http://www.ksla.com/global/story.asp?S=6855423">you could faces charges</a>.</p>
