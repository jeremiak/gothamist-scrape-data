A swastika was found on a Brooklyn sidewalk yesterday morning, and police have released surveillance video of a suspect. Brooklyn rabbi Mordechai Lightstone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://nypost.com/2016/11/13/new-school-dorm-vandalized-with-swastikas/">told the Post</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s never good to see these things. But obviously it&#x2019;s not new here, we&#x2019;ve seen these things in the past.&quot;<p></p>

<p>This is comes a day after swastikas were found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/four_dorm_rooms_at_the.php">on the doors of a New School dormitory</a>&#x2014;and a few days after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/trump_graffiti_nyu_prayer_room.php">Muslim prayer room was vandalized</a> at NYU and a Muslim woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/mta_bus_muslim_hate_queens.php">was bullied on a Queens bus</a>. After Donald Trump&apos;s presidential victory, there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://time.com/4569129/racist-anti-semitic-incidents-donald-trump/">has been a spike in hate incidents</a> targeting people of different religions, ethnicities, legal status and sexual orientation or identification. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/donald_trump_on_attackers_targeting.php">During his 60 Minutes interview</a> last Friday, President-elect Trump claimed to have only heard of &quot;one or two&quot; hate incidents, but said he was &quot;so saddened to hear&quot; about others, &quot;I say, &apos;Stop it.&apos; If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.&quot; While campaigning, Trump and his son Donald Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/03/trumps_anti-semitic_hillary_meme_wa.php">have shared</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/20/thanks_for_ruining_skittles_donald.php">endorsed memes</a> created by white supremacists. </p>

<p>Reflecting on the recent troubling incidents, Lightstone said to the Post, &quot;We need to use [the election results] to galvanize our communities toward doing more good, reaching out to each other and increasing goodness towards all people. We need to realize there can be a good and important outcome from all this.&quot; Here are some tips on what to do if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042844/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/native_new_yorker_racism.php">see someone acting racist and hateful</a>.<br>
