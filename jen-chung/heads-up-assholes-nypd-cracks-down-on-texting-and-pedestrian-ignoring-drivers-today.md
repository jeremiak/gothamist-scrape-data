<p>Drivers, think twice before failing to yield to pedestrians or using your cellphone: The NYPD is on day one of a two-day crackdown on drivers who aren&apos;t paying attention to the rules of the road. </p>

<p>The NYPD announced last night that it was started a &quot;citywide initiative to address the use of cell phones/texting while driving and failing to yield to pedestrians.&quot;</p><blockquote> The NYPD reminds all New Yorkers that the use of a hand held cell phone and texting while driving a vehicle is illegal. Driving while operating, talking, or texting on a cell phone or other similar hand-held device is extremely dangerous and endangers the safety of both drivers and pedestrians.<br>
 <br>
In addition, preserving the right of way for pedestrians is a primary focus of the NYPD&#x2019;s traffic safety mission. Motor vehicle operators are also reminded that yielding to pedestrians at intersections is paramount to the safety of all New Yorkers.<br>
