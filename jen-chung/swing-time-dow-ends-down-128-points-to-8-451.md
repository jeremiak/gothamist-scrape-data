</div></div>					<p>Traders really need this weekend after stocks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224039/http://www.cnbc.com/id/27115872">swung in a 1,000 point range</a> on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  The stock market <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528224039/http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2008-10-10-stocks-friday_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip">fell 696 points in the first 15 minutes</a> but managed to recover and even trade above the open.  At the end of the day, the market closed down 128 points, to 8,451.  Nasdaq ended slightly up, +0.27%, while the S&amp;P; 500 ended -1.18% down.</p>

<p>Knight Equity Trading&apos;s Peter Kenny told CNBC, &quot;We&apos;re seeing asset classes across the board being sold--commodities, energy, equities, bonds, you name it.  Everything is being sold. That&apos;s a sure sign that we&apos;re reaching some sort of tipping point in the market and market psychology.&quot;  Some banking stocks--Wachovia, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup--were up as were GE (profit was in line with market expectations), Apple and eBay.  </p>
