The victims are ages 50-71 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009063800/http://wcbstv.com/local/asian.women.attacked.2.1621825.html">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;Police say the five assaults on Asian women took place over the last ten days within a nine-block area right near the Williamsburg Bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>Three of the attacks occurred at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009063800/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/manbaruch.shtml">Baruch Houses</a>, while another was at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009063800/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/mangompersamuel.shtml">Gompers Houses</a> and another on Broadway near City Hall. Police, who have released surveillance video from the first attack, say that three men and two women are wanted for questioning: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009063800/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7376810">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;They typically wait in the lobbies of the apartment complexes for their prey. They surround the victims, and the young women beat them with their hands and fists while the young men watch. No money has been taken in the attacks, and there has been no prior contact between the victims and their attackers, according to investigators.&quot;</p>
