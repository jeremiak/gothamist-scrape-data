</div></div>					<p>Back in 2004, the huge Domino Sugar Factory on the Williamsburg waterfront <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052643/http://gothamist.com/2004/07/01/sugary_land_deal_domino_sugar_plant_purchased.php">was purchased by a developer</a> who had a hand in gentrifying Fourth Avenue in Park Slope, in partnership with Community Preservation Company. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052643/http://www.thenewdomino.com/index.php?section=index.html">Ambitious plans</a> for a mixed-use development were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052643/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/05/domino_sugar_refinery_development_f.php#photo-6">drawn up and shown to the public</a>  Now, the Daily News reports that DUMBO mega-developer Two Trees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052643/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/domino-sugar-factory-site-brooklyn-sold-160-million-article-1.1092844?localLinksEnabled=false">may be buying the building and land for $160 million</a>... if it&apos;s not blocked by one of the parties.</p>

<p>According to the News, &quot;Two Trees made its offer to the site&#x2019;s current owners, a troubled partnership between Community Preservation Company (CPC) and Katan Group. Katan, in a statement, announced it would attempt to block the Two Trees deal and accused CPC of cutting an agreement behind their backs.&quot;  Katan said, &quot;We were very surprised to learn of this purported deal. It&#x2019;s disappointing that our supposed partner has hidden this negotiation from us. We are studying the possible deal, but one thing is obvious: CPC is undervaluing the asset yet again.&quot;</p>

<p>Katan and CPC bought the building for $40 million; Katan thinks it&apos;s worth $200 million. Katan is also suing CPC over allegedly mismanaging the project and using funds from its $125 million loan.</p>

<p>A local broker told the News, &quot;Two Trees know how to build on the waterfront and they know historic conversion... They would get this done. If it gets held up in court, it&#x2019;s the people of Williamsburg who lose. Right now, Domino is like this void in the neighborhood.&quot; Well, whoever develops it will probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052643/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/01/lawsuit_tries_to_slow_new_domino_de.php">face neighborhood opposition</a> if they propose a huge complex.</p>

<p>We still think our idea of the factory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052643/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/31/video_of_the_da_92.php">becoming a museum would be awesome</a>.  Anyway, for fun, here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052643/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/video_breaking_into_brooklyns_indus.php">video of the Undercity crew breaking into the factory</a>:</p>
