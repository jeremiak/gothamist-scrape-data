The Sun reports NYPIRG would likely &quot;join a fight against such a vote court,&quot; with NYPIRG senior attorney Gene Russianoff pointing out that voters approved term limits in both 1993 and 1996.  (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063937/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/08/24/2008-08-24_pol_bloomberg_would_cross_line_if_he_kos.html">same sentiment was echoed</a> by former public advocate and mayoral candidate Mark Green.)  But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063937/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/08/23/2008-08-23_pols_urging_quinn_to_can_2term_rule.html">Daily News&apos; Adam Lisberg explained</a> why City Council Speaker Christine Quinn might be inclined to make a run at changing term limits; one reason might be &quot;she would get a graceful exit from a mayor&apos;s race that looks increasing worrisome for her.&quot;</p>
