<p>Here&apos;s the official schedule for the city&apos;s September 11 commemoration events tomorrow.  Mayor Bloomberg, NY Governor David Paterson, NJ Governor Jon Corzine, Homeland Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani will make introductions or deliver readings at Zuccotti Park.  And the victims&apos; names will be read by a family member plus a student representing the victim&apos;s native country.  This will probably be the last year victims&apos; families can descend into the &quot;pit,&quot; given the Ground Zero construction plans ahead.  (Details about the Tribute in Light after the jump.)</p>
