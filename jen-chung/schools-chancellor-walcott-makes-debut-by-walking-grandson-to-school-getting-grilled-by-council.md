Walcott, who also attended PS 36 when he was a boy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/fresh_chance_for_city_schools_BP8vnCY1M47akVnYnNedJM">told reporters</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t want him to be late on my first day.&quot;  Of course, parents and teachers said they couldn&apos;t recall seeing Grandpa Dennis there before, but that&apos;s okay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/walcott-and-a-little-pal-go-back-to-their-school/">with one dad telling City Room</a>, &quot;It makes me feel good because we&#x2019;ll probably get some more money for the school.&quot; The good times ended because then Walcott had a four-hour meeting with an irritated City Council!<p></p>

<p>Walcott&apos;s predecessor, former publishing executive Cathie Black, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/breaking_schools_chancellor_cathie.php">pushed aside on Thursday</a> after just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/black_out_pols_and_parents_respond.php">95 (dismal) days</a> on the job overseeing the largest public school system in the country.  Walcott has been a deputy mayor under Mayor Bloomberg since 2001, and while many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/black_out_pols_and_parents_respond.php">applauded his appointment</a>, the Council is upset at the city&apos;s plan to cut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/nyc_outlines_4675_teacher_layoffs_i.php">thousands of teachers</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/nyregion/09walcott.html">According to the NY Times</a>, City Councilman G. Oliver Koppell told him, &quot;Saying you&#x2019;re going to have to lay off teachers is a very ominous statement. What you should be saying is, &#x2018;I hope we&#x2019;re not going to have to lay off teachers,&apos;&quot; while Councilman Charles Barron &quot;dismissively [said] that Mr. Walcott was &apos;smooth enough, sharp enough,&apos; and that he would have an answer for everything.&quot; Speaking of&#x2014;some think he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045757/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2011/04/08/2011-04-08_dennis_walcott_successor_to_exschools_chancellor_cathie_black_hailed_as_all_that.html">great mayor material</a>, &quot;An African American [with credibility on Wall Street] and the mayor&apos;s backing would be virtually unbeatable.&quot;</p>
