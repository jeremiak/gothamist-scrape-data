<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012-02_gronk1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014430im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012-02_gronk1.jpg" width="300" height="345" class="image-right"> </span>Rob Gronkowski is the New England Patriots&apos; tight end, which means his sworn enemies are anyone from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014430/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/patriots_star_disses_rex_ryan_as_je.php#photo-1">Jets</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014430/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/super_bowl.php">Giants</a>.  So at an appearance at the University of Rhode Island, Gronkowski took the bait to say something naughty about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014430/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/21/oh_dear_god_jets_acquire_tim_tebow.php">newest Jet/Godsend</a>, Tim Tebow.  </p>

<p>When asked who he would &quot;f***, marry or kill&quot; among the choices of Rex Ryan, Betty White, and Tim Tebow, Gronkowski replied, &quot;Well, I would eff Tebow to take his virginity.&quot;  Which brought down the house!</p>

<p>Now, it doesn&apos;t seem that Gronkowski answered the rest of the question, but obviously he would want to kill Rex Ryan, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014430/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/22/does_rex_ryans_wife_have_pretty_fee.php">you wouldn&apos;t want to marry him... would you</a>?</p>

<p>Also, Gronkowski has been in the news for his outlandish tactics to get more Twitter followers&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014430/http://www.nesn.com/2011/10/bibi-jones-reveals-rob-gronkowski-jealous-of-her-twitter-following-though-nothing-happened-between-t.html">i.e., pose with porn star Bibi Jones</a>.</p>
