<p>No lightweights for this undercover work: The NJ Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control has announced it found 29 bars duped customers by substituting cheap liquor in premium bottles. &quot;Operation Swill&quot; found that restaurants like T.G.I. Friday&apos;s franchises and Ruby Tuesday were after bigger profits&#x2014;DUH x 10,000,000. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150233/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/top-shelf_scheme_authorities_r.html#incart_m-rpt-2">Star-Ledger reports</a>, &quot;The investigation began as a result of complaints, confidential informants and new technology used to test liquor covertly purchased at the establishments by detectives.&quot; And it involved 100 investigators!  </p>

<p>A spokesperson for T.G.I. Friday&apos;s said it was &quot;aware of this issue and is working closely with the franchisee and owner of the cited locations to review and investigate these serious allegations... We have one of the most extensive bar and beverage programs in the industry, which sets a very high standard in the quality and service of our beverages.&quot; </p>
