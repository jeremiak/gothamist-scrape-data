Simeonette Mapes&apos; uncle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724190434/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/kin_of_slain_si_teacher_she_was_enkkboD1thmV34uUxgt9OL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Staten%20Island">told the Post</a>, &quot;Anybody that had ever known her would say that she was an angel &#x2014; and to me, she really was.&quot; Apparently when 15 students couldn&apos;t pay for graduation caps and gowns, she paid for them.</p>

<p>Mapes, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724190434/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/06/slain_si_woman_had_brush_with_gun_v.php">taught at the School for Classics</a>: An Academy of Thinkers, Writers and Performers in East New York, Brooklyn, was found in the apartment&apos;s entryway by her husband and fellow teacher, Jonathan Crupi,  around 2 p.m.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724190434/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/husband-slain-teacher-hires-lawyer-arrest-brutal-slay-article-1.1109486">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Crupi, 30, told police he made the shocking discovery. His wife was in a pool of blood and the condo appeared to have been ransacked. Oddly, the couple&#x2019;s dogs were locked in a room and neighbors didn&#x2019;t hear them barking, police sources said. The dogs would have reacted to the presence of a stranger. There were no signs of forced entry. And sources said no valuables were taken, including an expensive Movado watch.&quot; </p>

<p>Crupi now has a lawyer, but has not been named a suspect.  </p>
