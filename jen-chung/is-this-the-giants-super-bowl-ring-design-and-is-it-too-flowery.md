<p>Yesterday, Giants linebacker Clint Sintim Tweeted photos of what he claimed were the team&apos;s new Super Bowl XLVI ring, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014436/https://twitter.com/#!/ClintSintim52/status/185439075258482688">later wrote</a>, &quot;Saw the ring online not official yet....official release will be presented by GIants organization... Sorry.&quot;  Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014436/https://twitter.com/#!/JustinTuckNYG91/status/185444763560976385">Justin Tuck said</a>,  &#x201C;People, I don&#x2019;t know who started the post of the ring. But we haven&#x2019;t decided on the final ring yet. Still working on it.&quot;  Well, some NYC jewelers hope so, because they think it sucks!</p>

<p>Diamond District jeweler Marc Hernandez sniffed to the Daily Nes, &quot;If this is Tiffany&#x2019;s work, they could have done a lot better. We&#x2019;re talking the Super Bowl &#x2014; this looks like a high school ring.&quot; (Tiffany&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014436/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/10table_super_b.php">designed the team&apos;s 2008 Ten-Table ring</a>.) And Eric Aranbaye of  Rafaello and Co. added, &quot;I could have done better. I don&#x2019;t know if the Giants are going to like this. It&#x2019;s flowery &#x2014; for a lady.&quot;</p>

<p>Giants VP Pat Hanlon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014436/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/super_bowl_ring_of_truth_DWaUQcGGmJVQXLjoLHS9xH">told the Post</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s under design, I know. I do not know if it&#x2019;s been finalized.&quot;</p>
