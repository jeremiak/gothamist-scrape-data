<p>A &quot;trailblazing jurist&quot; who was the first African-American woman to serve on the New York State Appellate Court was found dead yesterday. The body of Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam was discovered in the Hudson River near West 132nd Street Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Police say the NYPD Harbor Unit removed her body from the water and EMS pronounced her dead. Abdus-Salaam was 65 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420082256/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/appeals-court-judge-found-dead-hudson-river-article-1.3049391">had apparently been reported missing</a> on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The NYC Medical Examiner will determine cause of death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420082256/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/appeals-court-judge-found-dead-hudson-river-article-1.3049391">According to the Daily News</a>, her body was &quot;fully clothed... Police sources said there were no signs of obvious trauma or injuries indicating foul play.&quot; <b>Update</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420082256/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/judge-sheila-abdus-salaam-committed-suicide-police-article-1.3051425">A News&apos; source says</a> that Abdus-Salaam &quot;was struggling with depression and likely took her own life... It was unclear if [she] left behind a suicide note, and cops were awaiting the results of an autopsy before saying anything more, the source told the Daily News.&quot;</p>

<p>Abdus-Salaam, who lived on West 131st Street in Harlem, was born in Washington D.C.&#x2014;her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420082256/https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/jasalaam.htm">Court of Appeals bio notes</a> she was &quot;educated in its public schools&quot;&#x2014;and graduated from Barnard College and later Columbia Law School.  She graduated from Barnard College in 1974 and received her J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1977. She worked as an Assistant Attorney General in the New York State Department of Law, Civil Rights and Real Estate Financing Bureaus and was General Counsel for the New York City Office of Labor Services. After serving as a New York State Civil Court Judge and Supreme Court Judge, Governor David Paterson appointed her as an Associate Justice of the Appellate Division in 2009.</p>

<p>In 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo appointed her to the New York Court of Appeals. Today Cuomo said, &quot;Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam was a trailblazing jurist whose life in public service was in pursuit of a more fair and more just New York for all. As the first African-American woman to be appointed to the State&#x2019;s Court of Appeals, she was a pioneer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Through her writings, her wisdom, and her unshakable moral compass, she was a force for good whose legacy will be felt for years to come,&quot; his statement continued. &quot;I was proud to appoint her to the state&#x2019;s highest court and am deeply saddened by her passing. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest sympathies to her family, loved ones and colleagues during this trying and difficult time.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420082256/http://nypost.com/2017/04/12/judge-washes-up-dead-along-the-hudson-river/">From the NY Post</a>:</p><blockquote> Former US Attorney General Eric Holder, who went to Columbia with Abdus-Salaam, was in attendance for her historic [2013] swearing-in ceremony and described how she had &#x201C;defined herself by her relentless pursuit of excellence&#x201D; &#x2014; while also managing to be a great dancer.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Sheila could boogie,&#x201D; Holder joked at the time. &#x201C;She was witty and a great deal of fun to spend time with.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Abdus-Salaam went on to note how unlikely her and Holder&#x2019;s professional achievements in law would have been four decades ago.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Who knew that we would both attain such high positions, and that you would be the first black United States attorney general, and I would be the first black woman on the New York Court of Appeals?&#x201D; she told him with a big smile.</p></blockquote><p></p>

She also tended to lean toward injured parties who brought claims of misconduct, fraud or breach of contract against wealthy corporations. Among her colleagues, she was admired for her thoughtfulness, her candor and her finely crafted and restrained writing style. She was not one to use her decisions as a soapbox to make high-sounding political points or to wax poetic, even when her rulings were precedent-setting.&quot;</p>

<p>The Legal Aid Society&apos;s Attorney-in-Chief, Seymour W. James Jr., said, &quot;Our hearts ache with the passing of Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam - a judicial stalwart renowned for her intellect, and commitment to the law, morality, fairness, and justice. She leaves a lasting impact on New York - from her time as a legal services attorney fighting on behalf of low-income families, to her tenure as the first African-American woman to preside on the State&apos;s highest court. We extend our deepest condolences to her family and everyone she touched over the course of her life during this difficult time.&quot;</p>

<p>Abdus-Salaam&apos;s friends and neighbors in Harlem reportedly admired her integrity. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420082256/http://nypost.com/2017/04/12/friends-neighbors-say-judge-found-dead-was-squeaky-clean/">In an interview with the NY Post</a>, a friend admitted he tried to ask her to &quot;pull some strings&quot; for him, &quot;She was totally unbiased... She said, &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t abuse my power.&apos; Anyone, most anyone, would have been making phone calls. She didn&#x2019;t do that. That&#x2019;s how clean she was.&quot;</p>
