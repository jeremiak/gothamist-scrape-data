<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175811/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/08/summer_allegedly_here.php">Summer is coming</a> and it&apos;s probably going to be a few miserable days in NYC. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175811/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Heat-Wave-Hot-Temperature-90-Degrees-Summer-Storm-Team-4-427776963.html">NBC New York just reported</a>, &quot;By 9 a.m. Sunday, the temperature had already reached 81 degrees. Storm Team 4 warned of poor air quality. Those with asthma and breathing problems should take care. It&apos;s time to break out the sunscreen, with a UV index of 9. That means people can burn in 15-25 minutes if they don&apos;t protect their skin.&quot;</p>

<p>The National Weather Service added that we&apos;re looking at, &quot;highs generally in the lower 90s, feeling slightly warmer with the humidity.&quot;</p>

<p>And there&apos;s an air quality alert in effect, too:</p>

<div><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Air quality alert today into tonight for much of the region. Increasing heat and humidity, more low level ozone, more air pollution. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175811/https://t.co/Sxrckfa6pB">pic.twitter.com/Sxrckfa6pB</a></p>&#x2014; NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175811/https://twitter.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/873877515181449218">June 11, 2017</a></blockquote>
