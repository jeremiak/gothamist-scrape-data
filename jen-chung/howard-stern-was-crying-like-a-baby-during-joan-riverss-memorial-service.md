<p>Yesterday, friends and relatives of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013846/http://gothamist.com/tags/joanrivers">Joan Rivers</a> gathered at Temple Emanu-El on the Upper East Side <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013846/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/07/celebrities_fans_family_mourn_joan.php">to remember the late, great comedienne</a>. Howard Stern gave the eulogy, and he said today on his SiriusXM show, &quot;I was really really rocked by her death,&quot; and revealed that later in the service, &quot;I was crying like a baby.&quot;</p>

<p>Stern said that Melissa Rivers asked him to give the eulogy, but he balked at first, because it was big deal, though he&apos;d do anything for them. So he left his Hamptons home and went back to his NYC apartment to be alone and work on it. He said that Louis CK called him to discuss Rivers, and how she &quot;was like an aunt or a best friend who could make everything better. Even in times&#x2014;let&apos;s say 9/11&#x2014;when she would crack a joke... you didn&apos;t feel so alone... it made you feel better knowing Joan Rivers was making a joke about it... Great comedians have the ability to snap you out of this sadness, this loneliness.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013846/http://margaretcho.com/2014/09/08/putting-the-fun-back-in-funeral/">According to Margaret Cho</a>, Stern began with, &#x201C;Joan Rivers had a dry pussy.&#x201D;</p><blockquote>At first, the words just hung there, as no one knew exactly what to do. Of course I started laughing hysterically, and everyone else, remembering who we were there to honor, followed suit. Howard Stern actually choked back tears as he continued - &#x201C;Joan&#x2019;s pussy was so dry it was like a sponge - so that when she got in the bathtub - whooooosh - all the water would get absorbed in there! Joan said that if Whitney Houston had as dry a pussy as Joan&#x2019;s, she would still be alive today&#x2026;&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>It was so wrong but so right at the same time. So Joan. So great. RIP my friend.</p></blockquote>Hugh Jackman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013846/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMLdtEmufAQ">sang the Peter Allen song</a> &quot;Quiet Please, There&apos;s A Lady On Stage,&quot; which made Stern weep, &quot;I was so fucking moved...I had tears... You know me, I&apos;m a big scumbag. I don&apos;t get moved... Fucking Wolverine is up there singing in a suit!&quot;<p></p>

<p>He also discussed her innovations as a comedienne and a TV personality, and her fight with Fox over her late night talk show:</p>

<p>Stern had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013846/https://twitter.com/BrookeAnderson">said during the eulogy</a>, &quot;I hope Joan is somewhere chasing Johnny Carson with a baseball bat.&quot;</p>
