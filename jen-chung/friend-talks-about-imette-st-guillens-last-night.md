<p>Around 11 p.m. on the night of February 24, 2006, Higgins and St. Guillen headed from Higgins&apos;s Morningside Heights apartment to the Pioneer Bar. In the middle of their time there, Higgins recalled that St. Guillen had about four or five rum and Cokes: &quot;We were all drinking the same amount of drinks, but Imette seemed more drunk.&quot;  By 3:00 a.m., Higgins wanted to leave, but St. Guillen wanted to stay. The pair argued in the bar but eventually St. Guillen agreed to leave.  From the Post:</p><blockquote>When the pair hailed a cab, St. Guillen told Higgins, &quot;You get this one, and I&apos;ll be right behind you.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;I said, &apos;No, I&apos;m not leaving you.&apos; We stood there arguing about leaving,&quot; Higgins recalled.</p>

<p>&quot;Then Imette started walking down Bowery toward Kenmare [Street], and she was very drunk,&quot; Higgins told cops. &quot;After more arguing about leaving her by herself, she kept saying that she wanted to stay out.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
