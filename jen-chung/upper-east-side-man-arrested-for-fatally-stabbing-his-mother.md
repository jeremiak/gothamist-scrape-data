<form mt:asset-id="638643" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <div class="image-left" style=" width:260px; "> <img alt="2011_06_uesfatalstab.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124200im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_uesfatalstab.jpg" width="260" height="172"> <br> <i>Police say a 41-year-old man killed his mother inside their apartment on East 85th Street near Park Avenue.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124200/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/mom_slain_in_posh_apt_stab_horror_AMMwYZPjuADkCEfk90c4jI">According to the Post</a>, Jonathan Schwartz had been arguing with his mother yesterday around 5 p.m.: &quot;Sources said the son, who is unemployed and mentally unstable, then grabbed a knife from the kitchen and repeatedly stabbed the mom, 67, who heads the non-profit Weiden Schwartz Fischler Family Foundation.&quot;

<p>It&apos;s not clear what caused the pair to argue, but Schwartz called 911 and he stayed in the apartment when the police arrived. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124200/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/02/2011-07-02_upper_east_side_man_charged_with_murder_after_stabbing_elderly_mother_to_death_i.html"> A relative told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I just can&apos;t believe it. She loved him, because he&apos;s her son - but he gave her some problems... She did not have an easy time with her children. Jonathan wasn&apos;t working. He was spoiled.&quot;</p>

<p>Schwartz was charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon.  The Post added that Barbara Schwartz&apos;s husband had been out of the apartment at the time of the killing and when he arrived home, he learned his wife had been killed by his stepson.</p></i></div><i>
