<p><em>Saturday Night Live</em> had only a day to re-write whatever cold open existed before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">audio of Donald Trump bragging about his sexual assault techniques</a> emerged, but, of course, they were able to address the matter. In the cold open, Alec Baldwin&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/02/video_alec_baldwin_makes_his_debut.php">eerily perfect Trump</a> actually gives an interview (versus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">his solo, hostage video-style apology</a>) to CNN, so he can &quot;apple-a-gize&quot;:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/5sYGjoUcusM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>&quot;What I am doing is apple-a-gizing to all the people who were offended by my statements. But more importantly, to the people who were turned on by them. I hear it&apos;s really 50/50,&quot; he said. As for why he would say such awful things, Baldwin&apos;s Trump explains, &quot;I was trying to look cool. What normal red-blooded American doesn&#x2019;t want to impress THE Billy Bush?&quot; and notes that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/billy_bush_enabled_donald_trumps_pr.php">Billy Bush</a> is the most important Bush in this election.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, women, if you give me a chance, I can do a whole lot more than just grab it. I can also bop it, twist it and pull it,&quot; Baldwin as Trump exclaimed, gesticulating to show his grabbers. </p>

<p>(The &quot;Trump interview&quot; interrupted a re-broadcast of the Vice Presidential debate, features Mikey Day as Tim Kaine and Bruce Bennett at Mike Pence, with Melissa Villasenor as the moderator. She acknowledged, I&apos;m the new Hispanic castmember and tonight I&apos;ll be playing Asian moderator Elaine Quijano ... because baby steps.&quot;)</p>

<p>Later, Cecily Strong, as the CNN anchor, talks to Kate McKinnon&apos;s  Hillary Clinton, who was apparently preparing for the debate:</p>

<p>Also, &quot;Clinton&quot; gave her supporters a message:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hillary Clinton has a message for women still voting for Trump. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNLinManuel?src=hash">#SNLinManuel</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/https://t.co/c5lPrlWVr2">pic.twitter.com/c5lPrlWVr2</a></p>&#x2014; Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/784981814574059520">October 9, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171022042940js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The cold open also featured multiple Trump &quot;hot mic&quot; moments, including a reference to the excellent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042940/https://twitter.com/gjmccarthy/status/784147520108625920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Ted Cruz phone bank</a> meme.</p>
