<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152447/http://pix11.com/2016/05/25/rescue-effort-underway-in-waters-off-far-rockaway/">30-40 minutes</a>, the teen was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152447/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Far-Rockaway-Queens-New-York-City-Water-Rescue-380860811.html">eventually found by divers</a> and taken to the hospital in critical condition. </p>

<p>The Daily News (which has some potentially upsetting photographs of rescue) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152447/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/unconscious-queens-boy-rescued-ocean-horseplay-awry-article-1.2649907">reports</a> that the teen was there with two friends, &quot;The three teens, who skipped their classes at Newtown High School in Elmhurst, had been joking around, drinking and running in and out of the surf when one of them was swept away, witnesses said.&quot;</p>

<p>A friend told the News, &quot;He said he could swim but he kept going out deeper.&quot;</p>

<p>There were no lifeguards on duty because NYC beaches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152447/https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/beaches">don&apos;t officially open until Memorial Day weekend</a>.</p>
