<p>A bar in Gravesend was targeted by an acrobatic thief this past Thanksgiving weekend.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 4:45 a.m., on Saturday, November 28th, a &quot;suspect entered the Draft Barn located at 317 Avenue X through roof vent and, once inside, was able to break open a safe in the basement and remove two Rolex watches, an Apple iPad mini, a legally owned Walther P38 9MM handgun and an undetermined amount of money.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s video, which shows the burglar wearing a hoodie and trying to cover one of the cameras:</p>
