<p>A man on a flight from Hawaii was recently arrested by federal authorities after the plane touched down at JFK airport, because he allegedly molested the passenger sitting beside him during the flight... and removed his own pants and pleasured himself. </p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint, Ricardo Caceres was on an overnight Hawaiian Airlines flight that left Honolulu on January 15th; he was sitting on the aisle seat, while a man was sitting in the middle seat and the man&apos;s wife was by the window. A federal agent said that Caceres had multiple alcoholic drinks: </p><blockquote>During the flight, the defendant reached over and touched the passenger on his chest, belt and groin. The passenger asked the defendant what he was doing. The defendant then removed his pants and started masturbating. <p></p>

<p>The passenger and his wife both saw the defendant fully exposed, after which the passenger notified the flight crew. Two members of the flight crew responded, observed the defendant fully exposed with his pants off and instructed him to put his clothing back on, which the defendant did.</p></blockquote>The flight arrived on January 16th, and Caceres was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060903/http://nypost.com/2016/01/20/drunk-perv-molested-man-in-front-of-wife-on-flight-from-hawaii-lawsuit/">released on $50,000 bond</a>.<p></p>

<p>Oddly enough, in 2013, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060903/http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/travel-troubles/8776511/Air-passenger-has-no-memory-of-alleged-assaults">man named Ricardo Caceres</a> was &quot;accused of assaulting a flight attendant and biting one of two Federal Air Marshal deputies who restrained him during an 11-hour flight from New York&quot; to Hawaii.</p>
