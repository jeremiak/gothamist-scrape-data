<p>The police re-issued their call for help from the public to help identify suspect involved in the killing of a gay man last year. </p>

<p>On October 20, 2012, police discovered Lou Rispoli, a gay activist in Queens, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016130009/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/gay_man_brutally_beaten_in_queens_t.php">beaten unconscious with blunt force trauma</a> to the head at 42 Street and Queens Boulevard.  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016130009/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/gay_man_brutally_beaten_in_queens_t.php">died five days later</a> at Elmhurst General Hospital. His husband Danyal Lawson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016130009/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/19/murdered_gay_activist_mourned_at_qu.php">said after Rispoli&apos;s death</a>, &quot;Lou really loved this neighborhood. We lived here together for 32 years. He loved our building. He loved the shopkeepers and restaurant owners. He was a man with a big heart, and he shared his great heart with everyone. He never felt afraid to walk the streets here. At any time. No one should feel afraid to walk these streets at any time. No matter who they are.&quot;</p>

<p>The investigation found that Rispoli was attacked by three men who possibly fled in a white or grey four door sedan with a loud muffler. The NYPD is also treating the incident as a possible hate crime. Police initially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131016130009/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/30/police_release_sketches_of_suspects.php">released sketches of two of the suspects in January</a> and re-issued them last night. One suspect is described as a white male in his 20s while another is described as a Hispanic male in his 30s. There&apos;s no description of the third suspect. </p>

<p>There is a $22,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
