Because apparently his plans to appear in Central Park during Good Morning, America have been thwarted by powers that be, who may have been concerned about crowds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919200100/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/15/near_riot_nypd_shuts_down_drakes_se.php?gallery0Pic=1#gallery">after the near riot before his planned free concert</a> at the South Street Seaport.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919200100/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/07/08/2010-07-08_no_good_morning_in_park_for_drake.html">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;ABC decided not to book the 23-year-old Canadian rapper for a July 16 show in Central Park after the NYPD told the city Parks Department that Parks&apos; security plan wasn&apos;t up to snuff, Parks and police sources said.&quot;  Good Morning America said that the show was only &quot;interested in having Drake perform, but he was never officially booked,&quot; but Drake&apos;s people said there was a &quot;booking in place.&quot; </p>

<p>So, guess who will replace Drake?  A rep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919200100/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1643221/20100708/drake.jhtml">told MTV News</a>, &quot;There was an open date on the calendar for July 16, but they decided to feature the cast of the Broadway show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919200100/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/25/opinionist_american_idiot.php">&apos;American Idiot.&apos;</a>&quot;</p>
