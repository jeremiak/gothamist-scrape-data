<p>In other musical news that is as opposite to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124322/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/04/american_psycho_the_musical.php"><em>American Psycho</em>: The Musical</a> as possible, the beloved Irish indie film, <em>Once</em>, has a stage adaptation in the works, too.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124322/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/stage-version-of-once-will-start-downtown/">According to Arts Beat</a>, producers have decided to open a &quot;downtown production at New York Theater Workshop in November, with Broadway a possibility after that, according to executives involved with the show.&quot;</p>

<p>The 2007 film, written and directed by John Carney, was about a vacuum cleaner repairman by day/Dublin street busker by night (Glen Hansard)&#x2014;&quot;The Guy&quot;&#x2014; and his relationship with a Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova)&#x2014;&quot;The Girl&quot;&#x2014;who sells flowers and paper on the street.  After realizing that she can sing and play the piano, the street busker decides to enlist her help and cut a demo of his work for record labels.  Of course, they fall in love...but little is ever said or done about it. Karen Wilson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124322/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/17/the_cinecultist_82.php">also wrote here</a>, &quot;In the best sense of the word, Once is a consummate musical where the songs allow the characters to express their emotions and longing for each other in a way that mere words never could.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the producers of the stage musical, John Hart,  told Arts Beat, &quot;Our team led by John Tiffany found that we could tell a story that still honored the film but was also very distinct and enriched, as a stage musical, in ways that films aren&#x2019;t,&quot; and said they were happy with a workshop earlier this spring, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s any fixing to do, nothing specific, but we want to take our time and put it before audiences and critics at the New York Theater Workshop to get a clear sense of what we have.&quot; </p>

<p>Hansard and Irglova also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124322/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/24/oscar_night_200.php">won the Oscar</a> for Best Song (you may remember Irglova being<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124322/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/24/oscar_night_200.php"> cut off during the acceptance speech</a>, only for host Jon Stewart to have to come out again to finish her speech) for &quot;Falling Slowly&quot;:</p>
