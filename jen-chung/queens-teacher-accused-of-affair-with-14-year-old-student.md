Melissa Weber was charged with statutory rape, sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child; prosecutors claim she told the boy, a student in one of her classes, &quot;<strong>Don&#x2019;t tell anyone. I could get arrested and I could lose my teaching license.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>The boy&apos;s mother had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224011355/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/nyregion/29statutory.html?ref=nyregion">heard talk of an inappropriate relationship</a> (she was concerned because he was acting oddly) between her son and Weber, so she managed to get Weber&apos;s cell number and compared it to her son&apos;s phone...which had hundreds of messages from Weber over the past two months.  One of the last ones read, &quot;<strong>Erase your phone</strong>.&quot;  The boy admitted to the affair and apparently had a calendar of their trysts.  Weber and the boy allegedly had sex seven times between mid-April and mid-May and &quot;on seven other occasions, she allegedly engaged in inappropriate behavior with the boy,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224011355/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05292009/news/regionalnews/lady_teacher_had_sex_trysts_with_boy__14_171570.htm">according to the Post</a>.</p>

<p>Weber is being held pending arraignment. Queens DA Richard Brown said, &quot;The charges are very disturbing. A teacher is accused of preying on a young student who she is entrusted to teach. A classroom should always be a safe place for a child.&quot;</p>
