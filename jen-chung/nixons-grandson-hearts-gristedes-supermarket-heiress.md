Apparently the coupling of the 31-year-old Cox and 20-year-old Catsimatidis (they met when she was...17...at her high school) has &quot;scandalized Long Island&apos;s elite.&quot;  GOP source snark: &quot;Everyone&apos;s snickering behind their back. She&apos;s a kid. He brings her to these very staid Republican events and she&apos;s in a miniskirt.<strong> It&apos;s the political equivalent of &apos;The Addams Family.&apos;</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Cox is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308115115/http://www.chriscoxforcongress.com/">running for a Congressional seat</a> on Long Island.  According to the Post, the pair met &quot;in April 2008 while he was participating in a mock presidential debate, representing John McCain, at Hewitt, her all-girls high school on the Upper East Side.&quot;  Apparently a romantic, Cox proposed at Hewitt last month (Hewitt&apos;s Linda MacMurry Gibbs confirmed, &quot;It was at 9 at night. We had the proposal on our security cameras&quot;).  In turn, NYU student Catsimatidis announced the engagement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308115115/http://www.facebook.com/AJCats?ref=ts">on Facebook</a>: &quot;Andrea is engaged to the greatest man in the world (besides her father of course!)! YAYYYYYY!!!!! &lt;3&quot;</p>

<p>A &quot;high-ranking state GOP official&quot; said Cox was &quot;Not streetwise. Like an old-school stodgy Republican. He&apos;s very rigid. I&apos;ve maybe seen him have one drink at a cocktail party,&quot; adding, of course, &quot;his fianc&#xE9;e can&apos;t legally drink.&quot;  </p>

<p>John Catismatidis told the Post&apos;s Cindy Adams, &quot;I&apos;m shell-shocked,&quot; but, &quot;Chris is one of the nicest kids I&apos;ve ever met,&quot; he said. &quot;Straight-arrow. Clean-cut. Honest as the day is long. It&apos;s better than her running around, looking for anything.&quot;  He doesn&apos;t know if Cox has any money,  but &quot;Andrea has enough for both of them.&quot;  </p>
