Crowley&apos;s office)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161610/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queens_kingmaker_at_home_in_virginia_7AvwIRepzgY7XXd9Dr1nhJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">NY Post has an &quot;exclusive&quot; on how Rep. Joseph Crowley</a>, who represents Queens (and part of the Bronx) and is also the Queens Democratic party boss, spends most of his time in D.C. to the point that his wife and children live in Arlington, Virginia: &quot;The Crowleys live in an expansive home in the leafy Washington suburb of Arlington, Va., where his three kids attend the community&apos;s nationally renowned public schools -- shunning New York City&apos;s educational system, property records show.&quot;</p>

<p>Crowley does have a Queens residence in Woodside, but &quot;neighbors on the block don&apos;t know who he is. That&apos;s not surprising, since he bought his house in Virginia for $690,000 in 2004, six years after he went to Congress.&quot;  Citizens Union executive director Dick Dadey says, &quot;Given his dual role, he needs to spend more time in Queens. The process is better served having a more present party leader in the borough,&quot; but his spokeswoman explains, &quot;Joe is a proven leader and effective representative who consistently delivers for his district. He is also a devoted husband and father to three young kids who he wants to spend time with during the work week. He is strongly committed to both his job and family.&quot;  Crowley emphasized this point when the Observer&apos;s Azi Paybarah caught up with him&#x2014;Crowley wants to tuck his kids in at night! </p>

<p>In the video, Crowley makes the points that he is always fighting for his constituents and they should be happy that he is pleased with his private life (and wants his family nearby).  That&apos;s definitely a zing to former Congressmen Anthony &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161610/http://gothamist.com/tags/weinergate">I&apos;m gonna virtually cheat on my wife</a>&quot; Weiner and Vito &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161610/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/21/fossellas_wife.php">My wife found out about my lover and love child</a> when I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161610/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/08/vito_fossella_a.php">got pulled over for drunk driving</a> in Virginia&quot; Fossella. Plus, he thinks the Post is full of it, given the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161610/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/07/as_phone_hacking_scandal_grows_rupe.php">scandal abroad with another News Corp.-owned publication</a>.</p>
