<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_paradegro.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_paradegro.jpg" width="202" height="158" class="image-left"> </span>Last July, EMT Jason Green was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/18/emt_accused_of_ignoring_dying_pregn.php">killed outside</a> the Soho nightclub Greenhouse. Because Green was accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/20/emts_ignore_dying_pregnant_woman_in.php">ignoring an ailing pregnant lady</a>, only for her to die, police wondered if he was killed to avenge the woman&apos;s death. But Green was killed during a sidewalk argument-turned-fight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/20/police_infamous_emts_death_wasnt_ve.php">leading a cop to say</a>, &quot;It&apos;s karma, but it wasn&apos;t planned. It wasn&apos;t anyone retaliating.&quot; Now, one of the men accused of killing Green has been killed near Prospect Park.</p>

<p>Julio Locarno was arrested last month to allegedly yelling &quot;Shoot! Shoot!&quot; while he and another man were fighting with Green over a parking space.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/man_charged_in_emt_death_critically_KF1ZddKY8dKRsW0WLLRcvJ">Post reports</a> that he was &quot;hit with a hail of bullets &#x2014; in the head and body &#x2014; around 10:40 p.m. across from 45 Parade Place&quot; last night and died at Kings County Hospital this morning.  No suspects have been arrested.</p>

<p>Green and his fellow EMT girlfriend Melissa Jackson were suspended after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/20/emts_ignore_dying_pregnant_woman_in.php">allegedly refusing to help a pregnant Au Bon Pain worker</a> in Brooklyn; they supposedly suggested the store call 911, but Eutisha Reeve Rennix collapsed in the bathroom and later died. Their lawyer said that Green and Jackson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/26/emts_ignored_dying_woman_due_to_pro.php">acted properly and weren&apos;t equipped to treat Rennix</a>.  Green has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130834/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/13/emt_who_ignored_dying_woman_charged.php">charged with misconduct</a>.</p>
