<p>A witness told Brooklyn Heights Blog, &quot;I heard the shots and I looked over and I saw this young kid with a gun, and shoot it again, and then ran off,&quot; and others said there were two men (one with a backpack) and &quot;both fled east on Clark St., where one jumped in to a red SUV.&quot; The News says the gunman was described as &quot;a heavyset man in his 20s - was wearing jeans and a dark T-shirt.&quot;</p>

<p>Other neighbors tried to help the man while one was in shock, telling BHB, &quot;I&#x2019;m shaking. I have to admit that until I actually saw the blood, I was maybe a little&#x2026;not believing it was real, but then once I saw it I really started to feel very shaky, and this is totally out of keeping with this building, with this neighborhood, it&#x2019;s not at all what you would expect here.&quot;</p>
