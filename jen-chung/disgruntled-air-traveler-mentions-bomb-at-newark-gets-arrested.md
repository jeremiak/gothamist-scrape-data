<p>We&apos;ve all been there: The airline oversells your flight, you can&apos;t get where you&apos;re going, and you totally snap. But that&apos;s still no reason to start joking about bombs, if you know what&apos;s good for you.</p>

<p>Eran Hess, who was traveling with his family from Tel Aviv, caused a scene at Newark Airport yesterday. Apparently they were supposed to connect to a flight to Miami, but it was oversold. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322172228/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bomb_bozo_busted_lJSWBDZqJu1z6EmWTO7MkM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">The Post reports</a>, &quot;He grew outraged as he learned his bags had already been loaded and couldn&#x2019;t be removed, and made a comment to a United worker that worried security. &apos;I&#x2019;m going to go over there and tell the TSA I put a bomb in my bag and get my bag back,&apos; Hess allegedly fumed, according to sources. After ranting about the &#x201C;bomb,&#x201D; Hess and his family vanished into the crowd. At one point, about a dozen officers were looking for them, one source said.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, the oversold flight was delayed for hours as the plane was inspected, with all bags removed and checked by bomb-sniffing dogs. Authorities eventually found Hess about to board an American Airlines flight to Florida and charged him with creating a false public alarm.</p>
