<p>It was less than a year ago that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125164013/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/02/house_votes_333-79_to_censure_range.php">House of Representatives voted to censure</a> longtime Harlem Congressman Charles Rangel for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125164013/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/16/after_walk_out_rangel_awaits_house.php">series of ethic violations</a>, which Rangel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125164013/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/rangel_censure_was_embarrassing_pai.php">called &quot;embarrassing&quot; and &quot;painful.&quot;</a>  Yesterday, Rangel chortled, &quot;Anyone who wants to ask about the Ethics Committee, I&apos;m not answering any questions,&quot; when his portrait was unveiled at the Capitol yesterday (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125164013/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/09/rangel-no-ethics-talk-at-portrait-unveiling">Daily News said that line was greeted with &quot;applause and laughter&quot;</a>).</p>

<p>Time changes everything: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125164013/http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2011/09/23/single-portrait-reveals-many-sides-charlie-rangel">House Speaker John Boehner said</a>, &quot;Charlie and I have considered each other friends since I got here. We&apos;re proud of your accomplishments,&quot; and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said, &quot;Thank you for being an inspiration to us.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125164013/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/64204.html">Senator Chuck Schumer added</a>, &#x201C;Everybody has their good times, everybody has their bad. We all know that. But no matter what the times were like, this man, this great, wonderful man who I am so lucky to have as a mentor and friend to me &#x2026; his spirit is so strong and so good.&#x201D;</p>

<p>As for who is footing the cost of the portrait, it seems like it&apos;s okay that Rangel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125164013/http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0911/Rangels_portrait_to_be_unveiled_on_Capitol_Hill.html">is using campaign funds</a> for it.</p>
