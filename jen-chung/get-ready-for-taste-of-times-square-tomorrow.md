<p>Dozens of Times Square eateries will be at the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170044/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/about_us/events_taste.html">Taste of Times Square </a>tomorrow. The event, which is at the Broadway Plazas, between 42nd and 47th Streets, from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., gives New Yorkers and tourists alike a chance to try out dishes for $1-5.  And, yes, those pedestrian plazas are good for something besides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170044/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/times_squares_pedestrian_plazas_mad.php">cleaner air</a>.</p>

<p>Upscale steakhouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170044/http://www.thepalm.com/Palm-West">The Palm</a> on West 50th Street will be serving &quot;cream of spinach and sliced sirloin on toasted bread with blue cheese fondue and fried onions,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170044/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110605/midtown/taste-of-times-square-returns-monday">according to DNAinfo</a>. Palm Chef James Asaro said, &quot;There&apos;s a lot of buzz. A lot of people are talking about it in the neighborhood,&quot; and he wants to know people to know that The Palm isn&apos;t too expensive for them, &quot;A lot of people are afraid [that they&apos;ll spend $1,000 there].&quot; </p>

<p>O&apos;Lunney&apos;s Pub also told DNAinfo they are offering &quot;crab cakes with aioli sauce and at least 1,000 chicken pot pies with cream sauce topped with mashed potatoes&quot; while Ruby Foo&apos;s has &quot;cold smoked organic salmon with pomelos and an avocado and jalapeno pur&#xE9;e&quot; on the menu.</p>

<p>Tickets are available at the event or in advance at the Times Square Visitor Center and Mini-Museum on 7th Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets.  </p>
