<p>If you want to experience what it was like to take the subway back in 1917&#x2014;and you need to head to today&apos;s Yankees home-opener against the Boston Red Sox&#x2014;then hustle over to Grand Central Terminal, where there will be a four-car &quot;Nostalgia Train&quot; taking fans to on a non-stop ride through the boroughs and time.</p>

<p>The train will depart 42nd Street-Grand Central at 11:30 a.m. on the Lexington Avenue express platform. The four cars, from the original Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) system ,are 1917 vintage Lo-V (low voltage) cars, left passenger service in 1969. </p>

<p>The MTA adds, &quot;The Yankees have a stellar 4-1 record in home openers since the MTA first ran the &apos;Nostalgia Train&apos; to the Stadium in 2008.&quot; </p>

<p>Mets fans: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150827/http://www.mta.info/news/stories/?story=1012">You have the 7</a>.</p>
