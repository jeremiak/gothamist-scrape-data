<p>The incident occurred around 6:15 p.m. on March 3 at the museum at 1000 Fifth Avenue. According to the NYPD, the victim, a 46-year-old man, was &quot;struck with a bottle by an unidentified individual after a verbal dispute.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was a guard who allegedly told the attacker not to adjust a painting; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630080514/http://nypost.com/2017/03/03/met-visitor-clocks-security-guard-with-wine-bottle/">Post reports</a> that the suspect thought the painting was crooked. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630080514/http://abc7ny.com/news/nypd-met-security-guard-assaulted-over-crooked-painting/1787185/">From WABC 7</a>:</p><blockquote><br>
The guard reportedly told him not to touch the art and to lodge his concerns with the information desk.<p></p>

<p>As the guard walked away, police say the man came up behind him and cracked him in the back of the head with the bottle, smashing it into pieces.</p>

<p>The suspect allegedly muttered &quot;Do your job&quot; as he walked away.</p>

<p>Police followed a trail of blood, believed left by the suspect, through two galleries and out of the building.</p></blockquote>The guard suffered a laceration to his head and was taken to Weill Cornell Hospital in stable condition.<p></p>

<p>Police released an image and video of the suspect, who was described as being 20-25 years old, 5&apos;8&quot; and 150 pounds. He was last seen wearing all black clothing and has a large beard.</p>
