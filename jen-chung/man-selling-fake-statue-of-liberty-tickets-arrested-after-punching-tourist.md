<p>A ticket seller was arrested and another is being sought after a dispute over Statue of Liberty tickets the men were trying to sell. Apparently they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021448/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/statue-liberty-ticket-scammer-sucker-punches-tourist-article-1.2850561">&quot;aggressively&quot; trying to push water taxi tickets</a> on tourists, and, at one point, &quot;sucker-punched&quot; a visitor.</p>

<p>Andre Morris, 33, allegedly hit the 44-year-old man after he and his family refused to buy tickets. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021448/http://abc7ny.com/news/nypd-man-tried-to-sell-fake-statue-of-liberty-tickets-to-tourists/1579760/">According to WABC 7</a>, another suspect was also involved, and they &quot;punched the man several times after he realized the tickets were no good.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the dispute was over the fact that the water taxi doesn&apos;t actually go to Liberty Island.
