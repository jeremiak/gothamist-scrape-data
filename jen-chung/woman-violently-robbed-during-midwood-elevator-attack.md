<p>According to the NYPD, on July 27th at around 9:40 p.m., an 18-year-old woman was heading into her apartment building. Security camera video shows two males following her inside and into an elevator, but the woman tries to leave before the elevator doors closed=. That&apos;s when the two suspects grab her, drag her into the hallway and hold her down as they punch and kick her. They fled after taking her purse.</p>

<p>Police released video of the assault&#x2014;you can see one suspect throwing the purse away (they kept the iPhone and wallet):</p>
