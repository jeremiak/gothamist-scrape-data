<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:180px; "> <img alt="2010_09_rogerstone.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330151328im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_09_rogerstone.jpg" width="180" height="220"> <br> <i>Roger Stone on NY1</i></div> Today, the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330151328/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/team_paladino_roger_dodger_oDBot1GdWWM6F39rZbUvIN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">has a story</a> about how the notorious and colorful Republican strategist Roger Stone owes <em>a lot</em> in back taxes, &quot;The Internal Revenue Service filed a $405,035 lien for unpaid income taxes against the consultant -- one of politics&apos; most notorious dirty tricksters -- and his wife, Nydia, last fall in Dade County Circuit Court in Florida, records show.&quot; Naturally, Stone, who is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330151328/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/06/even_roger_stone_thinks_paladino_is.php">unpaid adviser to Carl Paladino&apos;s campaign</a>, fired back, accusing the Post&apos;s Fred Dicker (one of the bylines on the story) of &quot;slipping... Fred never lets the facts get in the way of a good tabloid story.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Stone, who has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330151328/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/21/gop_operative_c_1.php">strong distaste for Eliot Spitzer</a>,  explains on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330151328/http://stonezone.com/">his website</a>, &quot;In today&apos;s New York Post Fred Dicker reports that my wife and I have a $405,000 tax lien from the IRS which pertains to our 2006 taxes. What Fred is well aware of and didn&apos;t report is that the matter is in dispute and an appeal has been filed with a hearing scheduled in 90 days!&quot;  </p>

<p>The Post story also mentions a source who claims Stone &quot;has been suffering from &apos;widespread money problems&apos; in the wake of the collapse of his partnership with Fort Lauderdale mega-scammer, Scott Rothstein.&quot; Which gives Stone reason to further blasts Dicker&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330151328/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/video_paladino_gets_into_altercatio.php">who tussled with Paladino</a> over the Post&apos;s coverage of Paladino&apos;s mistress and love child&#x2014;&quot;Generally despised by his colleagues in the Press for his healthy disregard for facts and careful omissions when promoting his agenda, Dicker&apos;s has taken up the cudgel for Democrat Andrew Cuomo in this year&apos;s race for Governor. When I had lunch with Dicker in Miami last year, I was surprised when he punched Andrew up on his speed dial of his cell phone and handed the phone over so Andrew could say hello.&quot;</p>
