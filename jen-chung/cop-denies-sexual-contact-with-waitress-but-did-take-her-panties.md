<p>The waitress claims that her boss at La Parilla gave her $200 to drink with the group because it was the detective&apos;s 49th birthday.  She blacked out and claims she woke up to the owner sexually assaulting her. The Post, which says the detective is married, reports, &quot;Strong told his union lawyer yesterday he went to La Parilla&#x2019;s back room alone with the drunken waitress on Feb. 16 after she showed him and three other 33rd Precinct cops racy pictures of herself, the source said. &apos;She falls asleep and he covers her up with a blanket. He did not have sex with her. He did not have intercourse with her. Apparently, he did take her panties,&apos; he told the lawyer from the Detectives&#x2019; Endowment Association, according to the source.&quot;</p>

<p>The source says, &quot;When she got into bed, she started to take some of her clothes off.&quot;  The source also claims that Strong told his lawyer that he had &quot;three sodas and one glass of wine,&quot; making him &quot;fit for duty&quot; and that the waitress called him about her panties, &quot;He just goes right to her and hands them off in a plastic bag.&quot; </p>

<p>The waitress told the Daily News, &#x201C;The last thing I remember is [the detective] patting the bed and telling me to sit down next to him... He was trying to kiss me and I was trying to ward off his advances. I remember trying to slide away from him, bob and weave. He was like, &#x2018;Come here, everything&#x2019;s all right. I&#x2019;m not gonna hurt you.&#x2019;&quot; Then she blacked out.  A rape kit was conduced by the hospital, but the results are not in yet.  When she contacted the detective for her underwear, he told her that they didn&apos;t have sex because she was incapacitated.</p>
