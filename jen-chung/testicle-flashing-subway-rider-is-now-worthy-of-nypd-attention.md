Last week, a concerned subway rider went to a Manhattan police precinct to report that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111053/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/subway_exposure_nypd.php">man on the 4 train had exposed his testicles</a> and offered to provide officers with a clear photo of the individual. But a police officer told the tipster that unless the perp was overtly gesturing at people or masturbating, there was &quot;nothing they could do.&quot; This is quite contrary to NYPD Transit Bureau Chief Joseph Fox&apos;s position:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/4 We track &amp; investigate ALL sexually motivated crimes in our subways- including public lewdness &amp; unlawful surveillance-</p>&#x2014; Chief Joseph Fox (@NYPDTransit) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111053/https://twitter.com/NYPDTransit/status/744553496503025664">June 19, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20161028111053js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Now, after Gothamist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111053/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/subway_exposure_nypd.php">published a story about the incident</a> and the tipster&apos;s frustration with cops&apos; apathy, the NYPD is now officially investigating. Gothamist is on your side!</p>

<p>The police sent a &quot;Request for Media Attention,&quot; asking the public if they have seen this individual riding a southbound 4 train approaching the 14th Street-Union Square station on June 12th. The suspect, who is now sought by the NYPD for public lewdness, is described as being 55-65 years old.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111053/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on, etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111053/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. Don&apos;t let the perverts win.</p>
