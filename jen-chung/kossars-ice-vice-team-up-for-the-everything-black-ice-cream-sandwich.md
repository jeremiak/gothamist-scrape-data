<p>August is National Sandwich Month, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104703/http://kossars.com/">Kossar&apos;s</a> is kicking off a series of collaborations by offering a crazy sweet &apos;n&apos; savory ice cream sandwich: It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104703/http://iceandvice.com/">Ice &amp; Vice</a>&apos;s Basic B ice cream, bookended by Kossar&apos;s little black-and-white cookies and rolled in everything seasoning. </p>

<p>Confirming what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104703/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/24/everything_donut_reviewed.php">we knew from The Everything Donut</a>, the sweet and salty notes start a party in your mouth. The decadent black-and-white icing on the thick cakey cookie gives way to the rich Mexican vanilla ice cream with black-lava sea salt. Complementing the sugar rush are the earthy Everything ingredients: Salt, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, garlic and onion. </p>
