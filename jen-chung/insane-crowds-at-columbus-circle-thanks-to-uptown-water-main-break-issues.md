										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_09_subwaycolcir.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_09_subwaycolcir.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i>&quot;Cray cray. This is Columbus circle right now. No trains past 59th st going uptown due to water mane break!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716/http://twitter.com/#!/hanniye/status/115920739936387072">hanniye on Twitter</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Since the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/water_main_break_means_rough_rush_h.php">suspended A, B, C, and D service</a> during the evening commute due to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/106th_street_cpw_water_main_break_s.php">water main break</a> at West 106th Street and Central Park West (with good reason&#x2014;tracks are under water!), things got messy for many subway commuters.  For instance, ones at Columbus Circle&#x2014;where the A, B, C, and D run&#x2014;seemed to flock to the 1 to get out of there.  But that just meant a super-packed platform.</p>

<p>People Tweeted, &quot;WTF happened at Columbus Circle??? Mad people are getting out...is there something wrong w/ the train?&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716/http://twitter.com/#!/AlexMXBaez/status/115911241016422400">@AlexMXBaez</a>) and &quot;Dear god I think at least 1 subway train per line is out of commission right now. Never seen Columbus Circle so swamped&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716/http://twitter.com/#!/smdnyc/status/115919784222261248">@smdnyc</a>). Oh, and &quot;59th Columbus Circle looked like the Day After Tomorrow when I went in that station&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716/http://twitter.com/#!/Cole_STP/status/115896359948787712">@Cole_STP</a>).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023716/http://twitter.com/#!/dzalcman/status/115920240663207936">According to Daniella Zalcman</a>, &quot;The uptown 1 train platform at Columbus Circle looks like a mosh pit. Hundreds waiting, NYPD is roping off sections of the crowd.&quot;  </p>

<p>B and C train service has been suspended from end to end, while A train service is suspended between West 145th Street and 59th Street-Columbus Circle.<br>
In addition, D trains are not running at all between 161st Street-Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and 34th Street-Herald Square in Manhattan. The MTA says &quot;shuttle trains&quot; will operate between 205th Street and 161st Street-Yankee Stadium on the Concourse line, and customers can utilize 4 train service to and from 161st Street. Shuttle trains will also provide service to A line customers between 207th Street and 168th Street.
