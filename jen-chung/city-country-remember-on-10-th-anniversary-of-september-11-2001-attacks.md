</div></div>					<p>Today, New York City and the metropolitan area; Washington D.C.; Shanksville, Pennsylvania; and the rest of the country are remembering the September 11, 2001 attacks.  That beautiful Tuesday ten years ago turned dark and unspeakably grim when planes struck the World Trade Center, Pentagon and a field in Shanksville.  In New York, President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush are at the World Trade Center&apos;s new National 9/11 Memorial, as are Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Governor George Pataki, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Governor Chris Christie and former Mayor Giuliani.  </p>

<p>During the anniversary ceremony (which you can watch live on television or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011003/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/124256/ny1-live-stream--9-11-tenth-anniversary-memorial-ceremony">NY1.com</a>), the victims names are being read and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011003/http://live.nydailynews.com/Event/911_10_Years_Later">various officials are reading passages</a> from the Bible, poems and offering prayer. President Bush said, &#x201C;I pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement.&quot; and President Obama read from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011003/http://www.biblestudytools.com/nrs/psalms/46.html">Psalm 46</a>: </p><blockquote>God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.<p></p>

<p>Therefore, we will not fear, even though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.</p>

<p>Though its waters roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with its swelling, there&#x2019;s a river whose streams shall make glad the City of God, the holy place of the Tabernacle of the Most High.</p>

<p>God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God shall help her just at the break of dawn.</p>

<p>The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved. He uttered his voice. The earth melted. </p>

<p>The Lord of Hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.</p>

<p>Come behold the works of the Lord who has made desolations in the Earth. He makes wars cease to the ends of the Earth.</p>

<p>He breaks the bough and cuts the spear in two. He burns the chariot in fire.</p>

<p>Be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the Earths. The Lord of Hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The names of the 2,983 victims at the WTC attacks are being recited, punctuated by moments of silence for when the planes struck (a plane hit the North Tower at 8:46 a.m., then another hit the South Tower at 9:03 a.m.) and when the buildings fell (the South Tower fell at 9:59 a.m., the North Tower at 10:29 a.m.). Families of victims are also there&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011003/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/14/911_first_responders_wont_be_at_the.php">first responders who aided in disaster are not</a>&#x2014;and they have the first opportunity to descend to the Memorial and see their loved ones&apos; names etched alongside the reflecting pools and waterfalls.</p>
