<p>Earlier this week, video of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630065701/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/25/home_invasion_robbers_brutal_beatin.php">incredibly brutal home invasion perpetrator attacking a woman</a> in front of her three-year-old daughter was released by Millburn, NJ police. Now there&apos;s a $20,000 reward for information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630065701/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Nanny-Cam-Homeowner-Attacked-Invasion-New-Jersey-Mother-Child-Reward-213281901.html">leading to his arrest</a>. </p>

<p>The June 21 attack was caught on the family&apos;s nanny cam&#x2014;the woman had been with her daughter while her baby son was sleeping upstairs (her husband was at work in NYC).  The victim, who suffered a concussion, chipped teeth, bruising and cuts after being punched and thrown down a set of stairs, wanted to make the video public in hopes her assailant could be found. A neighbor, who said he had his back door unlocked on the day of the attack, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630065701/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/06/video_millburn_home_invasion_brutality_stuns_neighbor_drives_manhunt_for_suspect.html#incart_m-rpt-1">said</a>, &quot;That&#x2019;s the kind of person she is&#x2014;she doesn&#x2019;t want it to happen to anybody else. I hope they catch this guy. I canceled my vacation. I was supposed to leave Thursday.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Millburn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630065701/http://www.wtop.com/209/3370471/Nanny-cam-shows-man-beating-woman">police captain Michael Palardy said</a>, &quot;There was no reason for him to touch her at all because she would have willingly gave him what he wanted. I&apos;ve probably gone through this video 20 times, and it still sickens me every time I see it. He had no regard for her life. He didn&apos;t care if she lived or died.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630065701/http://www.wtop.com/209/3370471/Nanny-cam-shows-man-beating-woman">video shows that the</a> &quot;burglar made three trips upstairs to rifle through the family&apos;s belongings, police said, assaulting the woman on the trips back to the first floor, kicking her, punching her and yanking her by the hair.&quot;</p>

<p>Other residents in the wealthy suburb were shocked; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630065701/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/06/video_millburn_home_invasion_brutality_stuns_neighbor_drives_manhunt_for_suspect.html#incart_m-rpt-1">one woman told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;We always felt safe here. My kids walked around at night. We didn&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Now NJ lawmakers want to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630065701/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/06/millburn_home_invasion_prompts_bill_stiffening_penalties.html#incart_river_default">toughen penalties against home invasion robbers</a>. Currently, a home invasion is a third-degree crime; Assemblyman Jon Bramick wants to make it a second-degree. &quot;Criminals could potentially walk away from a home invasion without facing jail time,&quot; Bramick said.</p>
