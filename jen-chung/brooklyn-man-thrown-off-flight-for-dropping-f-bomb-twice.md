<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:280px; "> <img alt="2011_06_fbomb2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051041im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_fbomb2.jpg" width="280" height="333"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051041/http://www.stupidiotic.com/product_info.php?products_id=176">You can buy an F-Bomb</a></i></div> Sure, airplane passengers have been thrown off flights for joking about bombs, but being thrown off a flight for dropping the F-bomb seems like a new one:  Brooklyn resident Robert Sayegh  says he was thrown off an Atlantic South Airlines flight to Newark Liberty Airport after he complained, &quot;What&apos;s taking so (expletive) long to close the overhead compartments?&quot;  Hey, the plane had been at the gate at Detroit&apos;s Metro Airport for 45 minutes without moving!  <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051041/http://detnews.com/article/20110613/METRO01/106130343/Man-tossed-off-flight-after-cursing-in-Detroit-may-sue">According to the Detroit News</a>, Sayegh, whose Kansas City-Newark flight had a layover in Detroit on Saturday, and his expletives were overheard by another passenger, who informed the flight attendant: &quot;The plane eventually taxied to the runway, but soon returned, where airport police boarded the plane and Sayegh was escorted off.&quot;  Sayegh claims he only used the F-word twice, &quot;I&apos;m like, &apos;Are they throwing me off the plane?&apos; This is the most ridiculous thing I&apos;ve ever been through in my life. It&apos;s embarrassing... t wasn&apos;t like I stood up like a crazy maniac and was screaming, &apos;Move the plane!&apos;&quot;  And he &quot;said he grew up in Brooklyn where &apos;we curse as adjectives.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Sayegh is considering a lawsuit; Atlantic Southeast Airlines is investigating, but adds that Sayegh got another flight, plus it may remove people is &quot;when the passenger&apos;s conduct is disorderly, abusive or violent&quot; or seems drunk. Sayegh, who had been in Kansas City for a wedding, said he was only hung over and he knows not to be disruptive on a flight, &quot;My cousin was killed in 9/11. A lot of friends died in 9/11. I would never come close to doing anything like that.&quot;</p>
