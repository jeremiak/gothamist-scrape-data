A 27-year-old was arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174311/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-serial-urinator-caught,0,6289368.story">urinating on at least seven women</a> in the past three months.  His M.O. was described by Jersey City Police Chief Peter Malbach, &quot;He&apos;s been going up behind females who were waiting for the bus or just walking and just urinating on the back of their leg.&quot;</p>

<p>According to WPIX, Nitinkuma Patel was nabbed after a plainsclothes police officer saw him peeing on a 16-year-old girl at a bus stop.  Patel allegedly would strike &quot;between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., when young women were headed to work and school,&quot; targeting females in their teens to early 30s.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174311/http://www.nj.com/news/jjournal/jerseycity/index.ssf?/base/news-9/126889351259100.xml&amp;coll=3">Jersey Journal reports</a>:</p><blockquote>When the girl turned south on Tuers, [Officer Mike] Meyers got out of his car and began following on the other side of the street and saw Patel run to within six inches of the girl, reports said.<p></p>

<p>That&apos;s when Patel pulled down the front of his pants and urinated on the girl, reports said, adding that he quickly walked away and right into Meyers&apos; hands.</p></blockquote><br>
And Patel was caught wearing &quot;gray sweatpants with &apos;a large wet spot around his crotch area.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>A resident told WPIX, &quot;Well congratulations, he&apos;s off the streets. He won&apos;t be peeing on anyone else.&quot; Patel was charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact, lewdness, and child abuse and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174311/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/new_jersey/man-accused-of-urinating-on-women-in-jersey-city-20100317-akd">MyFoxNY says</a> he has spent over five years in prison for aggravated assault convictions.  </p>
