<p>Danae Mines, who works at Engine Co. 60 in the Bronx, said she was honored to be selected for the calendar. She applied with all the other firefighters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015708/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/13/fdny_calendar_firefighters_tell_us.php#photo-3">went to the casting call</a> and was interviewed. Finally, Mines found out by email that she would be photographed by Patrick McMullan for the calendar&#x2014;and she&apos;s Ms. March. Surprisingly, she didn&apos;t tell any of her family, friends or fellow firefighters; she said, &quot;They&apos;ll find out today.&quot;</p>

<p>Other firefighters were secretive as well, but John Kilan (Mr. December) told his dad about it. Kilan&apos;s father, John Kilan Sr., showed up during a break to cheer on his son&#x2014;and get a calendar autographed. Kilan Sr. showed us the inscription (&quot;I love you so much it hurts. Thanks for all your support!&quot;) and revealed that when his son started at the firehouse, he didn&apos;t know how to cook, so he quizzed his father on how to make spaetzle. Now, Kilan&apos;s firehouse speciality is turkey burgers&#x2014;but no buns! </p>

<p>Some of the firefighters discussed how they worked out and dieted before the casting call. They stuck to mostly lean meats, and firefighter John Basquez (Mr. June) said, &quot;I love kale! My girlfriend is really into juicing&#x2014;I do kale and celery.&quot;</p>

<p>Firefighter Miguel Ruiz (Mr. November) said that when he cooks at the firehouse, &quot;I like to keep it lean&#x2014;chicken, vegetables quinoa.&quot; However, his favorite fast food is Chipotle. Ruiz&apos;s girlfriend Libby told us she supported him during his training, &quot;I ran 10 miles with him!&quot;  </p>

<p>The calendars&apos; proceeds benefit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015708/http://www.fdnyfoundation.org/">FDNY Foundation</a> and its efforts to promote fire safety and help with the &quot;professional development, training, and education of members of the FDNY.&quot; For instance, FDNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015708/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/cpr/index.shtml">offers free CPR training to offices</a>, and that&apos;s funded through the Foundation. So make sure your smoke detectors have working batteries and buy a calendar!</p>
