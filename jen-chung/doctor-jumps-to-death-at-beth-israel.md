The body of 44-year-old Douglas Meyer was found &quot;on an air-conditioning unit between two buildings&quot; by a security guard at 7 a.m.</p>

<p>Meyer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224215216/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/06/30/2008-06-30_doctor_falls_17_stories_to_death_from_be.html">called a &quot;&apos;gifted&apos; gastroenterologist and liver specialist,&quot;</a> had completed his rounds.  A hospital technician told the Post, &quot;We started calling him at 7 a.m., and we couldn&apos;t reach him. And then one of the guards came in and told me, and I started crying. The entire floor was crying, technicians, nurses, managers, everyone.&quot; </p>

<p>A nurse told the Daily News, &quot;He made the staff happy.  He was never dull and always upbeat.&quot;  Meyer, who lived on the Upper West Side and was an assistant professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine; according to the News, would take his staff out and was often singing and humming while working with patients.</p>

<p>Beth Israel Hospital president Dr. David Shulkin said, &quot;We are totally shocked and distraught. It&apos;s a big loss for us and his patients. He was a gifted physician who made many significant contributions in his field and, no doubt, would have accomplished even more had his life not ended so tragically.&quot;</p>
