<p>Nickolas Ellias, 20, was arrested about 1.6 miles from where the bus was left&#x2014;the bus was tracked by its GPS. He allegedly told police, &quot;I want to be a bus driver... I was going to return the bus when I was done.&quot; Elias&apos;s foster father also told the News, &quot;He tried stealing a bus before, but the police caught him just in time. He&#x2019;s obsessed with buses. He doesn&#x2019;t learn,&quot; while a friend said, &quot;He&#x2019;s obsessed with buses. He was always riding them back and forth. He knows all the drivers. He&#x2019;s always hanging by the bus depot.&quot;</p>

<p>He is being held on $10,000 bail. Darius McCollum, an infamous subway and bus super fan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134903/http://gothamist.com/tags/dariusmccollum">has been arrested dozens of times</a> for impersonating transit workers.</p>
