</div></div>					<p>Last night, Vice President-elect Mike Pence decided to abandon the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/trump_tower_forget_it.php">gilded prison of Trump Tower</a> and check out the Big City. So he went to see <em>Hamilton: An American Musical</em>. Suffice to say, he did not get the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/09/bernie_sanders_hamilton.php">Bernie Sanders welcome</a>.</p>

<p>Pence, he of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://chicagoist.com/2016/10/10/trust_us_you_dont_want_a_mike_pence.php">worrisome policies</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/steve_bannon_trump_strategist.php">even more troubling</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/trumps_amerikkka_comes_together.php">future company</a> at the White House, was greeted with resounding boos:</p>

<div><center><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&apos;s Pence getting booed as he gets to his seats at Hamilton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/https://t.co/IRQG68x1sB">pic.twitter.com/IRQG68x1sB</a></p>&#x2014; David K (@dkipke12) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/https://twitter.com/dkipke12/status/799802254794571777">November 19, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170919144822js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></div>

<div><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unreal scene here - Mike Pence walks in and there&apos;s a massive mix of cheers and boos. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/https://t.co/GVZ5L67mA3">pic.twitter.com/GVZ5L67mA3</a></p>&#x2014; Noah Coslov (@NoahCoslov) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/https://twitter.com/NoahCoslov/status/799781124658659333">November 19, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170919144822js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></div>

<p>However, <em>Hamilton</em> is Lin-Manuel Miranda&apos;s Tony-winning look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/19/hamilton_miranda_review.php#photo-1">Alexander Hamilton&apos;s struggle as an immigrant</a> and places in the high stakes moment of creating America, with a diverse cast taking the roles of fellow founding fathers. And, as Miranda <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/tonyw_2016_hamilton.php#photo-1">said during the Tonys</a>, &quot;Love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love.&quot; </p>

<p>Therefore, after the curtain call, the cast welcomed Pence, who was walking out, and Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, asked Pence to stay. Dixon also told the audience, &quot;There&apos;s nothing to boo here&#x2014;we&apos;re all sharing in a story of love.&quot; And then he read a message from the cast and crew to Pence:</p>

<div><center><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tonight, VP-Elect Mike Pence attended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/https://twitter.com/hashtag/HamiltonBway?src=hash">#HamiltonBway</a>.

<p>Josh Gad, who was in <em>The Book Of Mormon</em>, also tweeted a message in support of the cast:</p>

Dixon added, &quot;I saw [Pence] enjoying it with whoever he was with, and I hope he remembers us. I truly believe we had an affect. It was a message from the producers the creative and the cast. If you have differences, say something! What better place than on this stage telling this story with these people? I hope he thinks of us every time he has to deal with an issue or talk about a bill or present anything.&quot;</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump was not impressed:</p>

<p>Trump&apos;s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was mad, as was MSNBC&apos;s Joe Scarborough (who as it happens is working on his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://www.gq.com/story/joe-scarborough-has-big-dreams-trump-musical">Hamilton-inspired Trump musical</a>):</p>

<p>The booing caused offense across the political aisle, drawing condemnation from reporters from Trump&apos;s liberal enemy, the Times:</p>

<p>Maybe we can hope that Pence will evolve in his views, the way first-term President Obama did to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://dcist.com/2013/06/crowd_erupts_as_supreme_court_issue.php">eventually support same-sex marriage</a> (with an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/06/joe_biden_supports_gay_marriage.php">assist from Uncle Joe</a>). But Pence&apos;s recent civil rights-infringing decisions as governor of Indiana <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919144822/http://chicagoist.com/2016/10/10/trust_us_you_dont_want_a_mike_pence.php">are nothing to ignore</a>. </p>

They do, however, deserve to be treated in accordance with their actions. And in the case of Mike Pence, he deserves nothing less than to be constantly&#x2014;and publicly&#x2014;criticized and humiliated. Because Mike Pence is a monster.&quot;</p>
