<p>Conan O&apos;Brien has been the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054018/http://gothamist.com/2004/09/27/in_the_year_2009_conan_gets_tonight_show.php">longtime successor</a> to the Tonight Show throne, but with Leno&apos;s strong late night ratings success and NBC&apos;s overall ratings disappointments, some were wondering if NBC was in a position to lose a valuable asset like Leno, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054018/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/business/media/22late-web.html">possibly alienating him</a>. Heck, even rival David Letterman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054018/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/arts/television/03lett.html">wondered why NBC would usher</a> the streaking Leno out).  And then ABC became very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054018/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07162008/tv/abc_eyes_leno_kimmel_team_120183.htm">interested in offering Leno a late-night slot</a>, possibly booting Nightline out and moving Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s show.  Now there&apos;s all kinds of new speculation.  Deadline Hollywood Daily gives it whirl: </p><blockquote> [I]t may very well secure NBC&apos;s 10 PM slot and Jay&apos;s legacy. Or it could all go into the crapper if Leno&apos;s 11:30 PM audience fails to follow him. Or if Jay doesn&apos;t attract more eyeballs than his most recent average of 4.8 million viewers tantamount to a mere pittance for primetime. Or if Leno&apos;s show cuts into Conan&apos;s viewers which cuts into new Late Night host Jimmy Fallon&apos;s audience because there&apos;s 3 similar programs in a row (and 3 1/2 if you count Carson Daly&apos;s abysmal half-hour). Suddenly, there&apos;s talk show format fatigue. </blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054018/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/business/media/09leno.html?_r=1&amp;hp">NY Times writes</a>, &quot;No broadcast network has ever before offered the same show in prime time five nights a week. Such so-called &apos;stripped shows&apos; have been a staple of daytime broadcasting,&quot; but Variety <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054018/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997051.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1">points out</a>, &quot;NBC toyed with the idea in 1992 as a way to keep David Letterman at the network; its believed the network also considered stripping &apos;Dateline NBC&apos; on the network back during a period of earlier ratings woes.&quot;  While Leno is rumored to make $40 to 50 million a year on the deal, it&apos;s also thought NBC would save money because it won&apos;t have to develop programs.<p></p>

<p>So, we guess this means Law &amp; Order and Law &amp; Order: Special Victim moves to 9 p.m.</p>
