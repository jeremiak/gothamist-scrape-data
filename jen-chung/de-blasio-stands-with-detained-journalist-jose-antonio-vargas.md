<p>Three years ago, Jose Antonio Vargas, a Puliter Prize-winning journalist, revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121121326/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/pulitzer_prize-winning_reporter_out.php">that he is an undocumented immigrant</a>. His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121121326/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/pulitzer_prize-winning_illegal_immi.php">license was revoked</a>, but he&apos;s been able to remain in the United States. Until he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121121326/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/texas-border-trapped-108826.html#ixzz37YPdP900">decided to report on the undocumented immigrant crisis</a> in Texas.</p>

<p>Vargas, who refers to himself as &quot;the most privileged undocumented immigrant in the country,&quot; was detained by Border Patrol when he tried to leave McAllen Airport. From the NY Times:</p><blockquote>Mr. Vargas wrote recently that he did not realize until he was here that he would have to cross through a Customs and Border Protection checkpoint to leave the Rio Grande Valley. Mr. Vargas travels on a valid Philippine passport, but it has no current United States visa in it...<p></p>

<p>Mr. Vargas insisted he never intended to be detained when he came to South Texas but his supporters were working hard &#x2014; on Twitter and at a news conference in front of the Border Patrol station where he was held &#x2014; to use the publicity to advance their demands for fewer deportations of illegal immigrants living in the country and more protections for the children crossing recently.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Various groups are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121121326/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/jose-antonio-vargas-detained-border-patrol-texas.html">demanding his release, including United We Dream, which said</a>, &quot;Once again, the Border Patrol has proven to be a rogue agency after arresting Jose Antonio, a low-priority case for detention and deportation. Our undocumented community along the border is trapped within its own country, unable to leave and surrounded by checkpoints. It&apos;s immoral that people aren&apos;t free to move around the country they know as home because of a system that seeks to criminalize them.&quot;</p>

<p>The Times adds, &quot;His apprehension poses a dilemma for the Obama administration, which will now have to decide how to handle his case at a time when the border situation has made all decisions about immigration high profile and politically fraught.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio just issued this statement:</p>

<blockquote>I stand in solidarity with journalist and advocate Jose Antonio Vargas&#x2014;an exemplary man whose tireless work has helped raise awareness around the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants living on American soil. Jose Antonio&#x2019;s detainment today at a Texas airport, close to where he was working to document the plight of refugees, shows how our immigrant enforcement agencies are failing to use their discretion and detaining long-time immigrants who do not pose a threat to our security. 

<p>Jose Antonio has spent most of his life in the United States, he was educated by American schools, went on to receive a Pulitzer Prize while working as a journalist at the Washington Post, and eventually disclosed his undocumented status to advocate for a much-needed debate around citizenship. He exemplifies what America is about. I call for his quick release and hope that he can stay in the country that has been his home and to which he has contributed so much.</p></blockquote><p></p>
