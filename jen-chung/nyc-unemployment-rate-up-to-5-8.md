---

<p>In what the state labor department calls the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113638/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/86014/n-y--unemployment-rises-one-percent-in-one-month/Default.aspx">largest month-to-month increase in more than 30 years</a>,&quot; New York City&apos;s unemployment grew 0.8% to 5.8% for August.   Not surprisingly, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113638/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/nyregion/19unemployed.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times finds</a>, &quot;Many of the layoffs came in the tumbling financial sector, which is one of the city&#x2019;s biggest employers and the provider of nearly one-fourth of its annual wages and salaries.&quot;  Keep in mind, layoffs for Lehman and the resulting Bank of America-Merrill Lynch deal will not appear until later.  The state unemployment rate is 5.8%, up from 5.2% in July; the national unemployment rate is 6.1%.</p>
