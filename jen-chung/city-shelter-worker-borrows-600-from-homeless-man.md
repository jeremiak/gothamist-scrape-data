Apparently the homeless man filed a complaint against Proctor when he only paid back $350 of the money by March 2007.  Proctor admitted he violated the City Charter and &quot;agreed to a 10-day suspension, worth $1,499.50, a loss of 10 vacation days, which total $770 in value, and a one-year probation period.&quot;  He has also since paid off the loan. Other things the Conflicts of Interests Board has been dealing with: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811102054/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2008/10/coib-no-conflict-to-consider-t.html">Term limits</a>.</p>
