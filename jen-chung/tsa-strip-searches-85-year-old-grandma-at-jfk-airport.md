<p>Oh, TSA.  Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711011655/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/lenore-zimmerman-85-hurt-strip-search-tsa-agents-jfk-airport-article-1.986198?localLinksEnabled=false&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29">Daily News reports that an 85-year-old woman was strip-searched</a> earlier this week right before a flight to Fort Lauderdale&#x2014;and she&apos;s really unhappy. Lenore Zimmerman, who lives on Long Island, says, &quot;I walk with a walker &#x2014; I really look like a terrorist. I&#x2019;m tiny. I weigh 110 pounds, 107 without clothes&quot;&#x2014;with her hunched back, she&apos;s 4&apos;11&quot;&#x2014;&quot;and I was strip-searched.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711011655/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/lenore-zimmerman-85-hurt-strip-search-tsa-agents-jfk-airport-article-1.986198?localLinksEnabled=false&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29">See her photograph here</a>&#x2014;and naturally, Zimmerman is thinking about a lawsuit, especially since the ordeal left her bloodied up.</p>

<p>Zimmerman was heading on a JetBlue flight to her winter home. After being dropped off at JFK Airport and headed to security, &quot;she asked if she could forgo the advanced image technology screening equipment, fearing it might interfere with her defibrillator.&quot;  From the News:</p><blockquote>She said she normally gets patted down. But this time, she says that two female agents escorted her to a private room and began to remove her clothes.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I was outraged,&#x201D; said Zimmerman, a retired receptionist.</p>

<p>As she tried to lift a lightweight walker off her lap, she says, the metal bars banged against her leg and blood trickled from a gash.</p>

<p>&#x201C;My sock was soaked with blood,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I was bleeding like a pig.&#x201D;</p>

<p>She says the TSA agents showed no sympathy, instead pulling down her pants and asking her to raise her arms.</p></blockquote>The TSA agents refused to explain why they were strip searching her, and the TSA told the News, &quot;Our screening procedures are conducted in a manner designed to treat all passengers with dignity, respect and courtesy.&quot;  Zimmerman&apos;s bleeding leg needed to be treated, so she missed her 1 p.m. flight.  <p></p>

<p>The TSA has caught flak lately for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711011655/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/tsa_were_sorry_for_patting_down_can.php">bad patdown of a breast cancer survivor</a> as well as leaving an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711011655/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/26/tsa_freak_on_agent_has_been_punishe.php">inappropriate note in a traveler&apos;s bag</a>. Oh, and this holiday season, the TSA does have the right to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711011655/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/tsa_reserves_the_right_to_open_your.php">open your holiday gifts</a>.</p>
