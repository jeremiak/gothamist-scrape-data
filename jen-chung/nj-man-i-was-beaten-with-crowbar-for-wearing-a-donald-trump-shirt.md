<p>NJ police are investigating what appears to be a politically-motivated assault: A man says he was attacked in a restaurant parking lot because he was wearing a Donald Trump T-shirt.</p>

<p>Bloomfield police tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163542/http://www.northjersey.com/news/crime-and-courts/man-with-trump-shirt-attacked-with-crowbar-in-bloomfield-police-say-1.1642025">NorthJersey.com</a> that a 62-year-old man was walking on West Passaic Avenue in the early evening last Wednesday when a driver pulled up beside him and shouted questions about his Trump shirt. The driver proceeded to follow the Trump supporter, yelling profanities at him, according to police.  </p>

<p>When the victim approached a nearby Friendly&apos;s restaurant, the unhinged Trump hater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163542/http://abc7ny.com/news/nj-crowbar-attack-prompted-by-donald-trump-shirt-police-say/1462904/">reportedly got out of his car</a> with a crowbar and beat him.</p>

<p>However, WABC 7 reporter Anthony Johnson Tweeted this photograph of the victim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163542/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/20/trump_shirts_rnc_photos.php#photo-1">wearing one of the classy Trump shirts</a>, with this tantalizing note, &quot;Man wearing #Trump shirt says he was attacked.  Witnesses tells a different story.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163542/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080189/Young-Republican-claimed-Obama-supporter-carved-letter-B-face-robbery-story-police-say.html">Anyone remember this Republican</a> with the backwards B?)</p>
