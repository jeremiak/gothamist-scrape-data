<p>Last night was Yankees captain Derek Jeter&apos;s very last All-Star Game. And he hit a double, thanks to a pitch that Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015700/http://deadspin.com/adam-wainwright-had-to-apologize-for-saying-he-grooved-1605746374">initially admitted was grooved.</a> </p>

<p>Wainwright said, &quot;I was going to give him a couple of pipe shots&#x2026; he deserved it. I didn&#x2019;t realize he would get a double, or else I would&#x2019;ve changed my mind. I probably should&#x2019;ve pitched him a little better than that.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015700/http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/wainwright-s-pitch-to-jeter-captures-all-star-game-conundrum/article_f2f40da6-37a6-5bae-8f0b-2c3d438feb4e.html">But later he said</a>, &quot;If I&#x2019;m going to be taken to the slaughterhouse for saying a stupid phrase then I deserve it. I tried to execute a good strike. I didn&#x2019;t want to give up a hit to Derek Jeter. &#x2026; Who cares if it doesn&#x2019;t count? But it does, and that&#x2019;s why I was trying to get outs. I can admit when I was wrong. I messed up.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, here&apos;s Jeter&apos;s All-Star at-bat, complete with Bob Sheppard introduction:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015700/http://nypost.com/2014/07/15/jeter-responds-to-all-star-love-with-leadoff-double-of-course/">Jeter said of the pitches</a>, &quot;He grooved them? The first one was a little cutter he threw down and away. He probably assumed I was swinging so he didn&#x2019;t groove the first one, the second one was about 98, two-seamer that I stayed on really good.&#x2019;.. I don&#x2019;t know, man. I didn&#x2019;t see 98. If he grooved it, thank you, you still got to hit it, I appreciate it if that&#x2019;s what he did, Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>And here&apos;s Jeter leaving the game, which the American League won 5-3, ensuring the AL Champion team home field advantage during the World Series:</p>

<p>Now, you can further have your emotions manipulated with help from Spike Lee, Michael Jordan and Rudy Giuliani in Nike&apos;s tribute ad to Jeter:</p>
