Now, we know that NYC tap water is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/10/tap_water_taste_test_at_amnh.php">pretty darn delicious</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/27/were_1_in_water.php">it did get first place</a> at the state fair last week), but is it worth buying a bottle full of it?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://www.tapdny.com/index.php">Tap&apos;dNY</a> strategy doesn&apos;t hide the fact that they &quot;purify and bottle New York City&apos;s famous tap water, leaving out the malarkey and far journey included in other bottled waters.&quot; Instead, it wants to be an &quot;honest and local alternative for all New Yorkers&quot;--perhaps a nod to how some bottled water marketers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/29/tap_water_is_al.php">haven&apos;t always said their water was from humble taps</a>--and even points out that refills are free at faucets in the city (after a few refills, you recycle the bottle).</p>

<p>Alternate idea: Invest in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://www.nalgene-outdoor.com/">Nalgene</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://www.camelbak.com/betterbottle">Camelbak Better Bottle</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://www.mysigg.com/">aluminum Sigg bottle</a> . And not everyone has access to such great water-- consider donating to causes, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://www.charitywater.org/">Charity:Water</a> (see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201237/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/09/video_of_the_da_187.php">PSA</a>), which try to bring fresh water to other parts of the world</p>
