Seconds later, a woman walking behind him suddenly touches her back, realizing she&apos;s been shot. She holds her hand to the wound as another bystander runs for help. After a minute, the woman walks on her own to a clinic down the street.&quot; </p>

<p><br>She was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101500/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170301/bushwick/myrtle-avenue-shooting-knickerbocker-avenue-m-train-station">taken to Elmhurst Hospital</a> in serious condition. Her injuries are not life-threatening.</p>

<p>While many people were shocked, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101500/http://abc7ny.com/news/innocent-bystander-shot-by-stray-bullet-near-doctors-office/1779913/">one resident told WABC 7</a>, &quot;It&apos;s scary, but at the same time this is New York. People throw each other in front of subway trains in Manhattan all the time. So you can&apos;t worry about it too much, you do what you can to keep yourself safe, and go from there.&quot;</p>

<p>No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
