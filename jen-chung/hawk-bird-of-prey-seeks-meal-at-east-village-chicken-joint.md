<p>We suppose that even hawks get tired of killing their prey&#x2014;yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508120153/http://www.andiamnotlying.com/2009/lunch-hawk/">D. Billy at And I Am Not Lying wrote</a> that he had a good lunch, &quot;<strong>Well&#x2026; there was this one part where A F***ING HAWK FLEW INTO THE RESTAURANT WHERE I WAS EATING, AND LANDED ON MY FOOD.</strong>&quot; What follows is an endearing story of shock and awe:</p><blockquote>I was sitting at a window seat next to the open door, and my food had just been brought out. I looked down to see this guy (or gal - I don&#x2019;t know hawks) just standing in the doorway, looking back and forth. After surveying the place for a few seconds, it flapped its way in and up onto one of the empty tables.<p></p>

<p>The guy working the counter came out, and we were both (slowly and carefully) snapping pictures with our phones. The hawk didn&#x2019;t react to us apart from turning his head to look back and forth between us &#x2014; even when said employee said:<br>
&#x201C;<em>Man, you inna wrong place, bird! Dontchu know this a chicken joint?</em>&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The hawk, whose talons were covered in jerk BBQ sauce while &quot;looking all emo,&quot; eventually got spooked when a delivery guy entered and flew into the kitchen: &quot;The counter guy, the delivery guy and I heard a few pots clanging as we debated calling animal control versus just trying to shoo it back out the door, <strong>when one of the cooks who was back there caught the hawk with his bare hands, and walked it back outside</strong>.&quot;  Awesome.  More awesome: It happened at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508120153/http://www.yelp.com/biz/birdies-grandmas-chicken-for-the-people-new-york">Birdie&apos;s</a>.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508120153/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/08/how_many_hawks_are_flying_around_ha.php">hawks</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508120153/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/28/five_baby_falcons_born_at_three_cit.php">falcons</a> in the city&#x2014;they help keep the rat population down.  A few years ago, Bryant Park put its hawk program (with hawks used to seek rats) on ice because hawks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508120153/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/07/hawks_vs_ratdogs.php">were attacking rat-like dogs</a>.  </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508120153/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/20/hudson_hawks_red-tailed_hawks_at_ri.php">some pictures of red-tailed hawks in Riverside Park</a>, where, unfortunately, there was no chicken in jerk BBQ sauce.</p>
