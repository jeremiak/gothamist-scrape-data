It&apos;s believed that Khadim Hussain Bhatti picked up a few passengers at 5 a.m. and one shot him in the stomach. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103729/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/nyregion/01livery.html?ref=nyregion">According to the NY Times</a>, Fernando Mateo, spokesman for the NY State Federation of Taxi Drivers, said that Bhatti worked for a car service, but &quot;added that [Bhatti]  worked in his off hours for lower fares not arranged through a dispatcher,&quot; which is what Bhatti  was doing yesterday morning: &quot;It was not a dispatched call, it was an independent hustle, which we don&#x2019;t encourage, but that is the way these guys make a living.&quot; Bhatti, a Pakistani immigrant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103729/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01012009/news/regionalnews/livery_driver_slain_146767.htm">had supported his family</a> with his driving. Mateo also said that the number of livery cab killings had dropped off in recent years&#x2014;the last he could remember was in 2006, &#x201C;In the 1990s, through 2000, there were well over 250 murders of livery drivers. They averaged about 25 a year, or two a month.&quot;</p>
