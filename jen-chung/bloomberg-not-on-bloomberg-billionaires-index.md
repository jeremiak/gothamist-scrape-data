<p>Bloomberg News published its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402030856/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-05/slim-beats-gates-in-global-daily-ranking-of-billionaires.html">first Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>&#x2014;and its founder, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is nowhere to be found!  Probably because his net worth is estimated to be in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402030856/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/mayor_bloomberg_worth_20_billion_wh.php">$20 billion range</a>.  The biggest billionaire is Carlos Slim, the Mexican mobile phone mogul (and NY Times lender), whose net worth is $68.5 billion; number two on the list is Bill Gates ($62.4 billion) and Warren Buffett ($43.8 billion).  And the richest European? Ingvar Kamprad, whose IKEA empire has given him a fortune of over $40 billion.</p>

<p>The index, who is to be updated daily, appears to be Bloomberg News&apos; foray into lists that have mainstays at Forbes and Fortune.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402030856/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-05/slim-beats-gates-in-global-daily-ranking-of-billionaires.html">Bloomberg News reports</a> about the billionaire battling brewing, &quot;Brazil&#x2019;s Eike Batista, who ranks 10th, still covets the top spot after vowing a year ago that he&#x2019;d become the world&#x2019;s wealthiest man by 2015. &apos;I&#x2019;m competitive,&apos; Batista, who trails Slim by almost $39 billion, said in a March 2 telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. &apos;It&#x2019;s Brazil&#x2019;s time to be No. 1. Brazilians have always admired the American dream. What&#x2019;s happening in Brazil is the Brazilian dream and I happen to be the example.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Other notable rich guys on the list&#x2014;Charles and David Koch, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402030856/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/19/koch_brother_cries_about_threats_de.php">brothers behind</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402030856/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/03/report_tea_partying_koch_brothers_c.php">Tea Party moves</a>&#x2014;each bro has $34 billion.</p>

<p>Here are details on how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402030856/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-05/bloomberg-s-billionaires-index-how-we-crunch-net-worth-numbers.html">Bloomberg News crunched on the numbers</a>: &quot;We try to identify and confirm all potential liabilities. No assumptions are made about personal debt.&quot;</p>
