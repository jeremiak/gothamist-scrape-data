<p>Yes, some bridezillas will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118101634/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/worst_bridezilla_ever_woman_indicte.php">fake terminal leukemia to have the perfect wedding</a>. But flirting with felonies seems like child&apos;s play when some other brides are making sure they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118101634/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/fashion/weddings/Losing-Weight-in-Time-for-the-Wedding.html">drop the pounds by getting feeding tubes inserted through their noses</a>. And don&apos;t worry&#x2014;these brides are totally cool with walking around with their tubes giving them their 800 calories/day!</p>

<p>The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118101634/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/fashion/weddings/Losing-Weight-in-Time-for-the-Wedding.html"> NY Times&apos; Styles section looks</a> at how brides try further exert control on their most important day by depriving themselves of sustenance.  One Illinois bride was worried when her weight was 159 pounds, which would endanger her plans of wearing her grandmother&apos;s wedding dress: &quot;She took prescription pills, had vitamin B shots and made weekly $45 visits to a Medithin clinic in Janesville, Wis. When she married on March 18, she was back to 125 pounds; the gown, from 1938, fit perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p>A Pennsylvania bride dropped 70 punds on the Dukan diet, explaining, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t want to be a fat bride.&quot; Another bride lost 14 pounds in six weeks via a combinations of &quot;injections [of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118101634/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hcg-diet/an02091">human chorionic gonadotropin</a>], weekly meetings with a registered nurse and a 500-calorie diet,&quot; which cost $950. And then there&apos;s what one Florida doctor is offering &quot;<strong>a nasogastric tube (a tube that goes through the nose and down the esophagus into the stomach) to provide all nourishment, with no carbohydrates, for 10 days.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>One patient, Jessica Schnaider, lost 10 pounds in eight days, so the doctor took her off it!  Schnaider told the Times, &quot;People think I&#x2019;m sick, I&#x2019;m dying,&quot; and added that she didn&apos;t go to her kids&apos; school while wearing the tube, &quot;The children, they would be scared.&quot; </p>

<p>A doctor critical of the feeding-tube plan, Dr. Louis Aronne, the director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Program at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, said, &quot;Any extreme low-calorie diet is associated with side effects, kidney stones, dehydration, headaches and if you lose muscle mass and water, what&#x2019;s the point of that?&quot; But the photographs will look so awesome!  </p>
