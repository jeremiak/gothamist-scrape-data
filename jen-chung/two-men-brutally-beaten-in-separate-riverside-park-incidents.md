He was robbed of his wallet, book bag, laptop and cellphone, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011959/http://www.westsiderag.com/2014/11/09/4-men-put-bag-over-victims-head-and-beat-him-in-riverside-park-police-beaten">police flyer indicated his head</a> was covered by his assailants during the attack.

<p>Jessica Rieske was walking her dogs on Thursday night when she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011959/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/11/11/2000-reward-offered-following-attacks-in-riverside-park/">saw the first victim</a>, &quot;He was bleeding a lot from his head. He had been beaten pretty badly. The whole left side of his face was swollen... I walked him home and we got him an ambulance and then the police came&quot;</p>

<p>The second attack occurred at West 72nd Street in the park, when a 58-year-old homeless man was beaten. He was not hospitalized. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011959/http://www.westsiderag.com/2014/11/09/4-men-put-bag-over-victims-head-and-beat-him-in-riverside-park-police-beaten">A tipster told West Side Rag</a> that she noticed a homeless man in the river, clinging to the wall last Friday, &quot;His face was bloodied, his hands scraped raw and he was visibly shaking and seemed quite disoriented.&quot; The tipster, who had also been walking her dogs, called 911 and continued her walk:</p><blockquote> I continued southward and at the equivalent of W. 68 street in Riverside Park South the pier where the yoga classes are held in the summer was cordoned off w/ NYPD crime scene tape and an officer was standing guard. In speaking w/ her, she explained that a young man had been mugged there the night before and brutally beaten. (It was a bloody crime scene) When I told her about the I was the person who phoned in the homeless man in the river, she explained that he too was probably a victim of the same thugs. Long story short: I spoke w/ Detectives who informed me both men (homeless guy was in okay shape, the other young man had a serious head injury) were victimized at about 11 pm on Thursday night with the homeless guy being thrown over the railing and the young man beaten about the head.</blockquote>Police describe the assailants as four black males and are offering a $2,000 reward.<p></p>
