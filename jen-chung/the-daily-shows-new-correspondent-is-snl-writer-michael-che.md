<p>On the heels of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155333/http://dcist.com/2014/04/video_john_oliver_takes_on_former_n.php">former correspondent John Oliver&apos;s HBO debut</a>, <em>The Daily Show</em> has announced it&apos;s adding <em>Saturday Night Live</em> writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155333/http://michaelche.com/">Michael Che</a> to the program.</p>

<p>Che has been writing for SNL since 2013. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155333/http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/04/28/daily-show-michael-che/">According to EW</a>, he &quot;will join the Comedy Central series in June after he finishes his stint at SNL... Che started doing standup in 2010, and since then has won New York&#x2019;s Funniest Stand-Up Competition, appeared on CBS&#x2019; Late Show, and was a regular on VH1&#x2032;s short-lived Best Week Ever reboot.&quot;</p>

<p>When he was on the Late Show in 2012, Che explained he was from the Lower East Side, &quot;which is a gentrified neighborhood. If you don&apos;t know what gentrified means, it&apos;s when a bunch of white people moves to a messed-up neighborhood and then open up cupcake stores everywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Che actually delved into LES gentrification in a more in-depth manner for MTV:</p>
