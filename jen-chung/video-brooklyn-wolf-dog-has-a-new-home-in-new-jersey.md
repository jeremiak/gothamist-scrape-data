<p>Hey, you know the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111226224339/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/wolf_found_on_the_streets_of_brookl.php">wolf that was found in Brooklyn</a>, only to be determined to be a wolf-dog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111226224339/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/23/brooklyn_wolf_is_an_illegal_wolf-do.php">a hybrid that&apos;s illegal to keep in NYC</a>?  Well, as of yesterday, the female wolf-dog has a home and she looks happy&#x2014;watch this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111226224339/http://agreatbigcity.com/a-happy-holiday-for-the-bro">According to A Great Big City</a>, Howling Woods Farm in Jackson Township, NJ was &quot;able to take the animal in and give it a home for the holidays! Howling Woods is a &apos;breed-specific animal shelter that rescues and places domestic bred wolves&apos;, and is able to provide the care that the animal will need.&quot;</p>

<p>The video&apos;s description also says, &quot;New arrival 12/24/2011, &#x201C;Rosie&#x201D; made it to Howling Woods Farm just in time for the Holidays. It&#x2019;s a much better place than the barn she stayed in after her owner sadly passed. Though a little overwhelmed, she is very affectionate and seeking to bond with a special someone.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111226224339/http://www.howlingwoods.org/wolf_dogs.html">Howling Woods Farm&apos;s website</a> explains a little more wolf-dogs. For instance, &quot;Some folks believe that wolfdogs are inherently provocative and aggressive, or that they are capable of &apos;turning on you&apos;. Just the opposite is true. By nature, they tend to be timid, loving, family(pack)-oriented and trusting of pack members.&quot;</p>
