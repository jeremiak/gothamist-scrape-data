She summed up how the neighborhood has changed, &quot;Oh, you know, it&apos;s bank, nail salon, bank, nail salon, bank, nail salon. The Subway across the street from Veselka, it&apos;s just an eyesore. The bigger chains coming in everywhere, it&apos;s depressing. <strong>You know what really bugs me about the neighborhood, actually? The students! The N.Y.U. kids and they&apos;ve opened an SVA dorm near my house, so now it&apos;s even more.</strong>&quot;  The <i>Big Love</i> wife says that if she did move from the EV, she&apos;d go back to Gramercy Park.
