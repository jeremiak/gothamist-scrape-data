<p>While you aim to have the best, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042343/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/29/nye_advice_must_credit_lauren_evans_dot_com.php">most bangin&apos; New Year&apos;s Eve possible</a>, the NYC Health Department wants to make sure you&apos;re healthy in 2016&#x2014;starting at 12:01 a.m.&#x2014;and noted that alcohol-related visits to the hospital are &quot;more than double on New Year&#x2019;s Day compared to the rest of the year.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, the Health Department says that ER visits &quot;peak during the hours 1 to 4 a.m. during New Year&#x2019;s Day.&quot; Here&apos;s a graph:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_12_alcohoer.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042343im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_12_alcohoer.jpg" width="640" height="317"> <br> <i> NYC Dept. of Health</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett urged, &quot;More than any other day of the year, New York City&#x2019;s emergency rooms treat people for issues related to excessive alcohol consumption during the early hours of New Year&#x2019;s Day. No one wants to spend their New Year&#x2019;s in a hospital room. Avoid drinking excessively and watch out for your friends to keep them from hurting themselves or others.&quot;</p>

<p>And the DOH offered these &quot;risk reduction tips for holiday revelers&quot;<br>
<em>- Be conscious of how much alcohol you consume: it&#x2019;s better to have one fewer drink than one too many<br>
- Eat dinner before the celebrations and snack throughout the evening<br>
- Pace yourself and if you choose to drink alcohol, alternate alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages<br>
- Stay well hydrated - drink plenty of water or a non-alcoholic beverage such as seltzer in between drinks</em></p>
