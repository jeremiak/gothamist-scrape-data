And most notably it&apos;s that he had $16 million to share between his children, his wife and his fiancee. Yes, his wife AND his fiancee. </p>

<p>The last surviving son of &quot;financier&quot; Bernard Madoff, Andrew Madoff insisted that he had no idea about his father&apos;s $60 billion Ponzi scheme&#x2014;even though he worked for his dad. However, Irving Picard, the trustee in charge with seizing assets from Madoff&apos;s scam, said that Andrew Madoff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081139/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/finally_madoffs_sons_brother_niece.php">got about $60 million from unsuspecting victims</a>. </p>

<p>&#x201C;I request my executor to pay to Catherine Hooper, so long as she is living, the sum of $50,000 on the first day of each month, commencing 30 days after the admission of this will to probate, for her support until the administration of my estate is completed,&#x201D; says the will, which was dated July 8.</p>

<p>After the estate is completed, she&#x2019;ll be paid from a trust which will have an undisclosed sum of money in it.</p>

<p>Also getting trusts are his two children, who were left all of their father&#x2019;s personal property.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081139/http://nypost.com/2014/09/11/andrew-madoff-left-16m-fortune-to-family/">One victim told the Post</a>, &quot;Sixteen million? And all these people were out of their money?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Andrew Madoff died at age 48 from lymphoma. His older brother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081139/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/11/bernard_madoffs_son_mark_found_dead.php">Mark Madoff killed himself in 2010</a>, with his baby son in the apartment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081139/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20692939,00.html">Madoff told People last year</a>, &quot;One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly. And it&#x2019;s killing me slowly.&quot;</p>
