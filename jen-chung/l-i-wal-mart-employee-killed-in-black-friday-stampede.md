<p>This morning, shoppers apparently broke down the doors of a Valley Stream Wal-Mart, and, in the process, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115150/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-limart1129,0,167903.story">trampled a Wal-Mart greeter to death</a> around 5 a.m.  The Nassau County police tell Newsday the store was a &quot;mob scene&quot; and that the worker was a temporary, part-time employee.  One witness, Kimberly Cribbs of Far Rockaway, said that other Wal-Mart employees (some of whom were crying) asked shoppers to leave:</p><blockquote>Though rumors circulated among the shoppers that someone had been badly injured, people ignored the Wal-Mart workers&apos; requests that they stop shopping, move to the front of the store and exit, Cribbs said.<p></p>

<p>&quot;They kept shopping. It&apos;s not right. They&apos;re savages,&quot; Cribbs said.</p>

<p>She said she entered the store after the worker was already being attended to by emergency personnel. As people waited, then pushed into the store, she said, &quot;It was chaos.&quot;</p></blockquote>A Wal-Mart employee, Jimmy Overby, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115150/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>He was bum-rushed by 200 people. They took the doors off the hinges.</strong> He was trampled and killed in front of me. They took me down too...I literally had to fight people off my back.&quot;<p></p>
