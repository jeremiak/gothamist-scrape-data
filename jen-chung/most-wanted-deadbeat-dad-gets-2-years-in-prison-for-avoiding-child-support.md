Sand. He was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233612/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/pr/2012/2012dec18.html">arrested last year</a> by federal authorities, after he fled to Asia to avoid paying over $1 million in child support. And Uncle Sam does not like it when parents shirk on child support&#x2014;Sand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233612/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/nyregion/man-labeled-most-wanted-deadbeat-parent-gets-2-year-sentence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">was sentenced to two years in prison</a>.</p>

<p>Sand, 50, had run a successful car auction business on Long Island, making $500,000-600,000 a year. In 1995, he was ordered to pay his ex-wife Lisa Sand $750 a week (later raised to $995) for child support for their two daughters. However, he stopped paying them after two years. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233612/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/nyregion/top-deadbeat-parent-is-arrested-but-may-avoid-prison.html">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Mr. Sand married another woman and moved to Florida in 1997, but that couple, after having one child, also divorced, leaving Mr. Sand with an additional obligation of $625 per week in child support. As his debts accumulated, in 2000 the Nassau County Family Court issued a warrant for his arrest, and he fled the country soon afterward. A federal arrest warrant was issued in 2002.&quot; </p>

<p>Sand was spotted in Thailand and was eventually caught when he entered Thailand without identification. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233612/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57570737-504083/robert-sand-no-1-deadbeat-parent-pleads-guilty-to-owing-more-than-$1.2-million-to-three-kids/">pleaded guilty to the charges earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>His exes wanted Sand to start working immediately to pay off the debt&#x2014;Sand&apos;s lawyer had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233612/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/syosset-dad-robert-sand-agrees-to-pay-1-2m-in-child-support-1.4687665">said in February</a>, &quot;Mr. Sand wants to do the appropriate thing to set things right, and he&apos;s taken the first step in doing just that. Mr. Sand is a capable person, and given the opportunity to work, I am confident he will obtain good employment and pay off his debt&quot; and Lisa Sand said, &quot;What he did was horrendous.... But I need the money now.&quot; </p>

<p>However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233612/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/judge-sentences-syosset-deadbeat-dad-1.5309244">judge refused and opted to send him to jail first,</a> because he wanted to send a message to other deadbeat parents: &quot;This is a horrendous crime. I have to send a message of deterrence.&quot;</p>
