<p>After weeks of speculation, Major League Baseball has handed down a stunning 211-game suspension for Yankess&apos; slugger Alex Rodriguez. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173435/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130805&amp;content_id=55962046&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb">said</a>, &quot;We conducted a thorough, aggressive investigation guided by facts so that we could justly enforce our rules.&quot; However, the ban, which would span late into the 2014 season, is likely to be appealed by Rodriguez, who will be able to play until the appeal is heard.</p>

<p>The rumors of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173435/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/04/alex_rodriguez_faces_214-game_ban_f.php">hefty suspension heated up</a> after Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173435/http://news.yahoo.com/ryan-braun-accepts-65-game-drug-suspension-072736678.html">accepted a 65-game suspension</a> last month. Rodriguez, Braun and others players <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173435/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130805&amp;content_id=55953176&amp;c_id">who received 50-game suspensions</a> have links to Biogenesis, a Miami-based anti-aging and performance-enhancement clinic. MLB also said that Rodriguez&apos;s &quot;use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years&quot; prompted the suspension.&quot;</p>

<p>Selig added, &quot;Despite the challenges this situation has created during a great season on the field, we pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do. For weeks, I have noted the many players throughout the game who have strongly voiced their support on this issue, and I thank them for it.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173435/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/sports/baseball/mlb-suspends-12-in-doping-investigation.html?emc=edit_na_20130805">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Recovering from hip surgery and a quadriceps strain, Rodriguez had planned to make his 2013 return to the Yankees&#x2019; lineup Monday night in Chicago against the White Sox. The suspension becomes effective on Thursday, so he can play until then regardless of his plans to appeal, which he is expected to announce shortly. If he does appeal, he would be eligible to play until his case is heard by an arbitrator.&quot;</p>
