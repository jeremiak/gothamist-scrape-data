<p>President Obama is visiting the Garden State and Big Apple today, so everyone should just get ready for the inevitable gridlock headaches.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145515/http://www.1010wins.com/Get-Ready-for-Gridlock--Obama-Is-Coming-to-Town/7788938">According to the AP/1010 WINS</a>, &quot;Obama was to speak Wednesday at a sandwich shop in Edison, N.J., to tout a lending initiative aimed at small businesses. From there he was to travel to New York to tape an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145515/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/26/bfd_obama_in_nyc_for_wednesday_view.php">interview with the daytime talk show &apos;The View&apos;</a> and attend two high-dollar fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee.&quot;</p>

<p>From what we&apos;ve gleaned: NJ Governor Chris Christie will greet Obama at Newark Liberty International Airport between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m.  Then the president will head to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145515/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/will_obama_be_eating_a_nj_sub_sandw.php">Tastee Sub Shop in Edison, NJ</a>.  As for exact street closures in Manhattan, the NYPD hasn&apos;t disclosed any but the View tapes on West 66th Street, off West End Avenue, so expect some gridlock in the Lincoln Center/Upper West Side area  Also, NYC Transit sent out this advisory:</p><blockquote> President Barack Obama is scheduled to visit Manhattan on Wednesday, July 28, 2010.  As a result, based on street closures (frozen zones) instituted by the U.S. Secret Service and the New York City Police Department, many local and express bus routes in Lower and Midtown Manhattan are expected to be either severely delayed or detoured between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m., especially the M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M7, M9, M11, M14/14A/14D, M15, M20, M21, M31, Q32, M50, M66, M72, M98, M101, M102, M103, M104, BxM1, BxM2, BxM3, BxM4, BxM6, BxM7, BxM7a, BxM9, BxM10 and BxM11.  <p></p>

<p>In addition, some subway station entrances/exits along the motorcade route may be temporarily closed. </p></blockquote><br>
