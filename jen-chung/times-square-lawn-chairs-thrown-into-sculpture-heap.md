</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s happened!  The lawn chairs, placed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220230611/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/26/breaking_in_pedestrian_plazad_times.php">Times Square pedestrian plazas</a> to much derision, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220230611/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/23/those_cheap_times_square_lawn_chair.php">pain</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220230611/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/27/broadway.php">enjoyment</a>, have been gathered up to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220230611/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/19/end_is_nigh_for_controversial_lawn.php">make way for more permanent chairs</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220230611/http://timessquarenyc.org/">Times Square Alliance</a> asked sculptor Jason Peters to create some art from the chairs, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220230611/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08162009/news/regionalnews/ugly_square_chairs_pile_up_184750.htm">Post says</a> he used &quot;zip ties to lash about 70 of the chairs together Friday morning in an installation that will stay up until 9 p.m. tonight. Maybe you can say adieu before the public screening of the Mad Men premiere in Times Square at 10 p.m. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220230611/http://timessquarenyc.org/then_now/MadMen.html">details</a>). </p>

<p>The new chairs will be placed in the plazas starting tomorrow; the TSA says it&apos;s sending the lawn chairs to people who requested them, &quot;<strong>We&apos;re also working on a tongue-and-cheek certificate of authenticity to go with each.</strong>&quot;</p>
