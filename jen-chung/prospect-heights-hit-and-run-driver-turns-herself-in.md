Frances Jasmin surrendered at the 77th Precinct and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112830/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-arrest-in-hit-and-run,0,7456223.story">arrested and charged</a> with &quot;leaving the scene of the accident which resulted in serious injury.&quot;  </p>

<p>Erinn Phelan and Alma Guerrero had been crossing at Flatbush and Prospect Place when an Acura Legend hit them; Guerrero, 23, suffered a broken collarbone, while Phelan, 22, was severely injured and is currently in a coma.  The police found the abandoned car and tracked it down to owner Cindy Jasmin, who said that her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112830/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/24/hit-and-run_car_owner_my_sister_did.php">sister Frances was driving</a>&#x2014;and that she was in psychiatric hospital because she was distraught.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112830/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/other_sis_did_it_nk0D5Eqfk1AVK11LvNxuLN">Post reports</a> that while cops questioned Cindy Jasmin&apos;s claim that her sister was the driver, later &quot;investigators began to give her story more credence after records placed Jasmin&apos;s cellphone in the vicinity of Prospect Heights shortly after the Feb. 21 accident, sources said. <strong>Cops also spoke to someone who told of receiving a phone call shortly after the accident from Jasmin, who said, &apos;I just hit two people.</strong>&apos;&quot;  </p>

<p>A lawyer for Frances Jasmin, who is being held on $300,000 bond or $150,000 cash bail, said, &quot;She&apos;s not been on the run or in hiding. She didn&apos;t know what she hit and then when she finally knew she was at the hospital the next day.&quot; And Cindy Jasmin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112830/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/03/10/2010-03-10_driver_blamed_in_brooklyn_hitandrun_that_left_young_mayors_aide_with_severe_brai.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;As much as we&apos;re going through it, it&apos;s even tougher for&quot; the victims&apos; families.</p>

<p>Phelan is a coordinator in the mayor&apos;s volunteerism effort; Mayor Bloomberg<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112830/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/nyregion/11hitandrun.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss"> said yesterday</a>, &quot;Today the New York City Police Department made an arrest in the hit-and-run case that has left Erinn Phelan clinging to life.  Erinn is a fighter, and all of us here at City Hall &#x2014; and from around the city &#x2014; are pulling and praying for her.&quot;</p>
