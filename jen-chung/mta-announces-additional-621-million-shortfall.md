										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_metrocardmach.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311202058im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_metrocardmach.jpg" width="116" height="110" class="image-right"> </span>The MTA, which already has a $1.2 billion budget deficit (hence the <a href="doomsday_mta_board_votes_on_fare_hi.php">doomsday fare hikes and service cuts</a>), now says it&apos;s been hit with another $621 million shortfall. Why?  Because of &quot;the continuing decline in the real estate and dedicated taxes that support the MTA, all of which are economically sensitive.&quot; Oh, and also the &quot;increasing unemployment and higher fares led the MTA to predict a 7.2% drop in usage of its facilities in 2009.&quot;  All told, the re-forecast for 2008 says real estate taxes are down $336 million, fare/toll revenue is down $221 million and state dedicated taxes are down $113 million (there was a $49 million budget surplus).  The MTA will have to find a way to make up this new shortfall as well, but MTA Chairman Dale Hemmerdinger said, &quot;This is terrible news for the MTA, our customers and the regional economy, and the MTA Board will do everything in our power to protect the transit network. <strong>Without assistance from Albany, however, it will be extremely painful for everyone who relies on MTA services.</strong>&quot;</p>
