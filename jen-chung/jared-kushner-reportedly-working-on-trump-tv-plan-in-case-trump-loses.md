<p>While the Republican presidential candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump">continues ranting on Twitter</a>, many Democrats may now enjoy a momentary ray of hope amidst all the election-related dread, thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/https://www.ft.com/content/7dc39954-940e-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582">Financial Times</a>, which reports that &quot;Donald Trump&apos;s son-in-law Jared Kushner has informally approached one of the media industry&apos;s top dealmakers about the prospect of setting up a Trump television network after the presidential election in November.&quot; Because Trump TV only works with Trump out of the White House... right?</p>

<p>Kushner, Trump&apos;s favorite (and only) son-in-law, is seen by many as the shadow campaign manager, wielding influence with his wife (Trump&apos;s favorite biological child Ivanka&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/good_luck_gop.php">&quot;piece of ass, even to her dad&quot;</a>) to help determine who is fired and hired in this clown show. In fact, Kushner and campaign CEO/Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon recently tried to have various women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/trump_clinton_accusers.php">seated in the &quot;family box&quot; during the last debate</a>. Anyway, the Financial Times reports that Kushner &quot;contacted Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder and chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment bank, within the past couple of months, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.&quot;</p><blockquote>Their conversation was brief and has not progressed since, the people said. Mr Bourkoff and Mr Kushner both declined to comment.<p></p>

<p>However, the approach suggests Mr Kushner and the Republican candidate himself are thinking about how to capitalise on the populist movement that has sprung up around their campaign in the event of an election defeat to Democrat Hillary Clinton next month...</p>

<p>Mr Trump, whose campaign is headed by populist digital media entrepreneur Stephen Bannon, has denied that he wants to start his own channel. &#x201C;I have no interest in a media company. False rumour,&#x201D; he told the Washington Post last month, following a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/donald-trump-tv-network">Vanity Fair report</a> that he and his advisers had explored the idea.</p>

<p>Mr Bourkoff, who launched LionTree in 2012, has advised on transactions worth more than $300bn, including Liberty Global&#x2019;s $23.3bn acquisition of Virgin Media and Verizon&#x2019;s $4.4bn takeover of AOL. He is also John Malone&#x2019;s favoured adviser and helped the so-called &#x201C;Cable Cowboy&#x201D; consolidate the US pay-TV industry &#x2014; in deals that culminated in Charter Communications&#x2019; $78bn takeover of Time Warner Cable this year.</p>

<p>More importantly, Mr Bourkoff is a friend of Mr Kushner, who is married to Mr Trump&#x2019;s daughter Ivanka. The two have worked together in the past: Mr Bourkoff advised Mr Kushner, who also owns the weekly New York Observer newspaper, when he tried to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team four years ago.</p></blockquote>Fox News founder and disgraced CEO Roger Ailes, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/roger_ailes_officially_forced_out_o.php">was ousted after multiple women</a> accused him of sexual harassment, has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/16/thelma_and_louise_style.php">informally advising</a> Trump. <p></p>

<p>And the real estate developer also has Fox News host Sean Hannity in his corner; Hannity suggested that the women who have accused Trump of sexually assaulting them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/10/13/hannity-defends-trump-over-sexual-assault-allegations-suggesting-it-may-have-been-welcome-victim/213828">were asking for it</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, American University communications professor Leonard Steinhorn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-once-said-tv-ruined-politics-then-it-made-him-a-star/2016/09/22/30533596-7c51-11e6-bd86-b7bbd53d2b5d_story.html">told the Washington Post</a> that Trump &quot;had a lifetime of experience with TV, and he understands the power of the medium in a way that many presidents have not. Donald Trump set out in this campaign to dominate the [TV] experience, to keep people glued in and to define the parameters of how we all experience this election. Hillary Clinton doesn&#x2019;t have the artfulness or the personality to compete with that.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Mitt Romney adviser Stuart Stevens demurred, &quot;If he was a genius at using TV, more people would like him. His belief is all coverage is good coverage. Maybe that&#x2019;s true if you are selling condos, but it&#x2019;s not true if you are selling the presidency.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-extends-lead-over-donald-trump-to-11-points-1476622801">The latest polls</a> do show Trump struggling, but everyone knows that&apos;s just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020030945/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/business/media/criticism-of-the-news-media-takes-on-a-more-sinister-tone.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjim-rutenberg&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=1&amp;referer=http:/www.nytimes.com/by/jim-rutenberg">the media conspiring against him</a>.</p>
