<p>The rally will be at the Stonewall Inn, 53 Christopher St, from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and organizers say: &quot;Join us in front of the Stonewall Inn as we stand in solidarity with every immigrant, asylum seeker, refugee and every person impacted by Donald Trump&apos;s illegal, immoral, unconstitutional and un-American executive orders. We will also speak out against Trump&apos;s selection of the most anti-LGBT nominees and appointees in modern history.&quot;</p>

<p>GLAAD President &amp; CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said, &quot;The LGBTQ community has a storied legacy of standing up, making our voices heard, and fighting vigorously against hate and discrimination. GLAAD is honored to be among the organizations participating in this powerful rally at the historic Stonewall Inn, where diverse LGBTQ people once again are standing in solidarity with all those affected by the discriminatory acts of the Trump Administration,&quot; in a statement sent to reporters.</p>
