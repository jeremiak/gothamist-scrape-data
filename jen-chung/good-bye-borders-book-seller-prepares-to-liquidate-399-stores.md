President Mike Edwards said, &quot;Following the best efforts of all parties, we are saddened by this development. We were all working hard toward a different outcome, but the head winds we have been facing for quite some time, including the rapidly changing book industry, [electronic reader] revolution, and turbulent economy, have brought us to where we are now.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083834/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303661904576454353768550280.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories#project%3DBorders_Books_Closings_Map%26articleTabs%3Darticle">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;The liquidation of the company&apos;s remaining 399 stores could start as soon as Friday, and the chain is expected to go out of business for good by the end of September, the company said.&quot;  Grove/Atlantic publisher Morgan Entrekin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083834/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/borders-calls-off-auction-plans-to-liquidate/?hp">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;It saddens me tremendously because it was a wonderful chain of bookstores that sold our books very well It&#x2019;s part of the whole change that we&#x2019;re dealing with, which is very confusing.&quot;</p>

<p>The company, which is the country&apos;s second largest book retailer, employs over 10,000 people, and one Twitter user, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083834/https://twitter.com/#!/maureenjohnson">author Maureen Johnson</a>, started a hashtag, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083834/https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23saveborderspeople">#saveborderspeople</a> to help soon-to-be-unemployed Borders workers with getting jobs.
