<p>There&apos;s loads of Caroline Giuliani-related news, but let&apos;s start with one of the more curious matters: Her transformation from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920203648/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/caroline_giuliani_will_never_forget.php?gallery0Pic=3#gallery">grungy-looking (in a NYU t-shirt)</a> alleged shoplifter in handcuffs to glowing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920203648/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/caroline_giuliani_will_never_forget.php?gallery0Pic=1#gallery">Harvard sweatshirt clad co-ed</a>, with flowing blond tresses, confidently walking out of the station house. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920203648/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/sin_derella_quick_change_QEWJrPwA9MOHOiFnqQrRCM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">According to the Post&apos;s sources</a>, it was because of...the Post! &quot;After a Post photographer snapped Rudy Giuliani&apos;s dowdy daughter in cuffs... she asked cops if she could put on a little makeup.&quot; </p>

<p>The 20-year-old daughter of &quot;America&apos;s mayor&quot; was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920203648/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/04/caroline_giuliani_arrested_for_shop.php">arrested on Wednesday afternoon</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920203648/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/06/2010-08-06_andrew_i_got_yer_back_lil_sister.html">allegedly stealin</a>g &quot;$40 Dior Skinflash primer sheer, a $22 Make Up For Ever Aqua Cream, a $10 Sephora brand Refillable Rollerball and three $3.50 snag-free elastics&quot; from a Sephora store at Lexington and 86th.  When at the 19th Precinct, she apparently spent 15 minutes in a bathroom glamming herself up. One stylist said, &quot;It will probably go down in history as the best jailhouse transformation ever.<strong> She made sure her hair and makeup were on point</strong>,&quot; while another sympathized, &quot;I think letting her hair down made a big difference. Everybody wants a good mug shot.&quot;</p>

<p>One woman&#x2014;busted on a Duane Reade shoplifting charged&#x2014;who was locked up in holding with Caroline <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920203648/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/it_cuff_love_for_rudy_kid_Yso5vHzdzavQTBreIMV55L?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">revealed</a>, &quot;She introduced herself as Caroline. She didn&apos;t make any issue about being Giuliani&apos;s daughter. I didn&apos;t find out until I heard the police call out her name... We were in the same place. She was no better than me.&quot; </p>
