<p>One hundred ninety-eight hours of President Richard Nixon&apos;s recordings were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101955/http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/virtuallibrary/documents/dec08.php">released by the Nixon Library yesterday</a>, as well as 90,000 pages of documents.  The recordings are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101955/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=6378441&amp;page=1">all from November and December 1972</a>, after his re-election.  And, as MSNBC&apos;s First Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101955/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/12/02/1695418.aspx">puts it</a>, Nixon is as &quot;ruthless, cynical&quot; and &quot;profane&quot; as ever!</p><blockquote>-- On April 4, 1972, Nixon discusses the press with Haldeman:<p></p>

<p>NIXON: &#x201C;Return the calls to those poor dumb bastards ... who I know are our friends. Now do it ... <strong>We made the same mistake [Dwight] Eisenhower made, but not as bad as Eisenhower made, because he sucked the Times too much</strong> ... G-d damn it, don&apos;t talk to them for a while. Will you enforce that now?&apos;<br>
HALDEMAN: &quot;I&apos;ll try.&quot;</p>

<p>-- On May 18, 1972, Nixon talks to Henry Kissinger about the National Security Adviser&apos;s meeting with Ivy League college presidents regarding the war in Vietnam:</p>

<p>NIXON: <strong>&quot;The Ivy League presidents? Why, I&apos;ll never let those sons-of-b------ in the White House again. Never, never, never. </strong>They&apos;re finished. The Ivy League schools are finished ... Henry, I would never have had them in. Don&apos;t do that again ... They came out against us when it was tough ... Don&apos;t ever go to an Ivy League school again, ever. Never, never, never.&quot;</p></blockquote>In documents, Nixon aide H.R. Haldeman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101955/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-nixon3-2008dec03,0,3011353.story">reminds himself to take action against someone believed</a> to be Ted Kennedy: &quot;Get him -- compromising situation . . . Get evidence -- use another Dem as front.&quot;<p></p>
