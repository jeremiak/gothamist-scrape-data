<p>Two men were mugged by a gun-wielding robber in a West Village apartment building lobby last month and cops are still searching for the perpetrator. Yesterday the NYPD released a video of the suspect in hopes the public can help identify and locate him.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at 3:45 a.m. on Sunday, December 13th, when a 30-year-old man and a 29-year-old man were confronted by a robber brandishing &quot;a silver firearm&quot; inside the lobby of a residential building near Waverly Place and Christopher Street.</p>

<p>The mugger then took $400 from the 29-year-old victim before fleeing. No one was injured.<br>
 <br>
The suspect is described as being about 40 years old, 5&apos;4&quot; and 160 pounds, last seen wearing a black shirt under a black jacket, blue jeans, black sneakers and a black winter hat.<br>
