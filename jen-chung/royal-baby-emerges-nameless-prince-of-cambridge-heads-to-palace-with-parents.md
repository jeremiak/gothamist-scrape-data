</div></div>					<p>The newest member of the royal family met his public for the first time. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151650/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/22/royal_baby.php#photo-1">day after his birth</a>, the Prince of Cambridge and his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (also known as Prince William and Kate Middleton), headed back to the Kensington Palace today. And his mother was wearing heels! </p>

<p>The Duchess appeared holding the baby and then gave him to his beaming father. She said, &quot;It&apos;s very emotional, it&apos;s such a special time. I think any parent will know what this feeling feels like.&quot; And Prince William added, &quot;He&apos;s got a good pair of lungs on him, that&apos;s for sure. He&apos;s a big boy, he&apos;s quite heavy. We are still working on a name so we will have that as soon as we can... It&apos;s the first time we have seen him really so we are having a proper chance to catch up.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504151650if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/H9EQxTqwZd8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Prince William also joked the baby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151650/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/10155483/Kate-Middleton-birth-pregnancy-baby.html">had more hair than he did</a>. For her part, Kate Middleton looked amazing&#x2014;not many mothers want to walk around or dress up that much after giving birth! (For fashionistas, she was wearing a bespoke crepe de chine Jenny Packham dress and what looks like her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151650/http://whatkatewore.com/tag/kate-middleton-white-espadrille-wedges/">Pied a Terre espadrille wedge shoes</a>.)</p>

<p>The couple went back into the hospital, to secure the baby in a car seat, and then left for good: Prince William put the baby in the backseat with Kate and then took the keys to drive off. Fun fact&#x2014;when he left the hospital, Prince William wasn&apos;t put in a car seat, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151650/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFmRlrTys9Y">simply carried in his mother&apos;s arms</a>.</p>

<p>The baby is third in line for the British throne. </p>
