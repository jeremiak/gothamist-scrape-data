<p>Nassau County authorities say they received a 911 call after midnight from a 12-year-old boy; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107090159/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/04/brooklyn-fiery-crash-bethpage-slaying-suspect/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that when officers arrived at a home on Seitz Drive in Bethpage &quot;they found the boy&#x2019;s 41-year-old mother dead from multiple stab wounds. His 16-year-old sister was injured as well from what were described as defensive wounds.&quot; </p>

<p>A Nassau County police spokesman said the husband fled the scene and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107090159/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/police-bethpage-homicide-suspect-arrested-in-nyc-after-pursuit-1.12558798">according to Newsday</a>, was &quot;found... parked on the Southern State Parkway near the Newbridge Road exit.&quot; But when cops approached him, he allegedly took off west on the Southern State Parkway and then went onto the Belt Parkway, across Queens and into Brooklyn. </p>

<p>&quot;That vehicle was again located by Nassau County police officers near Flatlands Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue in Brooklyn,&quot; said Detective Lt. Richard LeBrun. &quot;The subject exited his car, charged at the police officers. The police officers, amidst all of the flames, had to subdue this individual.&quot;</p>
