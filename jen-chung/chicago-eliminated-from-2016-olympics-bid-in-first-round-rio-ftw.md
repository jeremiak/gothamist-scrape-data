<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW] </strong>Chicago, welcome to how NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404092654/http://gothamist.com/2005/07/06/ioc_to_nyc_2012_olympics_aint_in_your_backyard.php">felt back in 2005</a>!  The Second City was eliminated in the first round of International Olympics Committee voting for the 2016 Olympics location.  One lesson: The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404092654/http://chicagoist.com/2009/10/02/live_blog_the_final_2016_presentati.php"> star power of President Barack Obama</a>, First Lady Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey is <em>not</em> enough to win an Olympics.  The city is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404092654/http://chicagoist.com/2009/10/02/shock_chicago_eliminated_in_first_r.php">apparently in shock</a>. But let&apos;s face it&#x2014;if NYC wasn&apos;t getting the 2012 Olympics when times were flush, what made Chicago think they could get it during a recession?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It&apos;s just been announced that the 2016 Olympics will be held in Rio de Janeiro, which is a pretty beautiful city, but forget about getting any decent deep dish pizza there.</p>
