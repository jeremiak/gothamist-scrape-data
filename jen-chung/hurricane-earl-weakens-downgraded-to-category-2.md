<p>Forecasters think that Long Island will &quot;dodge a bullet&quot; with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511112637/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneearl">Hurricane Earl</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511112637/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/hurricane-earl-s-threat-to-li-diminishes-as-it-loses-intensity-1.2256318">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;The National Hurricane Center is now predicting that Earl, which went from a Category 4 hurricane with wind speeds of 145 mph to a Category 2 storm with winds of 105 mph Thursday, will likely be a Category 1 hurricane with winds in the 80-mph range by the time it passes Long Island late Friday about 150 miles to the east.&quot;  Now less rain is expected, with winds in the &quot;35 mph to 45 mph range with wind gusts to 50 mph.&quot; </p>

<p>The National Weather Service&apos;s Brandon Smith said, &quot;Though it will still be a hurricane, the impact will be tropical storm force winds.&quot; However, because the storm is weakening, it could &quot;flatten out&quot;&#x2014;Newsday explains that it means &quot;wind velocities won&apos;t be as high the area they cover will be more widespread. And, by default, so could be the area of rainfall.&quot; </p>

<p>Right now, Earl is off North Carolina; a tropical storm warning i<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511112637/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/09/hurricane_earl_appears_to_be_s.html">s still in effect for NJ</a> and  Massachusetts is expected <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511112637/http://www.accuweather.com/blogs/news/story/36547/hurricane-earl-to-bash-nantuck-1.asp">to be hit hard by rain</a>, though Earl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511112637/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/09/forecasters_pre_8.html">may be a Category 1 hurricane</a> by the time it arrives there.</p>
