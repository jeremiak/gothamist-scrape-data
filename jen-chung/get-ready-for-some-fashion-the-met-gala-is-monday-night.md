					<p>On May 1, the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art will become the world&apos;s most vertiginous red carpet, as the museum&apos;s Art Costume Institute&apos;s annual gala will be held, with a bevy of celebrities and the fashion industry&apos;s A-list: The party, for the new exhibition, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/21/rei_kawakubocomme_des_garcons_will.php">about Rei Kawakubo and her line, Comme de Gar&#xE7;ons</a>, is co-chaired by Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour.</p>

<p>The gala is known as the &quot;Party of the Year,&quot; and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/fashion/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-met-gala.html?_r=0">Times explains</a>, &quot;Ms. Wintour, the editor of American Vogue and the artistic director of Cond&#xE9; Nast, took over as chairwoman of the gala in 1999. Since then, she has been instrumental in transforming a local philanthropic event into the ultimate global celebrity/power cocktail: Take a jigger of famous names from fashion, add film, politics and business, and mix. It&#x2019;s such a heady combo that President Trump proposed to his wife, Melania, during the gala in 2004. (In case you are wondering: No, they are not expected this year.) It is among the hardest party tickets of the year to get &#x2014; and thus, intensely coveted.&quot;</p>

<p>Don&apos;t start your #FOMO yet: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://pagesix.com/2017/04/29/inside-the-pettiness-and-politics-of-anna-wintours-met-gala/">Page Six helpfully explains</a>, &quot;[j]ust because you have the pedigree and money &#x2014; tickets start at $30,000 per person and, according to sources, go as high as $50,000 &#x2014; doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re invited.&quot;</p><blockquote>That&#x2019;s true even if you&#x2019;re one of the 100 members of the Friends of the Costume Institute, the committee that helps raise funds for the center.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Anna is extremely restrictive on who can buy a ticket,&#x201D; said a socialite, who has attended the event for years. &#x201C;Many people I know who are Friends, [and] who have the money to pay, have been turned down. Anna decides they can&#x2019;t go. Period.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Now, &#x201C;there aren&#x2019;t as many tickets for them,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Plus, the Friends tickets cost more. I think [the Gala team is] more concerned with getting celebrities to fill the seats. [Vogue contributing editor] Lauren Santo Domingo and [Est&#xE9;e Lauder creative director] Aerin Lauder will get to go. But I know at least 10 people who are Friends who were told no.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I know people [on the Friends committee] who get really frustrated that they can&#x2019;t bring their husbands,&#x201D; added Cameron Silver, founder of luxe vintage shop Decades in Los Angeles, who has been to the gala five times. &#x201C;It becomes a very expensive girls&#x2019; night out.&#x201D;...</p>

<p>&#x201C;Project Runway&#x201D; star Tim Gunn dished on E!&#x2019;s &#x201C;Fashion Police&#x201D; that his invitation was rescinded when he told The Post in 2006 about watching Wintour being carried down five flights of stairs at a fashion show by two bodyguards. After being asked by Vogue flacks to make a retraction &#x2014; and refusing &#x2014; Gunn claimed he had officially become persona non grata: &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had an open war ever since.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>But it&apos;s totally fun to be at home&#x2014;because you can make memes!<p></p>

<p>Or wait for gossip to come out the next day. The most famous post-Met Gala incident is, of course, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/12/video_solange_attacks_jay-z_in_stan.php">surveillance footage of Solange attacking Jay Z</a> in the elevator of The Standard Hotel&#x2014;with Beyonce observing&#x2014;as they headed to a post-Met Gala party.</p>

<p>The video shattered the image of Beyonce and Jay Z&apos;s seemingly happy marriage. But then Beyonce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://www.newsweek.com/lemonade-end-beyonce-jay-z-or-pr-stunt-452095">literally made</a> <em>Lemonade</em> from the situation... so things worked out okay? (Except for the fired Standard employee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/15/the_standard_fires_employee_who_lea.php">who leaked the tape,</a> though he/she probably got money from TMZ.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/16/heres_why.php">Last year&apos;s Met Gala</a> is also where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/16/heres_why.php">Hiddleswift was sparked</a>, and it may also be where Tom Hiddleston&apos;s dreams of becoming James Bond <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/https://theringer.com/tom-hiddleston-losing-james-bond-role-movies-84e85d004915">died</a>.</p>

<p>In the end, the night is <em>really</em> to promote fashion (or cutting-edge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430215853/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/06/photos_kim_kanye_sjp_beyonce_gwynet.php#photo-1">floral maternity wear</a>), and Kawakubo is the rare living designer to be honored with a show (the last was Yves Saint Laurent in 1983). Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton called her &quot;one of the most important and influential designers of the past 40 years. By inviting us to rethink fashion as a site of constant creation, recreation, and hybridity, she has defined the aesthetics of our time.&quot; </p>
