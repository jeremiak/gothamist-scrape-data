<p>An impromptu vigil for the victims of the Paris attacks emerged in Union Square tonight. </p>

<p>The crowd gathered was mostly made up of French nationals or French speakers&#x2014;Nell Casey tells us: &quot;It was pretty silent except for a few exchanges. Most people were just sitting, reflecting,&quot; until they decided to sing the French national anthem, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516093803/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/MARSEILL.asp">La Marseillaise</a>.&quot; Those in attendance at the France-Germany soccer match at Stade de France in Paris&#x2014;a number of explosions occurred around there&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516093803/http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/14/football-fans-sing-la-marseillaise-during-stadium-evacuation-video">sang this</a> as they were evacuated from the stadium Friday night.</p>

<p>The French authorities are continuing to investigate the massacre. Officials there say that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516093803/http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/13/world/paris-shooting/index.html">at least 153 people died</a> in the series of apparently coordinated attacks around the city.</p>

Instead, assailants appeared to strike at random in hip neighborhoods on a Friday night when many people would be starting to enjoy the weekend.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a Friday night, and there&#x2019;s a lot of people out, a lot of tourists out,&#x201D; said a senior European counterterrorism official. &#x201C;If you want maximum exposure, you do it like this, in the dark, when it&#x2019;s scarier and more difficult for police to act.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>For live updates, you can watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516093803/http://www.france24.com/en/livefeed">France24</a>, which is streaming 24/7 from Paris.<p></p>
