<p>The NYPD has released surveillance video of a man they say committed grand larceny in Brooklyn. According to investigators, last Monday, July 14, at 8:50 p.m., a man entered 174 North 5th Street in Williamsburg and proceeded to remove a tenant&apos;s Trek bicycle from the stairwell.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a man, 20-30 years old, with reddish hair and a beard, 5&apos;10&quot;, 200 pounds and with tattoos on both arms. He was last seen wearing a black t-shirt, blue jeans, and red sneakers. The video shows him entering the elevator with the bike and making sure an umbrella is closed (probably since he&apos;ll be riding the bike): </p>
