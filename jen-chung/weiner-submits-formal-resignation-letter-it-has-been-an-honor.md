<p>Anthony Weiner submitted his resignation letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi today, five days after resigning during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428061750/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">weird press conference in Brooklyn</a>.  He wrote, &quot;I hereby resign as a member of the House of Representatives for New York&apos;s Ninth Congressional District, effective at midnight, Tuesday, June 21, 2011. It&apos;s been an honor to serve the people of Queens and Brooklyn.&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner announced his resignation after his claims that his Twitter account was hacked were untrue and it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428061750/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/crying_weiner_admits_to_sending_exp.php">turned out he did send a photograph</a> of his underwear-clad genitals to another person on Twitter...and it turned out he was having numerous online relationships via Twitter, Facebook, Skype and email with different women across the country, with sexually explicit discussions and photographs, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428061750/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weiners_alleged_naked_crotch_shot_r.php">one of his own genitalia</a>.  The bizarrely intimate details in Weinergate also prompted Howard Stern radio show staffer Benjy Bronk to become a star during the June 6 Twitter confession press conference (&quot;Are you shocked that Arnold had sex with an ugly woman?&quot; &quot;In the grey [photo] are you fully erect? Are you capable of more?&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428061750/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okse3TSrZsw">video</a>) and then a bane during the June 16 resignation press conference (&quot;Will you maintain your hot physique and smooth sexy chest?&quot;).  </p>

<p>On today&apos;s Howard Stern Show, Stern said that right after the resignation press conference, Bronk was threatened by a man (possibly an audio engineer who was upset that Bronk was messing up their audio) who said he would paralyze Bronk if Bronk pulled that again. Naturally, Stern wants the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428061750/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43466630/ns/today-entertainment/">NYPD to investigate the incident</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428061750/http://marksfriggin.com/news.htm#mon">According to MarksFriggin</a>, the exhaustive Howard Stern recapper, &quot;Howard said he thinks that Benjy saved the whole thing. He said it was pretty mundane until Benjy did what he did. Howard said that they didn&apos;t miss anything with Weiner. He said the guy resigned and that was it.&quot;</p>
