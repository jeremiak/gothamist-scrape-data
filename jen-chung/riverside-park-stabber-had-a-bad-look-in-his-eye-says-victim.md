</div></div>					<p>Yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152654/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/breaking_multiple_people_stabbed_in.php">stabbing spree in a stretch of Riverside Park South</a> alarmed local residents who frequent the tranquil walking and jogging path&#x2014;especially the victims. James Fayette, who was stabbed in the chest while protecting his two-year-old son Luke (who was slashed in the arm), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152654/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/wounded-stabbing-riverside-park-article-1.1472476">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;There was no getting away. It wasn&apos;t frantic or quick movements. He just kind of stalked.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that Julius Graham, a 43-year-old homeless man from Texas who has been living in a homeless shelter, attacked five people, ranging in age from two to 36. He started in the park near West 64th Street, allegedly stabbing a female jogger, Deanna Koestel, 36, in the back at 7:50 a.m. Then a 36-year-old man, Ben Loehnen, walking his dog was attacked&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152654/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/nyregion/four-people-stabbed-in-riverside-park.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;At first the man thought he had been punched in the stomach, but saw blood and realized he had been stabbed.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Graham attacked another jogger, a 32-year-old woman identified as Jessica Lipps, in the neck. Near West 62nd Street in the park, Graham encountered Fayette. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;He slashes that man in the chest as the man is attempting to protect his son, and his son is slashed on the arm.&quot;</p>

<p>Fayette, who said he had been playing with his son, said, &quot;I assumed he&apos;d be frantic and run away. In the movies, people always run away after they do something like that. But he wasn&apos;t frantic. He was just walking around looking for people... There was no getting away. It wasn&apos;t frantic or quick movements. He just kind of stalked.&quot; He added, &quot;Julius had a bad look in his eye. He just wanted to do something bad. He wanted to hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>Thomas Ciriacks, 49, who was in the park, managed to subdue Graham as others, including a sanitation worker, ran to the aid of the injured. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152654/http://nypost.com/2013/10/01/2-stabbed-others-injured-at-riverside-park/">According to the Post</a>, he and Fayette &quot;ran to the aid of a screaming woman being attacked by the deranged man.&quot; Ciriacks said Fayette &quot;had his kid covered up, and the man was on top of him. He was huddled over his child, protecting his child... That guy is a hero... He came to this woman&#x2019;s aid, and he had a child to protect. He&#x2019;s absolutely a hero.&quot; </p>

<p>Ciriacks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152654/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131001/upper-west-side/man-stabbed-near-riverside-park-south-fdny-says">described Graham</a>, &quot;He was lurching about like a zombie. His eyes were crazy.&quot; Loehnen&apos;s husband Peter Wertheim told the Times, &quot;He told me that he was walking and this man basically ran at him. Ben thought that he had been punched in the stomach. He didn&#x2019;t realize that he had been stabbed until he looked down and saw a hole in his Patagonia vest.&quot; Loehnen underwent surgery, but even still, had a little sympathy; Wertheim relayed, &quot;He almost feels bad for the person who did this. He&#x2019;s obviously not a well person.&quot;</p>

<p>Graham is being held for psychiatric evaluation. He may be in court today. A law enforcement source told the Post, &quot;The guy is a f-king nut. He just took a pair of scissors and started stabbing everyone randomly, including a 2- to 3-year-old child. He was running down the [bike] path, going from person to person, stabbing them with a scissors.&quot;</p>

<p>Mental Illness Policy Organization&apos;s executive director D. J. Jaffe explained to the Times that people are only admitted to public psychiatric hospital with a court order, &quot;New York went from 600 beds per 100,000 population in the mid-1950s to fewer than 27 today. As a result, Rikers Island is New York&#x2019;s largest psychiatric institution.&#x201D; Rikers Island is a city jail.&quot;</p>
