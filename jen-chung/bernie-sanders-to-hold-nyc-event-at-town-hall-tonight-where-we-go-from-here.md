<p>Son of Brooklyn and Democratic presidential hopeful (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125215/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/hillary_clinton_victory_brooklyn.php">make that extremely hopeful</a>) Bernie Sanders is back in New York City today. He&apos;ll be giving a speech at Town Hall&#x2014;which is open to the public (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125215/http://sendy.berniesanders.com/l/kogaJU763Y260ESEG7r5Ug763A/mGlv892DvUt15Quqq4v0OejA/XANcGFceNVgY7fIk20CntA">RSVPs here</a>)&#x2014;tonight and the subject is, &quot;Where We Go From Here.&quot;</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125215/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/hillary_clinton_victory_brooklyn.php"> claimed victory as the Democrat to beat</a>, after securing Super Tuesday wins in California, New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico. Yesterday, Sanders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125215/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html?_r=0">admitted in an interview with CSPAN</a>, &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t appear that I&#x2019;m going to be the nominee, so I&#x2019;m not going to be determining the scope of the convention... What our job is now is to have her listen to what millions of people in this country who supported me want to see happen. We&#x2019;ll see how that evolves.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125215/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html?_r=0">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>Mr. Sanders did not acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton was going to leave the convention as the nominee, or that she would become the first woman presidential nominee of a major party. He did say she was &#x201C;very, very intelligent&#x201D; and has faced challenges, but he focused mainly on their policy differences.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;She has clearly had to fight her way through a lot of sexism and unfair attacks over the years,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But there are areas where we have strong disagreements. She is more or less an establishment Democrat. It&#x2019;s kind of hard to deny that. And I think we&#x2019;ve got to move beyond that.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>
