<p>Yesterday was Christmas Eve, which meant the NYPD was on patrol looking for drivers who were naughty&#x2014;and nice, it seems! Officers from the 47th Precinct in the Bronx stopped a number of vehicles that were obeying traffic rules in order to give the children in the cars Christmas gifts. Yes, sirens and lights were used and the drivers seemed <em>extremely</em> confused:</p>

I know my paperwork is good for the car. I was like, &#x2018;What&apos;s going on?&#x2019; But I really appreciate you guys coming out to the community and showing your support.&quot;</p>

<p>So many toys were donated to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035925/http://nypdnews.com/2015/12/thousands-of-kids-in-the-bronx-get-gifts-from-nypd/">47th&apos;s toy drive</a> that the precinct decided to share the items with residents in the neighborhood. Captain John Orellana said, &quot;This is a neighborhood that unfortunately, they&apos;re not fortunate enough, some kids in the neighborhood, so it&apos;s a good thing we wanted to do.&quot; </p>

<p>The NYPD is using the hashtag #ItsWhatWeDo when posting about it; it&apos;s unclear if this will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035925/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/22/mynypd_hashtag_lol.php">become a #myNYPD debacle</a>.</p>
