The locations include, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811095312/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,442621,00.html">per the AP</a>, &quot;in or near Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Denver, Newark, N.J., New York City, Oklahoma City and Washington.&quot;  The letters, which started to arrive on Monday, are being tested (so far, field tests have found the powder to be harmless). One letter implied the letter&apos;s opener would die, but no Chase employees have been injured.  An FBI spokesperson said, &quot;Even sending a hoax letter is a serious crime.&quot;</p>
