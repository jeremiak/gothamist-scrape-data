<blockquote>The 26-year-old woman met Sean Ahearn...on an unspecified dating site, and they made plans to meet at the Ritz in Battery Park around 8 p.m. on April 7, sources said. Ahearn paid for the pricey room with a credit card and escorted his date upstairs, sources said. Once inside the room, Ahearn allegedly slipped liquid ecstasy into her drink, causing her to black out, police sources said.&quot; Further, the sources think he may have used another drug to knock her out.</blockquote>

<p>Police sources tell the tabloid that Ahearn &quot;had sex with the unconscious victim and then left.&quot; When the woman woke up, she felt &quot;like sh-t.&quot; While at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, a rape kit and toxicology test were administered and she filed a police report. Later, police had the victim call Ahearn, and he allegedly admitted to drugging her.</p>

<p>Ahearn is charged with third-degree rape and facilitating a sex offense with a controlled substance. </p>
