<p>Earlier this week, the NYPD asked for the public&apos;s help in identifying a suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013105/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/29/nypd_this_thief_stole_macbooks_ipho.php">who allegedly stole numerous Apple products</a> from Kickstarter&apos;s Brooklyn office. Now it turns out the suspect decided to turn himself in.</p>

<p>According to the police, the burglary took place on Wednesday, September 24, at 8:20 p.m.: &quot;The suspect entered 58 Kent Street, the Kickstarter Company, by grabbing the door and not letting close after a food delivery.&quot; This is also known <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013105/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggybacking_(security)">as tailgating</a>. The NYPD added, &quot;The suspect waited for the employees to leave the front door area and proceeded to enter the location. Once inside, the suspect removed 2 Macbook Pros, a Macbook Air and an Apple iPhone 5S. The suspect then fled the location.&quot;</p>

<p>Last night, the police said, &quot;After seeing himself on television the suspect, a juvenile when he committed the crime, turned himself into the 94 Precinct Detective Squad with the property he removed from the location. He was charged as a juvenile and released to his parents with a family court date later in the month.&quot;</p>

<p>The teen was charged with criminal possession of stolen property and criminal trespass.</p>
