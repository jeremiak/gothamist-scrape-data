<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141018005403/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04092009/news/regionalnews/groper_nailed_163628.htm">Post reports</a> that Kevin Johnson, 30, was &quot;selling swipes on a MetroCard at the Bay Parkway station of the N line in Brooklyn when he got into an argument with a woman he eyed as a customer.&quot; The argument escalated to the point of him yelling &quot;profanities as he chased her out of the station.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141018005403/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/04/08/2009-04-08_subway_suspect_snapped_in_cell_phone_photo_arrested.html">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The woman ran, and, believing Johnson was the man pictured in the news for sexual abuse, called 911. That&apos;s when NYPD Transit cops busted Johnson outside of the train station.&quot;  And not only that, Johnson was wearing the same clothes he was pictured in during the Monday W train incident.</p>

<p>Charges are pending against Johnson, who has over 30 previous arrests (including sexual abuse, robbery, assault and theft).  The woman who took the cellphone picture of Johnson, Simona Pirvutu, told the News, &quot;I&apos;m happy they caught him,&quot; and added, &quot;I think every woman should do the same thing, given the circumstances. It&apos;s a very difficult position to be in. There&apos;s no way to prepare yourself for it. But you have to be prepared.&quot;  As for the incident, she said, &quot;I felt threatened and violated for a few seconds. It wasn&apos;t very pleasant... I&apos;m proud of myself, but I was very scared.&quot; </p>

<p>NYPD spokesman Paul J. Browne told the Post, &quot;<strong>The woman who took this picture performed a fabulous public service. She provided a great public service when you see his record.</strong>&quot;</p>
