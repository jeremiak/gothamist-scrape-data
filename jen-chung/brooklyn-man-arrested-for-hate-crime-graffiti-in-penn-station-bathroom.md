<p>A 65-year-old Brooklyn resident was arrested for allegedly writing hateful messages at Penn Station, including &quot;Mexicans take jobs from Americans.&quot; In announcing the arrest, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, &quot;This arrest sends a clear message that all hate crimes will be thoroughly investigated, and we will prosecute those found responsible for perpetrating these reprehensible actions.</p>

<p>&quot;We have zero tolerance for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721153354/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/05/new_yorkers_join_forces_to_remove_s.php">these acts of bigotry</a>, which stand in direct contrast to the values that we New Yorkers represent,&quot; he continued, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721153354/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/20/cuomo_inspiring_speech_against_hate.php">reiterating his stance on welcoming immigrants</a>. &quot;I applaud the MTA Police Department for their vigilance and actions in this investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Cuomo&apos;s office, the MTA police had been investigating a &quot;pattern of hate-crime graffiti and vandalization of men&apos;s bathrooms at Pennsylvania Station&quot; and had stationed detectives there. They &quot;noticed graffiti in a bathroom stall that Vargas left. No graffiti was in the stall beforehand. Detectives stopped Vargas under suspicion of vandalization and searched his backpack, which contained a black Sharpie marker - the same type used to deface the stall.&quot;</p>

<p>The detectives arrested Vargas, 65, for what they believe are multiples instances of bias graffiti last month. </p><blockquote>During an interview with police following his arrest, Vargas admitted to writing the graffiti and said that he wrote it &#x201C;because Mexicans take jobs from Americans.&quot; Police suspect Vargas is also responsible for graffiti in Penn Station on multiple other occasions since February 18, including swastikas and other statements that read: &quot;KKK&quot; and &quot;Mexican Go Home,&quot; among others, which were written in black marker in two different locations.</blockquote>Vargas was charged with eight counts of criminal mischiefs as hate crimes, which are felonies. <p></p>

<p>&quot;The MTA Police and our law enforcement partners across the state - including the State Police - vigorously investigate all hate crimes in order to bring those responsible to justice,&quot; MTA Chief of Police Owen Monaghan said. &quot;No one should think they can get away with trying to intimidate the public in this way.&quot;</p>
