</div></div>					<p>Here are some of our readers lovely photographs of the new openly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425000124/http://www.thehighline.org/">High Line park</a> in the Meatpacking District.  And it looks like the public aren&apos;t the only ones enjoying it&#x2014;here are a handful of reviews that note the gorgeous views from 30 feet above ground, the lovely plantings, and the vision and determination of the designers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425000124/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06092009/news/columnists/high_line_an_oasis_in_the_sky_173295.htm">Post&apos;s Steve Cuozzo</a> is wowed: &quot;<strong>If you&apos;re tired of High Line hype, you&apos;re in for a surprise. It&apos;s beautiful, witty, recreationally compelling and emotionally captivating from end to end. What an astonishing variety of effects the designers and landscapers managed to pull off in such narrow confines!  </strong> The railroad theme announces itself at the outset when you enter at Gansevoort Street: strips of actual preserved tracks and ties, overgrown with a profusion of pretty flowers representing the wild species said to have sprouted after the trains stopped running. It seems contrived only at first. As the track segments end, reappear, fade and return again as you proceed northward, they grow more persuasive and haunting. This was a railroad, and the engineers must have loved the ride. The High Line affords perspectives you can&apos;t get from the street or from inside a building.&quot;</p>
