title: McCain Reveals Elitists are in NYC, DC
---

	
										<p>During the second part of his interview with the Republican ticket, NBC News anchor Brian Williams asked Sarah Palin to explain, &quot;Who is a member of the elite?&quot;  Palin characterized them as, &quot;Anyone who thinks that they&apos;re better than someone else.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234235/http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/elitists_everyw.html">Full transcript here</a>) But then McCain chimed in, laughing, that he knew &quot;where a lot of &apos;em live... in our nation&apos;s capital and New York City.&quot;  The exchange starts at about four minutes in, after talk about Williams Ayers, the washed up terrorist McCain supposedly doesn&apos;t care about.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234235/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/10/23/2008-10-23_john_mccain_calls_new_yorkers_elitists_d.html">Daily News got clarification</a> from Rep. Peter King (R-Long Island), who said McCain wasn&apos;t talking about &quot;real New Yorkers...  He&apos;s talking about Park Ave. and the upper West Side, which is inhabited by the liberal socialites and the media types who, yeah, are certainly elitists,&quot; plus a barbed response from Senator Charles Schumer, &quot;Men in Gucci shoes who have seven glass houses should not cast stones.&quot;</p>

<p>The New Yorker has an interesting article about how Palin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234235/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer">made overtures to the media elite</a> after becoming governor.   Of course, that was the conservative media elite, so that&apos;s different, right?</p>
