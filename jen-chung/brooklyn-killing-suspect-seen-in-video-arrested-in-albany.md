Two weeks ago, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110505162309/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/intense_video_shows_murder_suspect.php">released an intense surveillance video</a> showing a man following Andre Pitts, 18, out of an elevator and then firing at him.  Then, another camera showed the suspect calmly walking outside the building located on Lott Avenue.  </p>
