<p>Last year, we sang the praises of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224205/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/21/the_best_vegan_dishes_in_nyc.php">delicious <em>vegan</em> soy bacon cheeseburger</a> at Cafe Blossom, which has three locations. But that burger was only available for lunch or dinner at the Upper West Side location, at 466 Columbus Avenue (it&apos;s a lunch-only option at the West Village and Chelsea locations). Now the UWS outpost is closing in eight days. And it&apos;s apparently because of a rent hike!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224205/http://www.westsiderag.com/2014/04/29/vegan-restaurant-cafe-blossom-to-close-on-mothers-day">West Side Rag reported last week</a>, &quot;The restaurant on 82nd and Columbus, faced a massive rent increase, according to a tipster: &apos;Their rent was more than doubled.&apos;&quot; On Friday, this message was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224205/https://www.facebook.com/cafeblossomnyc/posts/10152116283361032?stream_ref=10">posted on its Facebook page:</a></p>

<blockquote>To Our Loyal Guests and the Upper West Side Community,

<p>After 7 wonderful years, we are disappointed to announce that Cafe Blossom will be closing its doors on Monday, May 12th, 2014, due to building management issues beyond our control.</p>

<p>When we opened in 2007, we had one simple mission which was to bring delicious, healthful, organic and vegan fare to the neighborhood. We were lucky to have been so warmly welcomed into the Upper West Side community, and are grateful to you: our loyal following of compassionate and health-conscious guests, including many who became cherished regulars.</p>

<p>We sincerely thank you for your business and hope that you will continue to enjoy Blossom by visiting our other locations which include Blossom Restaurant in Chelsea, and Blossom on Carmine in the West Village, as well as V-Note on the Upper East Side. Our other locations look forward to welcoming you with the same commitment to quality organic and vegan cuisine. All have slightly varied menus and ambiences, so we invite you to check them out.</p>

<p>Please note we will honor gift cards purchased at Cafe Blossom at either of our other Blossom locations and feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns to us at blossomuptownnyc@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Lastly, we are exploring vacancies in the neighborhood and will be sure to send an update if we find the right location to reopen.</p>

<p>It has truly been a pleasure serving you from our Upper West Side location. Come visit us before May 12th!</p>

<p>With gratitude,</p>

<p>Cafe Blossom Management, Staff, and Owners</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Our fingers are crossed they can find another location on the UWS, which doesn&apos;t have the density of delicious restaurants that other neighborhoods seem to have. Unfortunately, many building managers and landlords <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224205/http://nypost.com/2014/04/26/the-hidden-proof-the-economy-is-still-awful/">would rather have empty storefronts</a> instead of keeping businesses that have become community fixtures. </p>
