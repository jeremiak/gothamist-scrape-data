<p>A man who bought a Queens self-storage unit at auction found a grisly surprise waiting behind the roll-up door: dozens of dead cats in a freezer. It&apos;s believed there were approximately 40 cats in storage there, though it was difficult to count because some of the cats had been frozen together.</p>

<p>The new owner had purchased the unit from American Self Storage in Long Island City at auction. The previous owner, a 66-year-old woman, hadn&apos;t paid rent since July. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194656/http://abc7ny.com/pets/40-frozen-dead-cats-found-inside-storage-unit-in-long-island-city/1560085/">According to WABC 7</a>, when the new owner went to inspect the space, he found the cats &quot;inside two four by three feet freezers. Police said the animals were stacked on top of each other and frozen together. They couldn&apos;t even count exactly how many there were... [O]ne skinned cat [was] in an aluminum tray.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When officers opened it, [it was] a horrendous death smell, horrid,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194656/http://nypost.com/2016/10/18/40-dead-cats-found-in-freezer-after-storage-unit-auction/">a source said to the Post</a>. &quot;They had to go back to the command to change.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The ASPCA is investigating and necropsies will be performed on the cats. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194656/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/17/frozen-cats-freezers/">police are now looking</a> for the previous owner. </p>
