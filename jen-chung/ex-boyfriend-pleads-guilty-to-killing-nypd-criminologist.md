<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_05_mcle.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024452im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_05_mcle.jpg" width="250" height="169" class="image-left"> </span>Queens DA Richard Brown announced that the ex-boyfriend of a NYPD criminologist who was found dead in her Sunnyside apartment last year pleaded guilty to her murder.  Gary McGurk, 24,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024452/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ex_lover_pleads_guilty_in_slaying_C75jyis7izwJd3Xg5880lL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME="> told a judge yesterday,</a> &quot;I struck the victim Michelle Lee in the head with a hammer&quot; four times, and, when asked what his relationship was with her, he answered, &quot;Long-time friends, you honor.&quot;</p>

<p>Lee&apos;s bloodied and beaten body was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024452/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/28/stab_city.php">found by her roommate</a>.  Lee, who had graduated from John Jay College in 2008, was working at a NYPD crime lab in Queens, and police said she was burned on the belly with an iron, tied to a bed with a cell phone charger cord, and stabbed in the neck, besides being struck in the head  It turned out that McGurk, who met Lee at John Jay and had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024452/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/22/ex-boyfriend_indicted_in_murder_of.php">lied to her about having cancer</a> so she&apos;d give him money, had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024452/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/23/suspect_allegedly_covered_up_nypd_c.php">covered up Lee&apos;s death</a> by, in the words of a police source, creating &quot;a psychopathic crime scene to throw [cops] off his trail. He was pulling pieces from all sorts of different crimes into one scene.&quot;  </p>

<p>In court, McGurk said that he first wrapped Lee&apos;s head with Saran wrap before striking her with a hammer, so there would be no blood when he repositioned her body.    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024452/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/05/21/2010-05-21_guilty_plea_in_horror_slay_of_nypd_criminologist.html">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;A woman seated behind McGurk sobbed while Lee&apos;s family members sat grim-faced during the proceedings.&quot;  McGurk faces 29 to 37 years in prison when he is sentenced.   Brown noted that the plea will spare Lee&apos;s family from the emotional trauma of having to listen to testimony at trial about the gruesome circumstances surrounding Ms. Lee&#x2019;s death&quot; and added, &quot;I think that Michelle would have been especially proud of her colleagues at the NYPD&#x2019;s Queens crime lab who worked tirelessly to make certain that her killer was apprehended and that justice would be served.&quot;</p>
