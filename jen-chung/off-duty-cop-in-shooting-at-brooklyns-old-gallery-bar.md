										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:223px; "> <img alt="2011_06_oldgall.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617110059im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_oldgall.jpg" width="223" height="264"> <br> <i>Via Trulia</i></div> Early this morning, a brawl led to gunfire at Kensington bar Old Gallery on McDonald Avenue&#x2014;and apparently an off-duty cop was one of the people who fired.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617110059/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/off_duty_cop_shoots_armed_man_in_MV6NyucSsTWWfE5gixH7MK">A witness told NY1</a>, &quot;I heard like three bullets. And in my mind I was like, that&apos;s firecrackers. Then I thought, no it&apos;s gunshots. Then I looked out the window, and I just see a bunch of people running from the bar, and I heard like maybe six more shots and there&apos;s a police car outside.&quot; One of the bar patrons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617110059/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/07/07/2011-07-07_man_shot_by_offduty_cop_during_brawl_at_brooklyns_old_gallery_bar.html">summed it up neatly to the Daily News</a>: &quot;People got drunk and they start fighting. It goes outside and then [the shooting] happened so fast.&quot;<p></p>

<p>While it&apos;s unclear whether the off-duty cop was inside the bar when the fighting broke out at 4 a.m., reports say he fired after a man pulled a gun on him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617110059/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/off_duty_cop_shoots_armed_man_in_MV6NyucSsTWWfE5gixH7MK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">wounding the man in the leg and back</a>.  A friend told the News that the injured man&apos;s street name was &quot;Corrupt.&quot; The News also spoke to a cabdriver named Al Bundy who said the cops arrived quickly as well a neighbor who really hates Old Gallery, &quot;Every morning, when I get up for work there&apos;s brawls going on. They&apos;re all spewing from that bar. That&apos;s a horrible bar.&quot;<br>
