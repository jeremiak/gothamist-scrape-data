Twelve-year-old Nicole Suriel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112233/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-girl-drowns-at-long-beach,0,7859935.story">disappeared while swimming</a> and was found nearly an hour and a half after other students and adults realized she was missing. WPIX reports, &quot;At some point got swept by a current, ending up in an area far from view&quot;; Nicole was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p>

<p>There were no lifeguards on duty at Long Beach (they are on duty during the weekend) and city manager Charles Theofan said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112233/http://www.1010wins.com/12-Year-Old-Drowns-During-School-Trip-to-Long-Beac/7524933">there are warnings on signs</a> posted by the beach. (Lifeguards were on the beach, because they were training in preparation for their weekend duties and working week day, starting next week; they and police officers help with the search.) Now the question is why the adults&#x2014;two licensed teachers and an intern&#x2014;allowed the children into the water.</p>

<p>Theofan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112233/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/harlem-schoolgirl-on-field-trip-drowns-off-long-beach-1.2044572">told Newsday</a>, &quot;I can tell you her teacher made a valiant attempt to save her; the teacher went in the water looking for her, got pretty banged up against the jetty and had to be rescued.&quot; The students were part of a June term class studying water; Theofan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112233/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/coast_guard_searches_for_missing_x5XJPBRmq6auk6KhpiRNQK">told the Post</a>, &quot;One of the detectives told me that the teacher told the kids not to swim. But how do you control 12-year-olds?&quot; One parent, David Suker, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112233/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/missing.swimmer.field.2.1767342.html">raged to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;He sent a lone teacher out there with two interns, a first-year teacher to supervise I don&apos;t know how many kids. He is responsible, the principal, Jose Maldonado.&quot;  </p>

<p>Two other students were rescued from the water.  The field trip&apos;s bus driver was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112233/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/coast_guard_searches_for_missing_x5XJPBRmq6auk6KhpiRNQK">summoned back to the beach</a> to take the children back to their school in Morningside Heights, where police officers and DOE officials met them.  Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112233/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/girl-12-drowns-on-class-trip/">Mayor Bloomberg said</a>, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not go and rush and assign blame. I think at this point what we have to focus on is maybe grieving and having a prayer for the child and see if we can help the parents through what is obviously the most difficult situation any parent could possibly experience. We&#x2019;ll focus on that right now.&quot;  And Schools Chancellor Joel Klein said, &quot;Obviously, we are working diligently to determine exactly what happened and to provide immediate support to the students and staff of the school.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, concerned parent Suker said, &quot;Dr. Maldonado has a history of not having proper regulations. I&apos;ve continually spoken out against this&#x2026;He&apos;s the building leader, and he&apos;s openly responsible. If its not his fault, it&apos;s Chancellor Klein&apos;s fault, and if it&apos;s not Klein&apos;s fault, it&apos;s Bloomberg&apos;s fault.&quot;</p>
