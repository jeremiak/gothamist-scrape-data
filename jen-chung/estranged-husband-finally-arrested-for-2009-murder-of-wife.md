<p>Nearly six years after Shele Danishefsky Covlin&apos;s body was found by her nine-year-old daughter, police have arrested the man who was a longtime person of interest: Danishefsky Covlin&apos;s estranged husband, Roderick Covlin. Today, Manhattan DA Cy Vance announced that Covlin was indicted for two counts of murder in the second degree.</p>

<p>On December 31, 2009, Shele Danishefsky Covlin and Roderick Covlin&apos;s young daughter found Shele Covlin&apos;s body submerged in a bathtub of her Upper West Side apartment at 155 West 68th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/girl-finds-mom-dead-upper-west-side-bathtub-banged-head-fall-article-1.461591">Initially it was thought to be an accident</a>&#x2014;&quot;detectives suspect[ed] the victim grabbed a handle to lift herself out of the tub, and the handle gave way&quot;&#x2014;but Danishefsky Covlin&apos;s family believed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/10/accidental_new_years_death_may_have.php">she was killed by her husband</a>, who lived across the hallway.<br>

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2015_10_scovlin.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_scovlin.jpg" width="319" height="381" class="image-right"> </span>Apparently, the day before her murder, Danishefsky Covlin, a wealth manager, was allegedly supposed to meet with a lawyer to remove her estranged husband from her will. (Her estate was worth a reported $4 million.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/husband-wealthy-nyc-woman-found-dead-tub-charged-article-1.2420389">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Danishefsky and Covlin were in the midst of a bitter divorce to end their nearly 12-year union, a legal move sparked by his desire for an open marriage. She had already obtained a &apos;get&apos; &#x2014; a Jewish religion divorce &#x2014; from Covlin. At the time, Danishefsky was living in the family&#x2019;s W. 68th St. apartment with the kids. Covlin was living across the hall and his wife was paying his bills.&quot;</p>

<p>Five years ago, a source told the Post that Covlin&apos;s behavior was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/murder_suspect_was_suspiciously_nic.php">suspicious because he was very friendly</a> on the day of Danishefsky Covlin&apos;s death: &quot;He stopped and talked to the doorman and offered him coffee. And the doorman said he never did that before.&quot; And another witness claimed, &quot;He was roaming the lobby at 4 in the morning, he hadn&#x2019;t changed his clothes in days, and he looked whacked.&quot;</p>

<p>No autopsy had been conducted after her death, because the gash on the back of her head was &quot;consistent with a fall,&quot; and because Danishefsky Covlin and her family are Orthodox Jews. However, the DA&apos;s office ordered an exhumation in 2010 (the family got a rabbinical exemption) and the medical examiner ruled that she died of strangulation.</p>

<p>Her divorce lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://nypost.com/2015/11/02/estranged-husband-arrested-6-years-after-wifes-killing/">Dominic Barbara said</a>, &quot;The moment I was told she died, I said, &#x2018;He killed her.&apos; [The family] didn&#x2019;t want to do an autopsy, but I kept insisting. He was violent. I got him thrown out of the apartment based on his violence.&quot;</p>

<p>In the meantime, Covlin&apos;s parents won custody of the children and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/parents-man-suspected-killing-wife-court-365-000-savings-account-article-1.1610085">battled over funds from Danishefsky&apos;s estate</a>.</p>

<p>Covlin, a former trader turned founder of the U.S. Backgammon Federation, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://nypost.com/2015/11/02/estranged-husband-arrested-6-years-after-wifes-killing/">arrested at the Scarsdale Metro-North station yesterday</a>. A source told the Post, &quot;The DA&#x2019;s office is very conservative in prosecuting homicide cases that they have even the slightest doubt about will get a conviction. So the case proceeded very slowly...This one would be a great &#x2018;Law and Order&#x2019; episode.&quot; </p>

<p>In court today, Covlin, 42, pleaded not guilty. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325065551/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/husband-wealthy-nyc-woman-found-dead-tub-charged-article-1.2420389">His lawyer said</a>, &quot;He is stunned by what has happened. We don&#x2019;t believe there is any credible evidence to these charges. He&#x2019;s very concerned about the children.&quot;</p>

<p>However, his mother-in-law Elaine Danishefsky told the News, &quot;It&#x2019;s about time. &#x201C;I just hope he gets what he deserves.&quot;</p>

<p>Covlin is being held without bail. His next court date is November 9. </p>
