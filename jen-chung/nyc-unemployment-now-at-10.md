										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065101/http://gothamist.com/attachments/NYC_Billy/2009_01_unemployment.jpg"> <img alt="2009_01_unemployment.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065101im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2009/01/2009_01_unemployment-thumb-120x115-54987.jpg" width="135" height="129" class="image-left"> </a> </span>Yesterday, the NY State Department of Labor released unemployment data for March, and the city&apos;s unemployment fell another 0.2% to 10% for last month.  (The rate had started at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065101/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/nyc_unemployment_rate_declined_last.php">10.4% in January</a>.)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065101/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/nyregion/16unemploy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Hiring was especially strong in professional and business services, like advertising and management of computer systems, a large part of the city&#x2019;s economy that usually expands early in a recovery,&quot; but, &quot;<strong>One continuing cause for worry is the persistent loss of jobs in the city&#x2019;s most lucrative fields, investment banking and securities trading.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Why is that a worry?  Because a finance job pay many times more than an average job (think tax revenue).  One economist also says that construction jobs grew last month, &quot;&#x201C;I think the warm weather in March induced some of the hiring, which may or may not be permanent.&quot;  </p>

<p>The state unemployment rate fell to 8.6% for March from 8.8% in February.  For a blast from the past, the unemployment rates in March 2009 were 8.5% (NYC) and 7.8% (NY State). </p>
