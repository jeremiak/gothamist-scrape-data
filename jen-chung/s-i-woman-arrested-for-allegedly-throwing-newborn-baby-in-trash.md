<p>A 28-year-old woman was arrested yesterday after the discovery of a newborn baby in a garbage bag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234712/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Newborn-Baby-Found-Dead-on-Staten-Island-NYPD-371883832.html">outside her house.</a> Police have charged Nausheen Rahman with concealment of a human corpse. </p>

<p>Rahman apparently went to Staten Island University Hospital&apos;s ER on Saturday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234712/http://nypost.com/2016/03/12/woman-admits-to-throwing-away-newborn-baby/">complaining of bleeding</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234712/http://www.silive.com/westshore/index.ssf/2016/03/infant_found_dead_in_trash_bag.html#incart_2box_silive-homepage-featured">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;Hospital officials realized they had no record of the woman having a baby at the facility, and notified police when she said she had the child at home and discarded it, the source said. At first she said she had the child five days earlier, but later said she delivered on Thursday, according to the source.&quot; </p>

<p>The baby was found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234712/http://abc7ny.com/news/woman-arrested-after-baby-found-dead-inside-trash-bag-on-staten-island-/1243783/">unconscious and unresponsive</a> in a trash receptacle outside an apartment building on Richmond Hill Road.</p>

<p>The investigation is continuing and an autopsy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619234712/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-puts-dead-newborn-baby-garbage-bag-throws-trash-article-1.2562481">will be performed</a>. A resident of the condominium complex told the Advance, &quot;This is disgusting. I really felt like crying when I heard this today.&quot;</p>
