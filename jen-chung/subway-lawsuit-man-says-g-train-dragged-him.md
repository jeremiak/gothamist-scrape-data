Jonathan Lynn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120102221545/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/30/2011-05-30_straphanger_jonathan_lynn_sues_mta_over_incident_where_his_arm_got_trapped_in_su.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I didn&apos;t think it was real. \[I thought\] the door&apos;s going to open, he&apos;s going to stop, he&apos;s going to hear me. I bounced off one of the pillars, hit my head and that&apos;s the extent of my memory.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to his lawsuit, Lynn, a 32-year-old web developer, ran to catch the train and the train&apos;s operator waved him on. Lynn was closest to the end of the train, and because the last set of doors was closed, he jogged to the next set, which closed on him; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120102221545/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/close_call_on_subway_NulaP5dzNmbq5VZWJiMa0M">the Post reports</a>, &quot;the closing doors trapped his shoulder while the rest of his body was still on the platform... The train began to move, pulling him relentlessly toward the tunnel.&quot; His arm and messenger bag were stuck in the door, and he pounded on the doors and tried to free himself. Lynn said, &quot;It was the wall approaching that gave me the final push to do anything I could to get out.&quot;</p>

<p>Lynn&apos;s lawyer said, &quot;My client basically had to save his own life, and to do that he had to break his own arm.&quot; He was left with a compound fracture, &quot;a gaping wound to his left arm as well as a head injury.&quot;  As for Lynn&apos;s current subway habits, &quot;I wait until it&apos;s wide open and dive in.&quot;</p>
