<p>The Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art just announced the lineup for its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152420/http://newdirectors.org/full-lineup-of-41st-ndnf-announced/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=film_ndnf_title_announcement">41st  New Directors/New Films Festival</a>, and 41 films will be screened between March 21 and April 1: 29 feature films (24 narrative, 5 documentary) and 12 short films representing 28 countries.  </p>

<p>ND/NF has given viewers a chance to catch directors like Christopher Nolan, Pedro Almodovar, Wong Kar Wai, Kelly Reichardt, Spike Lee, Steven Spielberg and Atom Egoyan early in their career, so it&apos;s a must for cinephiles.  Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The opening night feature is Nadine Labaki&#x2019;s <em>Where Do We Go Now</em>, which &quot;follows the events that transpire after women of different religions in a remote Lebanese village band together and invent schemes to prevent their men from killing each other in the intractable religious conflict that surrounds their community.&quot;</li>
	<li>For the first time, a 3-D film will be screened&#x2014;it&apos;s Antoine Delesvaux and Joann Sfar&apos;s animated version of Sfar&apos;s graphic novel, <em>The Rabbi&apos;s Cat</em>: &quot;Set in 1920&#x2019;s Algiers, a widower rabbi lives with his voluptuous and dutiful daughter and their pesky cat who swallows a parakeet and begins to speak, driving everyone crazy and moving the plot ahead by insisting on having a bar-mitzvah.&quot; </li>
	<li>Stanley Kubrick&apos;s <em>Fear and Desire</em> will be shown. Kubrick directed the film at 24, and some consider the &quot;original to the second half of <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>.&quot;</li>
	<li>Debut director Adam Leon&apos;s <em>Gimme The Loot</em> is &quot;an homage to street-smart kids and New York City. Malcolm and Sofia, two determined teens from the Bronx, are the ultimate graffiti writers. When their latest masterpiece is wiped out by a rival gang, they must hustle, steal and scheme to get spectacular revenge and become the biggest graffiti writers in the city.&quot; Below is the trailer.</li>
</ul>The closing night selection is a surprise and will be announced on April 1. Tickets go on sale on March 11; advance tickets are available on March 4 for MoMA and Film Society members.
