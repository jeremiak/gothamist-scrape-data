Even though you were very bad not to tell me how young you are haha but I don&#x2019;t mind.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Tivy, who operated Cafe Du Soleil in Morningside Heights, was arrested on Thursday, after an FBI investigation revealed details about the victim. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325055827/http://abc7ny.com/news/celebrity-chef-accused-of-taking-part-in-distributing-child-porn/1023167/">From WABC 7</a>:</p><blockquote>[P]olice uncovered new information in a search of Tivy&apos;s cellphone following his initial arrest on May 6. In the most recent arrest Tivy allegedly met up last December with a 14- or 15-year-old boy he met on Grindr, a dating/hookup app for gay men. They met at the top level of the a parking garage and engaged in sexual activity. The boy was a junior at a high school in the Bronx at the time. They recorded their encounter and Tivy later asked the boy to send him numerous video clips.<p></p>

<p>Police said Tivy texted the teen afterward. Here&apos;s that conversation detectives pulled from his phone:</p>

<p>Tivy: &quot;Even though you were very bad not to tell how young you are haha but I didn&apos;t mind.&quot;<br>
Teen: &quot;Oh, I thought I told you.&quot;<br>
Tivy: &quot;I&apos;ve been with a high school guy before so it&apos;s cool.&quot;</p>

<p>Prosecutors said Tivy then sent the video and a photo and video clips to a user on the messaging app KIK.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325055827/http://nypost.com/2015/10/08/celebrity-chef-arrested-after-picking-up-underage-teen-for-sex-docs/">Tivy allegedly said via Kik</a>, &quot;I have one kid that I f&#x2014;ed in my car. He&#x2019;s a high school sophomore.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Authorities believe Tivy was involved with more minors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325055827/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/chef-matthew-tivy-no-stranger-underage-boys-source-article-1.2391370">A source told the Daily News</a> there were young boys, around 16-17 years old, &quot;spotted at Matthew Tivy&#x2019;s apartment a couple times.&quot; </p>

<p>After his May arrest, Tivy also allegedly started an account on Chaturbate (username: &apos;iluvundies&apos;) and discussed having sex with minors. </p>

<p>A judge order Tivy held without bail because he may be a &quot;danger to the community.&quot; Tivy&apos;s attorney Glen Hardy said Tivy was innocent, but when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325055827/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-York-City-Celebrity-Chef-Arrested-Sex-Minor-Child-Pornography-331495012.html">asked to address the photos and sexts, Hardy said</a>, &quot;That&apos;s something we have to investigate. He has no obligation to explain to me or the government what they&apos;re about, but that&apos;s something Matthew and I are going to work on.&quot; </p>
