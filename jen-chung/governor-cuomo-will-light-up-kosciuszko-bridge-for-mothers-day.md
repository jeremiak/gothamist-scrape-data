<p>If you don&apos;t have a card or gift or overpriced brunch meal planned for Mother&apos;s Day, don&apos;t worry&#x2014;Governor Andrew Cuomo has got your back. His office just announced &quot;a multi-colored LED light show will take place on the new Kosciuszko Bridge to celebrate Mother&apos;s Day. Beginning at dusk on Sunday, May 14 and continuing through Monday morning, the Kosciuszko Bridge will be lit up in honor of New York&apos;s beloved moms.&quot;</p>

<p>Cuomo celebrated the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516203751/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/28/kosciuszko_bridge_lights.php">new Koscuiszko Bridge with a light show</a>&#x2014;that also included NYC soundtrack&#x2014; last month, and illuminating bridges all around New York City and New York State is part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516203751/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/ny_bridges_tolls_light_art.php#photo-1">his plan to promote tourism</a>. (These kind of lighting displays are called &quot;emotive lighting&quot; and cities around the U.S. and world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516203751/https://www.citylab.com/design/2016/11/soon-enough-every-bridge-everywhere-will-have-fancy-lighting/506885/">are glitzing up their civic infrastructure</a>.)</p>

<p>&quot;While no substitute for flowers, this celebration is one small way to thank hard-working moms across New York for everything they do,&quot; Cuomo said in a statement. &quot;On behalf of all New Yorkers, I wish every mother across the state a happy Mother&apos;s Day and invite them to enjoy this beautiful light show.&quot;</p>

<p>The lighting show will feature what the governor&apos;s office calls a &quot;splash of springtime color&quot; (&quot;soft pink, yellow and orange&quot;) starting at dusk on Sunday night and the colors &quot;will strum across the bridge cables to celebrate Moms across New York.&quot; But will all the pretty colors in the world distract moms from their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516203751/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/11/subway_funding_protest.php">terrible future commutes</a>?</p>

<p>If you have a more understanding relationship, maybe make a rain check and celebrate Mother&apos;s Day at the Kosciuszko Bridge when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516203751/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/22/bridge_bye.php">blow up the old structure later this summer</a>.</p>
