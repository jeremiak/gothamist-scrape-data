According to the DOT, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913170227/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/potholephotos.shtml">this is a &quot;cave-in.&quot;</a> Photograph by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913170227/http://www.flickr.com/photos/paypaul/2654832770/">PayPaul on Flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Sure, New York City has a pothole tumblr&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913170227/http://thedailypothole.tumblr.com/">The Daily Pothole</a>&#x2014;that brags about &quot;6,290,591 square yards resurfaced in 2011&quot; but for some residents, the potholes that are ruining their drives and vehicles aren&apos;t going to be fixed in a timely manner because the Department of Transportation considers them &quot;street defects.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913170227/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/this_is_not_uLJUo4iKd1WqfPZvUA2tyN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a> that former Taxi and Limousine Commissioner Fidel Del Valle contacted 311 to report potholes in Marine Park, only to be told they were &quot;sinkholes&quot; and therefore they were the responsibility of the Department of Environmental Protection.  </p>

<p>According to the Post, &quot;City inspectors came up with this important distinction during a painstaking, taxpayer-funded inspection of the two holes, which are about 40 feet apart on Flatlands Avenue near East 38th Street in Marine Park, according to the agency&#x2019;s bizarre e-mail response.&quot; The DOT told him to check the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913170227/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/potholephotos.shtml">DOT website to see what kind of defect it was</a> and then re-report the issue.  Ah, gotta love bureaucracy! But we bet if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110913170227/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/pothole-that-nearly-claimed-al-damato-has-been-filled/">former Senator Al D&apos;Amato complained</a>, it would be fixed by now.</p>
