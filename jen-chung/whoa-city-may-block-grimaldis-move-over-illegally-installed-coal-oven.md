<p>The drama over beloved Brooklyn pizzeria Grimaldi&apos;s and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122025039/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/21/dumbo_grimaldis_closing_november_28.php">rent dispute-prompted move</a> around the corner continues:  Grimaldi&apos;s employees had been promising customers the same coal oven pizza at the new location, but now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122025039/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/pizza_oven_burn_11JMvan84RWqHWTKWf4P5K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports that the Department of Buildings</a> &quot;put the kibosh on plans by the world-famous pizzeria to move into larger space next door after learning that its operators quietly installed a coal-fired brick oven at the new site without approval.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122025039/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/25/pizza_shocker_grimaldis_is_being_re.php">pizza war is on</a>!</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the problems also involve notorious Brooklyn architect, Robert Scarano, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122025039/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/04/controversial_architect_robert_scar.php">banned from filing plans with the city</a> over a history of bad building behavior.  From the Post:</p><blockquote>Ciolli said he was &#x201C;unaware of Scarano&#x2019;s history&#x201D; when he hired an architect with Scarano&#x2019;s firm to apply for a city construction permit at the new storefront. The application &#x2014; approved in October &#x2014; called from installing a &#x201C;pizza oven,&#x201D; but never mentioned a coal-fired brick oven would be installed. The city rarely issues new permits for coal-fired brick ovens because of environmental concerns. Existing ones like the one now at Grimaldi&#x2019;s are grandfathered in &#x2014; making them virtual gold mines. They can be approved on a case-by-case basis but it is very rare. City officials said they have recommended Ciolli install a gas-powered oven that uses coal for flavor enhancement. However, pizza aficionados say the taste of pizzas made that way pales in comparison to those made with true coal-fired brick ovens.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122025039/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=2&amp;vlcompdetlkey=0001472324">According to the DOB,</a> there&apos;s a &quot;15-DAY LETTER OF INTENT TO REVOKE APPLICATION #320344043 ON 11/25/11. ISSUE DOB STOP ORDER AND NOTE THE PERCENTAGE OF WORK COMPLETED.&quot; Ciolli, though, is still trying to get a coal oven at the new site, which is critical since the man he bought Grimaldi&apos;s from, Patsy Grimaldi, is planning on taking over the old Grimaldi&apos;s location and will reopen the space as &quot;Juliana&apos;s&quot;. The new Grimaldi&apos;s location <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122025039/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/21/dumbo_grimaldis_closing_november_28.php">was supposed to open</a> on November 29, but it&apos;s unclear when that may happen now.<p></p>

<p>And for those of you interested in pizzeria genealogy: When Patsy Grimaldi first opened his DUMBO restaurant in 1990 he called it Patsy&apos;s, after his uncle Patsy Lancieri&#x2019;s East Harlem pizzeria where he had worked growing up. He was forced to change the restaurant&apos;s name to Grimaldi&apos;s in 1995 after new owners took the East Harlem pizzeria and name. Then, in 1998, Grimaldi sold the pizzeria to Ciolli, but regretted it ever since.  </p>

<p>While some of you may think this could get ugly, Ciolli insists to the Post, &quot;I have no animosity towards Patsy and his family. He gave me a wonderful opportunity selling me the place in 1998, and I wish him the best.&quot;</p>
