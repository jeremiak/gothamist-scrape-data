<p>Last night, a Gulfstream IV taking off from an airport outside of Boston burst into flames, killing the seven people on board. One of the passengers was Lewis Katz, 72, a co-owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News and Philly.com. </p>

<p>The plane left Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts, at 9:40 p.m. and was headed to Atlantic City International Airport in NJ. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034533/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/seven-aboard-new-jersey-bound-plane-die-massachusetts-crash-n119491">A witness told the Boston Globe</a>, &quot;I heard a big boom, and I thought at the time that someone was trying to break into my house because it shook it. I thought someone was like banging on the door trying to get in.&quot; Others described a huge fire.</p>

<p>Last week, Katz and another business mogul, Gerry Lenfest, had just completed a $88 million buyout of other investors to take control of the paper amid falling circulation and advertising revenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034533/http://www.wsls.com/story/25661914/7-aboard-atlantic-city-bound-plane-killed-in-crash">Katz had said,</a> &quot;It&apos;s going to be a lot of hard work. We&apos;re not kidding ourselves. It&apos;s going to be an enormous undertaking... Hopefully, (the Inquirer) will get fatter.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034533/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20140602_Lewis_Katz__co-owner_of_The_Inquirer__dies_in_plane_crash.html">Lenfest said</a>, &quot;We all deeply mourn the loss of my true friend and fellow investor in ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com. It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that Drew Katz, Lewis&apos;s son, will replace his father on the board of our new company.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034533/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20140602_Lewis_Katz__co-owner_of_The_Inquirer__dies_in_plane_crash.html?c=r">From the Inquirer</a>:</p><blockquote>Katz made his fortune investing in the Kinney Parking empire and the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network in New York. He once owned the NBA&apos;s New Jersey Nets and the NHL&apos;s New Jersey Devils and is a major donor to Temple University, his alma mater.<p></p>

<p>&quot;Lewis Katz was an exceptional man, whose presence enriched the lives of everyone he came in contact with,&quot; said [Bill] Marimow, the Inquirer&apos;s editor. &quot;He never forgot his friends or his roots, giving back generously to the city of Camden, Temple University, Dickinson College&apos;s law school, the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, and countless other organizations.</p>

<p>&quot;He loved his family and his friends and they loved him back in return. We&apos;ve lost a great friend.&quot;</p></blockquote>Last year, Marimow was fired by the Inquirer&apos;s publisher, against Katz and Lenfest&apos;s wishes (and during disagreements <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034533/http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_24362039/katz-lenfest-court-philly-newspaper-feud">they had with the other owners</a>). Katz and Lenfest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034533/http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/05/katz-lenfest-take-philly-inquirer-company-189217.html">went to court to get Marimow reinstated</a>.<p></p>

<p>The NTSB is investigating the crash. The FAA says the plane apparently caught fire while taking off, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034533/http://www.necn.com/05/31/14/Newspaper-owner-6-others-killed-in-plane/landing.html?blockID=867267&amp;feedID=11106">an aviation expert told NECN said</a>, &quot;The engine could implode, if you will. A turbine wheel could separate, there could be a fire in the combustion chamber. Or a fuel leak could also create a fire of that nature.&quot;</p>
