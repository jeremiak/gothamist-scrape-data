Which is why there are enterprising individuals like one 23-year-old who used Match.com to find men to take her out to fancy restaurants five days a week.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030035215/http://www.businessinsider.com/confessions-how-she-made-1200-a-month-using-matchcom-2011-11">Business Insider found Jessica Sporty</a>, whose &quot;$45k salary was not enough and she needed at least an extra $500 a month and sometimes $1,000 to pay her credit card bills and afford her $1,475 a month apartment in Murray Hill. Then she discovered Match.com- the perfect site for a broke 23-year-old.&quot;  Sporty gives what must surely be Match.com&apos;s next testimonial, &quot;Before I barely had enough money to pay for food. <strong>After using Match.com I found I wasn&#x2019;t going into debt anymore.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Before you freak out, don&apos;t worry, it sounds like she was targeting the 1%, or at least 1% wannabes,&quot;The investment banker types were thrilled to woo her with extraordinary restaurants like the underground taqueria La Esquina and a Japanese restaurant, Megu, in Tribeca. One guy even took her to a champagne bar and purchased a $200 bottle.&quot; And don&apos;t worry, she didn&apos;t lead these guys on: &quot;Sporty started eating out five nights a week using a rotation of different guys she met through the dating site. She kept things simple&#x2014;no more than five dates with the same guy.&quot; Because after five dates, you&apos;ve probably used up your excuse that Aunt Flo is in town.</p>

<p>Prior to the magical online dating solution (dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030035215/http://www.observer.com/2011/11/businessinsider-introduces-novel-concept-of-food-hooking/">&quot;food hooking&quot; by some</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030035215/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/11/jessica_sporty_matchcom_dinners.php">infuriating by others</a>), Sporty was spending $500/month on dinners, but then her dates were paying about $60 for her portion of each meal (which is a low estimate of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030035215/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/12/new_yorkers_dont_spend_enough_on_fi.php">what a date costs in NYC</a>, BTW).  And she extended her savings by &quot;stop[ping] eating lunch and opt[ing] for a light breakfast&quot; plus turned her roommates onto the idea (&quot;One of them called for making spreadsheets about each guy who took them out for their drinks and/or meals. It included names, photos and details from their Match.com accounts&quot;).   Sporty has since called it quits: &quot;It was exhausting. I needed my sleep and I was done playing the game.&quot; Don&apos;t hate the player, HATE THE GAME!</p>

<p>There&apos;s still good news for men: Apparently income of NYC single women in their 20s is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030035215/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/date_works_hard_for_the_money_and_rW7bKzX7mR5zMDvNRk8fOJ">17% higher than their male counterparts</a>. </p>
