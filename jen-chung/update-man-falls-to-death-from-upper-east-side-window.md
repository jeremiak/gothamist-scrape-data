<p>Mastronardi was found dead in the building&apos;s courtyard.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102359/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/04/2011-04-04_wall_street_trader_falls_to_death_from_upper_east_side_apartment_window.html">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;An attendant at a neighboring parking lot said he was startled by the sound of Mastronardi hitting the ground and went running for cover. &apos;I heard a loud bang from the back,&apos; Joe Gomez said. &apos;It sounded like a bomb - very hard. I never heard something like that before.&apos;&quot;  Mastronardi was an exotic derivatives trader for Vyapar Capital Market Partners.</p>

<p>He and his wife had three children, including a baby.  Gomez told the News, &quot;I&apos;d see him passing by with the kids all the time and say hi.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Sources say Mastronardi had been drinking before the fall. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102359/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/04/04/wall-street-trader-dies-after-fall-from-apartment-window/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=WSJ_NY_NY_Blog">Police tell the Wall Street Journal</a> he was &#x201C;drinking heavily&#x201D; and smoking cigarettes, and that he lost his balance as he was opening a bedroom window to air out the apartment. And a source tells the Post that his wife, Debra Mastronardi, had also been drinking heavily and &quot;had to be taken out of the apartment in a stretcher.&quot; </p>
