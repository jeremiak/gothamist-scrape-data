<p>Police made a grisly discovery near 700 Columbia Street in Brooklyn yesterday: The body of a fully clothed and handcuffed man floating in the water.</p>

<p>The victim appeared to be in his 30s or 40s. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013200/http://nypost.com/2014/09/29/handcuffed-corpse-dressed-in-suit-pulled-from-river/">The NY Post reports</a>: &quot;A 911 caller reported a possible drowning in the Erie Basin around 9:40 a.m., but rescuers now believe the victim&#x2019;s lifeless body was in the water for days.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013200/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-body-found-brooklyn-coast-sources-article-1.1957040">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;His hands were cuffed in the front and a pair of leg shackles attached from his left ankle to his right wrist. He had trauma to his face and head... [and] was wearing a dark suit jacket and pants, brown shoes and a tie, the sources said. He had $11 and a MetroCard on him but no identification.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Post&apos;s sources, he also had &quot;a handcuff key in his pocket,&quot; leading another source to say, &quot;It could have been a suicide but who knows?&quot; </p>

<p>The ME&apos;s office will determine cause of death.</p>
