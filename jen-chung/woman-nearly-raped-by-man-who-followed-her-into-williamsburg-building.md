<p>Police are searching for a man accused of trying to rape a woman in South Williamsburg apartment building. The suspect may have been buzzed in by another resident.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May 3rd, near Driggs Avenue and South 8th Street. Police say the man followed the 37-year-old female victim into a residential building and caught up with her in the stairway. He then pulled off some of her clothes and tried to rape her. The woman screamed for help and fought off her assailant, who fled the building, running south on Driggs Avenue.<br>

He was randomly hitting buzzers to get inside. As the woman went upstairs, someone buzzed the man in.&quot;</p>

<p>Building management reportedly sent flyers to residents telling them not to buzz in strangers (<b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917153624/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/20/ask_a_native_new_yorker_should_i_le_1.php">never buzz in strangers</a></b>), but one resident said, &quot;It&#x2019;s a form of protection, but the buzzers sometimes, they static up. You can&#x2019;t really hear who you&#x2019;re buzzing in, what&#x2019;s going on, so sometimes, you just buzz them in.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The suspect is described as being 22-25 years old, 5&apos;7&quot;- 5&apos;8&quot; and 150-170 pounds; he carried a black umbrella and was last seen wearing a green hooded sweater, light colored pants and black sneakers. Police released surveillance images and video:</p>
