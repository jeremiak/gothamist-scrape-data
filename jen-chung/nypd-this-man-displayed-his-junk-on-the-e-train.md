<p>According to the NYPD, on July 29 at 10:30 a.m., a 48-year-old woman on a Queens-bound E train noticed that the man sitting across from her was exposing himself. When the train arrived at the Jamaica/Van Wyck Expressway subway station, the man fled.</p>

<p>Police released a photo of the suspect and say he&apos;s about 35-40 years old, approximately 5&apos;8&quot;, and last wearing a black hat and a black-and-white spotted button-down shirt.</p>
