The gunfire came from two police officers&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506004842/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/01/subway_panhandler_shot_after_stabbi.php">struggle with a reportedly schizophrenic subway panhandler</a>, who had stabbed one of the officers in the chest with a screwdriver.  The panhandler was reaching for one of the cops&apos; guns, so the cop fought for control (the gun went off twice) and then the stabbed partner fired three times, wounding the panhandler&#x2014;and also hitting Williams.  The 17-year-old told the Daily News, &quot;I ran as soon as I heard the fighting. I was still running when I felt a sting in my leg,&quot; and added that people on the platform were reassuring, &quot;People were saying, &apos;Just relax. Everything is going to be okay.&apos; I just fell down when I saw the blood.&quot;  Williams&apos; father, who said a police lieutenant visited to apologize, noting how his son is hobbling around on crutches, &quot;It&apos;s going to take quite a while before he can go back to school.&quot;</p>
