<p>A man aboard a southbound 2 train was attacked and robbed earlier this morning.</p>

<p>Police say the incident occurred around 1:15 a.m. as the train was pulling into the Jackson Avenue station in the Bronx: A 26-year-old man was approached by two men who slashed him in the face and hand and then took his backpack. A police source tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712161435/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Man-Slashed-in-Robbery-on-Subway-2-Train-in-Bronx-NYPD-374583031.html">NBC New York</a> that one of the muggers may have brandished a gun.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Lincoln Hospital. One subway rider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712161435/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/05/bronx-subway-slashing-robbery/">told 1010 WINS</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s scary because I work early mornings. It happened so close to home, I hear about it a lot on the news, but I didn&#x2019;t think it would happen so close to home.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD is trying to stop the 21% increase in slashings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712161435/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/22/this_isnt_1995_at_the_tunnel_okay.php">with a program called &quot;Operation Cutting Edge&quot;</a>. Police Commissioner Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712161435/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/05/bronx-subway-slashing-robbery/">said</a>, &quot;This is one of the few crimes that is going up. At the same time it&#x2019;s going up at a level that is a concern to us, that&#x2019;s the additional effort were putting into it.&quot;</p>
