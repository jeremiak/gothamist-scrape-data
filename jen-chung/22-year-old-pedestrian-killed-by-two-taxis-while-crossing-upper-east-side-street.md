</div></div>					<p>A 22-year-old NJ resident was fatally struck by two taxi cabs in Manhattan just before 11:30 p.m. Thursday night.</p>

<p>The victim was identified as Kelly Gordon. According to the NYPD, Gordon was crossing York Avenue from east to the west at East 84th Street when she was hit by the cab going south. Then a northbound cab hit her. Gordon was rushed to New York Cornell Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>Both drivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164316/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9500144">remained on the scene</a> and the NYPD&apos;s Highway Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. No charges have been filed yet.</p>

<p>Gordon&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164316/http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kelly-gordon/45/322/380">LinkedIn page</a> says she&apos;s a senior at Boston College and an intern at ITG. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164316/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/woman-dies-struck-yellow-cabs-upper-east-side-article-1.1753139">One neighborhood worker told the Daily News</a>, &quot;We ran over right after the accident. She looked horrible, there was blood coming from her nose, you could tell she wasn&apos;t going to make it... Her purse was on one side of the street, her shoe was on the other...I grabbed a flashlight and started to direct traffic.&quot; He added that he &quot;overheard Gordon&apos;s hysterical sister and a male friend tell police that they had just left the 7-11 convenience store at the corner of E. 84 St. and York Ave. and were Jaywalking across the street when Gordon was hit.&quot; </p>
