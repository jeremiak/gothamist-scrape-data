<p>Fellas, can I ask you a question? If you&apos;re shelling out $35,000 for an engagement ring, what are you doing inviting a woman you just met up to a hotel room? This is what some schmuck did and now his ring is, obviously, missing.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_05_checkin2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111327im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_05_checkin2.jpg" width="195" height="271" class="image-left"> </span>The police are looking for a female suspect who apparently pulled this grift two months ago. According to the NYPD, the incident occurred on March 17th, when the suspect &quot;removed a diamond engagement ring from the 43 year-old male victim&apos;s room inside the Standard Hotel, located at 848 Washington Street.&quot;</p>

When he woke up, the woman had left and the ring &#x2014; which he had been keeping in the room &#x2014; was gone.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as having black hair and is about 5&apos;2&quot; and 120 pounds. She also has a very nice smile, at least based on the NYPD surveillance image and video.</p>

<p>The video appears to show the suspect and victim checking into the Standard:</p>
