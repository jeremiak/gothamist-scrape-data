title: NYC Doesn't Want To Assign Races To Students

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="2010_10_race1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302075651im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_10_race1.jpg" width="350" height="257"> <br> <i>The race section of the 2010 Census form</i></div> Earlier this year, more than a few New Yorkers were confused and upset why the 2010 Census form <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302075651/http://www.wpix.com/news/local/wpix-census-hispanics,0,4163472.story">didn&apos;t offer a racial category for Hispanic or Latino</a> (the Census offer a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302075651/http://www.prb.org/Articles/2009/questionnaire.aspx">Hispanic question</a> for ethnicity).  Now, NY1 reports that  NYC Schools Chancellor Joel Klein sent an email to U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan saying that NYC school officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302075651/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/127764/ny1-exclusive--city-school-officials-oppose-federal-policy-to-assign-races-to-all-students">don&apos;t really want to classify students by race</a>, per federal law, &quot;[It] may well be problematic and confusing for many of our community members, particularly Hispanics, and could create a difficult public debate about the collection of this information.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A Census spokesman previously explained, &quot;If we were to try to provide a space for every different consideration of race ... the form would be 100 pages long. Focus groups were used to make decisions on which [races] were used,&quot; but Deputy Schools Chancellor Santiago Taveras said, &quot;Latinos like to identify themselves as Dominicanos [Dominicans], Puertorrique&#xF1;os [Puerto Rican], Guatemaltecos [Guatemalans], and this form actually overlooks all of that. So it was frustrating on a personal level and I can understand how parents would feel at home and I&apos;d like them to understand it&apos;s a mandate.&quot;  </p>

<p>In spite of the NYC Department of Education&apos;s concerns, NYC school officials are collecting the information since the feds are demanding it.  Schools are required to assign a student a race if he/she didn&apos;t mark one, which makes things a little dicey.</p>
