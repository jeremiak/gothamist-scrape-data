</div></div>					<p>While shipments have already reached some iPhone faithful already, there are lines outside Apple Stores around the world for the eagerly awaited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030844/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/07/iphone_3.php">iPhone 4</a>.  Yesterday, the Fifth Avenue Apple Store&apos;s line saw a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030844/http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/23/iphone-4-launch-coco-drops-in-on-the-apple-store-line/">visit from Conan O&apos;Brien</a>, this morning the cops were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030844/http://www.silive.com/westshore/index.ssf/2010/06/long_line_forming_outside_stat.html">called in to calm crowds</a> at the Staten Island Apple Store, and today, the first Fifth Avenue customers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030844/http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/24/iphone-4-launch-first-customers-entering-5th-ave-store/">being cheered</a>:</p>

<p>Some people waiting outside the Fifth Avenue store were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030844/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/drama_builds_on_apple_store_line_caPvmvgDxBQI2Uqsji01gN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">trying to sell their spots for $1,000</a>&#x2014;one said he got an offer of $1,200, &quot;People see us from the street and throw out numbers.
