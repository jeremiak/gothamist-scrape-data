<p>Channel your java addiction for a good cause: A number of cafes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://sprudge.com/a-nationwide-coffee-fundraiser-for-the-aclu-115163.html">are offering 5% of their coffee sales</a> from today, Friday, February 3, through Sunday, February 5, to the ACLU, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/aclu_donations_boom.php">help the organization</a> continue its fight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/29/4_more_detainees_released_from_jfk.php">against the immigration ban</a>. </p>

<p>Sprudge, a coffee culture and news website, organized the fundraiser, with hundreds of coffee joints across the country participating. The website explained:</p><blockquote>Sprudge is not a political publication. We did not endorse a 2016 Presidential Candidate, nor have we endorsed past candidates in elections in the United States or elsewhere. Although Sprudge is edited and published in the US, roughly half our daily readers come from outside of this country, as does our worldwide corps of editors, staff writers, and contributors. We don&#x2019;t typically report on anyone&#x2019;s local politics&#x2014;and at some point, it&#x2019;s all just local politics.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Stick to coffee, Sprudge!&#x201D;</p>

<p>We&#x2019;d love to, but unfortunately, the situation in our country has moved beyond political theater. We believe that the current executive order banning refugees from the United States and immigration from 7 majority Muslim nations is illegal, immoral, and fundamentally un-American. Like a hot mug of drip coffee spilled on a crisp white apron, these actions are a dark stain on our national conscience, and as Americans, we feel compelled to stand up against them.</p></blockquote>Among the NYC venues participating are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://joecoffeeshop.myshopify.com/">Joe Coffee</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/https://www.lacolombe.com/">La Colombe</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/https://varietycoffeeroasters.com/">Variety Coffee</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/https://buy.gimmecoffee.com/">Gimme Coffee</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://www.pudgeknuckles.com/">Pudge Knuckles</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://birchcoffee.com/">Birch Coffee</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://www.everymanespresso.com/">Everyman Espresso</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/https://irvingfarm.com/">Irving Farm</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153347/http://cafegrumpy.com/">Cafe Grumpy</a>, and more.
