</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072615/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/21/mta_chairman_jay_walder_resigns_to.php">Last year, MTA head Jay Walder stepped down</a> from heading the NYC subway and bus system and Long Island and Connecticut commuter lines to take a job running Hong Kong&apos;s transit system, the MTR.  Yesterday was his first day on the job and he told everyone how crappy everything is in New York!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072615/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/former-m-t-a-chief-recounts-his-ups-and-the-systems-downs/">According to CityRoom</a>, Walder said, &quot;New York, when I arrived there, was in a financial crisis. The system simply did not have enough money to continue to operate. The assets were not being renewed. And the infrastructure was in terrible condition... What I did was to be able to right that financial basis and to be able to put the system back on firm financial footing.&quot; Fine, so we&apos;re not getting fare hikes this year&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072615/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/mta_budget_no_2012_fare_hikes_or_se.php">what about our missing bus</a>?!</p>

<p>Walder was optimistic about Hong Kong&apos;s system, &quot;I think we have a very different situation here. We have a first-class railway. We have a sustainable financial model that is supporting that railway. And I think the people of Hong Kong are benefiting tremendously from what we have.&quot; Please, the MTR only runs 19 hours a day, while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072615/http://www.mta.info/nyct/subway/howto_sub.htm">NYC Transit subway system runs 24 hours a day</a>.  </p>

<p>The MTR happens to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072615/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/outgoing_mta_ceo_jay_walder_to_make.php">be paying Walder about $1 million/year</a>&#x2014;the MTR had a $1 billion surplus in 2010 and its revenue for the first half of 2011 jumped 8%, thanks to its advertising and rental income (because the MTR owns the land over the subway stations&#x2014;printing money, baby!).</p>
