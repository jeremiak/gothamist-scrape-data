Freedom Tower, at 1776 feet (including spire and antennae), was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104752/http://gothamist.com/2003/12/19/freedom_tower_unveiled.php">unveiled in December 2003</a>, only for the Daniel Libeskind-design to be scrapped for one by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104752/http://gothamist.com/2005/06/29/new_freedom_tower_designs_unveiled.php">Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill&apos;s David Childs</a>.  But that revised design remained a patriotic 1776 feet, even if officials say the building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104752/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/27/tizzy_over_downplayed_freedom_at_1.php">should be called &quot;One World Trade Center.&quot;</a> Now, it looks like the tower will be actually even <em>more</em> patriotic than previously thought.</p>

<p>The building will have a lightning rod on top: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104752/http://www.observer.com/2011/09/lightning-strikes-1-world-trade-center-making-room-for-rods-tower-will-be-taller-than-1776-feet/">According to the Observer</a>, &quot;A diagram for the 400-foot aerial appendage appeared in Architectural Record last week, and it showed an eight-foot protrusion atop the antenna... &apos;There is a sense a lighting strike could be huge, so we have to protect against that,&apos; this person said. Indeed, lightning has been an issue for decades at the Empire State Building.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Observer&apos;s source also does some math and says based on the current diagram, the building would measure 1784 feet but &quot;the lightning rod has not even been designed yet. It could be two feet tall or eleven feet, one rod or a dozen.&quot;  What a headache&#x2014;we just want to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104752/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/31/video_a_look_back_at_the_twin_tower.php">watch the Twin Towers on screen again</a>.</p>
