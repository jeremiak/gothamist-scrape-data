One commenter on LAist said, &quot;Sorry to get all #Queer &amp; #LGBT sentimental but &apos;I Feel Love&apos; was the coolest f*cking song this 10yr old pre-gay boy ever heard. In &apos;79/&apos;80 I made my dad take me to a record store to buy Bad Girls album before he dragged me to a watch a softball game. I HAD TO HAVE IT.<br>
I loathe mourning celebrity but this one is just so unexpected.&quot;</p>

<p>Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz issued a statement:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Today all of Brooklyn and the music world mourn the passing of Donna Summer. In the three decades I have been hosting the Seaside Summer Concert Series at Coney Island and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Concert Series in Crown Heights/Central Brooklyn, Donna Summer was at the top of my &#x2018;must have&#x2019; acts. I tried each and every year to get her to our borough, and finally, in August of 2009, she came to Coney Island and performed her first ever show in Brooklyn. It was electric&#x2014;what a show, what a show. When I met her, she was nothing but gracious and accommodating and a real class act who was willing to meet with fans and do whatever she could to make it an unforgettable event for the thousands who came out. She wasn&#x2019;t from Brooklyn, but that night Brooklyn adopted her as one of their own. The silencing of her voice brings great sadness to me and generations of fans who grew up with her music, but her songs will live on and hold a permanent place in the catalogue of great American music. Our hearts and prayers go out to Ms. Summer&#x2019;s husband, three children, grandchildren and everyone who was touched by this incredible lady.&#x201D;</blockquote>Here are some of those indelible performances:<p></p>
