<p>A police officer called Elias, 28, who reportedly said, <strong>&quot;&apos;We had a fight. She tried to stab me and I choked her. Is she OK?&apos;</strong>&quot; and told cops where he was.  He believed that Lopez was cheating on him and told the police that Lopez charged at him with a knife during their argument. (Lopez had also called her brother during the fight.) His mother told the Daily News, &quot;He&apos;s a great man and a great dad.&quot;</p>

I gotta go... I know I&apos;m going to jail. I love you.&quot;  </p>

<p>None of the people in the apartment heard the fight; Elias was charged wtih murder.</p>
