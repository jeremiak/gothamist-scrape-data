<p>A second juror from the George Zimmerman trial is speaking out&#x2014;and this one wants Trayvon Martin&apos;s parents to know she feels very badly. Juror B29, who would only given her name as Maddy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731193951/http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-juror-murder/story?id=19770659">told ABC News</a>, &quot;You can&apos;t put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty. But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Juror B29 was the only non-white member of the all-female jury that was deciding the murder and manslaughter charges against Zimmerman. Zimmerman fatally shot Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, after following the teen on a February 2012 night in Sanford, Florida, thinking the teen was suspicious and confronting him. A few weeks ago, the jury found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731193951/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/george_zimmerman_found_not_guilty_i.php">Zimmerman not guilty of both charges</a>, raising <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731193951/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/21/photos_thousands_want_justice_for_t.php">questions about the case</a>.</p>

<p>Describing herself as a nursing assistant and a mother of eight who recently moved to Florida from Chicago, Juror B29 said, &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can&apos;t get away from God. And at the end of the day, he&apos;s going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with. [But] the law couldn&apos;t prove it.&quot; She had wanted to convict him of second-degree murder:</p><blockquote>&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end,&quot; she said.<p></p>

<p>However, on the second day of deliberations, after spending nine hours discussing the evidence, Maddy said she realized there wasn&apos;t enough proof to convict Zimmerman of murder or manslaughter under Florida law.</p>

<p>Zimmerman concedes he shot and killed Martin in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012, but maintains he fired in self-defense.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s where I felt confused, where if a person kills someone, then you get charged for it,&quot; Maddy said. &quot;But as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can&apos;t say he&apos;s guilty.&quot;</p></blockquote>She said she was struggling with the verdict, &quot;I felt like I let a lot of people down, and I&apos;m thinking to myself, &apos;Did I go the right way? Did I go the wrong way?&apos; As much as we were trying to find this man guilty&#x2026;they give you a booklet that basically tells you the truth, and the truth is that there was nothing that we could do about it. I feel the verdict was already told.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The first juror who spoke out said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731193951/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/zimmerman_juror_george_zimmerman_is.php">Zimmerman&apos;s &quot;heart was in the right place&quot;</a>. The four other jurors issued a statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731193951/http://news.yahoo.com/4-jurors-distance-themselves-juror-b37-022818351.html">saying they didn&apos;t agree with her</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s hard for me to sleep, it&apos;s hard for me to eat because I feel I was forcefully included in Trayvon Martin&apos;s death,&quot; Juror B29 added. &quot;And as I carry him on my back, I&apos;m hurting as much Trayvon&apos;s Martin&apos;s mother because there&apos;s no way that any mother should feel that pain.&quot;</p>
