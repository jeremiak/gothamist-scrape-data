<p>Earlier this morning, two men were found with fatal gunshot wounds to the head in the elevator of a Bronx public housing building.</p>

<p>The NYPD says they received a 911 call at 10:49 a.m. about an incident at the Morrisania Houses at 3125 Park Avenue. Inside an elevator, they found a 26-year-old and a 23-year-old, both unconscious and unresponsive. Both men were pronounced dead at Lincoln Medical Center. </p>

<p>Apparently the men were found when the elevator was at the 7th floor; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012013/http://7online.com/news/2-men-fatally-shot-in-bronx-apartment-building/388603/">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;The shooter was reported to have fled the scene, but authorities are searching the 30-story apartment building in case the suspect is still inside.&quot;</p>
