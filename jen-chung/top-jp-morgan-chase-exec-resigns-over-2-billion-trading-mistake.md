Ina Drew, the Chief Investment Officer, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304192704577402500885560924.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories">resigning today</a> because her division oversaw the London office&#x2014;which handles nearly $400 billion in trades&#x2014; that made what CEO Jamie Dimon called &quot;a terrible egregious mistake.&quot;  Wait, actually the press release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822/http://pymnts.com/news/businesswire-feed/2012/may/14/jpmorgan-chase-announces-management-changesina-drew-to-retire-matt-zames-named-new-cio-20120514005908/">says Drew is &quot;retiring,&quot;</a> but let&apos;s face it&#x2014;this $2 billion mistake has the potential to be a $4 billion mistake. We&apos;re guessing her retirement party&apos;s not going to be pouring top shelf champagne. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/business/jpmorgan-chase-executive-to-resign-in-trading-debacle.html?_r=1&amp;hp">According to the NY Times</a>, the exit of &quot;Drew, a 55-year-old banker who has worked at the company for three decades and serves as chief investment officer...would be a precipitous fall for a trusted lieutenant of Mr. Dimon. <strong>Last year, Ms. Drew earned roughly $14 million, making her the bank&#x2019;s fourth-highest-paid officer... Ms. Drew had tearfully offered to resign multiple times since the scale of the loss became apparent in late April,</strong> but Mr. Dimon had held off until now on accepting it, said several people familiar with the situation, who would not speak publicly because the resignations had not been completed.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to Drew, the Wall Street Journal reports, &quot;Achilles Macris, who was in charge of the London-based operation that placed the questionable trades; and trader Javier Martin-Artajo&quot; will also be leaving JP Morgan after what is, for the bank, an embarrassing episode and, for government officials who want more financial regulation, a sobering reason why banks need to be regulated.  As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/business/jpmorgan-shooting-itself-in-the-foot-fair-game.html?scp=2&amp;sq=glass%20steagall&amp;st=Search">Times pointed out</a>, &quot;This much is clear: If the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/glass_steagall_act_1933/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Glass-Steagall</a> law were still around, the problematic trading at JPMorgan would not have occurred.&quot; So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm-Leach-Bliley_Act">blame Clinton</a>!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2012_04_creditbets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_creditbets.jpg" width="640" height="622"> <br> <i> This is the WSJ&apos;s illustration of what happened, which is more sophisticated (and colorful) than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040822/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/12/business/at-jpmorgan-chase-a-complex-strategy-that-backfired.html?ref=business">NY Times&apos; effort</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>JP Morgan is apparently &quot;prepared for another $1 billion of possible losses this quarter from these positions, as well as another $1 billion of potential losses over the next year or so,&quot; according to a WSJ source. &quot;That would mean a possible total loss of more than $4 billion, though the positions also could rebound in value, slicing any loss, the person noted.&quot;</p>
