<p>Last night, the Rent Guidelines Board voted to increase rents for tenants of rent-stabilized apartments by 4% for one-year leases and 7.75% for two-year leases. This is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506163425/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/renters_hit_with_highest_hike_in_daKGjZuZKKG8ak4rKgppnI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">highest increase in five years</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, the RGB voted on 2% and 4% increases for one-year and two-year leases respectively; in 2008, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506163425/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/20/rent_stabilised_hikes_face_45_8_hik.php">increases were 4.5% and 8%</a>. The increases typically leave both landlords/building owners and tenants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506163425/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/28/rent_hikes_approved_tenants_and_lan.php">furious</a>, and this was no exception. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506163425/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/184153/rent-guidelines-board-approves-increases-for-rent-stabilized-apartments">Tenants told NY1</a>, &quot;Tenants are sick and tired of these outrageous increases. We&apos;re still in a recession. I&apos;m just outraged&quot; and &quot;The landlords are making money, and the tenants are being squeezed.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Aaron Sirulnick, chairman of the Rent Stabilization Association, said, &quot;The board has once again failed to take into consideration the ever-increasing costs that small property owners have by way of real estate taxes, water and sewer charges, and all the other regulatory charges that the board recognized but didn&apos;t take into account in their final numbers.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506163425/http://pix11.com/2013/06/20/rent-guidelines-board-approves-stabilized-rent-increases">increases are based on</a> &quot;Price Index of Operating Costs, which calculates the operating and maintenance costs to landlords.  Kimmel said that those costs have increased 5.9% from last year&quot;&#x2014;landlords/building owners were looking for increases of 6.25% for one-year leases and 9.5% for two-year leases (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506163425/http://www.housingnyc.com/downloads/guidelines/RGBproposed2013.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>

<p>There are about one million New Yorkers who live in rent-stabilized apartments; the increases go into effect in October. And not all developers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506163425/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/here_are_the_10_east_village_apartm.php#photo-1">can offer $10 apartments</a>.</p>
