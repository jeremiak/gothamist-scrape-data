<p>A pregnant woman and her friend were stabbed on a subway on Thursday night, police say. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609172522/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170609/melrose/pregnant-woman-stabbed-2-train-nypd">sources tells DNAinfo</a> that the pregnant woman&apos;s leg &quot;leg bumped Derrick Wilson, 50, and sent him into a rage about 6:41 p.m.&quot;</p>

<p>The 24-year-old pregnant woman and her female friend, 21, were on a northbound 2 train in the Bronx. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609172522/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170608/concourse-village/man-shot-morris-avenue-nypd">According to DNAinfo</a>, a source said the pregnant woman &quot;was sitting on the lap of her friend&quot; when she apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609172522/http://nypost.com/2017/06/09/pregnant-woman-stabbed-in-the-neck-while-riding-the-subway/">bumped</a> into Wilson. That when Wilson allegedly took out a knife, stabbing the four-months pregnant woman in the neck and her friend in the left bicep. </p>

<p>Wilson fled at the elevated Prospect Avenue station, reportedly throwing the knife onto a rooftop; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609172522/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/suspect-stabs-pregnant-woman-bronx-subway-train-article-1.3232812">the Daily News adds</a>, &quot;A group of good Samaritans chased after him and held him until police arrived.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the Good Samaritans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609172522/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/06/09/brooklyn-shooting-17-year-old-killed-14-year-old-hurt/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I heard some commotion that somebody got stabbed. &#x201C;Me and a couple of other guys, we said &#x2018;where&#x2019;s he at.&#x2019; We came looking for him and he ran out. He came past me and I grabbed him.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;One witness said the crowd wanted to rough up Wilson, but he eventually talked them out of it,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609172522/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Pregnant-Woman-Critically-Injured-Man-Stabs-Her-in-Neck-in-Subway-427357593.html">per NBC New York</a>.</p>
