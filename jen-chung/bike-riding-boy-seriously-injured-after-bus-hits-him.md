                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_08_bikeboy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014819im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_bikeboy.jpg" width="365" height="264"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Via NBC New York</i></div> An 11-year-old boy was injured when an MTA bus struck him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014819/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9219030">in Brooklyn yesterday afternoon</a>.<p></p>

<p>Syncire Nickens was riding his bike at about 5:15 p.m. when he was hit by the B13 bus. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014819/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/MTA-Bus-Hits-Child-Bicyclist-Brooklyn-Cypress-Hills-221107441.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;Investigators believe the boy may have ridden his red and gray bicycle into the back of the bus at the corner of Crescent and Weldon streets in Cypress Hills at around 5:15 p.m.. They say the driver never saw him.&quot;</p>

<p>A resident in the area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014819/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/boy-bike-hit-brooklyn-bus-article-1.1436711">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I was on the fourth floor and I heard him screaming. I ran down to see what happened and I see him screaming like he was dying... He went silent after about three minutes. He looked like he was in shock, like he was in space.&quot;</p>

<p>Syncire, who suffered what the News calls &quot;traumatic injuries to his rib cage and lower body,&quot; is expected to survive. </p>
