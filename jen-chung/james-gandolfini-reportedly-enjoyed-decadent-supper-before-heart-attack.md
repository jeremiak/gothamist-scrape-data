<p>The family of James Gandolfini has confirmed that the TV star died of a heart attack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321234855/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/james_gandolfini_has_died_at_51.php">while in Italy</a>. A spokesperson for his family said, &quot;Today we received the results of the autopsy, which stated he died of a heart attack, of natural causes. The autopsy further states that nothing else was found in his system.&quot;</p>

<p>Gandolfini died in Rome, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321234855/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/20/james_gandolfinis_son_called_for_he.php">after going into cardiac arrest</a> at the Hotel Exeda. The statement added, &quot;James came here on a vacation with his family&#x2026; he had a wonderful day. He visited The Vatican and had dinner at the hotel with his son awaiting the arrival of his sister... We are all devastated by this loss. James was a devoted husband, a loving father of two children, a brother and cousin you could always count on. We thank you for the privacy you have afforded us during this difficult time.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I can confirm he has been known to blow lines and drink like an Irish sailor on weekend leave,&#x201D; said another source.</p></blockquote>Gandolfini&apos;s ex-wife claimed that he did cocaine with castmates of The Sopranos; Gandolfini, in turn, said his ex was unstable.<p></p>

<p>Gandolfini&apos;s body will be returned to the United States next week and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321234855/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/gandolfini_autopsy_confirms_heart_UdPQiYMjs5S2WXACy0LbpI">funeral will be held in New York City</a>.</p>
