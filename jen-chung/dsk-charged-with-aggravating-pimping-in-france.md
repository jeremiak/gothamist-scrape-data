<p>You know how former IMF head (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/14/imf_head_arrested_at_jfk_accused_of.php">horrible hotel guest</a>) Dominique Strauss-Kahn was being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/18/dsk_under_investigation_for_partici.php">investigated for his involvement in a prostitution ring</a> in France? Well, now prosecutors have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/world/europe/france-dsk-court/index.html">charged him with &quot;aggravated pimping.&quot;</a> Is that like Kramer wearing the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat?</p>

<p>Or is &quot;aggravated pimping more like &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7noKul-Q_8">Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch?</a>&quot;  Another question: Will the NY Post use this Photoshop, the way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/12/spitzerpimp_in.php">they did with SpitzerPimp</a>?</p>

<p>While having sex with a prostitute is legal in France, providing prostitutes for others is not, and the French media has implicated Strauss-Kahn in the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/02/21/carlton-affair-dominique-strauss-kahn_n_1290197.html">Carlton Affair</a>&quot; (named for the hotel in Lille where the &quot;sex parties&quot; allegedly occurred) for months. It&apos;s believed that DSK spent IMF funds on his debauchery. Strauss-Kahn, through his attorney, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/18/us-dsk-prostitution-idUSTRE81H0DG20120218">denied having any knowledge</a> that the women were prostitutes, and claims he believed he was attending &quot;swingers&apos; parties.&quot;</p>

<p>According to CNN, &quot;He is not allowed to have contact with other people involved in the investigation, nor is he permitted to talk to the media about the case. Strauss-Kahn was released under a 100,000-euro bail.&quot; What, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120326233646/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/dominique_strauss-kahn_moves_to_swa.php#photo-1">no house arrest</a>?</p>
