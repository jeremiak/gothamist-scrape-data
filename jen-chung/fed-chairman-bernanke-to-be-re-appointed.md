<p>Another positive for Bernanke&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129231005/http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Economy/idUSTRE57O0BM20090825?virtualBrandChannel=11611">investors and economists like him</a> and may feel comforted he&apos;s staying on. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129231005/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/business/25bernanke.html?ref=business">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Most economists now predict that the United States recession either has already ended or is about to end very soon. Although unemployment is 9.4 percent, higher than at any time since the early 1980s, a wide array of indicators suggest that the economy has hit bottom and is about to begin a slow if painful recovery.&quot; Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Connecticut) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129231005/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aymAIFp3wdNs">said</a> in spite of his &quot;serious differences with the Federal Reserve... I think reappointing Chairman Bernanke is probably the right choice,&quot; but promised a &quot;thorough&quot; confirmation hearing.</p>

<p>Obama made the announcement from his vacation in Martha&apos;s Vineyard (Bernanke will be there) and his prepared remarks include, &quot;<strong>As an expert on the causes of the Great Depression, I&#x2019;m sure Ben never imagined that he would be part of a team responsible for preventing another. But because of his background, his temperament, his courage, and his creativity, that&#x2019;s exactly what he has helped to achieve.</strong>&quot;</p>
