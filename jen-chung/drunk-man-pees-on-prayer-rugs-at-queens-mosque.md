Last night, at the Al-Iman Mosque on Steinway Street, an apparently intoxicated man stormed in and &quot;shouted anti-Muslim slurs as he urinated on prayer rugs,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825052414/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/drunk_desecration_at_mosque_fA7FZKYh59hx3Bjika6UGN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post reports</a>. Naturally, that interrupted the evening prayers.</p>

<p>According to witnesses, Omar Rivera was shouting slurs and calling the worshippers &quot;terrorists.&quot; One told the Post, &quot;He stuck up his middle finger and cursed at everyone... <strong>No one can pray now because the rugs are completely soiled. It was disgusting</strong>... He calls us terrorists, yet he comes into our mosque and terrorizes other people...  This is a true hate crime.&quot;</p>

<p>Rivera was eventually subdued and held in a back room until police arrived. He was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825052414/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7630863">charged with criminal trespass</a>.</p>
