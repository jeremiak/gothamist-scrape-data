<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155159/https://twitter.com/#!/kanyewest/statuses/201078576676749312">protege</a> of Kanye West was arrested at Laguardia Airport for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155159/http://www.tmz.com/2012/05/22/2-chainz-arrested-brass-knuckles-laguardia/">carrying a set of brass knuckles at Laguardia Airport</a>.  At least, that what the TSA <em>thinks</em> 2 Chainz had.  But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155159/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/2-chainz-arrested-at-laguardia-airport-20120522">others claim</a> 2 Chainz was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155159/http://www.tmz.com/2012/05/22/2-chainz-tity-boi-arrested-brass-knuckles-4-finger-ring/">just carrying his DOPE four-finger ring</a> and say that the Transportation Security Administration overreacted.  </p>

<p>2 Chainz, also known as Tauheed Epps, managed to fly into New York City with the accessory. Today, he was heading to North Carolina but was flagged by security around 1:45 p.m..  Now he&apos;s been charged with misdemeanor possession of a weapon in the 4th degree at around&#x2014;and he&apos;s apparently still in custody!</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155159/http://shop.dopecouture.com/DC315.html">DopeCouture online shop</a>, the ring retails for $48... and there&apos;s a warning &quot;this ring is considered a weapon by some law enforcement. do not attempt to take this with you through any security terminals. use caution.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear when the warning was put up.  <br>
