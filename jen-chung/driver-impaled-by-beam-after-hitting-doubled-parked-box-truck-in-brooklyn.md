					<p>A driver was seriously injured after rear-ending a box truck on a Brooklyn street: The box truck, which was double-parked, had construction material sticking out of it, and a beam went through the car&apos;s windshield. </p>

<p>A neighbor who ran out to help <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033556/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Out-of-Control-Car-Nearly-Crushes-Man-Crash-Box-Truck-Brooklyn-Street-391361182.html">said the driver</a> &quot;was talking, but it looked bad.&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY says the incident occurred outside 124 Louisiana Avenue in East New York at 3:59 p.m. Firefighters had to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033556/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-survives-being-hit-by-steel-beam-during-freak-accident-in-brooklyn/1485301/">cut off the car&apos;s roof</a> to remove the driver. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033556/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/25/east-new-york-car-truck-crash/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that he was impaled.</p>

<p>The driver was taken to Brookdale Hospital in serious condition. A security camera video shows the motorist driving down Louisiana Avenue and into the back of the truck, nearly hitting one of the workers next to it. Before the crash, other drivers appear to notice the double parked box truck and move their vehicles accordingly:</p>

<p>The truck&apos;s driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033556/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Out-of-Control-Car-Nearly-Crushes-Man-Crash-Box-Truck-Brooklyn-Street-391361182.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I ran to the car, stuck my hand and grabbed the man&apos;s hand, told him to hold my hand and squeeze it. Try to keep him awake while I was on the phone with emergency services.&quot;</p>

<p>He added, &quot;I&apos;m lucky I wasn&apos;t still standing there, because we just walked away from the truck. But I&apos;m not even thinking about that. I just hope he survives.&quot; </p>
