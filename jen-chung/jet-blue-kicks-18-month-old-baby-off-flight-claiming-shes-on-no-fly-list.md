That&apos;s what one NJ couple claims happened to them and their adorable daughter when they were trying to go back home to the Garden State.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423042723/http://www.wpbf.com/news/south-florida/Baby-18-months-old-ordered-off-plane-at-Fort-Lauderdale-airport/-/8788880/13038550/-/item/0/-/nj6oah/-/index.html">According to WPBF</a>, the incident happened on Tuesday, when the family was on a flight at Fort Lauderdale Airport. The parents, who did not want to be identified because they are Middle Eastern, said a JetBlue employee told them to leave the plane with little Riyanna. &quot;And I said, &apos;For what?&apos;&quot; the mother recalls. &quot;And he said, &apos;Well, it&apos;s not you or your husband. Your daughter was flagged as no fly.&apos; I said, &apos;Excuse me?&apos; &quot;</p>

<p>When they were taken off the plane, they had to stand around as the TSA and JetBlue figured out the situation for 30 minutes; the father said they were profiled, &quot;We were put on display like a circus act because my wife wears a hijab.&quot; The family was finally allowed back on the plane&#x2014;without explanation or apology&#x2014;but they refused  because they felt humiliated.</p>

<p>JetBlue told the station the issue was with the TSA, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423042723/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/10/baby-ordered-off-plane-for-being-on-no-fly-list_n_1505648.html">TSA told HuffPo</a>, &quot;The TSA did not flag this child as being on the No Fly list. TSA was called to the gate by the airline and after talking to the parents and confirming through our vetting system, TSA determined the airline had mistakenly indicated the child was on a government watch list.&quot;  The TSA points out the family, including the baby, was giving boarding passes.  JetBlue has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423042723/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Toddler-JetBlue-Plane-No-Fly-List-New-Jersey-Kicked-Off-Flight-150984405.html">more recently said,</a> &quot;Our crew members followed the appropriate protocols, and we apologize to the family involved in this unfortunate circumstance.&quot;</p>

<p>Riyanna&apos;s father said, &quot;We were humiliated.  We were picked on,&quot; and said they&apos;ll speak to an attorney.</p>
