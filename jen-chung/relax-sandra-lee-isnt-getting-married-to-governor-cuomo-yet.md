<p>In 2017, we have a President who uses Twitter as his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911160610/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065">live, ever-evolving enemies list</a>. So when lifestyle guru Sandra Lee, longtime partner of Governor Andrew Cuomo, Tweeted a photograph of her in a wedding-ish dress, romantics in the media got very excited!</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&apos;m having such a lovely time digging through all of this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911160610/https://twitter.com/hashtag/wedding?src=hash">#wedding</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911160610/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Inspiration?src=hash">#Inspiration</a>!

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911160610/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/cuomo-girlfriend-sandra-lee-tweets-misleading-wedding-dress-pic-article-1.2975762">The Daily News reported</a>, &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t clear whether Lee was doing a photo shoot for her magazine or was signaling that she and Cuomo were set to finally tie the knot. A call to Cuomo&#x2019;s office hardly cleared up the question.&quot; </p><blockquote>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing to expect,&#x201D; Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi said somewhat cryptically.<p></p>

<p>When pressed for a yes or no answer to the question of whether Lee and Cuomo were preparing to wed, Azzopardi wouldn&#x2019;t give one.</p>

<p>Lee&#x2019;s spokeswoman Cathy Chermol said she wasn&#x2019;t aware of any coming wedding and noted that Lee often does wedding themes for her fans.</p>

<p>Like Azzopardi, she wouldn&#x2019;t give a definitive answer to whether Lee and Cuomo were getting married.</p>

<p>That brought Lee herself to the phone.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I love you and someday we will call you and bring you in on the decision,&#x201D; Lee said cheerfully.</p></blockquote>Daily News reporter Ken Lovett shared his reporting LIVE:<p></p>

They both insist they&#x2019;re happy the way they are and Lee has said in the past the marriage will happen eventually.&quot;</p>

<p>Lee helpfully posted explanations on her Twitter and Facebook accounts, basically coming thiscloseto calling this FAKE NEWS:</p>

<p>Anyway, we&apos;ll just imagine the music Lee and Cuomo will have at their wedding&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911160610/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/nyregion/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo.html?_r=0">will probably happen before 2020</a>&#x2014;and make what we think is a safe bet that it&apos;ll be at least 80% Billy Joel.</p>

<p>P.S. Governor Cuomo, couldn&apos;t you have at least picked the &quot;Walk this Way&quot; version from your fellow Queens NATIVES Run-D.M.C.? </p>
