<p>The trustee in charge of liquidating Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff&apos;s assets, filed a lawsuit against Madoff&apos;s two sons, brother and his brother&apos;s daughter for $199 million in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306010218/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/26/trustee_to_sue_madoffs_relatives_fo.php">ill-gotten gains</a> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306010218/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/13/madoffs_billions_in_fraud_casts_a_w.php">multi-billion dollar fraud</a>.  Irving Picard said the relatives used money from Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities like a &quot;a family piggy bank.&quot;</p>

<p>The lawsuit doesn&apos;t accuse sons Andrew and Mark Madoff (co-directors of trading), brother Peter Madoff (chief compliance officer) and niece Shana Madoff (Peter&apos;s daughter and compliance counsel) of participating in the scheme; the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306010218/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/business/03madoff.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss"> NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Rather, the trustee&#x2019;s complaint describes the relatives as &apos;completely derelict&apos; in carrying out their professional duties at the federally regulated brokerage firm,&quot; with the complaint saying, &quot;Simply put, if the family members had been doing their jobs &#x2014; honestly and faithfully &#x2014; the Madoff Ponzi scheme might never have succeeded, or continued for so long.&quot;</p>
