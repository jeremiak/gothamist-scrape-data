A 41-year-old man was fatally stabbed near a playground at a Manhattan park yesterday.</p>

<p>Police say that officers responded to a call at East 124th and Madison Avenue, where they found Timothy Goodwin stabbed in the neck. He was pronounced dead at Harlem Hospital. </p>

<p>Goodwin apparently had gotten into an argument with another person at Marcus Garvey Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014901/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2014/08/marcus-garvey-park-man-dies-after-being.html">A Walk In The Park reported</a>, &quot;The man was stabbed in front of a playground filled with children. Witnesses said he walked out of the park and tried to go across the street for help but did not make it far.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014901/http://nypost.com/2014/08/08/victim-stabbed-to-death-outside-playground/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;During the war of words, the killer pulled a knife and plunged it into the victim&#x2019;s neck. He then fled on foot.&quot; Also, the Post adds, &quot;Several kids who were in the area watched the horrific attack unfold. A concerned parent, Sandra Rosario, 28, told The Post, &apos;It&#x2019;s kind of disgusting because [the criminals] don&#x2019;t care&#x2026;I bet if their little kid was in this park they would have a problem with it.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Police are investigating the incident. </p>
