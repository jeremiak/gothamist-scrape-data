</div></div><p>When we visited the National 9/11 Memorial two weeks ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083910/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/world_trade_center_site_progress_vi.php?gallery0Pic=1#gallery">workers were painting the interior walls</a> of the reflecting pools.  Now, they are installing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083910/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/world_trade_center_site_progress_vi.php?gallery0Pic=14#gallery">granite</a> on the walls, which will eventually be covered by the largest manmade waterfalls in the country.  The names of the victims will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083910/http://www.national911memorial.org/site/PageServer?pagename=New_Memorial_Names">inscribed in the parapet</a> around the pools.  </p>

<p>The 9/11 Memorial Plaza, which also includes the 8 acres of landscaped area, is expected to be completed by September 11, 2011, the tenth anniversary of the attacks.  </p>
