Sure, there are worries about the debt situation in Europe, but the flashback to 2008 could have been due to a trader&apos;s error.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111016053633/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704370704575227754131412596.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal reports</a>, &quot;Several market watchers said they heard a major firm may have accidentally released an errant program, where a trader accidentally placed an order to <strong>sell $16 billion, instead of $16 million</strong>, worth of e-minis, the futures contracts tied to equity indexes.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>P&amp;G; was trading at around $60 and suddenly fell to $39.37; the WSJ explains, &quot;The New York Stock Exchange said each stock has its own circuit breaker level. When these stocks fall below their levels, then they can be traded on any other exchange or platform at any price. When P&amp;G; fell below its circuit breaker, a bid came in for the stock at $39.37 from the Nasdaq, the NYSE said.&quot;</p>
