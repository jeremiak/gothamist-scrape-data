<p>Breezy Point residents have prided themselves on living in a secluded, down-to-earth beach enclave far from the city. However, because everything must be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082148/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/bro_no.php">ruined by party-hearty jerks</a>, some are upset that &quot;party boats&quot; have been blasting music in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Assembly Member Phil Goldfeder is demanding that the Parks Department and Department of Environmental Protection investigate noise complaints about these boats in the waters between Sheepshead Bay and Breezy Point. &quot;These boats have gone overboard,&quot; he said in a press release. &quot;Our families should not have to put up with blasting music at all hours that negatively impacts their quality of life. I urge the city to take the necessary steps to alleviate this situation ahead of the summer boating season.&quot; </p>

<p>Connie Carter-Kruter filmed the boats, and explained that she and her family typically hear the music &quot;Thursday through Sundays [when] the boat passes back and forth across the bay until very early in the morning. The sound carries right into my house and can wake you up from a sound sleep. It seems that the boat doesn&#x2019;t have to answer to anyone.&quot;<br>

<p>Goldfeder, though, doesn&apos;t want anyone to think that he&apos;s trying to ban <em>all</em> boats&#x2014;&quot;You won&apos;t find a community more attuned to life on the water than right here in Breezy Point and across Rockaway. Still, there must be a balance that allows party boats to operate but still respects families&apos; right to spend a quiet night at home without feeling like they&apos;re at a club.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, Goldfeder&apos;s colleague Steven Cymbrowitz, who represents Sheepshead Bay, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082148/http://www.wnyc.org/story/battle-water-sheepshead-bay/">trying to ban party boats</a> after constituents complained about passengers&apos; behavior. Cymbrowitz said, &quot;People urinate; they relieve themselves right on the median, on the sidewalk, on the street. And they vomit. People have total disrespect.&quot; But one critic of the bill said that most of the party boat passengers are West Indian, suggesting that the ban would discriminate against that community.</p>
