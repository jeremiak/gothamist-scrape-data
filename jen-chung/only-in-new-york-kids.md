Not huge news, but his dead body was on a park bench near the cops who congregate at the south-eastern portion of the park. Several people went up to the group of police to mention the man was passed-out or dead. Around 9am, a group of (austrian/german) tourists were adamant with the police the man needed some assistance.  </blockquote><br>
<blockquote>The only reply came from a chris noth lookalike cop who said &apos;Why don&apos;t you go push the man. I ain&apos;t touching &apos;em. He could be napping, you wanna take that risk? Go home.&apos; Around 11:15am paramedics (unknown ambulance unit) arrived and took the man&apos;s vitals. About 20 minutes later they put the man on a stretcher with a blanket covering him. He was dead by the time the paramedics arrived. Excellent Police work.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>
