<p>Now, that the MTA&apos;s 2009 budget gap has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912011422/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/10/mtas_dire_situation_more_dire_than.php">quadrupled from $300 million to $1.2 billion</a>, the agency is trying to figure out what to do next to close the gap. Regarding likely service cuts, fare hikes and possible layoffs, MTA CEO Elliott Sander said, &quot;The word &apos;Draconian&apos; is not inappropriate.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912011422/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11112008/news/regionalnews/blight_at_end_of_tunnel_for_haky_mtas_ri_138080.htm">William Henderon said,</a> &quot;One of the scary things is if you look at how much a 1 percent increase raises, and then look at the total that needs to be raised.&quot; (A 1% fare hike would be about an extra $50 million.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912011422/http://wcbstv.com/politics/mta.bloomberg.east.2.860987.html">WCBS 2 reports</a> that &quot;<strong>If the gap is closed only from the fare box straphangers and commuters could face a hike of something like 28 percent</strong>,&quot; so that&apos;s why additional revenue streams, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912011422/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/09/tolls_for_east_river_bridges_freak.php">tolls for currently free East River crossings</a>, are being considered.  </p>

<p>There were no details of what may be cut, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912011422/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/10/2008-11-10_mta_cuts_draconian_12b__rising_-4.html">Daily News reports </a>that &quot;bus riders - particularly on express routes - would likely see the biggest cuts.&quot;  Also, &quot;Subway riders would see fewer trains, especially on lines with parallel service, such as the Broadway line in Manhattan, where N, R and W trains run.&quot; And Richard Ravitch, who heads the commission on how the MTA can increase revenue, said the MTA&apos;s situation is very, very serious. It will have a very painful effect on the riders of this system in many respects. On the other hand, there will be a lot of pain in any solution as well.&quot;</p>

<p>On the Brian Lehrer Show, City Councilman John Liu (chair of the Council&apos;s transportation committee) and NY1&apos;s Josh Robin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912011422/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/episodes/2008/11/11/segments/115311">discussed the MTA&apos;s plight</a>.  </p>
