<p>Next year&apos;s Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium means the anticipated matchup will be in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162837/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/29/ravens_qb_joe_flacco_calls_nynj_sup.php">frigid, &quot;retarded&quot; weather</a>. And to make things more interesting, it seems the NFL will be charging about $2,600 for VIP tickets&#x2014;double what they were in New Orleans! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162837/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324665604579079424146436620.html?mod=WSJ_NY_Sports_RIGHTTopCarousel_1">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;The NFL is on the verge of approving a plan that would more than double the prices the league charges for the most coveted Super Bowl tickets. According to three league officials familiar with the plan, club-level seats in the mezzanine with access to indoor restaurants are likely to cost about $2,600&#x2014;a mammoth hike from last year&apos;s game in New Orleans, where the top tickets went for $1,250. The next-cheapest tranche of seats (those in the lower bowl) would cost about $1,500, the executives said, up from $950 for the second-tier seats sold in New Orleans.&quot;</p>

<p>Why so expensive? Here&apos;s some cute explaining:</p><blockquote> NFL officials argue that New York is a unique Super Bowl market that warrants higher ticket prices. Not only is it more densely populated than other Super Bowl venues, it has a high concentration of wealthy corporations and individuals. There is also a well-established tradition in the city of paying out the nose for marquee events.<p></p>

<p>Since roughly 50 million people live within 200 miles of MetLife Stadium (compared with 6 million in New Orleans) NFL officials argue that many people won&apos;t mind paying more, since they&apos;re likely to save money on flights and hotels.</p></blockquote>And the indoor suites (with 30 tickets) are going for $500,000! However, the NFL is lowering the price of the &quot;cheap seats&quot; from the 2013 price $600 to $500&#x2014;&quot;about 39% of the roughly 77,500 seats would cost $1,000 or less.&quot; A STEAL for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162837/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/rich_people_doing_that_taunting_hig.php">these people</a>.<p></p>
