<p>Yesterday afternoon, a group of teens made a shocking discovery: a newborn premature baby was inside a Pathmark shopping bag.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151140/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9226107">WABC 7 spoke to Keyshaun Wiggins</a>, 15, who said they found the baby in a building&apos;s courtyard: &quot;We heard something crying in the bag, we thought it was an animal or something. So we went up to the bag, and we saw the baby&apos;s hand coming.&quot; He and his friends went to the building&apos;s super, who then called 911. Keyshaun added, &quot;The baby could have suffocated in the bag.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151140/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/08/newborn_baby_abandoned_in_jersey_city_and_left_in_garbage.html">super&apos;s wife, Rebecca Wolmers, said</a> that the baby&apos;s umbilical cord was still attached. She didn&apos;t think any of the building&apos;s residents were pregnant. The baby, which is 3 pounds, is reportedly stable at Jersey Medical Center. </p>

<p>Police are looking for the baby&apos;s mother. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151140/http://njsafehaven.org/">NJ has a safe haven law</a> which allows parents to abandon babies in safe places without prosecution.</p>

<p>And super Arturo Rivas prohibits kids from playing in the courtyard, telling the Jersey Journal, &quot;Thank God they were back there.&quot;</p>
