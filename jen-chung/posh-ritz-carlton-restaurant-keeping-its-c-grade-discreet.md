										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_09_bltmarkets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316073646im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_09_bltmarkets.jpg" width="365" height="252"> <br> <i>BLT Market at the Ritz-Carlton</i></div> If you&apos;re spending $14 on soup or $10 on a <em>side</em> of spinach (let&apos;s not get into the $47 veal chop), you&apos;d probably hope that the restaurant would have a Department of Health Restaurant Inspection grade of A, right?  Well, in the case of the BLT Market restaurant at the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South, it&apos;s a C-venue&#x2014;thanks to violations like &quot;Hot food item not held at or above 140&#xBA; F&quot; and &quot;Filth flies or food/refuse/sewage-associated (FRSA) flies present in facility&#x2019;s food and/or non-food areas. Filth flies include house flies, little house flies, blow flies, bottle flies and flesh flies. Food/refuse/sewage-associated flies include fruit flies, drain flies and Phorid flies.&quot;  Your diet starts now!<p></p>

<p>The Post, which has the lede, &quot;The Ritz is the pits, as far as the city&#x2019;s Health Department is concerned,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316073646/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/blt_grade_beef_Scmm79e1e5tdAEXSKz4bSK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">reports that the restaurant&apos;s C-grade is &quot;barely visible&quot;</a> in the window (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316073646/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/08/half_of_c-grade_restaurants_keeping.php">not surprising!</a>) and spoke to potential diners who seemed turned off. A tourist said, &quot;We do like to go to upscale restaurants when we&#x2019;re here, but I don&#x2019;t expect that type of grade from a restaurant of this level of quality. It taints it. No, I won&#x2019;t be going.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Manager Scott Geraghty was apologetic to the Post, &#x201C;More than anything, we care about our guests and customer. The Health Department came in a while ago, and we took all their suggestions and made all the improvements, and now we&#x2019;re just waiting for them to come back... It&#x2019;s sort of a mystery, they come when they come.&quot; While many restaurants do hope to improve their grades with another inspection (any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316073646/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/18/gramercy_tavern_among_650_restauran.php">receiving over 28 points is a C</a>), BLT Market&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316073646/http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do">which you can find here</a> under &quot;Ritz-Carlton New York&quot; at the CPS address&#x2014;had 67 points in June and 42 points in March, which suggests that the restaurant got a C back in March and when inspectors came back three months later, it really bombed.</p>
