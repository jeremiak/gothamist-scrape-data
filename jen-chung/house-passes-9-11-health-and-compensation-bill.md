<p>The House of Representatives passed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act by a vote of 268 to 160 two months after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811142055/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/30/politics_as_usual_911_health_bill_f.php">failing to pass the bill in a rancorous session.</a>  The act will &quot;exposed to toxins released by the collapse of the World Trade Center towers&quot; and also reopens the federal Victim Compensation Fund, according to Rep. Carolyn Maloney&apos;s office.  Maloney, the Democrat who co-sponsored the bill with  Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Peter King (R-NY), and Michael McMahon (D-NY), said, &quot;To the living victims of 9/11, we have good news: help is on the way.  Today, the House answered the emergency calls of thousands of ailing 9/11 first responders and survivors. Our bill provides proper care to those who lost their health because of the 9/11 attacks and demonstrates that we will not abandon those who come to aid of our nation in times of crisis.&quot;</p>

<p>The entire New York Congressional delegation voted for the bill, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811142055/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/30/video_rep_weiner_rep_king_shout_it.php">caught in partisan maneuvering</a> over the summer (the House Democrats asked for an absolute majority, to prevent Republicans from adding amendments).  Now the Senate will get a chance to vote on it; President Obama has said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811142055/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/19/obama_to_support_911_health_bill.php">he&apos;ll sign it into law</a>.<br>
