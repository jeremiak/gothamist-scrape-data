The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160903/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/10/10/2010-10-10_fox_perv_abused_kin_says_sister.html?r=news%2Fny_crime&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews%2Fny_crime+%28News%2FNY+Crime%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader"> Daily News spoke to one of his sisters</a>, who claims he&apos;s abused little girls before, &quot;I&apos;d like to see them put him away for the rest of his life. I am so full of rage. If I had the opportunity to spit in his face and hurt him, I would do it.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to the News, &quot;It was 25 years ago when [Susan] Gaudet found out Leaf abused two young female relatives multiple times at their grandparents&apos; home in Trucksville, Pa. The abuse started when Leaf was just 9years old and his first victim was 3, Gaudet said.&quot; She said that her brother continued to abuse the girl, as well as her young sister, for six years.  When he was confronted, Gaudet says Leaf admitted to the abuse, &quot;He said, &apos;Mom, I did it.&apos; Just like that. And he&apos;s never denied it. He probably wanted help, but he never got it.&quot;</p>

<p>Leaf, who is also charged with endangering the welfare of a child, is being held in Bergen County Jail on $250,000 bail. Gaudet said she only recently started speaking to her brother again, &quot;He continually reassured me we had nothing to worry about. I kind of resolved myself to the fact that this was something in the past, but now we know it wasn&apos;t.&quot;  She added that she told Leaf&apos;s wife (the mother of his two young children) about his past last Friday, &quot;[Monika Leaf] said, &apos;I don&apos;t know what to believe. I don&apos;t know what to do.&apos;&quot;</p>
