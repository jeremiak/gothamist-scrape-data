<p>Early yesterday morning, a pair of men entered a McDonald&apos;s in downtown Manhattan, locked up a security guard, and stole $3,000. </p>

<p>According to police, the robbery occurred at 4:30 a.m. on Sunday at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627212125/http://www.mcnewyork.com/23318">McDonald&apos;s on Varick Street</a>, just north of Houston (it&apos;s that little McDonald&apos;s Express): The suspects entered, showed a gun, and demanded cash. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627212125/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/from_safe_lock_mcdonald_security_HRrvsyc4qH1asTr62xM5VO">the Post gives more details</a>, with its sources saying the pair asked to use an ATM while the location was closed (though it seems it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627212125/https://plus.google.com/105102077234693616492/about?gl=US&amp;hl=en-US">might be open 24 hours</a>): &quot;The guard let the men inside and one pulled a black and silver revolver, before ordering the unarmed security worker into the bathroom and locking him inside,&quot; sources told the Post.</p>

<p>Then the pair &quot;took about $200 in cash from one of the workers and grabbed about $2,800 from the safe, police sources said. The police released surveillance video of the suspects:</p>
