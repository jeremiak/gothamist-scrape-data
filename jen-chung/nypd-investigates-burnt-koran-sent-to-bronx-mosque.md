This comes days after those opposed to building a new mosque and Islamic community center a few blocks from the World Trade Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011342/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/12/photos_freedom_rally.php#photo-1">convened for another protest</a>. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011342/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8352494">According to WABC 7</a>, the burnt Koran was &quot;delivered in an envelope to&quot; the Masjid-Hefaz on East 198th Street on September 10.  The imam opened the envelope, which was &quot;covered with cartoon like drawing depicting hatred towards Muslims&quot; and contained a white powder. The powder turned out to be ashes from the burnt Koran.</p>

<p>The imam suspects the sender is someone who doesn&apos;t understand Islam and have a lacking of understanding of the religion. At the September 11 protest, one anti-mosqueteer told us, &quot;The Muslims rape little girls, we have to make it safe for the kids.&quot;</p>
