<p>At a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132324/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/mayors-memorial-day-message-praises-veterans/78623/">wreath laying ceremony at the Soliders&apos; and Sailors&apos; Monument</a> in Riverside Park, Mayor Bloomberg said, &quot;These brave soldiers and so many others will be lovingly remembered and deeply missed by family and friends. Today their losses echo throughout our entire city.&quot; </p>

<p>There were protesters present at the ceremony (&quot;Impeach Bush for war crimes!&quot;), and the Mayor later acknowledged them, saying, &quot;I think it&apos;s wonderful that they protest. I don&apos;t necessarily agree with them, but it would be a shame to have this freedom to express yourself and to try to influence government and then to be too lazy to use it.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Sun also reports the mayor reflected how on the city is &quot;more patriotic today than it was 10, 20 years ago.&quot; </p>
