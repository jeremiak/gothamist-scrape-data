<p>According to the NYPD, the victim was driving out of his parking space at Gansevoort and West 13th Street, when a grey minivan blocked him. The two drivers apparently exchanged some words, and the grey minivan driver shot him twice, once in the right arm and once in the right hip. A police spokesman speculated it could have been a possible robbery attempt.</p>

<p>The victim then drove to Washington and West 14th Street and called the police. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. Police say the suspect is a black male, wearing a fitted cap and a long dark jacket (according to WABC 7, he has a thin build and a beard).</p>
