<p>An off-duty MTA worker was found dead on a sidewalk in East New York last night. </p>

<p>Police say that officers responded to a call about a shooting at 11:41 p.m. on May 1st. They found Jacqueline Dicks, 41, unconscious and unresponsive in front of 1010 Elton Street, with a gunshot wound to the head, and EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. </p>

<p>Dicks, who lived a few buildings away, was a conductor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502162127/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/off-duty-mta-worker-shot-killed-brooklyn-street-article-1.3127982">According to the Daily News</a>, she &quot;was wearing her MTA uniform when three suspects, all male, confronted her&quot; on the street.</p>

<p>No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. Trevor Dicks, the victim&apos;s brother, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502162127/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Off-Duty-MTA-Worker-Wearing-Uniform-Shot-Killed-Brooklyn-Police-420974884.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t see why anybody would do that to her. Especially three men on a woman.&quot;</p>
