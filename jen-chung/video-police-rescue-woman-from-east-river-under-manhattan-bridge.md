<p>The NYPD says that officers were alerted to the woman&apos;s presence in the river under the Manhattan Bridge at 3:30 p.m. Then two Emergency Service Unit Officers, Detective James Coll and Detective Frank Stevens, went into the water, swimming out 30 feet from the shore line to secure her. They brought her to a NYPD Harbor Launch Boat and then took her to Bellevue Hospital for a medical evaluation.
