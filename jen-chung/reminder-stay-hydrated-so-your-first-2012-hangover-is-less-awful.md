<p>It&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve, so here&apos;s our PSA:  Drink responsibly. If you are drinking, don&apos;t drive&#x2014;take a cab, take mass transit (subways and buses are running on a Sunday schedule), and the Department of Transportation is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081559/http://youthemannyc.org/giveaway/">even handing out </a>$15 Taxi card and single-ride Metrocards today at 5 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081559/http://youthemannyc.org/giveaway/">on the Upper East Side and in Harlem</a>&#x2014;and drink water!</p>

<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081559/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/drinking_for_journalism_we_put_thre.php">we tried out a few alleged hangover cure-alls</a>, we asked Dr. Jason Rosenberg, assistant professor of neurology and the director of the Johns Hopkins Headache Center, why drinking so much hurts so bad.</p><blockquote> &quot;You&apos;re basically poisoning yourself when you drink alcohol to excess and there&apos;s not a great antidote for it.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;Nerves that are normally quiet that don&apos;t respond to light, noise, movements, your own heartbeat&#x2014;they get revved up,&quot; says Rosenberg. &quot;They&apos;re firing pain signals, so that you can feel every beat of your heart. Boom. Boom. Boom.&quot; Dr. Rosenberg posits that these nerves are largely responsible for the torture. &quot;Nearby systems kind of get kicked off either reflexively or directly from the alcohol&apos;s toxins that cause nausea.&quot; And what about profuse sweating and piercing hatred of the sun? &quot;A whole variety of reflexes might get kicked up too: light sensitivity, sweating, other non-specific responses.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenberg noted that there wasn&apos;t a whole lot that can be done to immediately alleviate the symptoms of a hangover&#x2014;when you&apos;ve got it, you&apos;ve got it. It&apos;s easier to prevent one, presumably by not drinking as much.</p></blockquote>That said, Dr. Rosenberg says the best thing to do is to drink water, &quot;Know your limits, stay hydrated, eat while you&apos;re drinking. Do it responsibly and make sure you get some sleep.&quot;  Other things to keep in mind: Don&apos;t drink on an empty stomach and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081559/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/30/gwyneth_paltrows_hangover_advice_su.php">don&apos;t go in the steam room</a>.<p></p>
