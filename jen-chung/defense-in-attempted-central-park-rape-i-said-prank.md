<p>Last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208201823/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/30/man_arrested_for_attempted_rape_of_1.php">Saul Alvarez was arrested</a> for allegedly trying to rape a jogger in Central Park. Yesterday, he appeared in court, where prosecutors revealed he told cops after his arrest that he thought it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208201823/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Central-Park-Attempted-Rapist-Prank-Joke-Arrest-Court-Police-217089101.html">was a hilarious joke</a>: &quot;When I first took her down, I said &apos;prank.&apos; I&apos;ve never done this prank in my life. This is the first time ever&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208201823/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/central-park-creep-rape-attempt-prank-article-1.1409307?localLinksEnabled=false">and</a> &quot;her eyes made me think that she had a good sense of humor and she was a good person to play the prank on.&quot;</p>

<p>Cops say that Alvarez, 21, allegedly grabbed a 29-year-old woman running on East Drive near East 106th Street at around 10:45 p.m. June 29, and then put his hand on her mouth and tried to drag her into a wooded area. The victim managed to free herself and a passer-by called 911 after hearing her screams. </p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208201823/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Central-Park-Attempted-Rapist-Prank-Joke-Arrest-Court-Police-217089101.html">court papers note that Alvarez also said</a>, &quot;The only other time that I ever played this prank was on my wife few years ago and that&apos;s how we met,&quot; and revealed other &quot;jokes&quot; he played on people were switching out skateboard wheels with marshmallows and switching coffee with water. </p>

<p>Alvarez has pleaded not guilty. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. <br>
