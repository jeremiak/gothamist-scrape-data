<p>CBS News reporter Lara Logan is speaking out about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080207/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/15/cbs_news_lara_logan_sexually_assaul.php">suffering a &quot;brutal and sustained sexual assault&quot;</a> while covering the fall of Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak in February.  Logan was separated from her crew when a mob of 200 grew unruly; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080207/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/media/29logan.html?ref=media">she told the NY Times</a> that a group of men groped her, tore off her clothes, and beat her, &quot;<strong>For an extended period of time, they raped me with their hands.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_02_laralogan3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080207im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_02_laralogan3.jpg" width="365" height="286" class="image-right"> </span>In an interview that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080207/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/28/60minutes/main20058368.shtml#ixzz1KrJ2fecK">will air on 60 Minutes</a> on Sunday, she tells Scott Pelley, &quot;There was no doubt in my mind that I was in the process of dying. I thought not only am I going to die, but it&apos;s going to be just a torturous death that&apos;s going to go on forever...&quot;  Apparently she was separated from the crew for 25 minutes (one report had suggested that she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080207/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/21/report_lara_logan_was_stripped_punc.php">beaten with flag poles</a>) and she says thinking about her two children inspired her to survive the attack. A group of Egyptian women and soldiers rescued her from the mob, and she was flown out of Egypt the next day.  </p>

<p>CBS News chairman Jeff Fager told the Times, &quot;There&#x2019;s a code of silence about it that I think is in Lara&#x2019;s interest and in our interest to break.&quot;  Logan says she didn&apos;t realize that women suffered so much abuse in Egypt, &quot;I would have paid more attention to it if I had had any sense of it. When women are harassed and subjected to this in society, they&#x2019;re denied an equal place in that society. Public spaces don&#x2019;t belong to them. Men control it. It reaffirms the oppressive role of men in the society.&quot; She said of her attackers, &quot;What really struck me was how merciless they were. They really enjoyed my pain and suffering. It incited them to more violence.&quot; </p>

<p>Logan said she wouldn&apos;t discuss the attack again after the 60 Minute interview is shown, explaining to the Times, &quot;I don&#x2019;t want this to define me.&quot; But she acknowledged that a big part of her recovery was the outpouring of support from colleagues and strangers:</p><blockquote>Among the letters she received, she said, was one from a woman who lives in Canada who was raped in the back of a taxi in Cairo in early February, amid the protests there. &#x201C;That poor woman had to go into the airport begging people to help her,&#x201D; Ms. Logan recalled. When she returned home, &#x201C;her family told her not to talk about it.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Ms. Logan said that as she read the letter, she started to sob. &#x201C;It was a reminder to me of how fortunate I was,&#x201D; she said.</p></blockquote><p></p>
