<p>As the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030116/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/douche_martin_shkreli_arrested.php">wallows in schadenfreude</a> this morning, human piece of garbage/pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli&apos;s arrest for alleged securities fraud raises some important questions. Like whether the Wu Tang Clan put a curse on <em>Once Upon A Time In Shaolin</em>.</p>

<p>The special album was specifically meant to be auctioned off to only one individual, who could do whatever he/she wanted with it, except sell it commercially, though sharing it online would be allowed. After being sold for $2 million, the buyer was unmasked as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030116/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/martin_shkreli_wu_tang_clan.php">none other than Shkreli</a>, who was already infamous for jacking up the price of a drug for AIDS and cancer patients from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill. </p>

<p>It seemed Wu-Tang was trying to keep the buyer&apos;s name under wraps, but when news started to leak RZA gave this statement: &#x201C;The sale of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was agreed upon in May, well before Martin Shkreli&#x2019;s business practices came to light. We decided to give a significant portion of the proceeds to charity.&quot;</p>

<p>Shkreli, 32, then admitted he hadn&apos;t even listened to the album yet and, in an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030116/http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2825/title.martin-shkreli-plans-to-bail-out-bobby-shmurda">published yesterday with HipHopDX</a>, expressed anger at the group:</p><blockquote>This thing [Wu-Tang thing] is starting to get pretty tense. You probably see that increasingly. I&#x2019;m getting pretty frustrated by it. I bought the most expensive album in the history of mankind and fucking RZA is talking shit behind my back and online in plain sight. I&#x2019;m just getting pissed off. That&#x2019;s not the way I do business. If I hand you $2 million, fucking show me some respect. At least have the decency to say nothing or &#x201C;no comment.&#x201D; The guy says &#x201C;&#x2026;before his business practices came to light.&#x201D; What the fuck does that mean? I fucking make money. That&#x2019;s what I do. That&#x2019;s why I can fucking afford a fucking $2 million album. What do you think I do, make cookies? No, motherfucker. I sell drugs. [Laughs] I felt insulted.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The feds say that Shkreli faked gains at his failing hedge fund&#x2014;he allegedly told one investor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030116/https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/677521595552919556">there was $35 million when there was only $700</a>&#x2014;and then raided stock from his next venture, pharmaceutical company Retrophin, to pay back his fund&apos;s investors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030116/http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-securities-fraud/">Bloomberg News points out</a>, &quot;Federal authorities could seize the album and other personal property if they can&#x2019;t otherwise recover his ill-gotten gains.&quot;</p>

<p>If the album is seized it would be part of an ongoing investigation, and thus exempt from FOIA...but hey, it&apos;s worth a shot.</p>
