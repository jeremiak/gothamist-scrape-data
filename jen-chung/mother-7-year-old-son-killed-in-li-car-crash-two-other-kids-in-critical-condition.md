Keri Trinca was driving &quot;on Oceanview Boulevard and as she entered the intersection, she was t-boned by a vehicle heading south on County Road 111,&quot; according to WABC 7.  A nurse who happened to be driving by the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011112308/http://www.newsday.com/mom-son-killed-in-crash-2-kids-critical-1.3231077?cmpid=Breaking">told Newsday</a> it was &quot;the most horrible accident I have seen in my life.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Trinca was killed at the scene, while son Jason was pronounced dead at a hospital; Trica&apos;s 2-year-old and 4-year-old children who were also in the care are also in critical condition. Nurse Taylor Adamo, who was driving home to Riverhead after her shift, told Newsday, &quot;There were no doors. They were busted open, so you could see in.&quot; She saw Trinca&apos;s dead body and the children were &quot;very critical.&quot;  As she helped, a man ran to the wreckage, &quot;<strong>He was screaming, &apos;Someone take me to my children!&apos;</strong>&quot; It turned out that was Trinca&apos;s husband.  Friends and neighbors of the Trincas are devastated; one said, &quot;Keri was a very loving mother. She was always there for her family.&quot;</p>

<p>Charges have not be filed, but the investigation is continuing.  The van&apos;s driver and passenger were taken to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.</p>
