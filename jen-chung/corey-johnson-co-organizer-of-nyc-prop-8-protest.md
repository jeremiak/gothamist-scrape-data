Now Johnson, who works as director of government affairs at a real estate firm, is a gay rights activist who helped coordinate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506055706/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/11/upper_west_side_prop_8_protest_plan.php">tonight&apos;s Proposition 8 protest</a> outside the Mormon Temple of the Church of Latter Day Saints on the Upper West Side. We managed to speak with him as he was getting ready for the protest:</i></p>

<p><b>Apparently thousands are expected at tonight&apos;s protest.  What do you have planned?</b><br>
We can not emphasize enough that this is a peaceful protest. We will not respond to their hatred with hatred. There will be a picket line with signs and chanting and also speeches from community leaders.</p>

<p><b>Can you explain why Proposition 8 is hateful?</b><br>
For the first time, a state Constitution has been amended to take away existing rights -- in this case, the right to marry. And this Prop. victory could invalidate more than 18,000 marriages that have happened in CA since June 17.</p>

<p><b>Why target the Mormon Church, rather than Catholics or other religious groups who oppose Prop 8?</b><br>
The Mormon Church distinguished itself from all other anti-gay groups by getting their congregation to contribute more than $20 million in their campaign of homophobia which resulted in the passage of Prop. 8, thereby doing away with marriage equality for all.</p>
