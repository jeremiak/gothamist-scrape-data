					<p>By 9:30 a.m., enthusiastic New Year&apos;s Eve revelers were already filing into the viewing area pens for tonight&apos;s big Times Square celebration. But with midnight a <em>long</em> way away, how would they cope without being able to use a restroom? &quot;We haven&apos;t been drinking anything for a long time,&quot; a pair of friends confessed.</p>

<p>Anthony, 28, and Ross, 27, who are originally from New Orleans but recently moved to NYC in the past few weeks, were standing at the front of a pen set up between 43rd and 44th Streets. They arrived at 8 a.m. and were planning to stick it out until midnight. If nature calls, Anthony waved an empty Gatorade bottle, &quot;I have this, in case.&quot; </p>

<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809232236/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/nyc_nye_street_closures.php">most of the streets closed</a> and much of the space taken up by the slowly-filling pens, tourists happily snapped photos and selfies with the New Year&apos;s diehards who are determined to ring in 2016 from Times Square. About a million people flock to the &quot;Crossroads of the World&quot; on New Year&apos;s Eve, many of them foreign, like Kiah, 20, and Keely, 20, from Australia, and Cherry, 21, from South Africa.</p>

<p>Asked about their bathroom plan, the women said, &quot;We have supplies.&quot; They arrived yesterday and are staying in Brooklyn&#x2014;and they are leaving the city tomorrow. When asked why they were camped out, with their Australian and South African flags (they asked other revelers for signatures), they exclaimed, &quot;It&apos;s Times Square!&quot; Kiah added that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809232236/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoS7Tlz-lBg"><em>New Year&apos;s Eve</em> the movie</a> was also inspiration.</p>

<p>Ruby, who is visiting New York City for the first time from California, arrived at 6 a.m. to stake out a corner of the pen. She explained, &quot;This is on my bucket list!&quot; And don&apos;t worry, she&apos;ll be fine without bathroom access for 18 hours: &quot;I&apos;m wearing a bunch of pads.&quot;</p>

<p>Then there are the veterans of Times Square New Year&apos;s Eves: Greg Packer arrived in Times Square by 8:30 a.m., after taking the 6:50 a.m. Long Island Rail Road train from Huntington, Long Island. &quot;I&apos;m wearing four sweatshirts and a coat&#x2014;I&apos;m ready,&quot; he enthused. He&apos;s celebrated the new year in Times Square too many times to count (&quot;definitely over 10 times&quot;) and reasoned, &quot;It&apos;s either stand here&quot;&#x2014;noting his prime position right in the center of 43rd Street&#x2014;&quot;or spend $400 at Olive Garden.&quot; Which one will you choose tonight?</p>
