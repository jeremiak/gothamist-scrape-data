Port Authority Executive Director Chris Ward, who just last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053317/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/02/port_authoritys_new.php">released &quot;probabilistic&quot; timelines</a> for various Ground Zero projects, testified in front of the City Council and revealed that the memorial&apos;s plaza wouldn&apos;t open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053317/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/10/06/2008-10-06_port_authority_says_911_memorial_at_grou.html">until late 2012</a>.  And when City Councilman Alan Gerson asked, &quot;Will any part of the site be generally open to the public to simply walk into without prescheduling?&quot; Ward replied it would be &quot;unlikely.&quot;  Maybe by the 15th anniversary, then?</p>
