<p>According to initial reports, an accident that involved three cars also had one car that crashed into a house on Taylor Avenue, right near the Cross Bronx Expressway, in the Parkchester section of the Bronx earlier this morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503193609/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/gallery?section=news&amp;id=8559714&amp;photo=1"> WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;The driver was rescued after becoming pinned in the vehicle.&quot; </p>

<p>Naturally, the Buildings Department is on the way. More photos of the response <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503193609/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/gallery?section=news&amp;id=8559714&amp;photo=1">can be seen at WABC 7</a>.<br>
