The NYPD says that Sgt. Michael Miller and Officer William Reddin checked out a livery cab that had been speeding on Quincy Street in Brooklyn yesterday around 4 a.m.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164214/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/officer_lifesaving_finger_GMYn9RfkP3OWuPe9mpHpWO">Post reports</a>, &quot;When the cops walked up and displayed shields, they noticed a passenger, Eugene Graves, acting suspiciously. Miller, a 13-year veteran of the NYPD, reached toward a bulge at Graves&#x2019; waist and felt a gun beneath his clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>Miller asked Graves to put his hands behind his head, but Graves &quot;violently&quot; struggled and then pulled out the gun and pressed it against Miller&apos;s stomach.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164214/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/09/cop-narrowly-escapes-shooting-during-struggle-over-gun-with-suspect-in-brooklyn/?utm_source=home&amp;utm_medium=dl&amp;utm_campaign=cops-close-call">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;As the suspect tried to shoot, the cop grabbed hold of the gun and jammed his right ring finger between the hammer and cylinder of the gun, keeping it from firing.&quot;</p>

<p>Graves was arrested for attempted murder of a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of a controlled substance and other charges. Miller was treated for a broken finger.</p>
