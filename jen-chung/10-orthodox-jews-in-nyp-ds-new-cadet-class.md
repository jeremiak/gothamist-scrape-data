While many of the cadets say their parents were <i>verklempt</i>, many explain it&apos;s just been a dream (and that they&apos;ll wear their yarmulkes under the police hat).   However, one cadet, Shmuel Tenenbaum said would like to work in an non-Orthodox neighborhood to avoid anyone thinking they can get special treatment, &quot;<strong>If you give a Jewish guy a ticket, it&apos;s very hard. </strong>And then people talk. They could make your life miserable.&quot;  Another worry:  Keeping kosher on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012115634/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/20/nypd_gets_97_re.php">cop&apos;s salary</a>; cadet Max Silva said, &quot;<strong>A burger at McDonald&apos;s costs two or three bucks, but at a kosher place it&apos;s $8.</strong>&quot;  Previously in the Post&apos;s adventures in Jewish cops: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012115634/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/10/from_the_talmud.php">NYPD JEW</a>.</p>
