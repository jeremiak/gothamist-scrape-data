<p>Yay for dog days!  Over the weekend, Times&apos;s Up! held its first annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211034957/http://times-up.org/index.php?page=doggie-pedal-parade">Doggie Pedal Parade</a>, highlighting bicycles adapted to transport pets and the benefits of adopting homeless animals. Bicyclists learned how to pimp their bikes for their pups pets and then humans and canines alike celebrated with a Pupnic at Washington Square Park&apos;s dog run.  </p>
