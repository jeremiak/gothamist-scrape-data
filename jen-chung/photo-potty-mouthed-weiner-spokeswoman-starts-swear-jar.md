<p>A day after her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005753/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/weiners_spokeswoman_trashes_ex-inte.php">profane, &quot;slutbag&quot;-filled takedown</a> of a former intern, Anthony Weiner campaign spokeswoman Barbara Morgan Tweeted this photograph, &quot;Not my best day yesterday. Should&apos;ve known better, been better. Gotta pay up.&quot;</p>

<p>Morgan had been blasting ex-intern Olivia Nuzzi because Nuzzi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005753/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/intern-reveals-reasons-joining-weiner-campaign-article-1.1412272?localLinksEnabled=false">wrote an unflattering account</a> of Weiner&apos;s campaign for the Daily News. Of course, Nuzzi was only an intern for four weeks, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005753/http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/07/top-weiner-aide-trashes-intern.php">Morgan told Talking Points Memo</a> that Nuzzi &quot;sucked... wasn&#x2019;t good at setting up events. She was clearly there because she wanted to be seen,&quot; adding,  &quot;You know what? Fuck you, you little cunt. I&#x2019;m not joking, I am going to sue her.&quot;</p>

<p>Morgan later apologized, stating that she thought the interview was off-the-record (TPM says it definitely wasn&apos;t) and said she apologized to Nuzzi. Today, Nuzzi said:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>As to Barbara Morgan&apos;s apology, of course I accept it.</p>&#x2014; Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005753/https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi/statuses/362541306758701060">July 31, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Not to excuse Morgan&apos;s unhinged rant, but the lady<em> has</em> had to deal with Carlos Danger. And she helped give the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005753/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/meet_cubicle_guy.php">Cubicle Guy</a>!</p>
