<p>The raccoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144424/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/15/upper_east_side_5.php">seen in a tree at East 88th Street and 1st Avenue</a> ultimately died after the police tried to capture it.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144424/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05162008/news/regionalnews/coonskin_capped_111072.htm">Post reports</a> the cops &quot;bungled&quot; the raccoon rescue operation, firing tranquilizer darts &quot;deep in its body.&quot;  </p>

<p>Animal Control said the animal was euthanized because it would have been &quot;difficult, if not impossible, to remove them.&quot;  But some residents told the Post the police were joking about &quot;harpooning&quot; the raccoon.  Linda Elkstrand said, &quot;I just don&apos;t think they handled it as humanely as they could have,&quot; and filed a complaint with the police.  </p>

<p>The NYPD said that there were concerns the raccoon might be rabid.  During a rabies outbreak in 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144424/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/04/staten_islands.php">Staten Islanders were told</a> if they see &quot;cute little raccoon in their backyard, staring at their children as they run around under an afternoon sun, it would be a good idea to pull the kids inside&quot; (a raccoon&apos;s acceptance of daylight could be a sign of rabies).  </p>
