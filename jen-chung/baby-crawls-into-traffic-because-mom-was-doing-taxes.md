<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_taxde.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613192306im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_taxde.jpg" width="160" height="160" class="image-left"> </span>Yes, it&apos;s tax season and everyone&apos;s scrambling before the April 18 deadline. But does that mean you should ignore your baby?  A Staten Island woman was arrested when her 1 1/2-year-old son &quot;was found in a diaper and T-shirt, crawling down the middle of Manor Road near Brielle Avenue at 12:37 p.m. Wednesday,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613192306/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_blotter/nypd_daily_blotter_MrfmVm9XmmLfr5lteqGfgO">the Post reports</a>.</p>

<p>The Post continues, &quot;A good Samaritan scooped up the child, and reportedly had to wait more than 20 minutes before [mother Lauren] Ayala, 21, arrived at the scene looking for her child.&quot; Ayala&apos;s excuse: &quot;I didn&apos;t notice he was missing. I was working on my taxes.&quot;  So, does she still get a child tax credit?</p>
