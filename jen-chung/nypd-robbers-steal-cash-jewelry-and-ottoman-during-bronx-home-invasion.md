<p>The police are looking for a pair of allegedly armed robbers who forced their way into Bronx apartment&#x2014;all with a four-year-old child present. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred around 10:40 p.m. on May 8, inside of 1711 Morris Avenue: &quot;Two individuals followed the 43-year-old male victim to his apartment and forced their way inside after he unlocked the door. One individual displayed a firearm while the other individual displayed a knife, and they demanded money and jewelry. The individuals then used physical force against the victim and his 28-year-old wife, as their 4-year-old son was present.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the items the robbers are accused of taking are cell phones, jewelry, cash and an ottoman. In this surveillance video of the suspects, you can see they struggling with the piece of furniture (you can also see them forcing their way into the apartment):</p>
