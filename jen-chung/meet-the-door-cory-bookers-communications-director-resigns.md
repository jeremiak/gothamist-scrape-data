<p>Sure, Newark Mayor Cory Booker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094447/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/newark_mayor_cory_booker_rescues_wo.php">may save people from burning buildings</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094447/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/16/video_chris_christie_hates_cory_boo.php#photo-1">yuck it up with NJ Governor Chris Christie</a>, but he&apos;s getting schooled in &quot;What Happens When You Go Off Message, 101&quot; after a disastrous Meet the Press appearance, during which he complained about President Obama&apos;s campaign attacking Republican contender Mitt Romney&apos;s stint at Bain Capital.  Booker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094447/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/cory_booker_walks_back_bain_comment.php">walked back his criticism</a>, but not without a casualty: His communications director is resigning, effective today.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094447/http://www.politickernj.com/57232/booker-communications-director-resigns">PolitickerNJ reports</a>, &quot;Sources say her resignation comes amid internal adminstration strife in the aftermath of Booker&apos;s appearance on Meet the Press.&quot;  Booker had referred to both Obama&apos;s and Romney&apos;s campaign ads, &quot;This kind of stuff is nauseating to me on both sides. It&#x2019;s nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright. This stuff has got to stop.&quot;  Booker&apos;s remarks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094447/http://www.thenation.com/blog/167978/et-tu-cory-booker-pathology-false-equivalence">were false equivalency</a> (Jeremiah Wright doesn&apos;t play a part in Obama&apos;s governing philosophies the way Bain Capital does with Romney&apos;s) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094447/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/david-axelrod-scolds-cory-booker-on-bain-capital/2012/05/21/gIQAQbJwfU_blog.html">earned the ire of David Axelrod</a>.</p>

<p>Booker Chief of Staff Mo Butler told Politicker NJ, &quot;It was an amicable decision reached by both Anne Torres and our administration. Anne will continue to be a part of our extended family and we wish her luck in her future pursuits.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe this is why Booker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094447/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/cory_booker_oprah_winfrey.html">can&apos;t imagine himself as president</a>!</p>
