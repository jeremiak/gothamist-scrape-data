</div></div>					<p>This morning, crews officially placed the final pieces of the spire atop 1 World Trade Center&#x2014;making the building the tallest in New York City (and the United States) at 1,776 feet. </p>

<p>Last week, on the second anniversary of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/president_obama_about_to_make_annou.php">Osama bin Laden&apos;s death</a>, the 408-foot spire was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/watch_1_world_trade_center_get_its.php#photo-1">lifted from the ground</a> to the top of 1 WTC. Weather had prevented it from being permanently installed until today. </p>

<p>Steven Plate, who is overseeing WTC construction, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22214960/1-world-trade-center-reaches-new-heights#ixzz2StMWtVQU">told MyFoxNY</a>, &quot;It will give a tremendous indication to people around the entire region, and the world, that we&apos;re back and better than ever.&quot; </p>

<p>While the Port Authority insists that the spire part of the building, some building experts say that if it&apos;s only an antenna, then it&apos;s not truly 1776 feet tall. (A previous design had the spire encased in cladding, which made it less antenna-y and more building-y, but it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/1_world_trade_center_may_not_be_177.php">scrapped due to cost</a>.) </p>

<p>Future tenants in the building, which is slated to open next year, are include the federal General Services Administration, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/03/chinese_firm_to.php">Chinese firm Vantone</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/its_official_conde_nast_will_move_t.php">Conde Nast</a> (whose employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/04/conde_nasties_on_ground_zero_move_i.php">aren&apos;t thrilled about it</a>). There will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105353/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/02/photos_from_the_top_of_one_world_tr.php#photo-1">also be an observatory with stunning views</a>.</p>
