Jonathan Metz was trying to fix the furnace on Sunday when he got stuck.  His calls for help were unanswered and two days later, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326063417/http://www.courant.com/community/west-hartford/hc-west-hartford-stuck-0610-20100610,0,2992626.story">Hartford Courant reports</a>, &quot;He was in and out of consciousness, but Metz, 31, knew what he had to do. He had to cut his arm off.&quot;</p>

<p>A trauma doctor, Dr. Scott Ellner at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326063417/http://www.necn.com/06/10/10/Connecticut-man-trapped-with-arm-in-furn/landing_newengland.html?blockID=250960&amp;feedID=4206">said</a>, &quot;His arm was [decaying] and once that happens you release toxins.  He did mention about the smell and he knew something wasn&apos;t right and that in order to save himself this was going to be the only option.  I don&apos;t think he knew exactly why he had to do this other than just to free himself but it was right thing to do.&quot; Ellner explained, &quot;With tools he had within reach he attempted to amputate his own arm [below the left shoulder]. He nearly did it but not completely.&quot;  The Courant says, &quot;His rescuers had to complete the amputation. Doctors were not able to reattach the limb. They hope he can be fitted with a prosthetic arm.&quot; </p>

<p>Metz was found when a friend, who was worried that Metz hadn&apos;t shown up to a softball game and never showed up for work, stopped by his house on Wednesday. Metz also survived by drinking water that leaked from the furnace. Another doctor said, &quot;It&apos;s inspiring to see someone take their life into their own hands, quite literally.&quot;</p>
