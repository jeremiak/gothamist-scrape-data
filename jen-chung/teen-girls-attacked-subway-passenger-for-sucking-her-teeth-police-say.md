<p>Police are looking for four suspects in an assault that happened at a Bedford-Stuyvesant subway station last month&#x2014;and the beating was allegedly instigated by the victim &quot;sucking her teeth.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred on May 27th at the Utica Avenue A/C station in Brooklyn. Cops said a group of teen girls and the victim, a 21-year-old woman, were all trying to get on the train at the same time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124615/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/teenagers-beat-woman-brooklyn-subway-sucking-teeth-article-1.2669910">According to the Daily News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The victim told police she was getting on the train at the Utica Ave. station about 11:15 a.m. when the four teens ran past her, police sources said.

<p>When one of the girls struck her elbow as they passed the victim sucked her teeth &#x2014; a sign of disrespect in some cultures.</p>

<p>She never said a word but the sound the victim made as she drew in breath through her clenched teeth was enough to set the teens off, cops were told.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The victim was allegedly punched and kicked on the train. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124615/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Girls-Attack-Woman-Subway-A-Train-Brooklyn-382551371.html">At the next station</a>, the teens fled.</p>

<p>Police released images of the suspects:</p>
