<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193304/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/07/6220570/how-long-will-anthony-weiners-trial-balloon-stay">Rumors of Anthony Weiner&apos;s (political) rise</a> are <em>perfect</em> for the slow summer months.  So he&apos;s got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193304/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/14/is_anthony_weiner_still_planning_to.php">millions in leftover campaign funds</a> from his previous mayoral runs.  So he&apos;s aching to run for city-wide office, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193304/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/15/anthony_weiner_has_big_plans_using.php">like mayor or Public Advocate</a>. Now he&apos;s got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193304/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/nyregion/anthony-weiner-longs-for-second-chance-in-politics-friends-say.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">NY Times story</a> about his post-crotch shot chances.</p>

<p>Verdict is that it&apos;s doubtful he&apos;ll be able to really make a campaign last, but, the Times reports, &quot;If nothing else, the buzz showed that Mr. Weiner was still capable of generating chatter in a mayoral field that seems to be solidifying despite its lack of star power.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193304/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/weiner_expose_self_G7B3dNjt1KC8rBNRFuPhGL#ixzz20mtvnarC">continues its Weiner coverage with a story</a> about how his wife (and aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) wants him to do a tell-all Q&amp;A;:</p><blockquote>Sources close to Huma Abedin...tell The Post she has been pushing her husband to do a single interview &#x2014; as Bubba did amid the Monica Lewinsky scandal &#x2014; that would be the final word on the sexting mess that ended Weiner&#x2019;s career in Congress last year.<p></p>

<p>She believes it would clear the air once and for all and allow him to move forward, the sources said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;She wants to figure out how to get all this behind them so they can get back on track, but he&#x2019;s still in denial,&#x201D; said a source close to Abedin.</p></blockquote>Please, someone do that so the logline can be: <em>Weiner, Raw</em>, or <em>Weiner, Up Close &amp; Personal</em>.  <p></p>
