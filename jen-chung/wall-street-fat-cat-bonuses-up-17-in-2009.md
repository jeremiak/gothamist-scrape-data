His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165316/http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/feb10/022310.htm">office press release states</a>, &quot;Total compensation at the largest securities firms grew even faster and industry profits could exceed an unprecedented $55 billion in 2009, nearly three times greater than the previous all-time record. In 2008, the industry lost a record $42.6 billion.&quot;</p>

<p>Some other facts: While Wall Street only accounts for 5% of the jobs in NYC, its wages account for 24% of what&apos;s paid to NYC workers (using 2008 figures); the average taxable bonus rose to $123,850; and &quot;Compensation at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase Investment Bank...increased by 31 percent in 2009. Average compensation rose by 27 percent to more than $340,000.&quot; </p>

<p>DiNapoli said, &quot;Wall Street is vital to New York&#x2019;s economy, and the dollars generated by the industry help the state&#x2019;s bottom line. But for most Americans, these huge bonuses are a bitter pill and hard to comprehend. There&#x2019;s a lot of resentment against the industry over its role in the global economic meltdown. Taxpayers bailed them out, and now they&#x2019;re back making money while many New York families are still struggling to make ends meet.&quot;  He called for firms to engage in less risky behavior and for more regulations.</p>
