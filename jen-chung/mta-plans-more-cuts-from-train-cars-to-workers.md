And that includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174011/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/next_stop_mta_layoffs_PCpxs7BZl5g5JPmzwF0JZL">eliminating 1,000 more workers</a> this year. The Post says this &quot;marks a second wave of layoffs, though this time they&apos;ll be accomplished though attrition and unfilled job vacancies.&quot;  Though there will be $110 million in savings, there will likely be &quot;dirtier subway cars and more graffitied windows, shorter LIRR and Metro-North trains, fewer public-address alerts on platforms and fewer ushers at Grand Central Terminal.&quot;<p></p>

<p>As for the blocking of the station agent layoffs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174011/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/06/2010-05-06_judge_hits_mta_with_restraining_order_barring_layoffs_of_475_token_booth_clerks.html">they have their jobs</a> until at least early next week when the hearing continues.  NYC Transit President Tom Prendergast says it&apos;ll cost the agency $600,000/week to keep the 475 workers.  But TWU Local 100 President John Samuelson said, &quot;Folks in the MTA don&apos;t seem to realize that when they pull these station agents out of the system, riders of New York City trains are in danger,&quot; a sentiment that the Straphanger Campaign&apos;s Gene Russianoff echoed: &quot;Station clerks or the eyes and ears of many subways. Riders are going to be scared at night at subway entrances when there are no human beings around.&quot;</p>
