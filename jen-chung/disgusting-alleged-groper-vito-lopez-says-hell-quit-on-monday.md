<p>Brooklyn Assemblyman Vito Lopez, whose gross <em>alleged</em> sexual harassment of female staffers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143931/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/disgusting_vito_lopez_details_he_ma.php">forcing them to touch his tumor! forcing his hands up their inner thighs!</a> did we mention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143931/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/teen_intern_had_assemblyman_wonderi.php">leering at 14-year-old interns</a>?) had brought even more shame to Albany said yesterday that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143931/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/vito_lopez_resigns_assembly_focuses.php">he&apos;d resign on June 20</a>. But now he tells the Post he&apos;ll leave his position on Monday, to avoid an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143931/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/finally_sheldon_silver_wants_to_off.php">embarrassing expulsion process</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143931/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/gropez_quitting_before_they_expel_K1ojcRMUO38GxLKEVy8oYJ">In a &quot;bitter&quot; interview, Lopez said</a>, &quot;For the sake of my family, for the sake of my close friends and for the sake of my own health, I will resign from the Assembly Monday morning by 10 a.m. Everything will end Monday. I want to make it clear that this is not an admission of wrongdoing on my part,&#x2019;&#x2019; Lopez continued. &#x201C;I have not admitted to wrongdoing, and I do feel I was denied an opportunity for due process in the investigations that took place.&quot;</p>

<p>Lopez, 71, is suffering from cancer and has insisted he didn&apos;t tell staffers to wear short skirts and low cut blouses or ask them to share hotel rooms. In fact, he says the whole investigation was a sham, &quot;I was a member of the Assembly for 29 years, I dedicated my life to it. I would have expected better treatment and the ability to have my issues heard. People should be allowed to have due process of law, and I wasn&#x2019;t allow to.&quot;</p>

<p>Lopez is running for NYC Council, but there&apos;s already a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143931/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/liberal_democrats_want_city_council.php">&quot;molester-free&quot; zone campaign against him</a>.</p>
