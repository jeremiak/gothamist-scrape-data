					<p>Time to set up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307231454/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/22/photos_bill_hillary_clinton_went_to.php">celebration dinner at Roberta&apos;s</a>: Chelsea Clinton had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307231454/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/17/chelsea_clinton_is_pregnant_fueling.php">her baby</a>!</p>

<p>The future presidential candidate is named Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky. Chelsea Clinton announced the news early this morning:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Marc and I are full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.</p>&#x2014; Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307231454/https://twitter.com/ChelseaClinton/status/515720633150619648">September 27, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170307231454js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>She later followed up with:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>At 7:03 PM on September 26th, we finally met Charlotte. We&#x2019;re in love. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307231454/http://t.co/9ZCkoa6BPU">pic.twitter.com/9ZCkoa6BPU</a></p>&#x2014; Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307231454/https://twitter.com/ChelseaClinton/status/515946379559333889">September 27, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Clinton had been active over the past week, participating in her family&apos;s Clinton Global Initiative. On Sunday, former President Bill Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307231454/http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/21/politics/clinton-grandchild-hint/index.html?sr=tw092114clintonbaby4pstorylink">had said</a>, &quot;I hope by the first of October, I&apos;ll be a grandfather.&quot; And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about her grandchild/presidential platform last week. From CNN:</p><blockquote>Now I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about family because you know I&apos;m on &apos;grandbaby watch&apos; and I think a lot about this new member of our family and what he or she can look forward to,&quot; Clinton said at a women&apos;s event Friday.<p></p>

<p>&quot;And I am well aware that we will do everything possible to prepare this child, to protect this child. But I want that for everybody&apos;s child and everybody&apos;s grandchild. I want every one of our children to feel that they are inheriting the best of America, that they have the chance to do what I believed was possible for me and what my husband believed was possible for him and what we instilled in our daughter that really this country is on your side.</p>

<p>&quot;This country will give you the fighting chance, the fair show you deserve to have. This country will give you the level playing field. So whether you&apos;re the grandchild of a president, or the grandchild of a janitor, whether you&apos;re born in a city or in a small rural village -- No matter who you are, you have the right to inherit the American dream.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Chelsea Clinton said she and husband Marc didn&apos;t know the baby&apos;s sex, &quot;There are so few mysteries in life&#x2026; in which any answer is a happy one. My husband and I decided we would enjoy this mystery for, you know, the nine-plus months that we were granted.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>OK, lost my bet that Chelsea would name her baby Ottumwa or Dubuque. But Charlotte is a big city in a swing state.
