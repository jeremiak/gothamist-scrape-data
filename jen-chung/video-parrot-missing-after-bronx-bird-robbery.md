<p>The police are hoping for the public&apos;s help in locating a parrot that was stolen from a Bronx woman and then sold by the robber. To help in the investigation, the NYPD even distributed a photograph of what the bird sorta looks like (see above).</p>

<p>The police say that on Monday afternoon at 3 p.m., a 67-year-old woman was followed into her home at the Morris Housing complex in Tremont when she was followed suspect Darryyl Walker. The woman had been carrying her parrot Cuca and was in the elevator with Walker. At the eleventh floor, Walker, apparently armed, then allegedly followed her into the hall and abducted the parrot.</p>

<p>The victim called 911 and police officers found surveillance video from its &quot;Viper cameras,&quot; which showed Walker at various points of the building and entering another building. </p>

<p>Soon they were able to identify him and arrested him on Tuesday. Walker confessed to robbing the woman of her parrot, but then revealed her sold Cuca. Walker, who is on parole for robbery, was charged with robbery, grand larceny, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. Anyone with information in regards to the whereabouts of the parrot is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
