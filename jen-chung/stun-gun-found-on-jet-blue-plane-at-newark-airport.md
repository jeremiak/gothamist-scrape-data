										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:270px; "> <img alt="2011_07_myfoxny.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170413102205im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_myfoxny.jpg" width="270" height="210"> <br> <i>Via My Fox NY</i></div> Great!  Just over a week after it was revealed that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170413102205/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/30/man_flies_from_jfk_to_la_without_va.php">man without a valid ID</a> (or valid boarding pass) managed to get on a JFK-LA flight, now it&apos;s reported that a stun gun was found in a seat on a Jet Blue plane that landed at Newark Airport on Friday.  My Fox NY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170413102205/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/stun-gun-found-on-board-jet-blue-plane-20110710">&quot;obtained&quot; the Striker 1800 stun gun</a> from sources  who &quot;say they suspect that the stun gun got through screening at Logan Airport in Boston.&quot; This really bodes well for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170413102205/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/06/body_bombs_threat_means_increased_a.php">body bomb screening</a>.<p></p>

<p>Apparently a cleaning crew found the stun gun in a back pocket after the passengers and crew left the plane; the cleaners contacted the Port Authority police and TSA. Jet Blue confirmed the incident to My Fox NY and said it was cooperating. </p>

<p>And for what it&apos;s worth, the family of a man killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks claims that lax security at Logan Airport that day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170413102205/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mass_family_suit_questions_logan_9BziOq11mBFrnD8u8p5G5N">contributed to the tragedy</a>.</p>
