</div></div>					<p>Just now, while James Murdoch was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144239/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/rupert_murdoch_this_is_the_most_hum.php">testifying</a>, a man walked up to Rupert Murdoch and attempted to hit the 80-year-old media mogul in the face with what a CNN producer believes is a &quot;shaving foam pie.&quot;  Murdoch&apos;s 42-year-old wife Wendi jumped up and smacked the attacker on the head while son James stood up.  While Rupert Murdoch&apos;s face was not facing the camera, the CNN producer says the pie did in fact hit Murdoch.</p>

<p>And video with slow-motion:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144239/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/blog/2011/jul/19/phone-hacking-rupert-murdoch-rebekah-brooks-mps">From the Guardian</a>:</p><blockquote>5.01pm: Jane Martinson reports from the hearing: &quot;He was sitting four rows back, calmly walked up with a plate of shaving foam - smacked it in Rupert&apos;s face - Wendi intervened.&quot;<p></p>

<p>4.59pm: Reports claim the assailant is a UK Uncut activist.</p>

<p>4.58pm: The BBC&apos;s Laura Kuenssberg thinks it&apos;s a bandage on the young man&apos;s face - Nick Robinson says it is shaving foam and the young man hit Rupert Murdoch with it.</p>

<p>4.57pm: The suspect looks like he has a substance like white paint on his face.</p>

<p>My colleague Jackie Ashley tells Twitter: &quot;Wendi [Murdoch&apos;s wife] can throw quite a punch.&quot;</p>

<p>4.56pm: The BBC says the young man has been handcuffed. Sky showed the footage again - it seemed to be an attack from Rupert Murdoch&apos;s left.</p></blockquote>Apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144239/http://twitter.com/#!/JonnieMarbles/status/93347191191646210">JonnieMarbles on Twitter</a> is taking credit for the attack.  <p></p>

<p>MP Louise Mensch (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144239/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002641/Strange-case-Tory-MP-Louise-Bagshawes-chick-lit-novel-rock-mogul-dumped-wife--Louise-Bagshawe.html">also writes chick lit</a>) had been questioning the Murdochs; when the session began again, she called Rupert Murdoch brave for managing to continue to answer questions after the horrifying attack.</p>
