<p>Until somebody makes a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020759/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/16/best_law_order_food_tumblr_ever.php#photo-1"><em>Law &amp; Order</em> Food supercut</a>, we&apos;ll have to enjoy this supercut of fake websites featured on <em>Law &amp; Order</em> shows&#x2014;do you have any friends on Faceunion?</p>

<p>Sometimes websites are just used in the investigative process by the cops, while other times websites&#x2014;especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020759/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0629531/">ones involving game-playing</a> or weird pedo-kidnappers&#x2014;can become major plot points. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020759/http://debbiesaslaw.com/">Debbie Saslaw</a> created this fun montage&#x2014;notice how most computer scenes take place in dark rooms:</p>

<p><object width="640" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MG-2zZfLm-U?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020759oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/MG-2zZfLm-U?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></object></p>

<p>Real websites rarely show up, but recently the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020759/http://perezhilton.com/tv/LAW_and_ORDER_SVU_Perez_Hilton_Guest_Stars_On_Rihanna_Chris_Brown_Episode/?id=f8edb1afc98dc&amp;autoplay=true">used real Perez Hilton</a> for its very special SVU episode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020759/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/law_order_svu_introduce_a_very_spec.php">about Chris Brown and Rihanna</a>.
