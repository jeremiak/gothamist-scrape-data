<p>Jennifer Holliday, who won a Tony for originating the role of Effie in <em>Dreamgirls</em> (&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170116172317/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/21/theater/stage-dreamgirls-michael-bennet-s-new-musical-opens.html?pagewanted=all">If the curtain didn&apos;t fall, the audience would probably cheer Jennifer Holliday until dawn</a>&quot;), made waves yesterday when she revealed she would sing at President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration next week. But one day later, she has decided to skip the show, a decision prompted by reading the Daily Beast&apos;s article, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170116172317/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/13/jennifer-holliday-will-perform-at-trump-s-inauguration-which-is-heartbreaking-to-gay-fans.html">Jennifer Holliday Will Perform at Trump&#x2019;s Inauguration, Which Is Heartbreaking to Gay Fans</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, Holliday had explained why she was going to perform, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170116172317/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7655262/jennifer-holliday-donald-trump-inauguration-performance-interview">telling Billboard</a>, &quot;I&apos;m not singing for Donald Trump; I&apos;m singing to welcome the people of America. He cannot be the only face that&apos;s gonna represent us. And just to have all white people up there singing is not going to be a fair representation either. So you&apos;re just saying don&apos;t go? Really? I&apos;m just very disheartened by it that it would be so much hate.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170116172317/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/arts/music/jennifer-holliday-trump-inauguration-performance.html">Holliday also told the Times</a>, &quot;I voted for Mrs. Clinton, and they knew that... if someone wants me to sing a national anthem or something, we think about America, and we go.&quot; </p>

<p>However, her spokesperson later emailed the Times to say, &quot;I just spoke to her and she still hadn&#x2019;t made up her mind about doing the event.&quot; And today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170116172317/http://www.thewrap.com/jennifer-holliday-trump-inauguration-lgbt/">the Wrap offered</a> the news of Holliday&apos;s reversal, with her letter to her LGBT fans:</p><blockquote>TO MY BELOVED LGBT COMMUNITY:<p></p>

<p>Please allow me this opportunity to speak to you directly and to explain why I originally made my decision to perform at the inauguration which was what I had thought would be my simply keeping in my tradition of being a &#x201C;bi-partisan songbird&#x201D; having sung for Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Bush.</p>

<p>I was asked to sing a song for what was presented to me as the &#x201C;Welcome Concert For The People&#x201D;- in my mind I was reflecting on the past times of being asked to sing for presidents and I only focused on the phrase &#x201C;For The People&#x201D;&#x2026; I thought, For America!</p>

<p>I was honestly just thinking that I wanted my voice to be a healing and unifying force for hope through music to help our deeply polarized country&#x2026; Regretfully, I did not take into consideration that my performing for the concert would actually instead be taken as a political act against my own personal beliefs and be mistaken for support of Donald Trump and Mike Pence.</p>

<p>In light of the information pointed out to me via the Daily Beast article on yesterday, my only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!</p>

<p>I sincerely apologize for my lapse of judgement, for being uneducated on the issues that affect every American at this crucial time in history and for causing such dismay and heartbreak to my fans.</p>

<p>Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you&#x2026; You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.</p>

<p>Thank you for communicating with me, I had no idea that I still meant so much to all of you.</p>

<p>Thank you for your posted comments both the good supportive ones as well as the ugly hurtful ones.</p>

<p>With LOVE &amp; Appreciation,</p>

<p>JENNIFER  HOLIDAY<br>
