					<p>A 17-year veteran of the NYC Fire Department was killed after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/bronx_explosion.php">a home in the Bronx exploded yesterday morning</a>. Battalion Chief Michael Fahy and other firefighters were at the Kingsbridge two-story dwelling, investigating a call about a possible gas leak and discovered what seemed like a drug lab or grow house. While waiting outside for Con Ed and the police, the home exploded, and Fahy was struck with flying debris.</p>

<p>&quot;A tragedy that has befallen the family, our Fire Department, and our entire City,&quot; Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference. He said that he, FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro and NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill &quot;spent time with [Fahy&apos;s] wife and with his parents here at the hospital and saw the unspeakable pain when they were told formally they had lost Michael. It is a reminder of the dangers that our first responders face every day, the dangers that the men and women of the FDNY face and the bravery with which they do their job.&quot;</p>

<p>Firefighters arrived at 304 West 234th Street at 6:22 a.m. after receiving a call about a gas odor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/http://nypost.com/2016/09/27/firefighters-respond-to-reported-house-explosion-in-the-bronx/">From the Post</a>:</p><blockquote>But when firefighters entered the house, they found what appeared to be a homemade drug laboratory inside a dark room, and immediately requested police, according to sources.<p></p>

<p>They also heard a hissing noise on the property, suggesting there had been a break in the gas line, law enforcement sources said. Firefighters opened up windows in the home, which smelled heavily of gas.</p>

<p>Cops and firefighters were waiting outside for a Con Ed crew to arrive after they evacuated the house when it blew up, sending a large piece of the roof flying into the air and landing on Fahy. He was rushed to a hospital in a police car after firefighters removed the debris, a source said.</p></blockquote>This video shows firefighters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/https://twitter.com/MarcusSolis7/status/780829930254954496/video/1">trying to get Fahy help</a>:<p></p>

<p>The explosion rocked the neighborhood, and the entire second floor of the house was destroyed. NYPD Commissioner O&apos;Neill said yesterday, &quot;We had a couple of weeks ago - we had information we received, and we were in the initial stages of an investigation on that block. So that&#x2019;s going to be part of the ongoing investigation as a possible drug lab, as a possible [marijuana] grow house.&quot; </p>

<p>A person of interest, Julio Salcedo, 34, was taken into custody yesterday, after a manhunt that led authorities to Cliffside Park, NJ. He apparently rented the home, and was &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/http://pix11.com/2016/09/27/man-in-custody-in-connection-to-deadly-explosion-at-alleged-grow-house-in-the-bronx/">spotted on surveillance video leaving the home Tuesday morning before the explosion</a>.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/explosion-rocks-bronx-home-cops-suspect-drug-lab-article-1.2808271">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;A neighbor said the current renters, unlike past years when Manhattan College students lived there, were low-key and drove high-end vehicles like Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs.&quot; Mike Garcia said, &quot;This definitely wasn&#x2019;t college students. We didn&#x2019;t hear any commotion or see any people. We thought it was shady.&quot;</p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160927/kingsbridge/explosion-home-gas-leak-fdny">DNAinfo reports</a>, &quot;Investigators believe that the operators of the marijuana grow house illegally tapped into the building&apos;s gas line to avoid running up large gas bills beyond that of a normal household, and trigger suspicions.&quot;</p>

<p>An emotional FDNY Commissioner Nigro called Fahy, 44, &quot;one of our rising stars... He was on the rise. He was a star, a brave man... It&#x2019;s not just a loss - it&#x2019;s a terrible loss for the family, for the Fahy family. It&#x2019;s a loss for the Fire Department family. We are a family. We feel it deeply. We feel it deeply today.&quot; </p>

<p>Fahy was married and had three kids, ages 6, 8 and 11. A Saturday funeral <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2016/09/28/fdny-chief-michael-fahy-funeral/91210984/">will be held in Yonkers</a>. The mayor ordered that city flags fly at half-staff until Fahy&apos;s interment, &quot;as a mark of respect for the memory of FDNY Battalion Chief Michael J. Fahy, who lost his life today in the line of duty.&quot; </p>

<p>Donations are also being taken for Fahy&apos;s family&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090855/https://www.fdnyfoundation.org/donate/">go to FDNY Foundation and select</a> &quot;Chief Michael J. Fahy&apos;s Children Educational Fund.&quot;</p>
