<p>Citi Field, home of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031611/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/duh_mr_met_is_the_consensus_best_ma.php">best mascot in sports</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031611/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/mets_settles_claims_from_madoff_tru.php">financial woes</a>, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031611/http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings/_/group/5">better-than-expected</a> (so far!) team, will host the All-Star Game next year.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031611/http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/mets-to-host-2013-all-star-game-at-citi-field/">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;The Mets were expected to be awarded the game after the Yankees hosted the Midsummer Classic in 2008, the last year the old Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium were open. This will be the second time the Mets will host the game; the first was in 1964, the year Shea Stadium opened. The announcement will be made at City Hall at 11:30 a.m. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected to attend, along with the Mets&#x2019; principal owner, Fred Wilpon, and Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball.&quot;</p>

<p>All-Star festivities are not limited to the game&#x2014;there are red carpet events, parades, FanFest (in Kansas City this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517031611/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/events/all_star/y2012/">there&apos;s a 5K</a>)&#x2014;so there&apos;s plenty to plan.  The Times adds, &quot;Talks with the city have been going on for some time, the person involved said, and the Mets&#x2019; financial woes and court battles were not a factor.&quot; And no matter how the Mets are doing, they&apos;re guaranteed to have at least one All-Star.&quot;</p>
