<p>Here&apos;s one baby with a lot of baggage:  Jordan Zane Weiner was born to former Congressman Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin yesterday.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081435/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/anthony_we_have_weiner_dqeIgPjh2RVMOL68eVCetJ">Post reports</a> that the baby was born &quot;10 days before the New Year&#x2019;s Eve due date&quot; and he &quot;checked in at just over 7 pounds, a source said.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081435/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/anthony_weiners_wife_huma_abedin_is.php">pregnancy of Abedin</a>, who is Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&apos;s top aide (Clinton was at the baby shower last week), added another twist to Weiner&apos;s social networking scandal, which involved him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081435/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/crying_weiner_admits_to_sending_exp.php">having sexy online relationships with numerous women</a> and sharing photographs of his genitals. Weiner, who was positioning himself to run for mayor in 2013, made the mistake of<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081435/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php"> sharing a crotch photograph on Twitter publicly</a> when he apparently meant to direct message it to a young female fan.  The Democrat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081435/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">eventually resigned in disgrace</a>.</p>

<p>Abedin has not said anything publicly (she never appeared at her husband&apos;s press conference) but tabloid reports suggested she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081435/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/18/post_weiners_wife_feels_trapped_in.php">would have left him</a> if not for the pregnancy.  </p>
