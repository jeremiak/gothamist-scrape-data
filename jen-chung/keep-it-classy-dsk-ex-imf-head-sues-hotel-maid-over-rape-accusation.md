<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="070211LEPERV.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_chrisrobbins/070211LEPERV.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Strauss-Kahn flashes a smile after his release yesterday. (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Aww, two weeks after a judge ruled that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/01/hotel_maids_civil_case_against_domi.php">could not claim diplomatic immunity in a civil lawsuit</a>, Dominique Strauss-Kahn has filed a counter lawsuit against the hotel maid who claims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/imf_head_to_plead_not_guilty_to_sex.php#photo-1">he raped her a year ago</a>. Strauss-Kahn, who resigned from his position at the International Monetary Fund during the scandal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/dsk-countersues-maid-accuses-rape-article-1.1078500">wants at least $1 million in damages</a> from  Nafissatou Diallo for &quot;knowingly and intentionally making a false report&quot; that ruined his &quot;professional and personal reputation ... throughout the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn is also unhappy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/hotel_maid_ids_imf_head_as_her_atta.php">with his SVU treatment</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/dsk_maid_is_served_Kg5O8gMqFUErmLCZHEvDHO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Bronx">his countersuit says</a>, &quot;Mr. Strauss-Kahn also was paraded in front of international media in handcuffs as part of a &#x2018;perp walk&#x2019; intended to humiliate him, even though he committed no crime.&quot; Hello, that&apos;s Law &amp; Order 101!</p>

<p>Diallo, a maid at the Times Square Sofitel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/14/imf_head_arrested_at_jfk_accused_of.php">accused Strauss-Kahn</a> of trying to rape her and forcing her to perform oral sex on him in his suite.  Strauss-Kahn was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/imf_head_to_plead_not_guilty_to_sex.php">removed from an Air France flight back to Paris</a>, arrested, perp-walked to the Special Victims Unit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/imf_heads_perp_walk_horrifies_the_f.php">birthing an international incident</a>.  The case eventually fell apart, because Diallo allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/30/report_authorities_suspect_dominiqu.php">had some inconsistencies in her story</a>, but Diallo has pressed on with a civil case, claiming a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/09/dsk_plans_to_defend_himself_from_ho.php"> &quot;violent, sadistic attack&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn&apos;s lawyer William Taylor said, &quot;It should come as no surprise that Mr. Strauss-Kahn is asserting claims against Ms. Diallo for her false allegations against him. She is directly responsible for his being arrested, imprisoned and subjected to extraordinary pain, anguish and expense. Her conduct is not without consequence for her and he is not required to simply endure what she did and her effort to profit for herself without fighting back.&quot;  Next question: Will he sue Belgian prostitutes who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005148/http://dcist.com/2012/05/former_imf_bank_chief_dominique_s.php">claim he raped them at a DC party in 2010</a>?</p>
