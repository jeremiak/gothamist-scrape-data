<p>Jerry Seinfeld was on Andy Cohen&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424223448/http://www.bravotv.com/watch-what-happens-live/season-6">Watch What Happens Live</a> last night where he revealed the longest he&apos;s been the master of his domain and how the actresses who played his many girlfriends had terrible breath.  But the biggest secret the comedian let out was how he really hated the episode &quot;The Alternate Side,&quot; because it involved a stroke victim (Elaine&apos;s 66-year-old boyfriend) whom the gang ended up feeding while he was infirm on a couch.</p>

<p>Seinfeld said, &quot;It was an older guy and we were feeding him on the couch... and I felt very uncomfortable with that episode... It was weird, he was in a wheelchair. It was uncomfortable.&quot; That&apos;s uncomfortable, but having an old immigrant die because Elaine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424223448/http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/ThePonyRemark.htm">mentioned she hated people with ponies</a> isn&apos;t? And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424223448/http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheRye.htm">stealing bread from old ladies is okay</a>?</p>

<p>Let&apos;s keep in mind that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424223448/http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheAlternateSide.htm">&quot;The Alternate Side&quot;</a> is the episode that spawned the infamous B-plot of Kramer getting a bit part in a Woody Allen film (when Elaine asks if Mia Farrow was there, Kramer says, &quot;Didn&apos;t see him&quot;) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424223448/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_o4Nvmr_M">with the line &quot;These pretzels are making me thirsty!&quot;</a>.  George, unemployed and in the middle of the stressful temporary job of moving cars for alternate side of the street parking, offers a tortured line reading that is deemed terrible, but George says, &quot;What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! <strong>Maybe he&apos;s been in the bar a really long time and he&apos;s really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he&apos;s parking cars for a living!</strong>&quot;  That episode was written by Bill Masters and Larry David&#x2014;no hugging, no learning!</p>
