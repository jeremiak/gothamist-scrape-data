<p>Jon Stewart crashed The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last night to continue rallying support for the Zadroga Act. However, Colbert felt that Stewart&apos;s heartfelt plea was &quot;borrriiiinnngggg&quot; and recommended a foolproof way for Americans to pay attention: Trump It up, by wearing a hideous sick-pee yellow wig and Cheeto dust for demagogue skin color. </p>

<p>The former Daily Show host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914063442/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/jon_stewart_zadroga_911.php">returned to his old show earlier this week</a> to slam the Republican-controlled Congress for not acting on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914063442/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/republicans_keep_stalling_health_ca.php">the about-to-expire</a> bill, which provides healthcare funding and compensation for 9/11 first responders and their families, with a heart wrenching look at the toll the responders have faced since 2001. But on The Late Show, Stewart gamely become the clown who is the leading Republican candidate for President:</p>

<p>&quot;These 9/11 first responders, let me tell you something, these 9/11 first responders are most top-notch, first-class, diamond-encrusted heroes America can produce!&quot; Stewart bellowed, angrily shaking his body (because The Donald equals America&apos;s untapped rage). &quot;Don&apos;t let Congress play politics with this necessary bill. If I&apos;m elected&#x2014;and I will be elected&#x2014;I will build a wall around politics and I will make politics pay for it.&quot;</p>

<p>He added, &quot;Tweet at your Congressman with #WorstResponders. Tell them Donald told them to pull up their big boy pants and help make America great again and pass the Zadroga Act or I will glue Congress together, dip them in gold and wear them around my friggin&apos; neck. Classy! Fantastic!&quot;</p>

<p>The Zadroga Act will be included in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914063442/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/house-include-zadroga-renewal-omnibus-spending-bill-article-1.2461325">next week&apos;s House omnibus bill</a>. Rep. Dan Donovan, the Republican Congressman from Staten island, told the Daily News, &quot;Speaker Ryan told me this morning that the Zadroga Act, which funds health screenings and treatments for 9/11 first responders, is in the large spending bill that will pass next week.  We spent months fighting side-by-side with American heroes &#x2014; with men and women who shouldn&apos;t have to shoulder this burden because they are already fighting for their lives &#x2014; to make our case. I&apos;ve said all along that on the merits, we will win.&quot;</p>
