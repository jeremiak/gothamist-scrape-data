<p>While you may salivating for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014112/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/27/dennys_nyc_photos.php#photo-1">new, fancy Financial District Denny&apos;s</a>, this whale was getting down to business in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014112/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Bight">New York Bight.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014112/http://www.wcs.org/">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> took this photograph of a humpback whale feeding on fish about six miles away. According to the WCS, &quot;Waters off New York City and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014112/https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+York%2FNew+Jersey+Bight/@39.9471558,-73.3352991,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89ea04529f7e20d1:0x387e5a374cc0eb98">greater New York Bight</a> serve as a feeding ground, nursery, and migratory corridor for many species of marine life including whales, dolphins, sharks, fish, and sea birds. WCS&#x2019;s New York Seascape program works to restore healthy populations of these species and protect New York marine waters, which are vital to wildlife and key to the area&#x2019;s economic and cultural vitality.&quot;</p>

But it didn&apos;t lunge. It spy hopped, which means it kicked its tail and stood there for a second, and I rattled off a whole bunch of shots, and I got a shot!&quot;</p>
