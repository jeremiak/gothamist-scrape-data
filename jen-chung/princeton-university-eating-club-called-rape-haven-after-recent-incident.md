<p>A student eating club at Princeton has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108062907/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/nyregion/princeton-eating-club-ousts-2-officers-over-emails-ridiculing-women.html?_r=0">kicked out two top club members after a series of awful incidents</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108062907/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/nyregion/princeton-eating-club-ousts-2-officers-over-emails-ridiculing-women.html?_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, not only did the Tiger Inn&apos;s treasurer email the listserv to disrupt a female alumna&apos;s event&#x2014;&quot;Looking for someone to blame for the influx of girls? Come tomorrow and help boo Sally Frank&quot;&#x2014;the club&apos;s vice president sent a photograph that &quot;showed a woman engaged in a sex act with a man in one of the public spaces of the club... accompanied by a crude joke and a reference to the woman as an &apos;Asian chick.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The e-mail with the sexually explicit photograph was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108062907/http://planetprinceton.com/2014/11/04/more-trouble-for-private-eating-club-at-princeton-university-school-police-investigating-allegations-student-distributed-photo-of-freshman-performing-sex-act-at-party/">made public by Planet Princeton last month</a>:</p><blockquote>By some accounts, a party at the Tiger Inn last month got out of control.<p></p>

<p>An intoxicated first-year female student at Princeton University allegedly began performing oral sex on a senior on the dance floor at the private eating club, and someone allegedly snapped a photo of the act.</p>

<p>An officer of the private eating club later allegedly distributed the photo to Tiger Inn members via email, some students claim...</p>

<p>Under New Jersey law, the distribution of a photo of a sex act without the person&#x2019;s consent is a criminal offense. A person commits a crime in the third degree if the person photographs, films, videotapes, records, or otherwise reproduces in any manner the image of another person whose intimate parts are exposed or who is engaged in an act of sexual penetration or sexual contact without that person&#x2019;s consent, and under circumstances in which a reasonable person would not expect to be observed.</p>

<p>It is also a third degree crime to disclose any photograph, film, videotape, recording or any other reproduction of the image of another person whose intimate parts are exposed, or who is engaged in an act of sexual penetration or sexual contact, unless that person has consented to such disclosure, regardless of whether the image was made legally.</p></blockquote>Planet Princeton also points out that Tiger Inn&apos;s reputation is as Princeton&apos;s &quot;animal house.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Someone spray-painted the words &quot;Rape Haven&quot; on the club&apos;s stone fence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108062907/http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/11/tiger-inn-graduate-board-chair-condemns-club-culture-in-email-to-membership/">after the email incident was reported</a>. Then Hap Cooper, 1982 graduate and president of the club&apos;s graduate membership, sent an email to members, &quot;There is a culture re-emerging at TI that makes some of our members feel unsafe. We went <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108062907/http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2006/04/a-reformed-tiger-inn-opens-its-doors-again/">down this road a decade ago</a>&#x2026;and it didn&#x2019;t end well. We WILL NOT [sic] go down this road again. All behavior or communication that makes other members feel disrespected, uncomfortable or unsafe must stop now. Future violations will be grounds for termination.&quot; </p>

<p>Adam Krop, the Tiger Inn&apos;s vice president who allegedly sent the photographs, and Andrew Hoffenberg, the treasurer who criticized Sally Frank (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108062907/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/04/nyregion/court-tells-princeton-clubs-they-must-admit-women.html">who successfully sued to get the eating clubs</a> to allow female members) were asked to step down for their &quot;offensive, disrespectful&quot; actions. Princeton police say that no victim or witnesses have come forward about the photograph.</p>
