<p>A man was randomly slashed in the face while walking in East Village on Saturday afternoon. The victim said his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-slashed-face-east-village-recalls-random-attack-article-1.2501063">attacker threw him against a wall and said,</a> &quot;F--- off! I&#x2019;m sick of this s--t!&quot;</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred around 4:30 p.m. on January 16th: &quot;The victim was assaulted by an unknown male as he walked on East 6 Street. The male knocked the victim to the ground and cut him with an unknown object. The victim suffered a large laceration to the right side of his face and a small laceration to his back.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim, Anthony Christopher-Smith, needed 150 stitches for the six-inch cut along the right side of his jaw. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/01/18/east-village-slashing/">He told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;I had my earbuds on. I wasn&#x2019;t listening. I was playing on my phone and walking ahead... And someone - probably from behind - just shoved me against the wall, and cursed, and you know, I kind of fall to the ground. I&#x2019;m looking up to see who it was. It looked like an Asian gentleman. He looked like he had a razor or something in his hand, and then he just went off. He didn&#x2019;t even really run. And as I got up, I realized I was bleeding all over.&quot;</p>

<p>Smith described the slasher as being &quot;deranged.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Man-Pushed-Slashed-In-East-Village-Attack-Police--365613221.html">He added</a>, &quot;I couldn&apos;t call 911 because there was so much blood everywhere. My hands were covered, my phone was covered.&quot; </p>

<p>Police describe the suspect as an Asian male, 20-30 years old, 5&apos;6&quot; and 150 pounds, wearing a black waist length jacket, black skull cap, black pants and brown boots.</p>

<p>Now Smith&apos;s face is partially paralyzed. The social worker who lives in Newark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://abc7ny.com/news/victim-in-east-village-slashing-speaks-out;-police-looking-for-suspect/1164170/">said that doctors</a> &quot;say I&apos;ll be able to smile again fully in six to nine months. So I&apos;m hopeful for that. I won&apos;t be able to feel my lower right ear lobe but that is a small price to pay.&quot;</p>

The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.

<p>Earlier this month, a woman walking in Chelsea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/chelsea_slashing_arrest.php">was randomly cut in the face</a> while in December, a student was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/16/16-yr-old_girl_viciously_slashed_in.php">slashed while walking to school</a>. In November, writer David Henry Hwang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154129/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/05/fort_greene_stabbing_hwang.php">was slashed in the neck</a> in a seemingly random attack while walking in Fort Greene.</p>
