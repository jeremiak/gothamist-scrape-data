My body and mind were in complete shock - but as I ran towards the scene I called 911. The man was alive, thank goodness and screaming - &quot;Please lift it, my back my back&quot;. In the meantime, 911 was dispatching an ambulance, but was completely unsure as to where Main Street on Roosevelt Island was located. After giving an address of 455 Main Street, the operator assured me that they were on the way. FDNY was first on the scene and moved quickly and efficiently to free the man from under the van. And, he was then whisked into the FDNY ambulance. I am wishing all the people involved in this incident well - it was truly traumatic.</blockquote>Roosevelt Island Public Safety Department Keith Guerra said, &quot; The victim and his wheelchair were wedged under the front wheel axle of the Mini-Bus. Members from PSD, FDNY and NYPD responded to the scene. The victim was extricated by the NYPD Emergency Service Unit and transported in an FDNY EMS Ambulance to the Cornell University Medical Center in Manhattan. He is awaiting surgery and is expected to recover from his injuries.&quot;  <p></p>
