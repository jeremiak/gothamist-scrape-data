There were so many on line, in fact, that the four day pop-up cafe was forced to turn away hundreds of hopefuls. But some lucky cat-lovers returning today will be whisked past the long lines thanks to an exclusive <em>Cat Cafe VIP Pass</em>. It&apos;s like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221916/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/was_extra_mooga_worth_250.php">Extra Meowga</a>!</p>

<p>A tipster named Jia gave us the scoop: &quot;People who were still in line when the cafe closed (the closest 100 I think, there was a cutoff point) got these VIP Frequent Visitor Cards. It allows the card holder to access the cat cafe in a separate line, with more priority than the regular line.&quot; We&apos;re trying to get a handle on what other purrks are offered&#x2014;more quality time with any of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221916/http://www.animalleague.org/events-news/events/purina-cat-cafe.html">16 adorable and immensely adoptable kittens</a>? A couple grams of primo catnip?</p>

<p>While a free coffee or espresso drink plus a free pastry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221916/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/24/cats_tiny_cats_omg_i_want_1o_cats_o.php">is available</a>, cat caf&#xE9; patrons seemed to be more interested in communing with the creatures. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221916/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/cat-cafe-place-new-yorkers-paws-relax-article-1.1767643">Daily News spoke to one excited attendee</a>: </p><blockquote>Feline fanatic Dennis Cote, 30, pounced at the opportunity to spend the morning with cats, commuting in two hours from his home in Farmington, Conn., to play with the shop&apos;s 16 fuzzy felines.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I have three cats at home already,&quot; said Cote, who works as a Starbucks barista. &quot;My parents said don&apos;t come back with a fourth.&quot;</p></blockquote>Meanwhile, some impatient Cat Cafe patrons are conspiring to create their own alt DIY pussycat lounge:<p></p>
