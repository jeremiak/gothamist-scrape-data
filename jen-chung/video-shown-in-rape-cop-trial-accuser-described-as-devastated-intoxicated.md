The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/st_look_for_rape_jurors_ZUIX3H1dpSuDBKCNlKUFuJ">Post reports</a>, &quot;The bulk of the video is hugely incriminating, showing accused rapist Officer Kenneth Moreno and accused lookout Officer Franklin Mata making three return trips to the drunken woman&apos;s apartment over the course of five hours,&quot; but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/nyregion/08rape.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">NY Times notes</a>, &quot;The woman briskly bounds toward a door, making a brief half-turn and gesturing to the police officer just behind her. A few steps back, another officer follows.&quot;  </p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/29/cops_accused_of_raping_woman_plead.php">December 2008</a>, the woman had been celebrating a promotion at Southpaw in Brooklyn and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/witnesses_woman_allegedly_raped_by.php">was assisted into a taxi back to Manhattan</a>; she threw up twice in her cab and the driver called 911 for help. The defense, which denies that Moreno raped her (he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/cop_didnt_rape_woman_merely_succume.php">allegedly just kissed her shoulder</a>), hopes to prove that the accuser was not that drunk because she is seen in the video walking without assistance, but a man Andom Mangum who was visiting her building testified, &quot;She seemed intoxicated [due to] her appearance. The way she&apos;s walking. The way her heels sounded. Her heels were sliding on the floor, on the marble. Her hair was in her face.&quot; Mangum did admit she was able to walk up the stairs by herself.</p>

<p>The woman&apos;s friend and boss Julie Kreling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/07/2011-04-07_manhattan_woman_told_me_she_was_raped_by_nypd_cop_her_boss_testifies.html">also testified that she got a call the day</a> after the alleged rape, called her &quot;devastated,&quot; and explaining, &quot;She was extremely broken down and emotional and crying. She said she had been raped and it was a cop. She was still very much in a state of shock.&quot; Moreno&apos;s lawyer asked Kreling if the accuser said, &quot;I can&apos;t believe he left me like that,&quot; which Kreling confirmed, &quot;She said that multiple times. <strong>She was in a very vulnerable state and [was] left as somebody who was hurt.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Kreling went to the hospital where the woman was and it was decided the police would not be called: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/07/alleged-victims-boss-testifies-in-rape-trial-of-nypd-officers-moreno-mata/">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The now 27-year-old woman, worrying that if she called 911 the officers would find out, instead reported the incident to the Manhattan District Attorney&#x2019;s office.&quot; As part of the investigation, the woman confronted Moreno after the alleged incident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/incriminating_tape_allowed_in_east.php">getting him to admit</a> on her secret recording, &quot;Yes, I did [wear a condom]. You don&#x2019;t have to worry about any diseases or getting pregnant,&quot; but the defense claims Moreno said that so she wouldn&apos;t make a scene at the precinct. The woman, who moved to San Francisco, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140313/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110407/lower-east-side-east-village/video-shows-alleged-victim-of-rape-cops-walked-into-apartment-unassisted">expected to testify on Monday</a>.</p>
