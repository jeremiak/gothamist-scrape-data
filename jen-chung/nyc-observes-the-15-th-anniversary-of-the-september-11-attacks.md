<p>Today, New York City honors the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011520/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks">thousands of people killed</a> in NYC on September 11, 2001; the victims who died in a crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania that day; the victims in the simultaneous attack at the Pentagon; and the six victims from the first World Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993. The total number of victims from all of those combined attacks numbers 2,983. </p>

<p>At the ceremony at the 9/11 Memorial plaza today&#x2014;which is open to family of victims&#x2014;there are six moments of silence: Two for when the planes hit the towers, two for when each tower fell, one for the attack on the Pentagon and one for Flight 93, which crashed in Shanksville. </p>
