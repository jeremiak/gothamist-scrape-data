</div></div><p>Governor Andrew Cuomo and his girlfriend, lifestyle guru Sandra Lee, joined hundreds of volunteers who gathered upstate to help communities devastated by Hurricane Irene yesterday.  It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110906005042/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/02/cuomo_be_a_good_neighbor_and_help_w.php">part of the NY State &quot;Labor For Your Neighbor&quot; Labor Day weekend volunteering push</a>, which the governor announced last Friday.  According to his office, over 2,000 New Yorkers volunteered, and Cuomo said, &quot;I am proud to be out here today with hundreds of my fellow New Yorkers to help first-hand in the cleanup and recovery efforts after Hurricane Irene. The response to our &apos;Labor for Your Neighbor&apos; program has been overwhelming, but to me it is not surprising. New Yorkers are always ready to lend a hand to help someone in need. In our darkest hours New Yorkers shine the brightest -- and the proof of that can be seen all across New York today.&quot;</p>

<p>Cuomo and Lee were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110906005042/http://www.wbng.com/news/local/Governor-Cuomo-Joins-The-Clean-Up-Crew-129236433.html">working in Margaretville to clean up debris</a>.  His office released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110906005042/http://www.flickr.com/photos/governorandrewcuomo/sets/72157627592946448/with/6113132347/">photographs of him and Lee cleaning basements, roads and more</a>.  </p>
