</div></div>					<p>If it&apos;s almost Halloween, it means it&apos;s time for pups to wear costumes with pride (and maybe a little adorable shame) for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012419/http://www.fortgreenepups.org/site_2009/php/fgp.php?page=news&amp;item=upcoming">16th Annual Great PUPkin</a>, which takes place tomorrow (Saturday, October 26th) at Fort Greene Park. Registration, which has a $5 donation, starts at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Last year, I had the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012419/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/28/photos_sharknado_falcor_edward_scis.php">pleasure of being one of the Great PUPkin judges</a>, and here are some of my observations from the experience:</p><blockquote><strong>Not all dog costumes are created equal:</strong> Store-bought costumes are fine, but when you see them at a dog costume contest, they don&apos;t really compare to someone&apos;s recreation of the Up house &#x2014;complete with helium balloons&#x2014;worn by an adorable pitbull. Then he had a friend dressed as Carl! Then there was a dog dressed as a topiary&#x2014;and his humans were a cheerleader and Edward Scissorhands!<p></p>

<p><strong>You don&apos;t even really need a costume:</strong> I loved the dog whose owner used make-up to make her pup look like Frankenstein, really, Frankenweenie.</p>

<p><strong>I love props!</strong> It helps to have a huge &quot;Neverending Story&quot; book to accompany your Falcor dog.</p>

<p><strong>I love puns!</strong> No, it&apos;s not Doctor Who&#x2014;it&apos;s Doctor Boo! There was also Pup Francis, the People&apos;s Pup.</p>

<p><strong>Humiliating the humans means points:</strong> To the dude who went shirtless as he carried his luau pu-pu platter dog, God bless you. To the dude dressed as a sheriff and let his Bob Marley dog &quot;shoot&quot; him so he fell on the ground, good work! To the lady who wore an insane Sharknado contraption on her body, that&apos;s definitely part of why we gave you first place. (Also, your partner&apos;s arm was missing and the &quot;sharks&quot;/dogs had bloody limbs in their mouths.)</p>

<p><strong>Timeliness counts</strong>: There were Banksy and government shutdown dogs. However, I was disappointed by the lack of CitiBike dogs (CitiBark?).</p>

<p><strong>Bribes for the judges are appreciated.</strong> That meth from the Barking Bad crew was great.</p></blockquote>For timeliness, we expect some dogs in hazmat suits&#x2014;or at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012419/http://dcist.com/2014/10/photos_the_secret_service_agents_wh.php">least some brave Secret Service dogs</a>. <p></p>
