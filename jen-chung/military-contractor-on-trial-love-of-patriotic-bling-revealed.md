The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144209/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/nyregion/27fraud.html?ref=us">NY Times reports</a> from the trial, being held at a district court on Long Island,  &quot;DHB, which specialized in making body armor used by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan, paid for more than $6 million in personal expenses on behalf of Mr. Brooks, covering items as expensive as luxury cars and as prosaic as party invitations, Ms. Schlegel testified. <strong>Also included were university textbooks for his daughter, pornographic videos for his son, plastic surgery for his wife, a burial plot for his mother, prostitutes for his employees, and, for him, a $100,000 American-flag belt buckle encrusted with rubies, sapphires and diamonds.</strong>&quot; </p>
