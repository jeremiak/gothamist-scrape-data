                            <p>After being disqualified for misspelling German-derived words in 2011 and 2012, Arvind Mahankali managed to correctly spell the German-Yiddish word &quot;knaidel&quot; and win the Scripps National Spelling Bee last night. Arvind, who is a 13-year-old from Bayside, Queens, was in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919233119/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-ace-advances-scripps-national-spelling-bee-finals-article-1.1359144">final year of eligibility and said his win</a> &quot;means I&#x2019;m retiring on a good note.&quot; For real&#x2014;check out his confidence while spelling the word, which means &quot;dumpling&quot;:</p>

<p>According to the Daily News, which sponsored the local spelling bee that the middle schooler won, Arvind was foiled by &quot;jugendstil&quot; (artistic style) in 2011 and &quot;schwannoma&quot; (tumor of the nerve sheath) last year&#x2014;he placed third both years. This time, when he was asked to spell &quot;knaidel,&quot; the audience laughed when they heard it was German-derived Yiddish and the announcer even said, &quot;No way!&quot; However, Arvind revealed, &quot;I thought, &apos;The German curse has turned into a German blessing.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Arvind won a $30,000 cash and a $2,500 savings bond and will be attending Stuyvesant High School this fall. Now that he doesn&apos;t have to study words, Arvind said, &quot;I will spend the entire day studying physics.&quot; He is also the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919233119/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/30/187410830/a-spelling-bee-veteran-finally-wins-with-knaidel">11th winner of Indian descent</a> since 1999.</p>
