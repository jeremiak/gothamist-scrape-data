<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_04_newsbur.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414183737im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_newsbur.jpg" width="365" height="229"> <br> <i>Via MyFoxNY</i></div> Last night, a woman drove her minivan with her four children&#x2014;ages 11 months to 10 years old&#x2014;to the Hudson River in Newburgh, NY.  She let the 10-year-old boy out, but then she continued driving into the river, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414183737/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/mom-drives-into-hudson-river-20110412-akd">drowning herself and a 5-year-old boy, a 2-year-old boy, and an 11-month-old girl</a>.  Apparently the women fled her husband after a domestic dispute.  <p></p>

<p>The 10-year-old ran to a fire station just before 8 p.m. and told them that his mother had driven the vehicle into the river. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414183737/http://www.lohud.com/article/20110413/NEWS03/104130365/Mother-3-children-drown-after-car-driven-into-Hudson?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage">Newburgh Fire Chief Michael Vatter said</a>, &quot;We commenced a search using the City of Newburgh fire boat and swimmers, Newburgh police divers and a state police helicopter. After about an hour of searching, we located the vehicle in about 8 to 10 feet of water, about 25 yards off shore.</p>

<p>The investigation is continuing, but it may have been a murder-suicide. Newburgh Police Chief Michael Ferrara said that police responded to a reported domestic dispute at 7:45 p.m. at the woman&apos;s home.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414183737/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110413/NEWS/104130378">According to the Times Herald Record</a>, &quot;When officers arrived at the address, however, there was no one inside. Minutes later, the 10-year-old showed up at the fire station to tell them what had happened.&quot;  Ferrara added, &quot;It&apos;s a horrible sight, all of them in the car.&quot;</p>
