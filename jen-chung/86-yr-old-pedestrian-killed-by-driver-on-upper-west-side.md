<p>Hours after Mayor Bill de Blasio discussed how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402210421/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/06/de_blasio_vision_zero.php">eight pedestrians were killed in traffic crashes</a> this past week, another person was killed by a driver on the Upper West Side.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at around 5:11 p.m. yesterday, officers responded after receiving a 911 call about a pedestrian who was struck at West End Avenue and West 64th Street. Police found an 86-year-old woman, who had apparently been heading east across West End when she was hit by the driver of a 2002 Toyota Camry that was traveling north. The driver remained at the scene.</p>

<p>The victim was pronounced dead at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital. </p>

<p>NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Squad&apos;s is currently investigating the incident. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio said yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402210421/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/06/de_blasio_vision_zero.php">that Vision Zero was working</a>, citing a dramatic increase in speeding and failure to yield tickets issued to drivers: &quot;I think a lot of it is, people who have a license and are not under the influence, but are driving too fast. I still think that&apos;s our number one problem, and not being mindful and not respecting pedestrians... Let&apos;s be clear: the central problem is vehicles being used wrongly and endangering others.&quot;</p>
