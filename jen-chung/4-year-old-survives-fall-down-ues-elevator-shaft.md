										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="2010_06_elevsh.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164605im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_06_elevsh.jpg" width="200" height="166"> <br> <i>(MyFoxNY)</i></div> Yesterday afternoon, a 4-year-old fell two stories after falling down an Upper East Side commercial building&apos;s freight elevator shaft. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164605/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/30/2010-06-30_girl_4_falls_down_shaft__and_lives.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Daily News reports</a> &quot;her stroller tipped over as her mom pushed it into the lift, officials said,&quot; while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164605/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/manhattan/girl-falls-down-elevator-shaft-in-manhattan-20100630-akd">MyFoxNY says</a> there was a 10-inch gap that the girl fell through while she was pushing a toy stroller.<p></p>

<p>The girl, who was crying when emergency responders arrived at 435 East 83rd Street, was taken to NewYork Presbyterian Hospital. Her injuries were described a minor and a fire official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164605/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/nyregion/01fall.html?ref=nyregion">told the Times</a> they were surprised she didn&apos;t suffer more injuries (it was a 25 foot fall).  </p>

<p>Neighbors say there are photo and film shoots in the building.  One appeared to have been taking place and a neighbor thought the girl, who was wearing a long white gown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164605/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/girl_falls_down_shaft_c8d6naIZmhFvROJ5gpdkSP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">may have been a part of it</a>, &quot;I assumed she was from the set... There were a lot of people dressed more formally, and from what looked like a film set, standing around her.&quot; The Department of Buildings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164605/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=2&amp;vlcompdetlkey=0001314132">issued a complaint</a> to the building&apos;s owners, Linda and Steve Horn.</p>
