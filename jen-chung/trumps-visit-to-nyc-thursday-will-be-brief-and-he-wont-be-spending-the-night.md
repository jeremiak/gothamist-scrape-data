<p>President Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503232629/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/26/president_trump_nyc_visit.php">first trip to NYC</a> since taking the oath of office will be a short one: He will return to Manhattan during the day and early evening on Thursday, May 4th, before heading to his Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, NJ. </p>

<p>&quot;The New York Police Department said it had been advised that Mr. Trump would not be staying in the city. He is expected to stay in Bedminster through the weekend,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503232629/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/nyregion/trump-visit-new-york-city.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">the NY Times reports</a>. Previously,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503232629/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/national-govt--politics/new-trump-plans-weekend-bedminster-golf-club-faa-notice-indicates/DWWWbodMtJAcK69IApstZJ/"> it was reported</a> that he would be staying a night at Trump Tower.</p>

<p>Trump will be meeting the Australian Prime Minster, Malcolm Turnbull, at the Intrepid for a reception and dinner to pay tribute to the Coral Sea, the 1942 World War II battle that became a &quot;strategic&quot; victory over Japan for the Allies. From there he&apos;ll decamp to NJ, where military helicopters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503232629/http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2017/05/military_helicopters_reportedly_spotted_in_near_tr.html#incart_river_home_pop">were spotted hovering in Somerset County</a>  yesterday.</p>

<p>State Senator Brad Hoylman, referring to the lack of a &quot;welcome home&quot; for Trump,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503232629/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/03/trump-returns-to-manhattan-which-plans-protests-237878"> told Politico</a>, &quot;We hope this is the mother of all snubs. Nothing he has done thus far should give any New Yorker confidence that he&#x2019;s looking out for the Big Apple &#x2014; even when it comes to counterterrorism or funding for security around his penthouse &#x2014; New Yorkers are getting screwed. We prefer he stay out of the city and spend his time elsewhere.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The NY Times adds, &quot;Several groups announced protests and marches near the Intrepid before the reception. Two groups, the Working Families Party and Rise and Resist, self-described as &apos;new and experienced activists committed to opposing, disrupting and defeating any government act that threatens democracy, equality and our civil liberties,&apos; planned to gather separately on streets north and south of the aircraft carrier and march toward each other.&quot;</p>

<p>The WFP and Resist Here gathering appears to be convening at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503232629/https://www.facebook.com/events/1198328846946489/">DeWitt Clinton Park at 2 p.m.,</a> though details may change depending on Trump&apos;s schedule. </p>

<p>The NYPD said there would be street closures around the Intrepid and Trump Tower, but did not go into specific detail about which streets exactly.</p>
