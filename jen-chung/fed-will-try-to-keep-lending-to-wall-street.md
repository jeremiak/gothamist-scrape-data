<p>Even though spokesmodels for Estee Lauder, including Elizabeth Hurley, prettied up the New York Stock Exchange by ringing today&apos;s opening bell, the mood has been dark as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040252/http://www.cnbc.com/id/25584338">&quot;frightened money is jumping all over the place.&quot;</a>  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke tried to soothe the market, by saying the Fed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040252/http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-07-08-bernanke_N.htm">might extend emergency lending to investment firms</a>.  He told a FDIC forum, &quot;Allowing Bear Stearns to fail so abruptly at a time when the financial markets were already under considerable stress would likely have had extremely adverse implications for the financial system and for the broader economy.&quot;</p>

<p>Bernanke also said the Fed would work to, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040252/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/business/09housing.html">per the NY Times</a>, &quot;restrict exotic mortgages and high-cost loans for people with weak credit,&quot; saying, &quot;The financial turmoil is ongoing, and our efforts today are concentrated on helping the financial system return to more normal functioning.&quot;  </p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040252/http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/07/08/bernankes-fdic-forum-highlights/">top six points from Bernanke&apos;s speech</a>.  And one Federal Reserver Bank president said the Fed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040252/http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/07/08/lacker-to-fed-dont-wait-too-long-on-rate/">shouldn&apos;t wait too long to raise rates</a>.</p>
