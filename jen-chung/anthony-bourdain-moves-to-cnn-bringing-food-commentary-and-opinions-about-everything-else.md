<p>Anthony Bourdain is continuing his transformation: First, he was rebel chef with bestselling books on the side. Then he was a globetrotting food documentarian who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601185325/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/bourdain_or_an_impostor_regrets_bas.php">bashes Paula Deen</a> and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601185325/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/anthony_bourdain_lets_it_all_hang_o.php">became a target for TMZ</a>. Now, hot off the heels of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601185325/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/would_anthony_bourdain_eat_human_fl.php">support for eating human flesh</a>, Bourdain is bringing his brash personality to CNN. He says, &quot;I&#x2019;m really looking forward to coming over to CNN. I think the world is going to get a whole lot bigger for me. I hope that old fans and new ones will be excited about what&#x2019;s coming down the road.&quot; Breaking: Tips on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601185325/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/19/anthony-bourdain-eat-human_n_1530268.html">how to cook unicorn</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601185325/http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/29/anthony-bourdain-joins-cnn-to-host-new-weekend-program/">According to the press release</a>, &quot;Bourdain will join CNN as host of a new weekend program, creating a signature showcase for the network&#x2019;s coverage of food and travel.... Launching in early 2013, the show will be shot on location and examine cultures from around the world through their food and dining and travel rituals... Bourdain, whose reporting has taken him from the culinary capitals of Europe, Asia and North and South America to such historically war-torn or isolated regions as Vietnam, Mozambique, Uzbekistan and Romania, will also offer commentary on other CNN programs and platforms, domestically and internationally, providing insights into current events and debates around food and health and other cultural conversations.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, until the show is live, you can catch him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601185325/http://www.travelchannel.com/schedule">on the Travel Channel</a> (for now&#x2014;his shows <em>No Reservations</em> and <em>The Layover</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601185325/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/anthony-bourdain-to-join-cnn-for-weekend-show/">end their runs early next year</a>)...and you can also see him below, telling Stephen Colbert about eating the endangered ortolan bird, &quot;You take it by the head and stick it in your mouth and crunch down into the body, bones guts and all. It&apos;s sort of a hot rush of fat, guts, bones, blood and meat and it&apos;s really delicious.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The Travel Channel issued a statement about Bourdain&apos;s departure: &quot;As part of Travel Channel&#x2019;s  strategic repositioning of the brand and its core programming mission, the Network has been aggressively developing new talent, new voices and new shows, as announced last year.  Anthony Bourdain has been an iconic figure at Travel Channel for eight groundbreaking seasons of the Emmy award-winning &#x201C;No Reservations&#x201D; and he just finished shooting the latest season of &#x201C;No Reservations.&#x201D; Additionally, we just began filming with Tony for season two of &#x201C;The Layover.&#x201D; Original episodes of both series will run through 2013 and Bourdain programs will always have a home on Travel Channel.  We are proud of the great storytelling Tony has brought to the Network. We congratulate him on his new venture and look forward to working with him on new projects in the future.&quot;</p>
