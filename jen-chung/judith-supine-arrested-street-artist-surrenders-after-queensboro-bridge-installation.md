</div></div>					<p>The street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926093029/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/29/video_street_artist_scales_queensbo.php">who scaled the Queensboro Bridge and then placed one</a> of his works on it has been arrested. Police say that Judith Supine turned himself in this morning.</p>

<p>Last month we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926093029/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/29/video_street_artist_scales_queensbo.php">posted a video of Supine walking on the bridge</a> and then climbing up a tower to install one of his Golden Child pieces. Naturally, the NYPD wasn&apos;t very happy about the stunt and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926093029/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/31/now_judith_supines_queensboro_bridg.php#photo-6">started an investigation</a>.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150926093029if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/p-vjQCsxFow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Supine&#x2014;a.k.a Brendan Fagan&#x2014;had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926093029/http://pagesix.com/2014/04/02/judith-supine-in-hiding-after-scaling-queensboro-bridge/">reportedly been crashing on couches</a> to avoid the police. The police announced that he surrendered to the 19th Precinct this morning at 9 a.m. with a lawyer. According to the NYPD, Supine had climbed the bridge just after midnight on March 24, 2014; he was charged with violation of local law, reckless endangerment and criminal trespass.</p>

<p>The artist is no stranger to placing his work in expected places: In 2007, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926093029/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/05/judith_supine_t.php">hung a large-scale portrait of a man hanging from the Manhattan Bridge</a>; in 2009, he placed a work at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926093029/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/williamsburg_bridge.php">very top of the Williamsburg Bridge</a>; and, also in 2009, he put a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926093029/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/supine_takes_a_dip_in_central_park.php">piece in a lake in Central Park</a>. Supine said to WCBS 2, &quot;It&#x2019;s just something I like to do for fun. To be naughty and run around the city and put my art in places I&#x2019;m not supposed to.&quot; </p>
