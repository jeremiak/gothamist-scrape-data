<p>The huge 10-alarm fire that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920004736/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/photos_video_unthinkable_6-alarm_fi.php#photo-1">devastated the NJ boardwalk and businesses</a> of Seaside Park and Seaside Heights has been considered a terrible blow to a community still recovering from Hurricane Sandy. And now it turns that the hurricane is part of the reason why the fire occurred!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920004736/http://www.app.com/article/20130917/NJNEWS/309170081/Seaside-fire?nclick_check=1">Asbury Park Press reports</a>, &quot;The fire began under the boardwalk with electrical wiring installed after 1970, which sustained damage from sand and salt water during superstorm Sandy, said Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph D. Coronato, during a brief news conference Tuesday at the Ocean County Library in the township. However, the wiring could have failed on its own even without further damage from Sandy. Prior to the fire, inspectors could not access the wires for maintenance, he said.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed damages will cost $5-10 million. </p>
