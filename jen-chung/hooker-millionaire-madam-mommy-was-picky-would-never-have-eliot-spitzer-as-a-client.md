<p>The woman accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722003221/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/mom_madam_allegedly_made_millions_o.php">running a multimillion-dollar brothel</a> from a nondescript Upper East Side townhouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722003221/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/06/millionaire_madam_mother_of_four_lo.php">remains behind bars</a>, but one of her employees has spoken.  The &quot;high-end hooker&quot; who worked for mother of four and pig-lover Anna Gristina <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722003221/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/high-end-hooker-dishes-accused-manhattan-madam-anna-gristina-roster-clients-article-1.1035259">tells the Daily News</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m not a typical escort. I don&#x2019;t have big implants, I don&#x2019;t dress (like a prostitute). I don&#x2019;t do drugs. I don&#x2019;t even smoke. I&#x2019;m not that girl. That girl gets the one-timers.&quot;</p>

<p>The News reports, &quot;The clients all paid well: $25,000 for weekends in Europe and Asia, and a minimum of $800 an hour at the alleged upper East Side brothel,&quot; and the call girl, who calls herself Lizzie, says, &quot;Anna is very selective about what girls she has working for her. But (we) never saw Anna... My friend, she (was) rejected just because she was a little overweight &#x2014; just 5 pounds. You have to stay in really good shape when you work for Anna. I worked out.&quot;  </p>

<p>Gristina, whose clients include &quot;royalty, state politicians, CEOs, club owners and members of the boards of city hospitals and art institutions,&quot; took 40% of what the escorts billed, &quot;well below the industry standard 50-50 split with working girls, say sources.&quot;  </p>

<p>Lizzie said of her johns, &quot;Do I get scared or nervous? No. When I first meet a man, I&#x2019;m trying to understand what he needs from me. I know what men want. But what I want to know, what does he NEED from me?&quot; She says they would shower her with clothing and fly her on their private jets.  As for sex, it&apos;s &quot;different with everybody. It&#x2019;s not like with your boyfriend. But some are incredibly considerate... If they are mean, I cut them off.&#xA0;Anna does, too. She would never have Eliot Spitzer as a client.&quot; Hmm, is she referring to how Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722003221/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/client_9_paid_4.php">liked to have sex with hookers without a condom</a>? Or how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722003221/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/06/madam_says_spitzer_was_getting_roug.php">he was rough and aggressive</a>?</p>

<p>The authorities are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722003221/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/nypd_eyes_sergeant_who_may_have_pro.php">investigating a NYPD sergeant who was often spotted</a> outside the East 78th Street building while they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722003221/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/madams_alleged_2_remains_nations_fo.php">looking for Gristina&apos;s alleged accomplice</a>.</p>
