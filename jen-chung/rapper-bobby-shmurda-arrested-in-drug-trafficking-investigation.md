<p>The Brooklyn-born rapper Bobby Shmurda was arrested yesterday in midtown Manhattan, apparently as part of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/12/8558757/rapper-bobby-shmurda-arrested?top-featured-1">investigation into shootings and drug trafficking</a>. His indictment will be unsealed today.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/nyregion/bobby-shmurda-rap-artist-is-arrested-in-manhattan.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a> that Shmurda, born Ackquille Pollard, was arrested &quot;as he sat in a car outside Quad Recording Studios, at 723 Seventh Avenue, near 48th Street, where the rapper Tupac Shakur was robbed and shot in 1994 as he walked through the lobby.&quot;</p>

<p>About a dozen other people were arrested, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/http://7online.com/entertainment/rapper-bobby-shmurda-faces-gun-drug-charges/440660/">including rapper Chad Marshal</a>&#x2014;Rowdy Rebel&#x2014;who was inside the studio &quot;where police also recovered handguns, authorities said.&quot; </p>

<p>Shmurda had originally planned on a secret performance yesterday:</p>

<p>The 20-year-old Shmurda rose to fame (he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/16/what_is_edamame_top_things_new_york.php">one of the most Googled people</a> in New York this year) with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJwKKKd2ZYE">song &quot;Hot N*gga&quot;</a> (or &quot;Hot Boy&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F7JU2TvYv8">for Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s audience</a>) and the Schmoney Dance. Marshal&apos;s recent song, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4tQGd65bqc">Computers</a>,&quot; features Shmurda.</p>

<p>Shmurda was arrested twice in Brooklyn earlier this year: In June for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/http://www.tmz.com/2014/08/29/bobby-shmurda-arrested-felony-gun-charge/">gun possession in Brownsville</a> (&quot;cops spotted Shmurda showing off the weapon in an apartment and when they went to investigate, he tried to hide it in a couch&quot;) and in October for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155954/http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/07/bobby-shmurda-arrest-marijuana-weed-brooklyn-police/">smoking a joint while double parked</a>. </p>

<p>He told New York magazine, &quot;My music is straight facts. There are a lot of gangsters in my &apos;hood.&quot;</p>
