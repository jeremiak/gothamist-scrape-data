<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175412/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/06/23/nyregion/new-york-asians.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times looks at data</a> from the April Census figures which reveal that New York City&apos;s Asian population grew by 32% since 2000:  &quot;The Hispanic population grew only 8 percent during that time, while the ranks of non-Hispanic whites declined 3 percent and blacks declined 5 percent.&quot;  However, even though Asians are now 13% of the city&apos;s population, advocates say that they get shafted on social services.  </p>

<p>Steven Choi, a community organizer, told the Times that the City Council only gives 1.4% of its discretionary money to social services for Asians and &quot;less than a quarter of one percent of the money for city social-service contracts.&quot; And another problem, many advocacy groups say, is that politicians assume Asians are the &quot;model minority&quot; and are always high-achieving.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175412/http://www.cacf.org/">Coalition for Asian American Children and Families</a>&apos; executive director Wayne Ho tells us, &quot;It is important to note that we can refute the Model Minority Myth from what we have seen in our own community in New York City. The facts are that 1 out of every 2 Asian Pacific American Children is born into poverty, 1 out of 5 of every Asian Pacific high school students does not graduate on time (or at all), and 1 out of 8 Asian Pacific Americans does not have health insurance. This is all occurring while Asian Pacific Americans are the fastest growing population in America&#x2019;s most populous city. It is critical for the well being of New York City that we have a seat at the table when decisions are being made.&quot;</p>

<p>Choi admits that one issue has been the fact that there are so many nationalities under the Asian umbrella&#x2014;Chinese, Indian, Korean, Bangladeshi, Japanese, etc.&#x2014;&quot;It&#x2019;s important as a coalition that we&#x2019;re not letting one narrative dominate over another.&quot; The Times also has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175412/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/06/23/nyregion/new-york-asians.html?ref=nyregion">map showing where Asians are in the city</a> and notes about where populations are growing.</p>
