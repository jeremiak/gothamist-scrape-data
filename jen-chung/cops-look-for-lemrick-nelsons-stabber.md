The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151423/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/14/2010-09-14_search_for_lemrick_nelsons_stabber_continues.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Daily News reports</a> that police are still looking for a suspect, &quot;He was not robbed, so cops think he had a road-rage confrontation with the stabber, who escaped unseen. The car appeared to have fresh damage, as if it had just been clipped or sideswiped, and the door was open, police said.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Nelson was found lying beside his car (with a bloodied ice pick nearby) around 2 a.m. on Sunday morning at 168th Street and Riverside Drive.  Back in 1991, hours after a 7-year-old black child was killed by a driver who was part of the Lubavitcher Jews, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151423/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gg2sRMPdFRKyfD5mhXJ3h9qzHvrgD9I6M2E00">AP reports</a>,  &quot;a gang of angry blacks shouting &apos;Get the Jew!&apos; descended on and fatally stabbed Yankel Rosenbaum, who was visiting from Australia. For more than two days, blacks looted stores, burned police cars and hurled bottles in the neighborhood.&quot;  </p>

<p>Nelson, who was 16 during the riots, admitted to stabbing Rosenbaum, but his lawyer blamed it on drunkenness.  He served time for his conviction, and had been living in NJ.  The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151423/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/crown_hts_thug_new_life_RRn9y1S44iYOFPMgRUt3zI">interviewed him earlier this year</a>, and he said, &quot;That was 19 years ago. I was a kid then. I made a mistake. Kids make mistakes. I&apos;m a man now. I&apos;ve never been in or out of trouble. I don&apos;t live that life... I regret the fact that people got hurt out there.&quot;  Nelson also asked the Post to keep details about his current life quiet, &quot;Let bygones be bygones. All it will do is bring back people&apos;s memories. You&apos;re just going to create tension for me.&quot;</p>
