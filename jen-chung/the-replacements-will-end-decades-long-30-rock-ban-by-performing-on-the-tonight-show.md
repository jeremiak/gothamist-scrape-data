<p>It&apos;s appointment TV time: Tomorrow night, September 9, The Tonight Show will feature musical guests, The Replacements. And it&apos;s a big deal because the &apos;Mats were banned from appearing on Saturday Night Live after a drunken performance in 1986.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how Spin described their 1986 appearance:</p><blockquote> Prior to the release of their 1987 album Pleased to Meet Me, the notoriously ramshackle rockers in the Replacements took to the stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza for a performance on Saturday Night Live. To say the least, things didn&apos;t quite go as well as producer Lorne Michaels had planned. Hotel room destruction, forgotten lyrics, obvious drunkenness, and an off-mic curse during &quot;Bastards of Young,&quot; got the Minneapolis quartet slapped with a permanent ban from the show.</blockquote>Saturday Night Live&apos;s creator Lorne Michaels is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013841/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/bio/lorne-michaels">executive producer of The Tonight Show</a>, so surely he&apos;d have some thoughts about this booking. And we guess 28 years is enough time to bury the hatchet, because they are going on air with guest Keith Richards&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013841/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/274175571.html">whose birthday</a> they played in 1988 at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013841/http://yerdoingreat.wordpress.com/2014/09/07/matskeef30rock/">Brendan Byrne Arena at the Meadowlands</a>. The band posted this YouTube teaser:<p></p>

<p>Also, Paul Westerberg has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013841/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZV-amGnyxk">performed solo on SNL</a>. As for how the Replacements were with Richards in 1988, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013841/http://yerdoingreat.wordpress.com/2014/09/07/matskeef30rock/">from yerdoingreat</a>:</p><blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013841/http://natkin.net/more-stones#sthash.KsIM8gwp.dpuf" "="">Photographer Paul Natkin recalls</a>, &#x201C;So, I spent about 3 weeks with Keith Richards and the X-Pensive Winos in November and December of 1988, traveling coast to coast with the coolest guy in Rock and Roll. The tour ended on Keith&#x2019;s birthday, with a huge party after the show backstage at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. The Replacements, who were the opening act that night, asked me if I could take their picture with Keith. I told them to hang out and when he was through cutting the cake I would ask him. He of course said OK, so we went back to the Replacements table (This was about 15 minutes later,) and two of them were gone and the other two were passed out at the table. Keith and I just looked at each other, smiled, shrugged and went about our business.&#x201D;</blockquote><p></p>
