<p>Another bit of ammunition to show that the private school admissions proces will send parents into a frenzy of questionable behavior. Some therapists have revealed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127092839/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/play_time_over_VyAqhJIc22Vg8ytkba405L?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">bizarre stuff parents will do to the Post</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ask what kind of fancy handbag they should bring to the interview.  </li>
	<li>&quot;A single mother she consulted pretended to be a lesbian &#x2014; to make her child&#x2019;s application more unique.&quot;</li>
<li>One wife berated her husband for making an &quot;off-color joke at a school tour&quot; (he was nervous!).</li>
<li>&quot;One couple started seeing her for marital issues but spent many of their sessions fighting about applying to private schools.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;One pregnant client asked whether she should induce on Aug. 28 so her child could be considered for kindergarten before the Sept. 1 cutoff date.&quot;</li>
<li>Parents say, &quot;I just have to leave the city.&quot;</li>
</ul>One therapist says, &quot;I end up being a psychiatrist as well as an admissions consultant.&quot; Wait until their kids apply to Harvard... oh, wait, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127092839/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/06/getting_into_nyc_private_school_kin.php">tougher to get into private school than Harvard</a>. 

<p>When we i<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127092839/http://gothamist.com/2005/05/20/karen_quinn_author_of_the_ivy_chronicles.php">nterviewed former private school admissions consultant Karen Quinn</a> (she wrote the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127092839/http://karenquinn.net/">novel, The Ivy Chronicles</a>, based on her experienced), she told us:</p><blockquote>There was a woman who hired an actor who pretended to be her husband through the parent interviews for her daughter&#x2019;s kindergarten application. She thought the child would have a better chance if she came from a traditional family. The kid got into an excellent girl&#x2019;s school and then the couple got a fake divorce the next fall. Then there are parents in the midst of real divorces, who can&#x2019;t stand to be in the room together, but who pretend to be happily married because they know schools won&#x2019;t take kids whose parents are going to be too difficult. I once heard about a father who put on a twenty-slide PowerPoint presentation pitching the advantages of his family and child over other applicants during a parent interview. Early in my practice, I had a client, a dad, who got so enraged over the admissions process during a meeting at my apartment that I actually feared for my life. I went in the kitchen and hid the knives.</blockquote><p></p>
