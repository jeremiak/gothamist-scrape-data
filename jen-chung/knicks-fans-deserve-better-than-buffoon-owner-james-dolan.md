<p>With the burning question about whether Knicks breakout star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/15/luxury_of_linsanity_knicks_may_ditc.php">Jeremy Lin will be re-signed</a> (latest ESPN rumors say that Lin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/8168185/2012-nba-free-agency-new-york-knicks-match-jeremy-lin-houston-rockets-offer-sheet-source-says?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">won&apos;t be re-signed by New York!</a>), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/http://www.grantland.com/">Grantland</a>&apos;s Bill Simmons took to Twitter yesterday to rant about the Knicks&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224547602224517120">&quot;complete buffoon&quot;</a> owner James Dolan&#x2014;and suggests that Knicks fans finally have an opportunity to free themselves from this abusive relationship.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224546135296053249">1.</a> To the Knicks fans who keep asking: If you&apos;re going to switch allegiance to Brooklyn, it has to happen this summer. But I&apos;m fine with it.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224546589358817280">2.</a> Here&apos;s the thing - Dolan is NEVER selling. The franchise will ALWAYS be screwed up. You have a 2nd NYC team and a legit excuse to leave.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224547322510585857">3.</a> If Celtics were in same situation (with a Dolan owner), I&apos;d stop rooting for them and be an NBA widow unless there was a 2nd Boston team.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224547602224517120">4.</a> The important thing to remember - Dolan is a complete buffoon. You have a 12-year track record to examine now. He&apos;s an incompetent owner<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224547810618511362">5.</a> So you have to ask yourself... &quot;Do I really want to spend DECADES of my life with my NBA fate tied to this guy?&quot; You control that answer.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224548032530747393">6.</a> And if you&apos;re a diehard, loyal down-with-the-ship type fan, that&apos;s fine too... stay with the Knicks. Just saying you have an out here.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224548751413489664">7.</a> My buddy @<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/housefromdc">housefromdc</a> quit on Orioles because of Angelos (Dolan-esque). Baseball widow for years, now a huge Nats fan. Totally happy.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/https://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/224549956638355457">8.</a> Last thought - I have a great deal of respect for Knicks fans (and NYK history + MSG). They deserve better than... <br>

<p>But Dolan has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173253/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/video_james_dolan_sings_his_new_hit.php">song about fixing the Knicks</a>!
