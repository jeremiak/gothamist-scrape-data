<p>The bomb threats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624184758/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/27/jewish_community_centers_across_new.php">aimed at Jewish community centers</a> across the country are now getting federal attention. A law enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624184758/http://nypost.com/2017/02/28/fbi-probes-bomb-threats-against-jewish-community-centers/">told the NY Post</a>, &quot;The FBI has taken the lead on this. Obviously, it&#x2019;s been happening nationally for the past three months or so. We believe it&#x2019;s the same guy.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624184758/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/us/bomb-threats-jewish-centers-jcc/">more than 100 JCCs have been targeted</a>. The incidents were denounced by President Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624184758/http://chicagoist.com/2017/02/28/trump_addresses_joint_session_of_co.php#photo-1">during his address to the joint session of Congress</a> last night (hours after allegedly suggesting some of them may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624184758/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/28/trump_anti_semitism_reverse.php">been &quot;false flag&quot; instances</a>).</p>

<p>On Monday, over a dozen threats were called in, including three in NYC, two in Westchester and one on Long Island. The Post reports:<br>
</p><blockquote><br>
Because bombs have yet to be found in any of the incidents, authorities believe the threats are the work of a single caller. &quot;He&#x2019;s definitely some nut job,&quot; the law enforcement source said. &quot;He&apos;s masking his phone number whenever he calls.... For the past three months, he&apos;s phoned in bomb threats to Jewish centers across the country and nothing ever happens. That&apos;s not a terrorist. That&apos;s a nut.&quot;<br>
</blockquote><br>
Well, that sure narrows it down. This morning Governor Cuomo addressed the recent wave of anti-Semitic incidents during an appearance at the Sidney Albert Albany JCC: &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t seem like it&#x2019;s getting better. If anything, it seems like it&#x2019;s getting worse. This is repugnant to everything we believe as New Yorkers. It is an act of cowardice. It suggests a basic misunderstanding of who we are as New Yorkers and what we believe as New Yorkers.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Cuomo added, &quot;It&#x2019;s especially reprehensible when you think these Jewish Community Centers often primarily handle children. They offer day care. They offer pre-K services. So these threats are against children. And when you talk of really ugly, reprehensible behavior, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything worse than racist activity, bigoted activity and targeting facilities that serve our children.&quot; </p>

<p>The governor will also being going to Israel in a few days, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624184758/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-israel-trip.html">according to the NY Times</a>: &quot;Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, already provoking talk of presidential ambitions in 2020, announced he would make a quick weekend trip to Israel, at a moment when the handling of Jewish issues is percolating through the national political debate.&quot;</p>
