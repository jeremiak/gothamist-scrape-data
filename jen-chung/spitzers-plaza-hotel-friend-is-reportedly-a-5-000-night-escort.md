<p>The woman that former Governor Eliot Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/15/spitzer_plaza_hotel_choking.php">visited at the Plaza Hotel</a> and then, apparently later at a hospital, is apparently a 26-year-old Russian woman who has written about her life as a high-end escort. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/14689-former-new-york-governor-eliot-spitzer-denies-choking-woman-in-hotel">Inside Edition</a> reports that Svetlana Travis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/https://medium.com/matter/sex-is-sex-but-money-is-money-e7c10091713f#.lbz9wc557">wrote about sex work under a pen name on Medium.</a> In the post, &quot;Svetlana Z&quot; explains why she doesn&apos;t want to &quot;spoil&quot; boyfriends: &quot;If someone&#x2019;s not paying you, you don&#x2019;t have to do blow jobs, you don&#x2019;t have to smile all the time, you can be yourself. But after a while you feel like something is missing. The something is money. You&#x2019;re sitting in the same apartment, you&#x2019;re the same you, but something is missing. Your wallet is empty. Sex is sex, but money is money.&quot;</p>

<p>Police sources tell the tabloids that Travis and Spitzer were in a suite at the Plaza Hotel on Saturday night when an argument ensued, apparently about Travis&apos;s decision to return to Russia. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/spitzer-choke-accuser-identified-svetlana-travis-25-article-1.2532341">From the Daily News</a>:</p><blockquote>Police sources said that after Spitzer, 56, allegedly choked and pushed Travis &#x2014; someone he&#x2019;s known for two years &#x2014; at the hotel, she cut herself with a broken glass. &#x201C;She then cut herself with the glass,&#x201D; one source said. &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t really on the wrist, like she was trying to kill herself. It was more on the arm. She said she was having a nervous breakdown.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Travis went to Roosevelt Hospital, where she named the &#x201C;Luv Gov&#x201D; as her attacker, the sources said. After the hospital visit, while she was being driven by police, &#x201C;at one point she gets out of the car and says she doesn&#x2019;t want to press charges,&#x201D; a source said.</p>

<p>In the hours after the alleged scrap, Spitzer was caught on hotel video wearing a wool cap pulled down low over his eyes, sources said. While Travis was in the hospital, a man identifying himself as &#x201C;George&#x201D; called twice to ask about seeing her.</p></blockquote>Spitzer would call himself &quot;George Fox&quot;&#x2014;a friend&apos;s name&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/eliot_superman_spitzer_steamrolled.php">during meetings with prostitutes</a> that preceded his<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/governor_spitze_1.php"> extremely embarrassing fall from public office</a>.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/nyregion/eliot-spitzers-lawyer-says-woman-retracted-claim-he-choked-her.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">Spitzer&apos;s lawyer Adam S. Kaufmann told the NY Times</a>, &quot;There was no assault,&quot; and offered an alternate story, saying that Travis reached out to Spitzer last week: &quot;&apos;This is someone that he had a relationship with in the past,&apos; Mr. Kaufmann said, though he declined to say how long Mr. Spitzer had known her or how the two had met.&quot;</p><blockquote>Mr. Kaufmann said she told Mr. Spitzer, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m in New York and I&#x2019;m going back to Russia on Sunday &#x2014; I&#x2019;d like to see you on Saturday.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>She asked him to book a hotel room and Mr. Spitzer did so, Mr. Kaufmann said. On Saturday afternoon, the former governor visited her at the Plaza and they talked for less than an hour &#x2014; amiably, Mr. Kaufmann said &#x2014; about her plans on her return to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. Spitzer left the hotel but heard from her again a couple of hours later, he said. This time, she sounded distraught and asked to see him again.</p>

<p>According to the lawyer, Mr. Spitzer went back to the hotel around 7 and found her in &#x201C;a highly agitated state.&#x201D; Mr. Kaufmann said she threatened suicide, made a superficial cut in her wrist and called 911, but then tried to cancel the call.</p>

<p>She left the hospital on Sunday and flew to Russia as scheduled, Mr. Kaufmann said. And on Monday, she sent the email. &#x201C;I just read the news, I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201D; she said, offering to send a statement to the police &#x201C;that my report was all fake.&#x201D; She said she would tell the police that she attempted suicide &#x201C;as I had before.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;You tried to save me,&#x201D; she wrote to Mr. Spitzer, according to the copy of the email provided by Mr. Kaufmann.</p>

<p>She suggested that she made up the assault story because she was scared she would be hospitalized for a long period. She offered to send &#x201C;documents from all mental homes where I have been &#x2014; Russia, Catskill New York, California.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;If I didn&#x2019;t say Eliot started (it) all, I think I would be hospitalized in some mental home for a few months. I made up the story in order to not be hospitalized,&#x201D; the person claiming to be Travis wrote.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://nypost.com/2016/02/16/spizter-accuser-a-young-jobless-ex-hooker-who-lives-a-life-of-luxury/">The Post&apos;s sources say</a> that Travis referred to herself as Spitzer&apos;s girlfriend&#x2014;one added, &quot;They met before this, and she was a prostitute at the time&quot;&#x2014;and that they&apos;ve known each other for &quot;at least&quot; two years.<p></p>

<p>Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/26/spitzer_spends_christmas_at_girlfri.php">was dating Lis Smith</a>, his former communications director for his failed NYC Comptroller campaign, from late 2013 until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://nypost.com/2015/12/27/eliot-spitzer-and-lis-smith-break-up/">December 2015</a>. Smith was on track for a top position <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/spitzers_girlfriend_lis_smith_leave.php">on Mayor de Blasio&apos;s press team</a> but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/24/ny_post_slut_shames_lis_smith_becau.php">furor (and slut-shaming)</a> over her choice of boyfriends led her to resign. Most recently, she worked on Martin O&apos;Malley&apos;s presidential campaign; you can see her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/video_triumph_the_insult_comic_dog_6.php">giggling while Triumph the Insult Comic Dog poops</a> on O&apos;Malley. </p>

<p>In her essay on Medium, Travis goes into detail about her entrepreneurship&#x2014;she spent thousands to ensure she had the best photographs and ad placement&#x2014;and the kinds of clients she dealt with:</p><blockquote>The big part of my job started at the door. You don&#x2019;t pay attention to the envelope he has. You pretend it doesn&#x2019;t even exist. You&#x2019;re smiling because he&#x2019;s a handsome man, and there&#x2019;s chemistry. If he&#x2019;s shy, you offer him a glass of wine. If he&#x2019;s super shy, you ask, can you massage him, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with a massage, right?<p></p>

<p>Sometimes I would say, &#x201C;Oh, you&#x2019;re so handsome,&#x201D; because people like to be flattered, even if it&#x2019;s not true. People like to believe the better things, because believing better things is easier. And guys who are paying $1,000 an hour really believe the better things! If he can afford $1,000 an hour, he already thinks he&#x2019;s cool. When a guy&#x2019;s got money, he thinks he&#x2019;s cool, cooler than regular people.</p></blockquote>Spitzer himself said, &quot;The woman who initially made the allegation was not my girlfriend. Lis Smith was my girlfriend, and I had and have deep affection for Lis. She is the love of my life.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Police are still investigating the incident, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023042208/http://www.amny.com/news/eliot-spitzer-charges-unlikely-in-hotel-assault-allegation-sources-say-1.11475537">haven&apos;t interviewed Spitzer yet</a>.</p>
