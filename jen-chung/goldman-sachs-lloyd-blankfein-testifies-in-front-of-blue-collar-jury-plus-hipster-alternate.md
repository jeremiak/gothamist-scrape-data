<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_01_lloydblankfein.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_01_lloydblankfein.jpg" width="180" height="235" class="image-left"> </span><strike>Vampire squid</strike> Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein testified today in the Galleon insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam, a hedge fund founder who is out on $100 million bail, is accused of a huge insider trading ring.  The trial is pretty complicated, what with hours of secretly recorded conversation and financial details, and the jury is<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/10/galleon_insider_trading_trial_jury.php"> made up of mostly blue collar New Yorkers</a>&#x2014;and one alternate juror dubbed the &quot;Hipster Juror&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/the-snooze-moment-in-the-galleon-trial/">who has already fallen asleep</a>&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-08/rajaratnam-trial-brings-early-defense-victory-and-a-question-lloyd-who-.html">don&apos;t know who the hell Lloyd Blankfein is</a>.</p>

<p>Blankfein appeared to say that a former Goldman board member&#x2014;Rajat Gupta&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-23/goldman-s-lloyd-blankfein-will-testify-today-in-galleon-trial.html">violated the company&apos;s confidentiality policy</a> by discussing issues with Rajaratnam.  A tape of Gupta telling Rajaratnam about possible deals was played, and prosecutors claimed that Gupta also mentioned Berkshire Hathaway&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/23/berkshire_hathaway_to_invest_5_bill.php">$5 billion investment in Goldman</a>, which then prompted Rajaratnam to buy shares in the investment firm. </p>

<p>What&apos;s interesting is that the prosecution directed questions to Blankfein without mentioning the words &quot;financial crisis&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/at-galleon-trial-blankfein-testifies-on-goldman-confidentiality/">according to Dealbook</a>, &quot;Before Mr. Blankfein&#x2019;s testimony, prosecutors had expressed concern that testimony about the financial crisis could unfairly prejudice the jury against Mr. Blankfein. In his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Blankfein described September 2008 as &apos;a volatile period in the market,&apos; saying that it was &apos;a dangerous time&apos; that &apos;made us nervous.&apos; There was also &apos;riskiness,&apos; and a &apos;general insecurity,&apos; he said.&quot;  Goldman received a $10 billion TARP bailout in 2008; the year before, Blankfein <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185558/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-28/goldman-sachs-s-blankfein-gets-12-6-million-2010-stock-bonus.html">was paid $68 million</a>.</p>
