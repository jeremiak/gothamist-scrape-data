Advertisers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/world_to_rush_limbaugh_please_shut.php">suspended their ads on his show</a>&#x2014;just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/rush-limbaugh-aol-advertisers_n_1321260.html">joined by AOL</a>&#x2014;in spite of Limbaugh&apos;s limp apology, claiming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/world_to_rush_limbaugh_please_shut.php">he was just being &quot;humorous.&quot;</a>  Today, Fluke said of his maybe-mea culpa, &quot;<strong>I don&apos;t think a statement like this saying that his choice of words was not the best changes anything</strong>, especially when the statement is issued when he&apos;s under significant pressure&quot; from advertisers.</p>

<p>Fluke, 30, student and activist, had testified before Democratic House members to explain why Georgetown students&apos; contraception should be covered by health insurance (Georgetown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://jesuits.georgetown.edu/">is a Jesuit school</a>). Last week, Limbaugh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/troll_rush_limbaugh_cant_stop_wont.php">mocked Fluke&#x2014;and women, really&#x2014; for days</a>: &quot;So, Ms. Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here&apos;s the deal: If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it. And I&apos;ll tell you what it is. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.&quot;  </p>

<p>On the program, Fluke added that she didn&apos;t want a call from Limbaugh, &quot;<strong>The statements he&apos;s made about me over the air are personal enough, so I&apos;d rather not have a personal phone call with him</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Additionally, Fluke also told people to go to Media Matters to see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://mediamatters.org/blog/201203020007">list of media figures defending Limbaugh</a> &quot;who think it&apos;s acceptable&quot; to say these things about women. And former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum explains<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/05/opinion/frum-rush-limbaugh-fairness/index.html"> why Limbaugh&apos;s remarks are a new low</a> and why excuses that liberal media figures&apos; misogyny (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/16/letterman_apologizes_to_palin_again.php">David Letterman</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/video_ed_schultz_apologizes_for_cal.php">Ed Schultz</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517010554/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/03/23/slams-maher-sarah-palin-insult-chides-media-asking/">Bill Maher</a>), &quot;Letterman is not a political figure at all; and while Maher and Schultz strongly identify as liberals, neither qualifies as anything like a powerbroker in the Democratic Party. I&apos;m sure the Barack Obama re-election effort is happy to have Maher&apos;s million-dollar gift, but I sincerely doubt there is a Democratic congressman who worries much whether Maher criticizes him. A word of criticism from Limbaugh, by contrast, will reduce almost any member of the Republican caucus to abject groveling.&quot;</p>
