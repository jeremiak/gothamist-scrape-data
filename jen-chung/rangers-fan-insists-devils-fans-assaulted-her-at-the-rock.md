Stephanie Gorman says that in the wake of the Rangers&apos; victory, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150925/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/21/female-rangers-fan-claims-3-male-devils-fans-attacked-her-after-game-3-at-the-rock/">three Devils fans attacked her</a>: &quot;The one guy spit at me, all over my face and jersey. Another guy pushed me and right after that, a third guy grabbed me around the neck and pushed me, very hard.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Gorman says she and her boyfriend were exiting an elevator at the Prudential Center in Newark, chanting with other Rangers fans.  She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150925/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ranger-fan-stephanie-gorman-men-assaulted-playoff-game-devils-prudential-center-newark-article-1.1082298">shared photographs of her bruises</a> and claims that security was unresponsive.  She said, &quot;I was shaken up, crying, hyperventilating... They&#x2019;re yelling in my face, if I don&#x2019;t calm down, they&#x2019;re gonna call police.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Jim Crann, head of Prudential Center security (where violence after a Red Hot Chili Peppers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150925/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/prudential_center_heightens_securit.php">prompted heightened police presence around the arena</a>), told WCBS 2, &quot;Witnesses said the woman was aggressive, combative and was being restrained by her male companion. She appeared to have been drinking.&quot;  Gorman says that while she did have &quot;a few beers, three,&quot; she denies being drunk or abusive.</p>

<p>Gorman&apos;s father, a retired Jersey City firefighter and Rangers fan, told NBC New York, &quot;The fact that somebody would spit on a woman because of a sports game is appalling. They have to be human beings. There has to be a certain sense of adulthood.&quot; Tell that to the Flyers fans who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528150925/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/05/video_cops_seek_flyers_fan_who_beat.php">beat up Rangers fans after the Winter Classic</a>. </p>
