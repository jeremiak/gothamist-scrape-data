<p>Twelve people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40148737">have been arrested</a> in connection to a shocking Saturday night of violence in London that left seven people dead and dozens injured. &quot;Last night, our country fell victim to a brutal terrorist attack once again,&quot; British Prime Minister Theresa May <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/http://time.com/4804640/london-attack-theresa-may-speech-transcript-full/">said on Sunday morning</a>.</p>

<p>The events unfolded around 10 p.m. in London, when a white van drove into pedestrians on London Bridge. Then, three men got out of the van and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40149159">witness said they ran towards pedestrians</a> that were nearly hurt, &quot;I thought oh maybe they&apos;re worried about them and trying to comfort them because obviously [I thought] it&apos;s an accident. [But] they literally just started kicking them, punching them, they took out knives and then they just, it was a rampage really.&quot;</p>

<p>The attackers then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40148737">stabbed people in Borough Market</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/871311397032009728">map</a>). The assailants, who were tackled by many including police officers and an amateur rugby player, were fatally shot by police. May said, &quot;All three were wearing what appeared to be explosive vests, but the police have established that this clothing was fake and worn only to spread panic and fear.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-respond-to-incident-at-london-bridge-1496528407">Wall Street Journal had harrowing accounts of the attack</a>: </p><blockquote>Gerard Vowls said he was near the food market when he saw three men rampaging up and down the streets, through bars and restaurants. &#x201C;All they wanted to do was kill people,&#x201D; he said.<p></p>

<p>Mr. Vowls said he saw one of the assailants repeatedly stab a woman. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the hardest thing I&#x2019;ve ever seen,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>He said he threw bottles and glasses at the men, and one of them rushed him, but Mr. Vowls ran away. When he came back later, he saw the three men lying in the street, apparently shot.</p></blockquote>A man dining at a restaurant told the WSJ that when he &quot;looked out and [he] saw three men throwing chairs into some of the open-air restaurants. Moments later, a man entered the restaurant, walked over to a waiter and stabbed the waiter in the back.&quot; When he and his friends tried to run for safety, they &quot;saw three attackers lined up about 50 feet away. Two held kitchen knives, one with a pink handle and pink serrated blade.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The NYPD reassured New Yorkers that there were &quot;no credible threats&quot; in the city but reminded the public that the Critical Response Command is deployed in popular areas:</p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a statement, expressing sympathy for the victims and noting, &quot;New York stands with the people of Britain -- as they have always done for us.&quot; He also said, &quot;The safety and security of New Yorkers is our top priority, and we will continue to remain vigilant. We are in close contact with federal and local officials, and I have directed state law enforcement officials to step up security and patrols at high-profile locations across New York, including our airports, bridges, tunnels and mass transit systems.&quot;</p>

<p>May referenced the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Manchester_Arena_bombing">May 22 Manchester</a> bombing and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604164453/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Westminster_attack">March 22 Westminster attack</a> of this year in her remarks today, &quot;In terms of their planning and execution, the recent attacks are not connected but we believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face. As terrorism breeds terrorism and perpetrators are inspired to attack, not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots after years of planning and training, and not even as lone attackers radicalised online, but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack. We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are. Things need to change and they need to change in four important ways.&quot; </p>

<p>Last night, before much known about the attacks, President Donald Trump Tweeted:</p>
