<p>Who knew that the Knicks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120409140131/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/video_hobbled_knicks_talk_beautiful.php">battered</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120409140131/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/mike_dantoni_fallout_should_we_blam.php">with an interim coach</a>, could put on a thrilling Easter show against the dominating Chicago Bulls? Although New York was leading for the first half, Chicago regained its footing in the second.  Still, the Knicks pushed Derrick Rose and the rest of the Bulls to overtime, thanks to Carmelo Anthony&apos;s efforts.  And then Anthony had a three-pointer in final seconds of OT&#x2014;finishing the game with 43 points&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120409140131/http://www.nba.com/games/20120408/CHINYK/gameinfo.html">to seal the 100-99 victory</a>.</p>

Overtime. Easter Sunday. Everybody&#x2019;s watching. This ranks as one of the top. At that point, I was thinking something had to go. If I take the shot and we make it, we win. If we don&#x2019;t, we lose the game.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;d call conduct unbecoming of an MVP. He also did it in Miami on Jan. 29 in the Bulls&#x2019; four-point loss to the Heat. That day, he fought back tears, saying, &apos;I guarantee you, the next time, those shots are going down.&apos; But against the Knicks, he didn&#x2019;t make good on his guarantee, bricking two free throws in the final 19 seconds, with the Bulls ahead by 91-88.&quot;</p>

<p>The Knicks are now in seventh place for the Eastern Conference playoffs.</p>
