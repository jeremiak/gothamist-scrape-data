<p>Before the U.S. Open started, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204013/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/29/serena_williams_rolls_her_eyes_when.php">Serena Williams rolled her eyes</a> when reporters brought up her notorious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204013/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/13/video_serena_williams_flips_out_and.php">2009 meltdown where she swore at a line judge</a> (&quot;I swear to God, I&apos;m f*ckin&apos; takin&apos; this ball and shovin&apos; it in(?) your f*ckin&apos; throat&#x2026; I swear to God&quot;), pointing out, &quot;Oh my God. That was, like, two years ago. This is, like, two years later.&quot;  Well, two years later, Williams can still get mad&#x2014;but she can get mad without swearing!  During yesterday&apos;s final against Samantha Stosur, Williams let loose at the umpire: &quot;<strong>If you ever see me walking down the hall, look the other way</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204013/http://projects.nytimes.com/live-dashboard/us-open-tennis/womens-final">According to the NY Times</a>, the dispute began when &quot;Williams&quot;&#x2014;which facing a break point in the second set&#x2014;&quot;hit a powerful forehand and shouted &apos;Come on!&apos; before the ball reached Stosur&apos;s racquet. The chair umpire Eva Asderaki correctly called a hindrance on Williams for audibly interfering with the point in play, giving Stosur the point and the break.&quot;  </p>

<p>Then Williams confused Asderaki with another judge (either Mariana Alves who made incorrect calls in Williams&apos; loss to Jennifer Capriati in 2004 or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204013/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2011/09/11/2011-09-11_sam_stosur_upsets_serena_williams_for_us_open_title_serena_argues_with_umpire_in.html"> Louise Engzell, who officiated her 2009 match</a> with Kim Cljisters), &quot;Aren&apos;t you the one who screwed me over last time? ... That&apos;s totally not cool.&quot;  Video shows Williams saying during the changeover, &quot;If you ever see me walking down the hall, look the other way, because you&apos;re out of control... You&apos;re totally out of control, you&apos;re a hater, and you&apos;re unattractive inside. Who would do such a thing? And I never complain. Wow... We&apos;re in America last I checked. Can I get a water or am I gonna get violated for a water? Really, don&apos;t even look at me! I promise you, don&apos;t look at me, &apos;cause I am not the one. Don&apos;t look my way.&quot;</p>

<p>Stosur went on to win the championship, 6-2, 6-3, and Williams was gracious, saying the call had nothing to do with her loss and calling Stosur a great opponent. However, Williams didn&apos;t shake Asderaki&apos;s hand.</p>
