<p>Tomorrow, there<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230919/http://manhattan.ny1.com/content/top_stories/165195/family-plans-funeral-for-harlem-restaurant-owner-sylvia-woods"> will be a public viewing</a> at the Abyssinian Baptist Church for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230919/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/sylvia_woods_queen_of_soul_food_and.php">iconic Harlem restaurateur Sylvia Woods</a>, who passed away last week.  Woods&apos; family and the Reverend Al Sharpton also announced that next week, on August 1, there will be a parade and breakfast in honor of the restaurant&apos;s 50th anniversary and Woods&apos; legacy.  </p>

<p>Sharpton wrote an op-ed in the Daily News about Sylvia&apos;s Restaurant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230919/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/20/al_sharpton_on_sylvias_a_world-famo.php#photo-3">importance in the black and global community</a>. He often ate there with powerful figures, including Fox News&apos; Bill O&apos;Reilly.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230919/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/26/bill_oreilly_un.php">Back in 2007</a>, O&apos;Reilly recounted his thoughts about the meal on his radio program:</p><blockquote>I couldn&apos;t get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia&apos;s restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it&apos;s run by blacks, primarily black patronship.<p></p>

<p>...There wasn&apos;t one person in Sylvia&apos;s who was screaming, &apos;M-Fer, I want more iced tea.&apos; ...You know, I mean, everybody was -- it was like going into an Italian restaurant in an all-white suburb in the sense of people were sitting there, and they were ordering and having fun. And there wasn&apos;t any kind of craziness at all.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There was, of course, outrage (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230919/http://mediamatters.org/research/2007/09/21/oreilly-surprised-there-was-no-difference-betwe/139893">fueled by Media Matters</a>) and O&apos;Reilly tried to get Sharpton to stand up for him.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230919/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/27/oreilly_talks_s.php">Sharpton would only say</a> that he hadn&apos;t heard the recording but &quot;What I read was surprising and disturbing.&quot; Sharpton went onto say that his words had been distorted by the media before so &quot;I will be as fair to you as you have been to me. I will listen to the tape, and I will give my judgment.&quot; He added that he and O&apos;Reilly go to dinner in Harlem once a year and that O&apos;Reilly has never said anything offensive. O&apos;Reilly kept mentioning how he picked up the tab, but Sharpton said, &quot;You should pick up the tab - you make more money!&quot;</p>

<p>As for the reaction from Sylvia&apos;s, Woods&apos; son H. Kenneth Woods<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230919/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/nyregion/27oreilly.html?ref=nyregion"> told the NY Times,</a> &quot;I was surprised that after all these years in business he would have thought that he would&#x2019;ve possibly seen something different. He&#x2019;s welcome to come again.&quot; But one diner said, &quot;I would laugh if I didn&#x2019;t think it was sad.&quot;</p>
