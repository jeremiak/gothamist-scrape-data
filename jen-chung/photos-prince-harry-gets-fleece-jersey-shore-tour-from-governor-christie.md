	<p>Days after setting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143746/http://dcist.com/2013/05/photos_prince_harry_visits_capitol.php#photo-1">female Capitol staffers&apos; hearts aflutter</a>, Prince Harry is visiting New Jersey right now, getting a personal tour of Hurricane Sandy&apos;s damage from NJ Governor Chris Christie. Christie also gave Harry his own fleece.</p>

Christie guided Harry to spot where the Atlantic Ocean had cut Mantoloking in half, taking out a bridge and houses. They inspected dune construction, walked past destroyed homes and shook hands with police and other emergency. &apos;This used to be a house?&apos; Harry asked at one barren spot.&quot; But don&apos;t think it&apos;s a total downer: </p><blockquote>Among those waiting for Harry were members of the Bowden family, four siblings who shared a summer house that was destroyed by the storm in October.<p></p>

<p>A member of the family, Camilla Bowden, 17, said she had visited London and studied royal history but came to see Harry for one reason: &quot;cause he&apos;s my future husband.&quot;</p></blockquote>Harry will visit Seaside Heights next and see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143746/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/13/tomorrow_demolition_set_for_nj_roll.php#photo-1">Jet-Star roller coaster in the Atlantic Ocean</a> just hours before crews start to remove it.<p></p>

<p>Prince Harry will come to New York City later today.</p>
