<p>Last night was the crowd pleasing, if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131022070935/http://www.nycwineandfoodfestival.com/2009/view-events.php?event=7">awkwardly titled</a>, &quot;Blue Moon Burger Bash, presented by Allen Brothers, hosted by Rachael Ray.&quot; Held at the Tobacco Warehouse in Brooklyn, former Top Chef contest Spike Mendelsohn won the judge&apos;s prize of his burger with blue cheese, bacon, and horseradish mayonnaise, while the popular vote was won by Lure Fishbar&apos;s Josh Capon.  But clearly the real winners were those who go to try offerings from Al Roker, Shake Shack and more.</p>
