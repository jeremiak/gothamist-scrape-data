<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_crimerate.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203131im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_crimerate.jpg" width="218" height="185" class="image-left"> </span>Remember how there are worries that budget cuts could pressure the NYPD to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203131/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/nypd_budget_cuts_could_bring_back_9.php">trim its force and crime would rise</a>? Well, couple that with this: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203131/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/03/26/2010-03-26_bloody_start_to_10_spike_in_killings__shootings_has_folks_worried.html">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The citywide murder rate has increased 22.8% in the first 11 weeks of the year over the same period in 2009, from 79 homicides to 97 as of Sunday, the most recent day for which statistics are available. Shootings in general are also up citywide, with 293 people hit by bullets this year, a 16.3% change from the total of 252 recorded by March 21 last year.&quot; </p>

<p>In Brooklyn, there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203131/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7351959">have been 37 murders so far</a>; there were 32 last year.  In the Bronx, there are 23 murders, up from 20.  In Manhattan, there have been 16, up from 9. And in Queens, there have been 18, up from 14. But NYPD spokesman Paul Browne tells the News, &quot;The NYPD is fighting its own record,&quot; referring to how last year the city had a record low 466 murders. Browne pointed out that this year&apos;s murder rate is still 14% lower than 2008 and 39% lower than the murder rate in 2001. Still, that&apos;s little comfort for some residents: A 15-year-old in the South Bronx, where crime has increased, says, &quot;[It] is getting worse. I shouldn&apos;t be used to it, but it&apos;s where I live.&quot;</p>
