<p>Today, Occupy Wall Street protesters will be visiting the 1% (really, the 0.001%) on the Upper East Side, by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144221/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3688798/tomorrows-occupy-wall-street-protest-makes-stops-homes-murdoch-koch-">marching to the homes of billionaires and millionaires</a>.  Organized by the Working Families Party and New York Communities for Change, they will be going by the apartment buildings of Tea Party-lovin&apos; richest man in NYC David Koch, News Corp. owner Rupert Murdoch, real estate developer (and Andrew Cuomo donor) Howard Milstein, hedge fund manager John Paulson, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.  </p>

<p>According to Capital New York, the organizers say, &quot;[T]he tour will visit homes of some of the most well-known millionaires in New York City specially chosen for their willingness to hoard wealth at the expense of the 99%.&quot;  Interestingly enough, the march will not include a stop at Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s house&#x2014;maybe they are happy he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144221/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/bloomberg_says_wall_street_proteste.php">not kicking them out of Zuccotti Park just yet</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144221/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=275701809119520&amp;ref=nf">According to a Facebook page</a>, &quot;We&apos;ll be meeting at 59th Street and 5th Avenue at 12:30 pm, and then march from house to house, demanding accountability for Wall Street crimes, and an extension of the Millionaire&apos;s tax.&quot;</p>

<p>House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R)  has said of OWS, &quot;I for one am increasingly concerned about the growing mobs occupying Wall Street and the other cities across the country,&quot; but the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is broadcasting his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144221/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/listen_al_sharpton_broadcasts_live.php">radio show from Zuccotti Park this week</a>, pointed out, &quot;The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144221/http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2010/01/03/75694/guns-tea-party/">Tea Party had guns.</a> The Tea Party was spitting on members of Congress. Whereas these people are not a mob. This is democracy.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in 2009, the Connecticut Working Families&apos; Party organized a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144221/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/22/protesters_tour_aig_office_execs_ho.php">protest outside of the homes of AIG executives</a>&#x2014;chants included &quot;Bail out Main Street, not Wall Street.&quot;</p>
