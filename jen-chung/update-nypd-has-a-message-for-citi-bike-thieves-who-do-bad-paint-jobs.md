<p>As we&apos;ve seen time and again, Citi Bikes are perpetually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825160839/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/citi_bikes_abandoned_in_brooklyn.php">stolen</a>, hidden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825160839/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/24/photo_ues_resident_discovers_hidden.php">in Upper East Side basements</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825160839/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/07/photos_poor_citi_bike_thrown_into_u.php">abandoned in odd places</a>. While Citi Bike administrators might be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825160839/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/24/citi_bike_expanding.php">more concerned about other things</a> than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825160839/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/citi_bike_like_all_whatever.php">recovering stolen bikes</a>, sometimes the NYPD is ON IT&#x2014;as the 109th Precinct in Queens demonstrated yesterday. <b>Update: More details below</b></p>

<p>The Flushing precinct bragged last night:</p>

<p>A tipster tells us the suspect claims he found the Citi Bike in the garbage. We&apos;ve contacted the 109th Precinct and NYPD&apos;s public information office for more information, and we&apos;ll update when we hear back. If we hear back...</p>

<p>If your Citi Bike is lost or stolen, Citi Bike says, &quot;Immediately notify us by calling 1-855-BIKE-311(245-3311). You must do this within 24 hours. The customer service representative you speak with will ask you to fill out a Citi Bike Theft Report form. In addition, we request that you call or visit the police precinct in which the theft occurred within 24 hours to file a theft report. Your credit card may be charged for the cost of recovery or replacement of the bike. Please note, you must contact Citi Bike within 24 hours of the loss or theft of your Citi Bike.&quot; And those suckers are $1,200!</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The NYPD tells us that Xianbo Kong, 68, was arrested for criminal of possession of stolen property. Apparently, at 11:38 a.m., police had responded to a call about &quot;suspicious male on a painted Citibike and observed a male matching  the description on the bike in question. It was determined the serial number on the bike was that of a reported stolen Citibike and the individual was placed under arrest.&quot;</p>
