The explosion killed a woman and severely burned her four daughters, who have been in hospital burn units.  Yesterday, six-year-ld Duaa Al Ghaithi was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080358/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/84818/girl-injured-in-harlem-explosion-leaves-hospital/Default.aspx">the last of the girls to return home</a>, after many months of rehab (she will need many more years of therapy).  According to NY1, she &quot;wears a head-to-toe compression garment 23 hours a day&quot; which also includes gloves.  Duaa&apos;s vocal chords were also damaged, but she said, &quot;I&apos;m a female spiderman.&quot;  Her family has sued the building&apos;s owner and Con Ed; apparently there had been complaints about the smell of gas, but the smell was later masked by fresh paint.</p>
