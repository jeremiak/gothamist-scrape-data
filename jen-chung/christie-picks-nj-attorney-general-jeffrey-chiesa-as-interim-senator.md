                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_06_jchiesa.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130812092513im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_jchiesa.jpg" width="280" height="350"> <br> <i style=" width:280px; ;display:block"> NJ AG Jeffrey Chiesa</i></div> NJ Senator Frank Lautenberg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130812092513/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/senator_frank_lautenberg_long-servi.php">death prompted speculation</a> about what NJ Governor Chris Christie would do, given that the seat is highly coveted by both political parties. Earlier this week, Christie announced the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130812092513/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/christie_outlines_special_elec.html#incart_river">special election would be in October</a> (much to Democrats&apos; outrage because it&apos;ll cost $25 million), and now he&apos;s announced that his pick to fill the seat is NJ&apos;s current Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130812092513/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/christie_names_x_to_fill_us_se.html#incart_m-rpt-1">According to the Star-Ledger</a>:</p><blockquote>Chiesa grew up in in Bound Brook with two younger sisters. His father worked at a chemical plant and died when Chiesa was 8, leaving his mother -- a public school teacher-- to raise him and his two sisters. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1987, and returns every year to see a football game. He earned his law degree from the Catholic University of America in 1990 and a year later joined the Cranford law firm now known as Dughi &amp; Hewit. It was there that he met Christie.<p></p>

<p>Chiesa followed Christie to the U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office in 2002. He became Christie&apos;s trusted eyes and ears, and led some of the office&apos;s most high-profile public corruption cases, like the one against former state Senate president John Lynch. He moved again in 2009 after Christie was elected governor, taking the reins of his transition team.</p></blockquote>Chiesa will not run in the special election.<p></p>
