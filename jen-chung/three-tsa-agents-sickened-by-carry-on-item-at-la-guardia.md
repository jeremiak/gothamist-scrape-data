<p>Three TSA workers at LaGuardia Airport suffered minor injuries this morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033252/http://pix11.com/2017/03/29/3-people-injured-by-hazardous-material-at-laguardia-airport-fdny/">According to PIX 11</a>, &quot;They were harmed when a carry-on bag set off an alarm at a checkpoint at Terminal B, Concourse D.&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY says that it responded to a call at 5:30 a.m. and that the victims complained about irritation to their eyes. The three people were taken to Elmhurst General Hospital. A TSA spokesperson confirmed to Gothamist the injured parties were agents with the administration, and were &quot;[s]ent to hospital for precautionary measures.&quot;</p>

<p>The item was described as an &quot;irritating food material&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033252/http://pix11.com/2017/03/29/3-people-injured-by-hazardous-material-at-laguardia-airport-fdny/">by WABC 7</a>.</p>

<p>Terminal B was closed at 5:49 a.m. &quot;out of caution,&quot; a Port Authority spokeswoman said, adding that it was reopened at 6:27 a.m., &quot;Customers should expect delays for checking in.&quot; </p>
