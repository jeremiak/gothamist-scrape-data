Deadspin editor A.J. Daulerio explained:<blockquote>Last winter, close to the Super Bowl, Ms. Sterger and I were discussing a possible collaboration on the proposed &quot;Deadspin Swimsuit Project,&quot; which turned into a conversation about the whole &quot;athlete dong photo&quot; phenomenon. She claimed that she&apos;s been on the receiving end of several of those types of cell phone interactions by drunk men, some of whom were professional athletes. We later had a phone conversation about who some of the more well-known dong-shot senders were. One person, she claimed, who was very into cell phone-donging her was none other than Brett Favre. </blockquote><br>
After (graphically) describing the photos and voicemails Favre allegedly sent her, Sterger, who insisted she never &quot;met [Favre], saw him,&quot; became wary about divulging the evidence and going on the record. Daulerio agreed not to run the story, &quot;but still persisted because I&apos;m a dick and it&apos;s an incredibly funny story, but one that didn&apos;t really hold any real weight unless she either gave us the A.) photos B.) voicemails C.) attached her name to it.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Daulerio ran the story yesterday, causing much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160556/http://deadspin.com/5604695/your-brett-favre-cock-story-backlash-roundup">agita over sports blogging ethics</a>. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160556/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/05/on-the-fan-deadspin-defends-brett-favre-jenn-sterger-story/">defended himself on WFAN&apos;s Boomer &amp; Carton show</a>, &quot;This obviously isn&#x2019;t the nicest thing in the world to do to Jenn, but I did say I wasn&#x2019;t going to sit on the story forever... I said [to Sterger], &#x2018;I want to move forward with this, can I get your clearance on it?&#x2019; And I interpereted her email back to mean &#x2018;Go ahead.&#x2019;&quot; He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160556/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2010/08/04/2010-08-04_deadspin_reports_favre_sent_xrated_photos.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>What irks me a little bit is when people put us in the same category as The New York Times or you guys. We&apos;ve run rumors and innuendo from the get-go. That&apos;s what we do.</strong>&quot;  </p>
