<p>A boy who lives upstairs from the deli recalled, &quot;I heard &#x2018;bang, bang, bang&#x2019; three times.  thought it was somebody hitting something against the sidewalk outside. I looked out the window and saw people calling the police.&quot;<br>

Police released images of three males wanted for questioning in connection with the killing, as well as video of a vehicle that might have been the one the shooter fled in. </p>
