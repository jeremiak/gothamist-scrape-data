<p>A 49-year-old man who was allegedly threatening cops with a glass bottle died after being hit by a police officer&apos;s stun gun in the Bronx. Investigators say the man went into cardiac arrest after he was Tased and was later pronounced dead.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112174224/http://nypost.com/2016/11/02/man-dies-after-cops-use-taser-on-him/">A neighbor said the man</a> was a &quot;good guy... Never bothered anybody. Didn&#x2019;t think he would go like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that officers from the 45th Precinct responded to a 911 call about an emotionally disturbed person &quot;who was armed with a knife and acting violently at 1840 Mayflower Avenue in the Bronx.&quot; Three officers and a sergeant found the 49-year-old man, who, the NYPD states, &quot;threatened them with a glass bottle.&quot; The sergeant then fired the Taser at the suspect.</p>

<p>A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112174224/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/man-critical-condition-cops-taser-bronx-clash-article-1.2855934">tells the Daily News</a> that after being Tased once, the man got up and allegedly tried to fight the officers, at which point the sergeant Tased him a second time.  </p>

<p>That&apos;s when the man went into cardiac arrest, and the police personnel performed CPR. He was pronounced dead at Einstein Hospital at 7:22 p.m. The NYPD says the incident is being investigated by the Force Investigation Division pending determination of the cause of death.</p>

<p>&quot;He&#x2019;s not an aggressive guy at all, he&#x2019;s a real good man,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112174224/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/man-critical-condition-cops-taser-bronx-clash-article-1.2855934">a neighbor told the Daily News</a>. &quot;He works out in Long Island. He cuts cold cuts &#x2014; he&#x2019;s a deli guy. He was real good with my son. My son called him &#x2018;Big Buddy.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is also looking at the incident to determine whether his office will conduct an investigation. Last month, Schneiderman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112174224/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/deborah_danner_ny_ag.php">announced he would not investigate</a> a police sergeant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112174224/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/deborah_danner_protest.php">who was widely criticized</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112174224/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/19/nypd_killing_edp_bronx.php">fatally shooting a 66-year-old woman</a> who was allegedly threatening officers with a baseball bat. The sergeant had a Taser but used his firearm instead; the Bronx DA&apos;s office is leading the investigation.</p>

<p>Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for the NY Attorney General, said members of the office&apos;s Special Investigations and Prosecutions Unit were dispatched to the scene to review the incident for jurisdiction under the executive order.</p>
