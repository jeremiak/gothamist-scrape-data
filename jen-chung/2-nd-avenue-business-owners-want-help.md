<p>While Upper East Side residents feel it&apos;s been hell without a second subway line, some Second Avenue business owners are feeling the pinch from the MTA&apos;s construction of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110144/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/12/second_avenue_s_5.php">long-awaited Second Avenue Subway</a>.  Yesterday, businesses asked Mayor Bloomberg to give them a hand, by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408110144/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/06/20/2008-06-20_2nd_ave_subway_works_killing_biz-1.html">boosting state legislation aimed at aiding them</a>. </p>

<p>According to the Daily News, the legislation would &quot;give tenants and landlords grants, sales-tax reprieves and property-tax abatements.&quot;  Business owners point to construction crews and equipment on the street and curb as obstacles for potential customers.  Blondie&apos;s Restaurant owner Jill Homorodean, who stopped lunch service because of the lack of foot traffic, said, &quot;It&apos;s just heartbreaking to see my work get run into the ground.&quot; </p>

<p>Crowe&apos;s Nest Bar and Restaurant owner Eddie Crowe told the Post, &quot;Six businesses have closed since the start of construction in April of 2007, and several more are on their last legs.&quot;  However, Bloomberg spokesman said, &quot;There are tangible steps the city is taking to help minimize the temporary impact of the subway construction on businesses, but granting blanket tax abatements would be a mistake, especially given the current pressure on taxpayer dollars.&quot;</p>
