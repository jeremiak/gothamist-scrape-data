<p>Yesterday, the funeral of Mary Richardson Kennedy was held in Bedford, NY. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/fight_over_mary_kennedys_body_betwe.php">The battle over her body</a>, between the Kennedys and Richardsons, was ultimately settled in favor of the Kennedys. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the opportunity to make his case during the eulogy, &quot;I know I did everything I could to help her.&quot; </p>

<p>Mary Kennedy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/mary_kennedy_estranged_wife_of_rfk.php">hanged herself in a barn</a> on her Mt. Kisco property last Wednesday; she and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had been estranged, with RFK filing for divorce in May 2010, around the time of Mary Kennedy&apos;s drunk driving incidents. Her friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/mary_kennedys_friends_blame_rfk_jr.php">blamed RFK&apos;s behavior</a> (his alleged cheating and abandonment) for her decline into drinking and depression. They also cited her concern <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mary-richardson-kennedy-funeral-divided-families-bid-rfk-jr-wife-fairwell-days-suicide-article-1.1081118?localLinksEnabled=false">over sharing custody of their four children</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rfk_jr_in_eu8NSPzLha4OXUYhMPVcXN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">RFK Jr. said in his eulogy</a>,  &quot;The day before she died, she called me and said, &#x2018;You know me better than anyone in the world.&apos; She said, &#x2018;I was such a good girl.&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;I know you are and you still are.&#x2019; She really fought so hard. She had these demons, and she didn&#x2019;t deserve it.&quot;</p>

<p>Kerry Kennedy, RFK&apos;s sister, was best friends with Mary Kennedy, since they met at age 15 in boarding school.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://www.lohud.com/article/20120520/NEWS02/305200065/Mary-Kennedy-s-love-her-children-remembered-funeral?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage">She told reporters</a>, &quot;Mary suffered from depression. I just think about the story of Michael the Archangel who had to battle the forces of evil, who had to battle Satan, who was trying to enter paradise. And that&#x2019;s what Mary did her whole life. She was battling those demons and keeping them out of the paradise that was Mary.&quot; Inside the church, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/nyregion/at-mary-kennedys-funeral-mourners-remember-her-generosity.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">she remembered</a>, &quot;Let&#x2019;s just know it&#x2019;s not her demons, but everything else about Mary that&#x2019;s important and will always abide. So let&#x2019;s not remember her for her despair, but take inspiration from the determination she had to heal her woundedness and all of our woundedness.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, Mary Kennedy&apos;s family had filed a last-minute challenge to block RFK from burying her near the Kennedys&apos; Hyannisport compound, noting that the couple was in the middle of a divorce.  But after the funeral, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rfk_jr_in_eu8NSPzLha4OXUYhMPVcXN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">body was taken to Massachusetts</a>: &quot;On Friday, RFK Jr. bought eight plots at St. Francis Xavier Cemetery, including one for Mary, Maki Monument Co. told The Post.&quot;&#x2014;RFK has two children from his first marriage&#x2014;&quot;Mary&#x2019;s grave is positioned in a new row, a short distance from the Kennedy graves.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Post&apos;s Maureen Callahan has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063851/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/the_real_curse_of_the_kennedys_oD8hoAIqjScISxTvboXfQO?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">withering takedown of the fabled family and the tragedy of Mary Kennedy&apos;s suicide</a>: &quot;Let&#x2019;s just call it what it is: the natural fallout when you&#x2019;re a member of a family riddled with entitled, underachieving drunks, drug addicts and adulterers, whose treatment of women is historically deplorable.&quot;</p>
