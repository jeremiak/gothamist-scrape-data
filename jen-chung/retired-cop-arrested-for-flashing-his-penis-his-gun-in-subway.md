And it turns out the suspect is a retired police officer.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, just before midnight on Monday, a 38-year-old woman on the southbound platform of the Fifth Avenue N/R station &quot;heard a hissing noise beside her. When she looked to see what the noise was, she observed the suspect manipulating his penis outside of his pants.&quot;</p>

<p>The pervert started to leave and the woman began to cry, prompting another man, 41, on the platform to ask what was wrong. After she explained, the man decided to follow the masturbator and film him. </p>

<p>Near the exit, the suspect allegedly &quot;pulled out a black handgun, pointed [it at the man] and told him to mind his own business.&quot;</p>
