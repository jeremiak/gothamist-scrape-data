<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred around 5 p.m. in the food court, with the suspects setting off the fireworks &quot;which caused patrons to panic and run from the scene, resulting in numerous minor injuries.&quot;</p>

<p>One mall-goer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014943/http://www.silive.com/westshore/index.ssf/2016/08/police_activity_reported_in_st.html#incart_river_home_pop">told the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;I was inside the mall and all of a sudden a hundred people start yelling &apos;Get out of the mall, get out of the mall.&apos; ... Let me tell you, it was a scary feeling.&quot; And another said, &quot;I never heard a rumble indoors like that in my life... Talk about a flashback to 9/11. Cops are making everyone leave the mall because they want to make sure it&apos;s fireworks.&quot;</p>
