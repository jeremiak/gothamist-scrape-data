Now it turns out that the victim was a notable transgender performer, Lorena Escalera, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162040/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/transgender_star_dies_in_klyn_blaze_4XtgMXy2kcL5Es9bxiFVAP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">was the &quot;Puerto Rican Beyonc&#xE9;.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Police were called to 47 Furman Avenue around 4 a.m., and it took 65 firefighters over a half hour to battle the blaze.  Residents say that a man who had been driving by alerted them to the fire&#x2014;one told the Post, &quot;He was kicking on everyone&#x2019;s door to let them know there was a fire,&quot; while another who credited the Good Samaritan with saving his life, as well as his girlfriend&apos;s and their baby&apos;s lives, said the man also helped them while they were on the fire escape, &quot;This guy jumps on the rail and pulls it down&#x2014;and he says &#x2018;Give me the baby!&#x2019; so he got the baby and took him down the ladder. He said he was just passing by. I gave him a hug, and he just bounced.&quot;</p>

<p>But while most neighbors emerged from their homes, Escalera, whose stage name was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162040/http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lorena-Lareina-Xtravaganza/150980781590769">Lorena &quot;La&apos;reina&quot; Xtravaganza</a>, was not so lucky: She was found &quot;unconscious and unresponsive&quot; and declared dead by emergency responders.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162040/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/nyregion/woman-in-group-of-transgender-performers-dies-in-brooklyn-fire.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Though the fire has been deemed suspicious, investigators have found no evidence of accelerant, said one law enforcement official&quot; and are awaiting word from the FDNY. The Times adds, &quot;The victim&#x2019;s roommates said that when work was done on the electrical system, they created holes around the electrical outlets and filled them with cardboard, the official said.&quot;</p>

<p>Escalera had apparently brought two men back to her apartment, but it&apos;s unclear where they are now. One neighbor said that Escalera was an escort and promoted her services online, &#x201C;She was always on her laptop posting ads about herself. Still, she was a nice person.&quot;   The Good Samaritan reportedly told one of the residents that he saw two men arguing outside the building at the time of the fire.</p>

<p>Escalera described herself on Facebook, &quot;Im Very honest,simple n Humble Person... i always believe in &apos;RESPECT&apos;&quot;.</p>
