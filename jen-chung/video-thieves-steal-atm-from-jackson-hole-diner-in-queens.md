<p>A pair of enterprising thieves made off with an entire ATM from a restaurant on Astoria Boulevard last week. Here you can see one of them taking the money machine on video.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the burglary occurred at 4:25 a.m. on July 8 at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821145448/http://www.yelp.com/biz/jackson-hole-jackson-heights">Jackson Hole Diner</a> at 69-35 Astoria Boulevard. One suspect entered the diner&#x2014;by breaking the window on the door and crawling through&#x2014;and removed the ATM while another suspect waited outside as the lookout. </p>
