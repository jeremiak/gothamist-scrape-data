<p>Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers student who was found guilty of spying on his freshman roommate Tyler Clementi, will not be deported.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303703004577474970853967002.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTTopStories">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said</a>, &quot;Based on a review of Mr. Ravi&apos;s criminal record, ICE is not initiating removal proceedings at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>n September 2010, Ravi had set up a webcam in the dorm room he shared with Clementi and viewed Clementi and Clementi&apos;s guest during intimate encounters, and shared a link (unsuccessfully) to view the livestream via Twitter. Clementi killed himself by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/rutgers_students_appalled_over_vide.php">jumping off the George Washington Bridge</a> the day after the second time he was filmed. While prosecutors have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/trial_of_tyler_clementis_roommate_b.php"> portrayed Ravi as homophobic</a>, his lawyer and the witnesses speaking on his behalf said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/family_friends_of_dharun_ravi.html">was not homophobic</a>, instead claiming he was simply acting immaturely. But jurors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/justice_has_been_served_for_tyler_c.php">agreed with prosecutors</a>, finding that Ravi invaded Clementi&apos;s and his guest&apos;s privacy twice and meant to intimidate Clementi when he spied a second time.</p>

<p>Judge Glenn Berman had sentenced Ravi, who is in the country legally but is not a U.S. citizen (he was born in India), to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/dharun_ravi_to_be_sentenced_for_spy.php">30 days in prison</a>, pointing out that he&apos;ll also serve 300 hours of community service. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/judge_dharun_ravi_shouldnt_be_in_pr.php">Berman said</a>, &quot;I can&#x2019;t find it in me to remand him to state prison that houses people convicted of offenses such as murder, armed robbery and rape. I don&#x2019;t believe that that fits this case. I believe that he has to be punished, and he will be.&quot;</p>

<p>Seton Hall Law professor Lori Nessel told the Wall Street Journal, &quot;It doesn&apos;t surprise me, given the sentence that he ultimately received. If he had gotten a much longer sentence then it might have put a lot more pressure or made it much harder for ICE not to move to deport him.&quot;</p>

<p>Ravi only<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032008/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/29/finally_dharun_ravi_apologizes_for.php"> apologized after he was sentenced</a>; Clementi&apos;s grieving parents believe his words were meaningless, &quot;We are concerned that the sentence of probation simply disregarded the unanimous verdicts of twelve jury members on these serious charges, that it disregarded the applicable law, that it missed a valuable opportunity to reinforce the message that our society takes these types of crimes seriously, and that we will act decisively to protect individuals&apos; privacy and human dignity.&quot;</p>
