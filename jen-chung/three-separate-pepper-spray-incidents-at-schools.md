NY1 has the rundown:  The first was at A. Philiip Randolph Campus High School in Harlem.  It&apos;s unclear what the circumstances were, but one student was taken to a hospital with chest pains while 16 others had burning eyes and itchy throats.  The second was at a Chelsea high school, where a &quot;14-year-old sprayed pepper spray in the cafeteria&quot;; five students were taken to the hospital for treatment and the 14-year-old was arrested.  The final one was at St. Francis Prep in Queens, where a &quot;student claimed it fell out of her purse and discharged.&quot;  She was taken into custody as 11 people were taken to hospitals.</p>
