</div></div>					<p>Around 4:30 a.m. this morning, a tractor-trailer flipped over on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in Brooklyn, causing hours of delays and backups. Photos show the tractor-trailer sprawled across the eastbound lanes, with its cargo on the road:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828112539/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=resources/traffic&amp;id=9488641">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;The cab of the truck was hanging over the guardrail, above the southbound lanes. Tow trucks arrived on the scene and dragged the truck entirely back onto the northbound section, but the roof broke open and spilled the contents onto the roadway... The truck was uprighted just after 6:30 a.m. and removed by 7:30, but debris and a fuel spill still littered the roadway.&quot; Sand has been put on top of the fuel spill&#x2014;and there are still extensive delays.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear why the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828112539/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/02/overnight-bqe-crash-snarls-morning-commute/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">tractor-trailer driver lost control</a>.
