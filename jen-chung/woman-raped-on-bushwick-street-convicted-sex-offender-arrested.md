<p>A convicted sex offender is in custody for allegedly raping a woman at knifepoint in Brooklyn on Tuesday. The suspect, 52-year-old Michael Mann, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014958/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/sex-offender-grilled-cops-brooklyn-woman-raped-article-1.2755669">reportedly</a> told her, &quot;I will stick you,&quot; and said he had seen her in the neighborhood before. Police subsequently caught Mann because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014958/http://nypost.com/2016/08/18/convicted-sex-offender-accidentally-calls-911-on-himself/">he called 911 and asked cops for a ride.</a></p>

<p>The 27-year-old victim, who had been walking home from the Kosciuszko Street J station, was near Dekalb and Bushwick Avenues at 2:30 a.m. on August 16th, when Mann allegedly approached her, brandished a knife, demanded her property, and raped her. He then fled in an unknown direction.  </p>

The man took her property, kissed her and raped her before giving her back the property.&quot; Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014958/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/sex-offender-grilled-cops-brooklyn-woman-raped-article-1.2755669">tell the Daily News</a> that Mann &quot;promised to return the items &apos;if you do what I say,&apos;&quot; and then raped her at knifepoint. Then he gave her back her property but allegedly warned her that he had seen her around the neighborhood and would kill her if she called the police.</p>

Yesterday, Mann, who previously served 17 years in prison for rape, called 911 from a payphone. When officers arrived, they noticed his red sneakers. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014958/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/18/brooklyn-rape-arrest/">NYPD Deputy Inspector Maximo Tolentino said</a>, &quot;The officers realized this is the guy. They said, &#x2018;Listen, we&#x2019;ll give you a ride but we have a department policy that we don&#x2019;t let someone get into a car unless we know what someone has in their pockets.&#x2019; They said, &#x2018;Do you have anything that can harm us?&#x2019; And he said, &#x2018;I have a knife&#x2019; and he pulled it out of his pocket.&quot;</p>

<p>Mann was arrested and hit with multiple charges, including rape, robbery, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon plus charges related to his Level 3 sex offender status, such as failure to appear to 90 day address verification and failure to report change of address within 10 days.</p>
