<p>One World Trade Center is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105452/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/photos_one_world_trade_center_so_ta.php">officially New York City&apos;s tallest building, at 1271 feet</a>, today, and the Empire State Building is tipping its hat (or crown?) to its big buddy.  Per the ESB&apos;s press people:</p><blockquote>The Empire State Building will shine red, white and blue on Monday, April 30, 2012 in honor of 1 World Trade Center.<br>
 <br>
As 1 World Trade Center officially becomes New York&#x2019;s tallest building, the Empire State Building, the world&#x2019;s most famous office building and ancestor of all super-tall towers, welcomes its newer, taller cousin to the New York City skyline and salutes her.</blockquote><p></p>
