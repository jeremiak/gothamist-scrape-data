<p>Harlem&apos;s ATLAH Worldwide Missionary Church seems to actively court controversy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140327015415/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/26/video_harlem_church_angry_at_obama.php">with his anti-Obama and anti-gay stances</a> broadcast to the neighborhood via the church sign. So it doesn&apos;t seem <em>that</em> surprising when the NYPD announced the church was vandalized over the weekend. </p>

<p>On Saturday, just after midnight, police say a suspect climbed over the locked church fence at 38 West 123rd Street. The suspect &quot;removed letters from the church board and spray painted graffiti on the board.&quot;</p>
