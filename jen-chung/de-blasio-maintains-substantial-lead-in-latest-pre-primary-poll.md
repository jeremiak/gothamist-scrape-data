<p>While it&apos;s not a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912093800/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/03/smackdown_de_blasio_has_43_in_lates.php">run-off proof number</a>, the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912093800/http://maristpoll.marist.edu/99-final-countdown-de-blasio-leads-closest-competitors-for-new-york-city-mayor-by-wide-margin/">Marist mayoral poll shows</a> that Public Advocate Bill de Blasio&apos;s late surge is holding strong: He&apos;s got 36%, while City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and former Comptroller Biill Thompson each have 20%. </p>

<p>Rounding out the poll are Anthony Weiner with 7%, John Liu with 5%, and Sal Albanese and Erick Salgado, both with 1%. Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, says, &quot;Bill de Blasio leads Quinn among women and Thompson among African Americans. His campaign is being fueled by Democratic voters&#x2019; dislike of extending term limits, the policy of stop and frisk, and of course, the Dante effect.&quot; Here are some other Marist notes:</p><blockquote>De Blasio does better among likely Democratic voters who are both white and liberal &#x2014; 43%.  He does well among likely Democratic voters in Brooklyn &#x2014; 40% &#x2014; and Manhattan &#x2014; 40%.  De Blasio also does well among likely Democratic voters who are African American &#x2014; 39%, men &#x2014; 38%, voters 45 or older &#x2014; 38%, or those who consider themselves to be strong Democrats &#x2014; 38%.<p></p>

<p>Although Quinn does not lead among any group of likely Democratic voters, she does well among those who live in Manhattan &#x2014; 30%, those who are Jewish &#x2014; 29%, or those who are white Catholics &#x2014; 26%.</p>

<p>Thompson also does not lead among any group of likely Democratic voters.  However, he does well among those who live in the Bronx &#x2014; 26%, those who live in union households &#x2014; 26%, and those who are African American &#x2014; 25%.</p></blockquote>A candidate needs 40% of the primary vote to avoid a runoff. Analysts say that in runoff scenarios with de Blasio v. Quinn and de Blasio v. Thompson, de Blasio wins both. <p></p>

<p>The poll ended on Friday night&#x2014;before Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s comments that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912093800/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/bloomberg_calls_bill_de_blasio_camp.php">de Blasio&apos;s campaign was racist</a> for showing his mixed-race family. Naturally, de Blasio&apos;s campaign is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912093800/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/08/video_bill_de_blasio_responds_to_bl.php">having a good time with that</a>.</p>
