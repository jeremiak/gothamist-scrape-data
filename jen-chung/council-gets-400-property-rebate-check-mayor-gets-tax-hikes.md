<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103738im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_12_blqui.jpg" class="right">According to numerous reports, Mayor Bloomberg has agreed to issue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103738/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/12/bloomberg_agrees_to_mail_400_t.html">the $400 property rebate checks</a> to homeowners, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103738/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/10/report_bloomberg_quinn_fight_over_4.php">win for the City Council</a> <i>except</i> that in exchange for the checks, the Council agreed to raise both the property tax (by 7%) and hotel room tax. The Staten Island Advance says, &quot;<strong>If the city&apos;s Department of Finance begins printing them immediately, homeowners should receive their rebate checks shortly after the new year, around the same time they will get their new property tax bills</strong>.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103738/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/nyregion/18city.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times also adds</a> that Bloomberg will not cut $20 million from the budget and some Council members expect to vote on the agreement today (though they warned that the deal could collapse).  Some numbers: The property rebate checks cost the city $256 million; raising the property taxes to 7% in January (instead of June, as previously planned) means an additional $600 million for the fiscal year; and the hotel room tax hike brings an additional $100 million between March 2009 and June 2010.</p>
