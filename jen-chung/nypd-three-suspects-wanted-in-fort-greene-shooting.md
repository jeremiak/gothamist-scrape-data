<p>The police are hoping the public can help them find three men wanted for a shooting that took place in Brooklyn on August 15th.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the shooting happened around 1:50 a.m. on Dekalb Avenue and Clermont Avenue in the confines of the 88th Precinct. Suspect #2, seen in the top left photo, apparently handed suspect #1, the one in the top right photo, a gun at the corner. Then suspects #2 and #3 entered a location where the victim was: &quot;As the victim leaves and walks towards his vehicle he is approached by Suspect #1 who fires multiple times at the victim striking him one time in the buttocks.&quot; The victim was taken to Brooklyn Hospital in stable condition.</p>
