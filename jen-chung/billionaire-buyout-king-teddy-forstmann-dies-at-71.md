Forstmann, whose empire included the entertainment management company IMG and was a frequent tabloid name&#x2014;thanks to relationships with Princess Diana, Elizabeth Hurley and, most recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053845/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/30/padma_lakshmis_baby_daddy_drama_and.php">Padma Lakshmi</a>&#x2014;had been diagnosed with brain cancer earlier this year.  <p></p>

<p>Forstmann grew up in a wealthy Greenwich, CT family, &quot;as an heir to one of the nation&#x2019;s biggest textile dynasties&quot; and graduated from Yale, but his family&apos;s fortunes crumbled and he &quot;was left to attend Columbia University &#x2019;s law school in 1962 on a $150 a month trust fund,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053845/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/finance_great_ted_forstmann_is_dead_85MvflREPRsnvrFXSAODsJ#ixzz1eM54v7JU">according to the Post</a>. </p>

<p>After working in a number of investment firms, he and his brother opened up their own firm: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053845/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/business/theodore-j-forstmann-a-takeover-pioneer-dies-at-71.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries">NY Times&apos; obituary notes</a>, &quot;Mr. Forstmann was among the first executives to use debt to acquire companies, fix them and then sell them for millions &#x2014; and sometimes billions &#x2014; of dollars in profit. Beginning in the late 1970s, he pooled money from wealthy investors and large pension funds to back his acquisitions while taking 20 percent of the profits, creating a business model that today is known as the private equity industry.&quot; Some of the companies he bought and sold included Dr. Pepper, General Instrument, Topps, and Gulfstream.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053845/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204443404577050401913314514.html?mod=WSJ_hps_RIGHTTopCarousel_4">Wall Street Journal&apos;s obituary</a>: </p>

<blockquote> Buyouts surged in size in the late 1980s, and rivals completed huge deals using junk bonds&#x2014;those rated below investment-grade&#x2014;and riskier debt as currency. Mr. Forstmann lashed out, predicting the deals would end badly.

<p>&quot;It&apos;s funny money. It&apos;s wampum,&quot; he was quoted as saying in the 1990 book &quot;Barbarians at the Gate,&quot; which chronicles the takeover fight for RJR Nabisco, a battle Mr. Forstmann&apos;s firm lost to rival Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. after declining to raise its acquisition bid.</p>

<p>He is credited with coining the famous phrase that gave the bestselling book its title. According to co-author John Helyar, Mr. Forstmann&apos;s RJR Nabisco bid would involve taking on those who would fund their bids with junk bonds. The image formed in his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;The junk bond hordes are at the city gates ...This is where we could stand at the bridge and push the barbarians back. Wouldn&apos;t that be phenomenal?&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Forstmann had been more interested in giving away his wealth in recent years. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053845/http://givingpledge.org/#ted_forstmann">signed the Giving Pledge, saying</a>, &quot;For many years I&#x2019;ve been quietly doing my own version of &apos;the giving pledge&apos; trying to help disadvantaged children around the world.  I&#x2019;ve always believed that you don&#x2019;t really talk about giving; you just do it. However, Mayor Bloomberg convinced me that by lending my name to &apos;The Giving Pledge&apos; it would help encourage others to participate and would result in helping many needy causes. I&#x2019;ve tried to live by the motto &apos;you save one life and you save the world.&apos;   I hope that by joining &apos;The Giving Pledge&apos; it will encourage others to do the same.&quot;</p>
