<p>As the struggling network is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162423/http://laist.com/2013/03/19/nbc_execs_are_snakes_says_jay_leno.php">dealing with Jay Leno</a>, NBC is apparently planning to bring The Tonight Show back to New York City. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162423/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/business/media/tonight-show-expected-to-return-to-new-york-with-fallon.html?ref=media">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;While the network has yet to complete a deal, it has made a commitment to Jimmy Fallon, the current host of its &#x201C;Late Night&#x201D; program, to have him succeed Jay Leno as the next host of &#x201C;Tonight,&apos;&#x2019; according to several senior television executives involved in the decision.&quot;</p>

<p>Also: &quot;Some details remain to be worked out, including an exact timetable for the switch, though it is expected to take place by the fall of 2014 at the latest, the executives said in interviews this week.&quot; NBC famously brought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162423/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/10/nbc_confirms_lenos_back_to_late-nig.php">Leno back to host The Tonight Show in 2010</a> (they gave him a prime-time show, which bombed), unceremoniously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162423/http://laist.com/2010/01/18/photos_rally_for_conan_draws_hundre.php#photo-1">dumping Conan O&apos;Brien</a>.</p>

<p>Leno has lately been mocking NBC during The Tonight Show, upsetting executives like Robert Greenblatt who sent Leno <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162423/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/nbc-executive-and-leno-said-to-have-clashed-over-jokes/?hp">emails complaining about jokes</a> like &quot;It&#x2019;s so bad, &#x2018;The Biggest Loser&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t just a TV show anymore; it&#x2019;s our new motto.&quot;  So on Monday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162423/http://laist.com/2013/03/19/nbc_execs_are_snakes_says_jay_leno.php">Leno snarked</a>, &quot;You know the whole legend of St. Patrick, right? St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland&#x2014;and then they came to the United States and became NBC executives. It&apos;s a fascinating story.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently NBC has been &quot;quietly&quot; building a new studio at 30 Rock. The Times notes, &quot;A move to New York would return &#x201C;Tonight&#x201D; to its roots, after an absence of more than four decades. Beginning in 1954 the show was taped every evening at 30 Rock, first with Mr. Allen as host, followed by Jack Paar and Johnny Carson. But Mr. Carson, looking for easier access to Hollywood guests, as well as a different lifestyle, moved the show permanently to Burbank in 1972.&quot;  </p>

<p>Anyway, guess we&apos;ll be seeing the History of Rap, Parts VI-X on The Tonight Show:</p>
