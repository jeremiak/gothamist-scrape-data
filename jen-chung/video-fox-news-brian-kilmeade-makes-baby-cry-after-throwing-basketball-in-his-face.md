<p>Fox &amp; Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade is regularly depicted as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814150233/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/05/videos_zach_galifianakis_brings_the.php#photo-2">basically an overgrown idiot child</a>. So is it any surprise that he tossed a basketball into the face of a two-year-old during this morning&apos;s show, making the baby cry?</p>

<p>Perhaps Kilmeade is acting out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814150233/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hasselbeck-heads-fox-news-article-1.1394312">because he&apos;s got a new co-host</a>? Elisabeth Hasselback, keep your kids away from him!</p>
