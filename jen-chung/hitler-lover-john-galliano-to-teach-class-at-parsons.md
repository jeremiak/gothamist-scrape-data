<p>Finally, young fashion designers get to learn from a man who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061544/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/designer_john_galliano_found_guilty.php">convicted of antisemitism</a> in France and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061544/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/hitler-lover_john_galliano_dresses.php">dressed as a Hasidic Jew earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_04_emotion2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_emotion2.jpg" width="250" height="386"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> Show Me Emotion!</i></div> Bad-boy fashion designer John Galliano will be teaching a &quot;masterclass&quot; at Parsons in a class called &quot;SHOW ME EMOTION!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061544/http://www.luckymag.com/blogs/luckyrightnow/2013/04/galliano-parsons">According to Lucky</a>, &quot;&apos;SHOW ME EMOTION!&apos; seeks to engage its participants by provoking the power of emotion in context of fashion practice and exploration of intuitive, perceptive manners of investigational making.&quot; Also, the class &quot;includes a 3-day workshop with the designer and a final day of critique and conversation with Galliano and Simon Collins, Dean of the School of Fashion.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Of course, showing emotion is what made Galliano&apos;s fashion shows (both for his own label and Christian Dior) so great, and what also killed his career&#x2014;at a Parisian cafe, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061544/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/john_galliano_fired_from_dior_after.php">called another patron a &quot;dirty Jew face&quot;</a> and said things like &quot;I love Hitler... People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, would all be f****** gassed.&quot; Maybe he&apos;ll teach students that being a bigoted jerk is a career killer?</p>

<p>The New School told Lucky, &quot;An invaluable part of a Parsons education is the opportunity to learn from the world&apos;s leading designers, from Donna Karan and Diane Von Furstenberg to Olivier Theyskens. The planned master class with John Galliano will be a dynamic and intimate opportunity for our students to learn from an immensely talented designer.  We believe that over the past two years Galliano has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions, and as part of this workshop, <strong>Parsons students will have the opportunity to engage in a frank conversation with Mr. Galliano about the challenges and complications of leading a design house in the 21st century</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061544/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/hitler-lover_john_galliano_dresses.php">ever took up the offer to visit Williamsburg</a> to meet Holocaust survivors and see the clothing they wear.</p>
