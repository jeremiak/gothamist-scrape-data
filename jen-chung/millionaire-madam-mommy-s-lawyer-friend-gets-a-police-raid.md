<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:320px; "> <img alt="2012_02_raidgristina.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210744im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_raidgristina.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <br> <i>Photograph of police with items from the office by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210744/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120316/downtown/cops-raid-lawyer-connected-millionaire-madam-anna-gristina">DNAinfo</a></i></div> A lawyer in lower Manhattan got a rude awakening yesterday when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210744/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120316/downtown/cops-raid-lawyer-connected-millionaire-madam-anna-gristina">police descended on 225 Broadway to raid his offices</a>.  Apparently David Jaroslawicz has some financiai dealings with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210744/http://gothamist.com/tags/annagristina">Anna Gristina</a>, the alleged &quot;Millionaire Madam&quot; and mother of four... like how his office was listed in paperwork for the Upper East Side address prosecutors say is Gristina&apos;s brothel.  And how  an LLC connected to his office owns the property where Gristina and her family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210744/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120307/NEWS/203070322&amp;cid=sitesearch">live in Monroe, NY</a>.<p></p>

<p>Jaroslawicz&apos;s own lawyer told DNAinfo, &quot;The prosecutor was very clear that [Jaroslawicz] is not the target of the investigation in any way so there&apos;s no indication that he&apos;s been involved in any wrongdoing. There&apos;s no indication that he&apos;s furthering the business in any way and he does not own the brothel.&quot; But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210744/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/raid_on_madam_crony_EUqmZGIXLUrBeUuxxxl82N?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">Post reports</a> that prosecutor Charles &quot;Linehan at Gristina&#x2019;s Feb. 23 arraignment told a judge that the alleged escort queen has a lawyer pal who helped her hide cash and owned the East 78th Street building where Gristina ran her &apos;brothel.&apos; &apos;We believe he has basically locked money away for her,&apos; Linehan added.&quot;  </p>

<p>Gristina has been held at Rikers on $2 million bail. Though her defense insists that she doesn&apos;t have the money, prosecutors cite recordings where she&apos;s mentioned having money overseas as well as connected friends in law enforcement who will tip her off about investigations.</p>

<p>In the mean time, three people were arrested for their involvement in the alleged operation and are supposedly cooperating: Two women, &quot;Catherine DeVries and Mhairiangela Bottone, have been charged with prostituting themselves at the E. 78th St. condo on July 27,&quot; and Jonas Gayer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210744/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/irs-worker-jonas-gayer-money-man-manhattan-madam-scandal-article-1.1040947"> is accused of being the person laundering money for Gristina</a>.</p>
