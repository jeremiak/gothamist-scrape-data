<p>According to the NYPD, at 1:15 a.m. on March 24th, a 25-year-old woman heard a knock on her door. The person, speaking in Spanish, said he was the super and said there was an emergency in her apartment&#x2014;and then said it was a gas leak. The woman opened the door and found the suspect holding a gun. </p>

<p>He told her to be quiet, police say, and then struck her on the head with the gun before raping her. The suspect fled afterwards. The victim was treated at an area hospital.</p>
