<p>Nederlander&apos;s romantic travails have been very public:  In 1998, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160210/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/style/weddings-jessica-sklar-eric-nederlander.html">married Jessica Sklar</a>, who left him three weeks later after meeting Jerry Seinfeld.  In 2004, he married Lindsey Kupferman, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160210/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E5D9123EF93BA15752C1A9629C8B63">NY Times reported</a> him as saying, his tabloid-ready dumping was &quot;Extremely difficult... It&apos;s not something you forget easily, if you ever do. I feel very fortunate that Lindsey came along. When I met her, everything fell into place.&quot;  But then they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160210/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/item_eI2hYOIuwI4iuCjjX2PGbJ;jsessionid=56DB3CFE85E078B3516F2F67C1504A22">broke up in 2008</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160210/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/broadway_scion_eric_nederlander_mhX8tOu45RFSXtpuZp7vwI">Post says</a> that Kupferman was given an order of protection against him &quot;based upon a finding of danger to person or property and domestic violence.&quot;</p>

<p>Okun previously had a limited order of protection against Nederlander, but his lawyer said, &quot;There are serious issues undermining the complainant&#x2019;s credibility.&quot; The News adds, &quot;A source said Nederlander may have gotten a key to Okun&#x2019;s apartment from the doorman and let himself in while she dozed after midnight. Prosecutors said he checked her cell phone and then attacked her.&quot; While a judge did allow him out of $5000 cash bond (vs. the prosecutors&apos; requested $15,000 cash bail), he did give Okun a full order of protection. </p>
