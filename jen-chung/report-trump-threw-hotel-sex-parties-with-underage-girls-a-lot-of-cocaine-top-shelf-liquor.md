<p>Now that Donald Trump&apos;s zeal for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">kissing and groping</a> unsuspecting women is out in the open, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/gloria_allred_trump.php">more and more stories</a> of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/more_trump_groping_claims.php">loathsome behavior</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/trump_groping_us_open.php">have</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://laist.com/2016/10/14/summer_zervos_trump.php">emerged</a>. The latest comes from Michael Gross, chronicler of New York City&apos;s high-life, who spoke with two men who say Trump was known for throwing debauched hotel parties with underage girls and much older men. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/24/inside-donald-trump-s-one-stop-parties-attendees-recall-cocaine-and-very-young-models.html"> In the Daily Beast, Gross writes</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry, Ivanka, I really am, but here&#x2019;s the sad truth: Your dad&#x2019;s not a dog. He&#x2019;s a pig.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier in the summer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/19/donald-trump-used-model-parties-to-seal-deals-industry-sources-say.html">Gross wrote</a> about &quot;Trump&#x2019;s history as what&#x2019;s commonly referred to as a model-fucker&quot; and how he started a modeling agency as a &quot;date farm&quot;: &quot;In 1999, actor Leonardo di Caprio, by then already a noted modelizer himself, was quoted in the Times of London memorably describing Trump&#x2019;s poser business as &apos;one-stop date-shopping.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_10_delpo2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_10_delpo2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Supporters in Florida (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>In that story, Gross, who has written two books about the fashion industry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://mgross.com/writing/books/model/">one about modeling</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://mgross.com/writing/books/focus/">other about photography</a>, mentioned &quot;meet-and-greet parties Trump threw in a suite at New York&#x2019;s iconic Plaza Hotel.&quot; Now, two men &quot;put Donald Trump in the room with cocaine, very young women and underage girls, and rich, old men there to&#x2014;pardon my language, but if the Times can say pussy on its front page, I can say this&#x2014;fuck them.&quot;</p><blockquote>Young models were attracted to the f&#xEA;tes with a simple, time-tested pitch. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll meet rich guys who will help you,&#x201D; says the photographer. &#x201C;It was networking, but on a weird, bizarre scale.&#x201D; <p></p>

<p>The girls were as young as 15, he says, and &#x201C;over their heads, they had no idea, and they ended up in situations. There were always dramas because the men threw money and drugs at them to keep them enticed. It&#x2019;s based on power and dominating girls who can&#x2019;t push back and can be discarded. There&#x2019;s always someone to pick them back up. Nobody wants to call home and say &#x2018;Help me.&#x2019;&#x201D; </p>

<p>Trump would &#x201C;go from room to room,&#x201D; said the photographer, who added that &#x201C;I was there to party myself. It was guys with younger girls, sex, a lot of sex, a lot of cocaine, top-shelf liquor&#x201D; but no smoking. Trump didn&#x2019;t approve of cigarettes. </p></blockquote>The photographer, who was granted anonymity, said, &quot;Trump was in and out. He&#x2019;d wander off with a couple girls. I saw him. He was getting laid like crazy. Trump was at the heart of it. He loved the attention and in private, he was a total fucking beast.&quot; <p></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_10_deplo3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_10_deplo3.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> This (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The other man who confirmed Trump&apos;s presence was modeling executive (or &quot;wrangler&quot; for the parties) Andy Lucchesi, who said, &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to get him in trouble. I like Donald. I respect the guy. People should want to know about Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton&quot; (Epstein, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/25/billionaire_sex_offender_clarifies.php">billionaire sex offender</a> who is accused of being a pedophile, is good friends with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/30/the-billionaire-pedophile-who-could-bring-down-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton.html">both the former president and our possible future president</a>; for further reading see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/trump_rape_lawsuit.php">this lawsuit accusing Trump</a> of raping a teenager). </p>

<p>Replying to Gross&apos;s question about whether Trump had sex with female guests, Lucchesi said, &quot;So, he&#x2019;s a man with a woman,&quot; and, referring to the ages of the female guests, he said, &quot;A lot of girls, 14, look 24. That&#x2019;s as juicy as I can get. I never asked how old they were; I just partook. I did partake in activities that would be controversial, too.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump has denied sexually assaulting women&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022321/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/24/politics/trump-on-latest-accusations/index.html">he says they are making up stories</a>&#x2014;and claims no one respects women more than him.</p>
