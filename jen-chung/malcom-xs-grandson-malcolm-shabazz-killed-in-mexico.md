<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729114014/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/nyregion/grandson-of-malcolm-x-said-to-have-died-in-mexico.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">The Times reports</a>, &quot;He was jailed and released after four years, but was incarcerated again shortly afterward for attempted robbery. He joined a gang, he said in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729114014/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/06/nyregion/for-malcolm-x-s-grandson-a-clouded-path.html?ref=malcolmshabazz&amp;pagewanted=1]">2003 profile in The New York Times</a>, but also worked with Ms. Williams, a publicist and author, speaking with teenagers and warning them to avoid drugs and gang life.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729114014/http://www.malcolmshabazz.blogspot.com/">Shabazz&apos;s website says</a>, &quot;Malcolm is the first male heir of Malcolm X. However, this young man has developed into his own as he has overcome obstacle after obstacle in his life. Since his release from prison a few years ago he has been traveling throughout the US and around the world speaking to different audiences about the struggles that confront this generation. Malcolm is a humble, passionate and forceful speaker who&#x2019;s emerging as a voice for our generation as a writer in the process of publishing his first 2 books.&quot; A March entry notes how he was prohibited from traveling to Iran for a film festival:</p><blockquote>&quot;In the beginning of 2012 I had been informed that I was under investigation by the F.B.I.&apos;s Counter Terrorism Task Force Unit located in Goshen, N.Y... I was picked up by authorities after I filed for a visa to Iran, and 2 days prior to my departure. A detective squad from the City of Middletown Police Department surrounded me in the street about 2 blocks from where I was residing. They asked me my name, and I gave them an alias, but they were already well aware of who I actually was. I didn&apos;t tell them my real name because I didn&apos;t know what was going on. When I was brought before a Judge of City of Middletown court I was surprised to be informed that I was being charged with Grand Larceny, and False Impersonation charge. Then I was sent to jail, and told to appear again 7 days later. Then following court date the bogus charge of Grand Larceny, which they only put to justify stopping me in first place, was dropped. And they left me to face the False Impersonation. I was offered 90 days for the offense of giving the authorities the wrong name which I declined before bailing out after 2 weeks.&quot;</blockquote>The Amsterdam News, which says that Shabazz denied setting the fire in recent years, reports, &quot;Malcolm Shabazz was in the process of writing two books, at least one of which was a manuscript, and he was attending John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.&quot;<p></p>
