We just want to do our business and go about our day without having to think about things like this.&quot;</p>

<p>The news channel also aired a photograph of him&#x2014;wearing a &quot;I &#x2665; Asian Girls&quot; t-shirt&#x2014;from his Facebook page during its segment:</p>

<p>Of course, Sholder is (allegedly!) only one of a long line of creeps who love to take upskirt pics at the busy downtown subway station&#x2014;some examples:</p>

<p><strong>2013:</strong> A jerk tried to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309132246/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/26/watch_out_for_upskirt_pervs_with_an.php">conceal his iPod Touch with a plastic bag</a> as he took upskirt pictures.</p>

<p><strong>2012: </strong>A Mount Sinai <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309132246/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/03/former_tsa_agent_caught_alleged_ups.php">urologist was found</a> to have taken upskirt pictures with a secret camera in a pen. Cops ultimately found many upskirt videos in his possession. The doctor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309132246/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/upskirt_urologist_gets_off.php">avoided jail time but lost his job</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2011:</strong> A man was caught <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309132246/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/05/men_named_edgar_more_likely_to_upsk.php">&quot;salivating&quot; over his upskirt pics</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2011: </strong>A cop questioned a man with a pen camera at an Occupy Wall Street protest and he admitted he had taken upskirt pictures in Union Square. Then, while out on bail, he took many more upskirt photos from numerous subway stations; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309132246/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/technology-sends-perv-cam-cases-soaring-article-1.1194482">Daily News says timestamps started</a> at 8 a.m. and ended at 9 p.m.</p>

<p><strong>2009: </strong>A man had wired his boots (!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309132246/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/10/cops_find_upskirt_perv_suspect_in_u.php">with cameras to take secret photos</a>.</p>

<p>So ladies, remember, as the weather gets better, more perverts will be on the loose.</p>
