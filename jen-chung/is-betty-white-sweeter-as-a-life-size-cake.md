<p>Last night, everyone&apos;s favorite granny Betty White was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161205/http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/05/16/betty-white-friars-club-roast/">roasted at the Friar&apos;s Club</a>, where she entered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161205/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/betty-white-is-roasted-but-everyone-is-skewered/">via a white pony</a> and was feted with off-color jokes.  For instance, Jeffrey Ross referenced her Snickers commercial, &quot;I thought Kim Kardashian was the only one who got famous for putting chocolate in her mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>There was more chocolate at the festivities&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161205/http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/cake-boss">Cake Boss Buddy Valastro</a> and his Carlo&apos;s Bakery team created a life-size Betty White cade: &quot;The 5&apos; 2&quot; creation, made of vanilla cake with buttercream, covered in modeling chocolate, shows Betty accompanied by an edible silver fox, a nod to her love of animals - and of the theme of the roast. The bottom of the cake carries one of the Friars mottos, &apos;WE ONLY ROAST THE ONES WE LOVE.&apos;&quot; </p>
