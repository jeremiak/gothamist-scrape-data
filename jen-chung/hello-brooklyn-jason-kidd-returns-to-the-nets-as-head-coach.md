	<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://gothamist.com/tags/jasonkidd">Jason Kidd</a>, one of best point guards in NBA history and a longtime former New Jersey Net, will be the Brooklyn Nets&apos; new coach. Nets principal owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://www.nba.com/nets/news/brooklyn-nets-name-jason-kidd-head-coach">Mikahil Prokhorov said</a>, &quot;Jason Kidd has a long and legendary history with the Nets and with the city of New York. He has the fire in the belly we need, and has achieved as a player everything the Brooklyn Nets are striving to achieve. We believe he will lead us there. Welcome home, Jason.&quot;</p>

<p>Kidd, who spent the past season as a New York Knick before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/jason_kidd_retires_after_nineteen_s.php">announcing his retirement </a>earlier this month, said, &quot;This is a tremendous opportunity to be named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets, and it&apos;s a role I have been studying for over the course of my playing days. Championship teams are built on being prepared, playing unselfishly and being held accountable, and that&apos;s how I expect to coach this basketball team. I am truly excited about this next phase of my basketball career.&quot; </p>

<p>The 40-year-old has a 2011 NBA championship ring from his time with the Dallas Mavericks and also led the New Jersey Nets to back-to-back NBA finals in 2002 (Lakers won in 4) and 2003 (Spurs won in 6). During the 2002 playoffs, Kidd and the Indiana Pacers&apos; Reggie Miller faced off in an epic double overtime Game 5 first round meeting:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/q51UYp0fRjs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Kidd has no prior coaching experience, but he&apos;s always been an intelligent player, which lends himself to being a good coach. Plus, he&apos;s also been described by other players as being like a coach on the floor. According to the Post, &quot;Kidd impressed everybody who listened with his enthusiasm and passion, and with his unbridled desire for the job. His fire came through again in his first job-related statement that also reflected how he played &#x2014; which was to make everyone around him better.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/9378352/jason-kidd-hired-new-coach-brooklyn-nets">ESPN&apos;s source says</a> that he &quot;didn&apos;t just come in and puff out his chest. He got up on the board and drew up plays and showed he had command of what he wanted to do on offense. He had good knowledge of the personnel, and explained his philosophy.&quot; (The Daily News&apos; Mike Lupica is crowing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/lupica-finding-new-leader-nets-old-guard-article-1.1371101">about how he broke the news</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://www.netsdaily.com/2013/6/12/4424770/marc-stein-brooklyn-nets-on-verge-of-hiring-jason-kidd">Nets Daily wrote</a>:</p><blockquote>In what can only be described as a bold move, the Nets decided on Kidd despite the risks associated with giving a player, even as one as great as Kidd, the run of their franchise without the benefit of any coaching experience.<p></p>

<p> The Nets understood those risks, but team insiders pointed out that there are risks for Kidd as well. The Nets have shown a willingness to give coaches the hook and note he left $6 million on the table when he retired from the Knicks. Moreover, they point to the recent example of Mark Jackson who aided by experienced assistants and a supportive ownership, turned that franchise around.</p></blockquote>  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324688404578542142619673244.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal points out</a>, &quot;He&apos;s yet to name any assistants, but it is a safe bet that he&apos;ll have considerable experience next to him on the bench. Former Nets head coach Lawrence Frank figures to be a target, and a handful of other men who have held head coaching jobs&#x2014;who can help walk Kidd through the process of what it takes&#x2014;are certain to be put into consideration.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s a highlight reel:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/Egd5Tr0_ldk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Of course, Kidd&apos;s off-tactic antics give some pause&#x2014;he apparently likes to go out with players and have a drink (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092613/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/after_partying_at_hamptons_club_jas.php#photo-3">many and then crash his car into a lightpole</a>), which is something he cannot do as a coach. Maybe he can just take Citi Bike home.</p>
