The CDC also said the child had recently traveled to Mexico.  Acting CDC chief Dr. Richard Besser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507075024/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/30471035/">told the Today Show</a>, &quot;Even though we&apos;ve been expecting [that there would be some deaths], it is very, very sad. As a pediatrician and a parent, my heart goes out to the family.&quot;  He added, &quot;I don&apos;t think it (the reported death in Texas) indicates any change in the strain. We see with any flu virus a spectrum of disease symptoms... It&apos;s very important that people take their concern and channel it into action...it is crucial that people understand what they need to do if symptoms appear.&quot;  Here&apos;s the CDC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507075024/http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/swineflu_you.htm">Swine Flu &amp; You website</a>, which points out, &quot;Children, especially younger children, might potentially be contagious for longer periods.&quot;  (Children are also very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507075024/http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm">vulnerable to the seasonal flu</a>.)</p>
