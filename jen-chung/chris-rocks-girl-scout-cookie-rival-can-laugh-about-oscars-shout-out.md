<p>One of the more charming Oscar night bits (as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821053933/http://laist.com/2016/02/28/chris_rock_monologue.php">opposed to thoughtfully provocative</a>) was Chris Rock helping out a Girl Scout troop by selling cookies to the A-list crowd. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821053933/http://greatideas.people.com/2016/02/28/chris-rock-oscars-2016-daughters-girl-scout-cookies/">Rock explained</a>, &quot;Last night Zara, my youngest called me up and said, &#x2018;Daddy how come we never sell the most cookies? How come Mrs. Dunn wins every year?&apos; It would mean so much to my little girl if we could beat Linda Dunn.&quot; Julianne Moore, John Legend, Kate Winslet, Lou Gossett Jr., Olivia Wilde, Matt Damon and even the Vice President of the United States were among those who joined forces to make sure Rock could reign victorious. </p>

<p>Although he told everyone at the time that he was pulling the stunt to help his daughters&apos; Girl Scout troop in New Jersey, the money will actually go to the troop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821053933/http://laist.com/2016/02/29/chris_rock_oscars_girl_scout_cookies.php">in Inglewood</a> that joined him at the ceremony last night.</p>

<p>By the end of the evening, Hollywood had raised over $65,000 for the troop.</p>

My email blows up. Everyone is calling to say Chris Rock just threw down the gauntlet. Did he really do that? He is nuts. It was all fun and all for a great cause.&quot;</p>

<p>Dunn said that in the past, Rock has &quot;stood in front of Kings (supermarket) and sold cookies&quot; with his daughters, while she and her daughter tap the family network in NJ, NY and Florida. Well, that&apos;s nothing compared to Olivia Munn <em>getting out of her seat</em> to demand some cookies:</p>
