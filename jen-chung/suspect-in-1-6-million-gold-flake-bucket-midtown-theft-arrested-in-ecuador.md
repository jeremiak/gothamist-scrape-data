<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122164807/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/21/gold_bucket_thief_nivelo.php">career criminal</a> suspected of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122164807/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/gold_bucket_thief_nyc.php">grabbing a five-gallon bucket containing $1.6 million worth of gold flakes</a> from an armored truck has been caught. Julio Nivelo was apprehended in Ecuador, according to the police. </p>

<p>Last September, Nivelo, who is also known as David Vargas, approached an armored truck parked outside of 48 West 48th Street around 4:30 p.m. One of the truck&apos;s employees was making a delivery while another was apparently looking for his phone in the cab when Nivelo allegedly made his move for the 86-pound pail. </p>

<p>Last year, NYPD Detective Martin Pastor of the Major Case Squad<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122164807/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Million-Dollar-Gold-Flakes-Bucket-Thief-Identified-Convicted-Felon-Julio-Nivelo-NYPD-Midtown-Manhattan-407657995.html"> told NBC New York</a> that Nivelo is &quot;a career thief who&apos;s been arrested seven times and deported four times to his native Ecuador... Pastor says Nivelo fled to Orlando, Florida, before moving on to California, where he&apos;s believed to be hiding out in the Los Angeles area with the stolen riches.&quot;</p>

Federal Homeland Security Investigations agents helped capture him there Thursday, officials said.&quot;</p>

<p>Some of the money <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122164807/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Gold-Bucket-Heist-16-Million-Dollars-Julio-Nivelo-Arrest-Ecuador-NYPD-Police-Investigation-411217795.html">has been recovered</a>.</p>

<p>Nivelo may be involved with other incidents&#x2014;&quot;he grabbed jewelry from a courier truck, camera equipment from a car, clothing and glasses from a Fed Ex truck, and tried but failed to make off with a box of Jimmy Choo designer shoes,&quot; according to the News&apos; sources.</p>
