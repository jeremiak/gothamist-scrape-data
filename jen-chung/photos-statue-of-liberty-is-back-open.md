<p>NYC.gov details the work that went into the landmark&apos;s reopening: </p>

<blockquote>Parks workers from around the nation&#x2014;along with the New York City Parks Department - worked hard to reopen the statue The repairs to Liberty Island included taking major steps to protect the island from major coastal storms in the future. During a typical year, the Statue of Liberty has an average of 3.8 million visitors&#x2014;including usually close to half a million during July alone. About 2,200 New Yorkers&apos; jobs are supported by the Statue of Liberty.</blockquote>
