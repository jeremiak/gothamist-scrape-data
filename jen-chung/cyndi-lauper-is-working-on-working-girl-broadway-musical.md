<p>One of the very best movies about New York City will be heading to Broadway: There&apos;s a musical adaption of <em>Working Girl</em>, the 1988 film starring Melanie Griffith as a plucky Staten Islander trying to get ahead in the cut-throat Manhattan business world in the works&#x2014;and Cyndi Lauper is working on the music, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607022031/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/theater/cyndi-lauper-working-girl-broadway-bound.html?_r=0">according to the NY Times</a>. </p>

<p>Native New Yorker Lauper, who won a Tony for the score to the Broadway hit <em>Kinky Boots</em>, told the Times, &quot;I love the film, and its story about a woman&#x2019;s very unconventional road to success in the &#x2019;80s is something I know a lot about. Women are still fighting for fundamental rights and equal pay!&quot;</p>

<p>Griffith played Tess McGill, who is trying to get out of the secretarial pool and into mergers and acquisitions, and decides to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607022031/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nyba4TMiJk">lean in a little</a> when an opportunity presents itself. The movie, directed by Mike Nichols, has an all-star cast&#x2014;Sigourney Weaver as her boss; Harrison Ford as a business colleague; Alec Baldwin as her boyfriend; Kevin Spacey as, well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607022031/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTHoIehOkK0">a Kevin Spacey type</a>; and an amazing Joan Cusack as Tess&apos;s best friend. </p>

<p>One can only hope that the musical will include the Staten Island Ferry as well as some really great 80s fashion and a chandelier that goes up and down (move over, <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>!). The Times says it&apos;s unclear if Carly Simon will be involved in the musical; Simon&apos;s song from the movie, &quot;Let the River Run&quot; won an Oscar:</p>
