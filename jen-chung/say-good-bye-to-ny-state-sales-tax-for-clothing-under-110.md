<p>After years of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120329152655/http://gothamist.com/tags/salestax">being there and not being there</a>, this Sunday, April 1, Albany is restoring the state sales tax exemption for clothing under $110.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120329152655/http://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/st/sales_tax_clothing_exemption.htm">state explains</a>, &quot;Sales of eligible clothing and footwear costing less than $110 per item or pair are exempt from the state&apos;s 4% sales tax and local tax in those localities that enacted the exemption.&quot;</p>

<p>Which means for anyone buying clothes and/or shoes (under $110) in NYC, there&apos;s no 4.5% city, 4% state, or 0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District tax&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120329152655/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/state_clothes_tax_booted_RrwlZgWGUbawlDkh6rKy8L?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">only starting on Sunday</a>.  </p>
