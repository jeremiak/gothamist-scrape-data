U.S. District Judge Edward Korman had pointed out, &quot;The record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription,&quot; but said the agency restricted access during the Bush years for political reasons.  Now women, 17 and over, can go to pharmacies, show proof of age, and ask for and receive Plan B. The NY Times reports that while advocates have hoped the pill would help slash the teen pregnancy rate and critics have said it would lead to more abortions and unprotected sex, there&apos;s no evidence that either has happened. Princeton&apos;s Office of Population Research director Dr. James Trussell tells the Times, &quot;This is not going to be a cheap cure to the unintended pregnancy epidemic in this country. It&#x2019;s very depressing.&quot;</p>
