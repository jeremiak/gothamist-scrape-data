</div></div>					<p>Tie, the collie-shepherd mix, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/09/photos_adorable_dog_chases_metro-no.php#photo-1">chased and raced a Metro-North train for over a mile</a> between the Bronx and Manhattan (and over water!), was pretty adorable in her media debut yesterday. Animal Care &amp; Control executive director Risa Weinstock thinks she had an owner, because Tie was so clean and knows ticks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/nyregion/different-sort-of-dog-run-beside-train-between-boroughs.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">like &quot;lifting her right paw for a shake.&quot;</a> According to the NY Times, Weinstock remarked, &quot;That&#x2019;s not something you just learn on the street.&quot;</p>

<p>Tie won the hearts of MTA employees and Metro-North passengers after her Tuesday sprint, which started at 149th Street and Park Avenue in the Bronx and ended up at the 125th Street station in Harlem. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/nyregion/different-sort-of-dog-run-beside-train-between-boroughs.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">The Times reports</a>, &quot;She crossed the Harlem River &#x2014; either bounding from tie to tie above the water, officials said, or maneuvering to a walkway on the lift bridge &#x2014; and remained ahead of the train as it reached the station at 125th Street.&quot;</p>

<p>Metro-North engineer Joseph Delia slowed the train for Tie and MTA police officers Errold Borges and Luis Alvarez rescued her at the station. The MTA cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/http://nypost.com/2014/04/09/dog-that-raced-metro-north-train-reunited-with-rescuers/">were reunited with Tie yesterday</a>, and Alvarez said, &quot;I was so happy that we were able to recover the dog. I would love to take her.&quot;</p>

<p>However, if no owner steps forward by tomorrow, Tie will be up for adoption. Animal Care and Control tells us there is a lot of interest in adopting the pup, and &quot;interested adopters can complete an application [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/http://www.nycacc.org/pdfs/adoptions/AdoptionApplication.pdf">PDF</a>] and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/http://www.nycacc.org/">review our adoption policies online</a>. They can email our Adoption team at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/mailto:adoption@nycacc.org">adoption@nycacc.org</a>.&quot;<br>
 <br>
AC&amp;C; adds, &quot;While Tie isn&#x2019;t available yet, there are many other wonderful dogs--and cats and rabbits!&#x2014;currently looking for loving homes. People can visit our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413001356/http://www.nycacc.org/AdoptionSearch.htm">Adoption Search page to view them</a>, and also come on by our Care Centers.&quot; </p>
