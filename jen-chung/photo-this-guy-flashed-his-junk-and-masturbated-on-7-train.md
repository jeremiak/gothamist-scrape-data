But that&apos;s what apparently happened to one straphanger on the 7 train this week, who contacted the police.</p>

<p>The NYPD says that yesterday morning at 9:45 a.m., a man on a Queens-bound 7 train &quot;exposed his genitals and masturbated in public view as the train approached the Queens Borough Plaza station.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim took a photograph of the suspect, who is described as being about 6&apos; and 180 pounds. He was last seen wearing a white shirt, blue jeans, black boots and sunglasses. The photograph (click to enlarge) also shows him with a black-and-white patterned jacket for partial coverage. <br>
