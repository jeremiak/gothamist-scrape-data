<p>According to police, they responded to the incident at 2:19 a.m. this morning. When they got to Jerome Avenue between East 196th Street and Morris Avenue, they found a man, who was unconscious and unresponsive, inside a 1999 Lexus. EMS pronounced the driver dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Police believed that the driver was going northbound on Jerome Avenue when he hit the pillar. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015454/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/man-dies-crash-slices-car-bronx-article-1.1878324">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The pillar cut clear through the center of the car on impact, sending the front portion of the sedan careening into vehicles parked along the street while the back half came to rest in the middle of the avenue.&quot;</p>

<p>A person who lives nearby also told the News, &quot;I could hear a screech, like brakes, and then &apos;bam&apos;... After that you could smell smoke. He had to be going fast, it was a huge impact.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say the investigation is ongoing.</p>
