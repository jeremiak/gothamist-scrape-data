<p>Last night, police in Yonkers were chasing the driver of a Ford Mustang who managed to escape after cops crashed into other cars. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151845/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/northern_suburbs&amp;id=9039663">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;A K-9 officer was chasing that Mustang in Greenburgh when he T-boned a car, causing the chain-reaction crash.&quot;</p>

<p>Another car was &quot;hit so hard that it ended up more than 50 feet away.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151845/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/gallery?section=news&amp;id=9039703&amp;photo=1">photos are pretty crazy</a>. Luckily, there were only minor injuries&#x2014;and the K-9 officer&apos;s dog is okay, too.  </p>

<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151845/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/25/6-vehicles-including-police-k9-unit-damaged-in-westchester-crash/">unclear why the cops were chasing</a> the Ford Mustang, but police are still looking for the driver.</p>
