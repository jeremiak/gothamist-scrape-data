But after recent outcry, the DOB has re-reviewed many plans, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228135734/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05252008/news/regionalnews/report_bares_construction_site_crisis_112485.htm">finding <strong>over 80% are &quot;plagued with zoning violations</strong></a>.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Post, the DOB usually &quot;randomly reviews 20 percent of self-certified plans,&quot; but with the building boom (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228135734/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/17/city_councilman_2.php">especially in Brooklyn</a>), more funds were given to allow the DOB to audit plans.  Six hundred sixty-two plans from September 17, 2007 through January 31, 2008 were looked at, and 556 earned &quot;objections&quot; from the Professional Certification Review and Audit Team.&quot;  </p>

<p>State Assemblyman James Bennan said, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s an open door for non-compliance with the Building Code and Zoning Resolution.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Last month, the Buildings Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228135734/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/18/oops_buildings.php">admitted it shouldn&apos;t have approved the plans</a> for a Turtle Bay tower whose crane later collapsed and killed seven people.  And earlier this year, the Bronx DA&apos;s office announced that an 83-year-old engineer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228135734/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/04/engineer_pleads.php">lied about a building&apos;s alterations</a>; the building later burned in a fire that killed two firefighters.</p>
