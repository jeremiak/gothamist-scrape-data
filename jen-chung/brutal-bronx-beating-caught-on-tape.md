He was returning to their apartment building around 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, after having a few drinks at a nearby restaurant.</p><blockquote>As de la Cruz stood at the door of the building ringing the buzzer, a surveillance camera captured one of the men approaching him from behind. As de la Cruz began to turn, the man swung a bat striking the victim on the side of the head.<p></p>

<p>As de la Cruz slumped to the ground the man proceeded to viciously strike him seven more times as he lay on the ground. A second man then comes into frame on the surveillance footage and the two can be seen rifling through the victim&apos;s pockets.</p></blockquote>They stole a cell phone, wallet and gold chain.  <p></p>

<p>The Daily News reports that police believe the suspects were cruising for an &quot;easy target.&quot;  After 30-45 minutes, a passerby noticed him and called 911.  De La Cruz &quot;has not regained consciousness, suffered several broken bones in his face... will need to undergo extensive reconstructive surgery&quot; and &quot;may also lose an eye.&quot;  The station manager for WESX, a Spanish-language station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115835/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/nyregion/20beat.html?ref=nyregion">said</a>, &quot;&#x201C;He is a friendly guy who likes chatting with everybody and anybody. He is very outspoken, very friendly and humble.&#x201D;</p>
