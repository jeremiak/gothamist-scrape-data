Shack&#x2019;s hours on the Upper West Side will be in flux for the first few weeks (11:00 AM - 9:00 PM), but once the Shack is really shakin&#x2019;, it will be open seven days a week from 11 AM - 11 PM. Our site will keep tabs on any hour changes.  <strong>Depending on how practice sessions go, Shack may open it&apos;s doors to the neighborhood a little sooner than Monday. But the official (read: definite) opening is Monday at 11:00 AM.</strong>&quot;  A few pictures of the UWS Shake Shack in progress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143848/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/16/upper_west_side_awaits_shake_shack.php">here</a>.</p>
