<p><em>Saturday Night Live</em> is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013712/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/10/chris_pratt_sarah_silverman_snl.php">coming back on September 27th</a>, and producer Lorne Michaels is finalizing the cast. Today, it was announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013712/https://twitter.com/petedavidson">Pete Davidson</a> would be joining the current team&#x2014;earlier this year, when he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he said, &quot;I just turned 20 and it&#x2019;s over, I&#x2019;m not going to make it.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013712/http://deadline.com/2014/09/pete-davidson-cast-saturday-night-live-834404/">From Deadline</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A native of Staten Island, NY, Davidson started his career in comedy at 16, using it as a therapeutic outlet after losing his father, a New York City firefighter, on 9/11. Making his rounds in the New York comedy scene, he was spotted by Nick Cannon who took him under his wing. Davidson was a semi-regular on the revival of Nick Cannon Presents: Wild &#x2018;N Out improv comedy series on MTV2 last year, leading to a gig on the MTV2 comedy/reality show Guy Code. Davidson, who dropped out of college, made his film-acting debut in Cannon&#x2019;s direct-to-video School Dance.</blockquote>

<p>More recently, he&apos;s guest-starred on <em>Brooklyn Nine Nine</em>. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s his set on Jimmy Kimmel, plus an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013712/http://gothamist.com/tags/awkwafina">Awkwafina</a>, and some videos from 2012:</p>
