<p>In writer-director Noah Baumbach*&apos;s 1995 film, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040924/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113537/">Kicking and Screaming</a> (about college graduates, not to be confused with the Will Ferrell&apos;s children&apos;s soccer movie), the protagonist tries to tempt his girlfriend to live with him in Brooklyn: &quot;<strong>And not just Brooklyn, A-list Brooklyn. Park Slope. Division 2 Manhattan.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>The NY Times Styles section has an article about Division 2 Manhattan--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040924/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/fashion/18slope.html?ref=fashion">Park Slope: Where Is the Love?</a>, which outlines the withering attacks Park Slope the neighborhood and the community has endured, especially from blogs and websites (like this one), and tries to dissect the genesis of &quot;Slope Rage.&quot;  Here are some quotes from interview subjects, including residents and professors:</p><blockquote>- &quot;This whole thing sounds like white people being annoyed by and jealous of other white people.&quot;<br>
- &quot;They&#x2019;re jealous because they can&#x2019;t live here.&quot;<br>
- &#x201C;There is all this class resentment in New York, and it&#x2019;s very tied up in real estate. People who are well-housed are the envy of others.&#x201D;<br>
- &quot;Hipsters and people who don&#x2019;t have kids are terrified of becoming grown-ups and parents, which is what Park Slope has come to represent.&quot;<br>
- &quot;Brooklyn was supposed to be different. Park Slope, to some, now represents everything that Brooklyn was not supposed to be.&#x201D;</blockquote><p></p>
