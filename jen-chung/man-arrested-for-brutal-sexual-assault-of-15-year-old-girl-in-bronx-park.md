<p>A 27-year-old man has been charged with attempted rape, strangulation and more following a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022333/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/25/bronx_park_beating.php">vicious attack on a 15-year-old girl</a> on Monday morning. Authorities say the girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022333/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2016/10/girl-15-attacked-beaten-in-bronx.html">was &quot;left for dead,&quot;</a> with her teeth knocked out, in Bronx Park.</p>

<p>The suspect, Shaun Lewis, was arrested and charged with attempted rape, assault, strangulation, forcible touching and endangering the welfare of a child. </p>

<p>Investigators say that around 4:40 a.m. on October 24th the victim &quot;met an unknown male at the Gun Hill Road subway station and the two walked together to Bronx Park, near the corner of Bronx Boulevard and East 213th Street.&quot; There, she was attacked: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022333/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/25/bronx-teen-attacked-suspect/">WCBS 2 reported</a> that her &quot;head was stomped [on] and teeth [were] knocked out before being sexually assaulted.&quot; </p>

Police sources told the paper that Lewis allegedly &quot;ripped off her pants, sexually abused the teen and then forced her into a nearby river to wash away any evidence he left behind.&quot; Later, &quot;a good Samaritan found the teen - wet and not wearing pants - on the side of the Bronx River Parkway near the river and took her to Montefiore Medical Center.&quot;</p>
