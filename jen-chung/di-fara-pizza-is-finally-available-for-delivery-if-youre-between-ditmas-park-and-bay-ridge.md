<p>Midwood, Brooklyn institution Di Fara Pizza is famous for its fastidiously-prepared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014937/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/best_pizza_nyc_final.php">basil-topped slices</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014937/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/16/di_fara_dessert_cafe.php">long waits</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014937/http://ny.eater.com/2016/11/21/13696250/di-fara-delivery">90 minutes</a>!). For one sweet day in May, Di Fara <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014937/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/02/uber_free_pizza.php">offered delivery</a> for an Uber Eats promotion&#x2014;which turned out to be a preview for actual regular delivery. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014937/http://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/brooklyn-pizza-institution-delivers-first-time-50-years">Daily Meal experienced</a> Di Fara by Uber Eats delivery last week, with nearly the whole menu available:</p><blockquote>My order was quickly accepted and went to &quot;food being prepared&quot; instantly. And a screen bubble offered a promise of pizza in 38 minutes. I watched as the delivery time went up and down: 37 minutes, 36, 41, 35. No matter, the delivery time is mind blowing if you&#x2019;ve ever waited in line for longer than that during their busy season.<p></p>

<p>Ultimately my delivery was in the hands of Allan, an UberEats bicycler. Allan arrived and apologized that there was no pizza box. Yes I had pizza, but since this venue was new to delivery, most bikers only had their insulated baskets, not a pizza box carrier, so the pie was delivered broken down into slices. He assured me that as the process moves along, it will be perfected. Also, some orders have been getting lost when the shop&apos;s WiFi drops, but Uber lets pizza fans know when an order wasn&apos;t accepted.</p></blockquote>The pizza was delicious, according to the Daily Meal, which noted that &quot;once the pizza arrived, it was as crisp and perfect as an in-store slice.&quot;<p></p>

<p>At this point, delivery is only for an area between Ditmas Park and Bay Ridge. </p>
