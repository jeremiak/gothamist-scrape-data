The only thing: It&apos;s not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225725/http://gothamist.com/tags/statueofliberty">Statue of Liberty in the New York Harbor</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s the Statue of Liberty at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225725/http://www.newyorknewyork.com/">New York New York Hotel in Las Vegas</a>. Luck be a lady?<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225725/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/us/15stamp.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;adxnnlx=1302868818-3ADEKrE4x2mBLP1PPWwr9A">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The post office, which had thought the Lady Liberty &#x201C;forever&#x201D; stamp featured the real thing, found out otherwise when a clever stamp collector who is also what one might call a superfan of the Statue of Liberty got suspicious and contacted Linn&#x2019;s Stamp News, the essential read among philatelists,&quot; and adds, &quot;The hair is different. The replica&#x2019;s eyes are much more sharply defined. A rectangular patch &#x2014; a plaque, maybe? &#x2014; is on the replica&#x2019;s center spike.&quot;  </p>

<p>The USPS is not changing the photograph: Spokesman Roy Betts said, &quot;We still love the stamp design and would have selected this photograph anyway,&quot; but said they&apos;d try to better vet future stamps.  </p>
