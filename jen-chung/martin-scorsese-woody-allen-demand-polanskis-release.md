<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_09_romanswi.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_romanswi.jpg" width="210" height="241" class="image-left"> </span>As film director Roman Polanski remains in Swiss custody, after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/27/roman_polanski_arrested_in_switzerl.php">arrested on a U.S. arrest warrant</a> for the 1977 rape of a 13-year-old, his moviemaking brethren are rallying to his side. A number of notable film notables, including Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, David Lynch, Jonathan Demme, and Pedro Almodovar, have reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009308.html?categoryId=13&amp;cs=1">signed</a> a petition demanding his release.  However, it&apos;s unlikely he&apos;ll be released on bail anytime soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-polanski-swiss30-2009sep30,0,4988989.story?track=rss">LA Times reports</a> that though Polanski&apos;s lawyers are trying to free him, &quot;such releases are rare for nonresidents in Switzerland, who are generally deemed to be flight risks. And given the lengthy extradition and appeals process, Polanski faces jail time far in excess of the 42 days he already served in Los Angeles back when the charges against him arose.&quot;  One lawyer guesses he could be in Swiss lockup for a few months.  Referring to the 42 days he already served, Polanski rep says that the filmmaker has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/movies/30polanski.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">already done his duty</a>.</p>

<p>The LA County DA&apos;s office may have been annoyed by Polanski&apos;s lawyers&apos; claim (in court papers to get the charges dropped) that the LA authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/09/29/2009-09-29_roman_polanskis_lawyer_caught_das_attention_when_he_claimed_us_wasnt_trying_to_n.html">weren&apos;t trying to apprehend him</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/dogged_hunt_for_polanski_kk3CB5q1NwHVQkCLx87SlM">produced a list of the places</a> they tried to arrest the Oscar-winning director. Still, even the Swiss foreign minister said that the arrest &quot;lacked finesse&quot;: &quot;She said Switzerland could have acted with more tact because Polanski was in Switzerland for the film festival, where the country&apos;s culture minister was also booked as a guest to deliver a speech.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, one film director thinks Polanski needs to face justice: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130013/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/movies/30polanski.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Luc Besson said,</a> &quot;This is a man who I love a lot and know a little bit. Our daughters are good friends. But there is one justice, and that should be the same for everyone. I will let justice happen... <strong>I don&#x2019;t have any opinion on this, but I have a daughter, 13 years old. And if she was violated, nothing would be the same, even 30 years later.</strong>&quot;</p>
