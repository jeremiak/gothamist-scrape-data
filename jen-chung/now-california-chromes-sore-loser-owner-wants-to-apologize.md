<p>Steve Coburn, the folksy underdog hero-turned-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003537/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/08/california_chromes_owner_still_upse.php">villainous sore loser</a> after his horse California Chrome lost his bid for the Triple Crown, is suddenly very sorry. On Good Morning America today, he said, &quot;I need to apologize to the world and America. I wanted it so much for this horse to win the Triple Crown for the people of America and I was very emotional, very emotional.&quot;</p>

<p>Coburn and Perry Martin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003537/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/california-chrome-wins-140th-running-kentucky-derby-article-1.1778483">bred California Chrome from a mare</a> they bought for $8,000 in 2008. The mare, Love That Chase, had only won one of out six career starts,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003537/http://www.churchilldowns.com/news/archive/get-know-kentucky-derby-winner-california-chrome-pre-race-bio"> leading a groom to say of her</a>, &quot;Anyone who decides to buy this horse is a dumbass.&quot; Still, Chrome won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and headed to Belmont on Saturday as the favorite. </p>

<p>However, when Tonalist won the race&#x2014;with Chrome ending in fourth place&#x2014;Coburn went on a rant, complaining that not all of the horses ran all three races, &quot;I&#x2019;m 61 years old, and in my lifetime, I&#x2019;ll never see another Triple Crown winner because of the way they do this. I look at it this way: If you can&#x2019;t make enough points to get in the Kentucky Derby, you can&#x2019;t run in the other two races... This is a coward&#x2019;s way out... If you&#x2019;ve got a horse, run him in all three. &#x2026; Those 20 horses that start in Kentucky are the only 20 eligible to run in all three races.&quot; </p>

<p>Then on Sunday, Coburn told ESPN, &quot;These people nominate their horses for the Triple Crown and then they hold out two [races] and then come back and run one. That would be like me at 6-2 playing basketball with a kid in a wheelchair. They haven&apos;t done anything with their horses in the Triple Crown. There were three horses in this race that ran in the first two&#x2014;California Chrome, Ride on Curlin and General A Rod&#x2014;none of the other horses did. You figure out. You ask yourself, &apos;Would it be fair if I played basketball with a child in a wheel chair?&quot; </p>

<p>Now, at day 3, Coburn says he&apos;s &quot;ashamed,&quot; adding, &quot;I need to apologize to the winners. They ran a beautiful race&#x2026;I did not mean to take anything away from them.&quot; And of Tonalist, he said, &quot;He won the race fair and square.&quot;</p>

<p>Coburn&apos;s wife Carolyn also spoke to Good Morning America, saying, &quot;This last year, we&#x2019;ve given so much joy, this horse and our journey and our story has given so much joy to so many people and I hope that 30 seconds isn&#x2019;t going to destroy all of that.&quot; And to her husband, she said, &quot;I&#x2019;m proud of you for coming up here and doing this and it was something that we needed to have done. I hope people can see him the way he is because that isn&#x2019;t the way he normally is. He&#x2019;s a very compassionate man.&quot;</p>

<p>The Coburns say that California Chrome was injured after leaving the gate; Steve Coburn said, &quot;He made contact with another horse and he got stepped on really bad on his right front foot and tore some of the foot away. It&#x2019;s going to take probably 10 days to two weeks to heal him up.&quot;</p>

<p>He added, &quot;It&#x2019;s a learning process for us and I&#x2019;m going to do better. I promise you I&#x2019;ll do better.&quot;</p>
