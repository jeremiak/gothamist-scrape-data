<p>Yesterday, Dharun Ravi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/dharun_ravi_says_goodbye_to_fa.html">turned himself into authorities for 30-day jail sentence</a>, part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/dharun_ravi_to_be_sentenced_for_spy.php">his punishment for spying on Rutgers roommate</a> Tyler Clementi and Clementi&apos;s guest. His trip to jail came just two days after he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/29/finally_dharun_ravi_apologizes_for.php">apologized for the 2010 spying incident</a> that resulted in Clementi&apos;s death.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Ex-Rutgers_student_Dharun_ravi_reports_for_jail_in_webcam_case.html">Clementi&apos;s parents spoke out against Ravi yesterday</a>, saying his words were &quot;no apology at all, but a public relations piece produced by Mr. Ravi&apos;s advisors.&quot;</p>

<p>In September 2010, Ravi had set up a webcam in the dorm room he shared with Clementi and viewed Clementi and Clementi&apos;s guest during intimate encounters, and shared a link (unsuccessfully) to view the livestream via Twitter. Clementi killed himself by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/rutgers_students_appalled_over_vide.php">jumping off the George Washington Bridge</a> the day after the second time he was filmed. While prosecutors have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/trial_of_tyler_clementis_roommate_b.php"> portrayed Ravi as homophobic</a>, his lawyer and the witnesses speaking on his behalf said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/family_friends_of_dharun_ravi.html">was not homophobic</a>, instead claiming he was simply acting immaturely. But jurors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/justice_has_been_served_for_tyler_c.php">agreed with prosecutors</a>, finding that Ravi invaded Clementi&apos;s and his guest&apos;s privacy twice and meant to intimidate Clementi when he spied a second time.</p>

<p>Joseph and Jane Clementi&apos;s statement about Ravi blasted how the 20-year-old never mentioned their son or their family by name in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/29/finally_dharun_ravi_apologizes_for.php">his apology</a>.  They also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/judge_dharun_ravi_shouldnt_be_in_pr.php">criticized the judge for the sentence</a> (though the judge had faulted the prosecution for not being clear about what they were looking for in a sentence):</p><blockquote>&quot;We have respect for Judge Berman and we appreciate the manner in which he presided over the criminal trial of Mr. Ravi. Although we do not question the sincerity of his feelings, and we have never sought harsh punishment, we are troubled by the Judge&apos;s failure to impose even a short jail sentence on the several charges of criminal invasion of Tyler&apos;s privacy and bias crimes. We are concerned that the sentence  of probation simply disregarded the unanimous verdicts of twelve jury members on these serious charges, that it disregarded the applicable law, that it missed a valuable opportunity to reinforce the message that our society takes these types of crimes seriously, and that we will act decisively to protect individuals&apos; privacy and human dignity.<p></p>

<p>As to the so-called &quot;apology&quot;, it was, of course, no apology at all, but a public relations piece produced by Mr. Ravi&apos;s advisors only after Judge Berman scolded Mr. Ravi in open court for his failure to have expressed a word of remorse or apology. A sincere apology is personal. Many people convicted of crimes address the victims and their families in Court. Mr. Ravi was given that opportunity but chose to say nothing. His press release did not mention Tyler or our family, and it included no words of sincere remorse, compassion or responsibility for the pain he caused.&quot;</p></blockquote>Ravi<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/dharun_ravi_may_serve_less_than_30.php"> may be out in as little as 20 days</a>, for good behavior. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140055/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/dharun_ravi_says_goodbye_to_fa.html">His lawyer said</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s hard not to be nervous, but he took it as well and was as prepared as he can be because jail is jail. He&#x2019;s eager to put this behind him and move on with his life.&quot;<p></p>
