<p>The 83-year-old woman who is suing Apple for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144253/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l91ISfcuzDw">$1 million</a> because she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144253/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/24/grandma_sues_apple_after_walking_in.php">broke her nose when she walked into the glass door</a> at the Apple Store in Manhasset is speaking out about her lawsuit.  </p>

<p>Evelyn Paswell&apos;s lawsuit claims that Apple&apos;s stores are inconsiderate to the elderly and that the company &quot;was negligent...in allowing a clear, see-through glass wall and/or door to exist without proper warning.&quot;  The grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144253/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/paned_gran_not_so_blind_Vzbq2jsuzlfoRVsv1jwMTM">insisted to the NY Post</a> that her eyesight is great, &quot;I may be elderly, but I&#x2019;m very active, and I&#x2019;m still driving too!&quot;  </p>

<p>Apparently Paswell&apos;s incident occurred on December 13 of last year; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144253/http://www.ifoapplestore.com/db/2012/03/24/senior-citizen-claims-injury-window-glass-too-clear/">IFOAppleStore points out</a>:</p><blockquote>However, Apple began installing rectangular warning stickers on store front windows some time before January 2011. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144253/http://www.eebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0800.jpg">photo of the Manhasset store</a> taken in October 2011 shows stickers in place on the front windows and doors, and all other U.S. stores now reportedly also have the stickers. Famously, a passerby at the Lincoln Park (Chicago) retail store walked into the glass at the south end of the building the night before the store&#x2019;s grand opening, in full view of the overnight waiting line. A fire department ambulance crew arrived to treat the woman&#x2019;s bleeding nose, but she declined a trip to the hospital. </blockquote>Goodness knows what would happen if Paswell were to venture on some Apple Store stairs:<p></p>
