Well, according to WNBC, &quot;The forklift hit and damaged the third rail preventing trains from getting out of the yard for the afternoon rush hour.&quot;  Oh, crap.  <b>Update</b>: WABC 7 says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005611/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=resources/traffic&amp;id=6257263">everything&apos;s back to normal</a>, but as of 5:16 p.m., the MTA&apos;s website still says there may be delays.  Intrepid straphangers, let us know how it goes!  </p>
