One Brooklynite admitted, &quot;I eat at my desk a lot. I&apos;ve never cleaned my keyboard. Most of the crumbs just fall in between the keys. I&apos;ve got a whole ecosystem going on at the bottom of my keyboard right now.&quot; Another said she doesn&apos;t really clean her desk, &quot;I eat at my desk every day and spend about seven hours at my keyboard... I found ants on my desk once.&quot; </p>
