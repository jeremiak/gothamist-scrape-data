Tysha Jones of East Harlem had been sitting on a railing&#x2014;and nearby was the intended target. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131956/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/11/2011-06-11_earlier_fight_believed_to_be_bloody_spark.html">Police spokesman Paul Browne explained the violence</a> &quot;erupted out of young adults getting into some sort of beef on the beach,&quot; and Police Commissioner Kelly called Jones&apos; death a &quot;terrible tragedy.&quot;<p></p>

<p>There apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131956/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/scuffle_then_hail_of_bullets_6tGXJfxXy7y4mEtKE5ZtvI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">was an incident on the beach</a> where a bottle was broken over one person&apos;s head and an umbrella was also used to strike someone. The teens involved with the shooting wanted revenge, intending to aim at one of the alleged beach assailants, who was sitting on a railing (he was not shot).  The shots hit Jones; Calvin Berkley, 23, who is in critical condition; Wayne Gibbons, 26; Julien Boudet, 26; and Tykwan Beckett, 21.  Gibbons told the News he was just listening to music on the boardwalk and denied being part of the beef, &quot;I just heard the shots and I went down. It came out of nowhere... It was just a group of guys and girls going to the beach on a lovely day who ended up being at the wrong place at the wrong time.&quot; </p>

<p>Jones was raised in East Harlem, but she had been sent to live with her grandmother in North Carolina after having trouble in school.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131956/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/nyregion/family-mourns-girl-as-bathers-return-to-brighton-beach.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a> that the teen &quot;missed home and returned. She was attending Landmark High School in Chelsea, though her mother, Cynthia Jones, had intended to send her back to North Carolina.&quot; (Sadly, Cynthia Jones didn&apos;t want her daughter to go to the beach, but the teen begged to go and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131956/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304259304576377943178980876.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTTopStories">she gave in</a>.) Jones&apos; father Kevin Wilson said, &quot;Our baby&#x2019;s not here anymore because somebody put a gun in their hand and thought they were in the wild, Wild West.&quot;</p>
