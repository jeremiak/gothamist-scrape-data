Per the Daily News, the lawsuit contends coach O.D. Vincent suspension over trivial incidents like &quot;driving too fast out of a parking lot, breaking a driver, getting into an confrontation with a teammate&quot; was ill-advised.  Also claimed: Vincent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811072708/http://www.newsday.com/news/columnists/ny-nyheni0724,0,4058653.column">made Giuliani&apos;s teammates turn against him</a>,&quot; comparing his tactics to The Lord of the Flies.  When talking to reporters, Andrew Giuliani pointedly thanked his mom and stepdad, but not his dad (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811072708/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/04/no_love_lost_be.php">he&apos;s not that close to</a>), saying, &quot;I love my father very much. <strong>I just decided not to ask him to get involved in the situation</strong>.&quot; Yeah, 9/11 probably isn&apos;t a strong argument for this matter.</p>
