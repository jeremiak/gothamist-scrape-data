<p>The police have released a video of a horrifying assault, in hopes of finding the attackers: A homeless man, sleeping on the steps of Saint Nicholas of Tolentine Church in the Bronx, was beaten unconscious by three men.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident happened on Thursday, June 19, at 10:11 p.m. The homeless man, 41, was sleeping on the steps of the church located at West Fordham Road and University Avenue when three males approached him. The suspect then kicked him in the head before fleeing.</p>

<p>The victim is currently in critical condition at Saint Barnabas Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175513/http://pix11.com/2014/06/23/homeless-man-viciously-beaten-while-sleeping-on-bronx-church-steps/">Father Joseph Girone told PIX 11</a>, &quot;I believe [homeless people] sleep there precisely because it&#x2019;s up high, and there&#x2019;s a certain protection there, the lights are, on, and the fact that the man was assaulted, kicked in the head like that, in front of the church door, where it&#x2019;s supposed to be a place of peace, at the very least, it&#x2019;s disconcerting.&quot;<br>
