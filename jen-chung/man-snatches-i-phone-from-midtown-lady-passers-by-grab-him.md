That&apos;s what happened to one woman in Midtown earlier this month.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216164648/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/phone_grabber_nabbers_LVilh4xWLIyMhW2m9SAUCN">Bonnie Somerstein tells the Post</a> that while waiting at Lexington and 42nd Street, right outside of Grand Central Terminal, for a crosstown bus, she was &quot;holding my iPhone with left hand and typing with my right hand... There was nobody beside me. The cards were all against me. I was a prime target.&quot; (Say these words to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216164648/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0">tune of Friday</a>.)</p>

<p>Anyway, a man &quot;raced up to her on his bike, grabbed the phone out of her hands and sped off.&quot;  Somerstein said, &quot;I literally said to myself, &#x2018;That didn&#x2019;t just happen!&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t remember my brain telling my mouth to start screaming or my feet to start running, but I started screaming at the top of my lungs &#x2018;Help! Help! He stole my phone!&#x2019;&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t going to let him get away with it.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she couldn&apos;t chase the man in her rubber boots, but then two executives help wrangle 25-year-old Delfino Morales.  Michael Solomon spotted Morales on his bike and pushed him hard against a planter, sending the phone flying, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t know what he did (but) I knew it wasn&#x2019;t something good,&quot; while Russell Otero helped hold him down.  </p>

<p>Morales was charged with third-degree robbery and criminal possession of stolen property.  Somerstein said, &quot;With the help of New York City strangers, they pushed and caught him. I was amazed by the kindness of strangers. I was very, very touched.&quot;</p>
