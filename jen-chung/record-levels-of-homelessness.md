The group&apos;s head, Mary Brosnahan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501155640/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/10/30/2008-10-30_citys_rising_homeless_crisis.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;While both city and state budget shortfalls require difficult choices, vulnerable New Yorkers now need more support, not less.&quot;  Department of Homeless Services Commissioner Robert Hess tried to find a silver lining, &quot;The fact that our system is withstanding the test of recent high demand is evidence that we have successfully transformed the families system and put a solid infrastructure in place.&quot; Earlier this year, NY Magazine had an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501155640/http://nymag.com/news/features/45103/">article about how homelessness</a> is the &quot;single biggest failure of the Bloomberg administration.&quot;</p>
