He was arrested at 2:45 a.m.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The victim, Clara Almazo, was crossing the street and managed to push her  grandson, Brian Herrera-Ramirez, 8, out of the way to avoid McGurk&apos;s SUV.  Witnesses have suggested he was speeding (and a man whose surveillance camera caught the incident said that it seemed as though the impact sent Almazo flying 10-20 feet).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120409035637/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspect-staten-island-hit-run-killed-hero-grandma-jailed-arraignment-article-1.1057469">Almazo&apos;s brother said</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know why he left. If you have an accident, you don&#x2019;t leave the scene of that accident.&quot;  A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120409035637/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/hit_run_slayer_gives_up_HSmCTqCEyPFCZXZqoQV0rL">told the Post</a>, &#x201C;I thought it was two cars hitting each other &#x2014; it was that loud.&quot;</p>

<p>McGurk, who was charged with leaving the scene of an accident, was at Rikers Island briefly, because he was unable to post the $50,000 bail (the Department of Corrections website says he&apos;s been discharged).  The Advance reports that &quot;his lawyer, Matthew Zuntag, had no comment, except to tell reporters his client is a lifelong Islander and has no record.&quot;  McGurk was in the news last year: He had been paying $850/month in lifetime alimony to his ex-wife, because a car wreck prevented her from working, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120409035637/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/16/belly_dancing_blog.php">then noticed recent photographs of her bellydancing</a>.  A judge agreed to end the alimony.</p>
