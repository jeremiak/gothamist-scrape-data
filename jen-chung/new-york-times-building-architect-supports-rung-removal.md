The rods acted as rungs for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312164928/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/third_man_climbs_new_york_times_bui.php">three climbers</a> to scale the building&apos;s exterior; Piano said, &quot;I&#x2019;m frankly quite worried about this new fashion of going up on buildings. <strong>This is what I call an inappropriate use of the building.</strong>&#x201D; He added that the building was &quot;built to be responsive to design after 9/11. The big challenge was to make a building that is not like a fortress, but that is transparent, and open to the city.&quot;</p>
