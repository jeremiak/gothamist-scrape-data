<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120214020902/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/in_for_bad_spell_6P0ucEX2cUYafpF8K5zp3L">Post is horrified</a> that &quot;A slew of officials have failed to report a humiliating spelling error &#x2014; &apos;SHCOOL X-NG&apos; &#x2014; plastered on Stanton Street outside a Lower East Side high school for months.&quot; It&apos;s been on the street so long, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120214020902/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=stanton+and+suffolk+st+nyny&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.720689,-73.985968&amp;spn=0.007985,0.017638&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.901528,72.246094&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;hnear=Stanton+St+%26+Suffolk+St,+New+York,+10002&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">it&apos;s on Google Maps</a>!  Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120214020902/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2012/01/hey-dot-you-might-want-to-rin-spell-check-on-this-one.html">The Lo Down was all over earlier</a>.</p>

<p>The warning is outside the Marta Valle High School, and its PTA president took the time to complain, &quot;Nothing surprises me anymore at this school... What&#x2019;s ironic is that the principal has probably painted the lunchroom and rooms inside over about five times since 2010. She&#x2019;s probably spent $100,000 in paint doing and redoing the inside of the school, but she doesn&#x2019;t notice this right outside her door!&quot; </p>

<p>The Department of Transportation told the Post that error was the fault of a utility provider &quot;and not the city or any of its contractors&quot; after some work on the street. But one city worker claims, &quot;Regardless of who painted it, someone from the school should have been outside supervising, or noticed it by now. This is sloppy work.&quot; Who knew that schools had to supervise street work?!? Anyway, the DOT says it&apos;s fixing it.</p>
