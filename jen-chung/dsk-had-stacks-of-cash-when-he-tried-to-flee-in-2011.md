<p>Back in mid-May of 2011, in a time before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820191759/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronuts">Cronuts</a> and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820191759/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php">crotch shots from Congressmen</a>, we had the head of the International Monetary Fund hauled off a plane at JFK Airport because he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820191759/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/14/imf_head_arrested_at_jfk_accused_of.php">accused of raping a hotel housekeeper</a>. The rape case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820191759/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/23/charges_against_dominique_strauss-k.php">crumbled in the months to come</a>, but we were left with the indelible image of DSK being perp-walked in East Harlem. And DSK is still pissed about it!</p>

The problem is it&#x2019;s a moment where in all European, American society you suppose to be innocent, you suppose to be innocent and feel you&#x2019;re convicted. And the perp-walk takes place at the moment where you suppose to be innocent. And so what happens is you just show to everybody as if you were a criminal, at the moment no one knows whether it&#x2019;s true or not. Maybe you&#x2019;re a criminal, maybe you&#x2019;re not. And then you prove later on that it is just unfair to show people in that way to the rest of the world when you just don&#x2019;t know what they have done.&quot;</blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820191759/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/dsk_was_hauling_cash_AdkJ17kmTyCBF6Z2fyGGmI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">NY Post, though, wants to burst DSK&apos;s bubble</a> of martyrdom, reporting that when cops arrested him &quot;he looked like an international drug kingpin with a moneybelt stuffed with cash.&quot; <p></p>

<p>A source said, &quot;<strong>He was wearing a money belt around his waist with stacks of foreign currency in different denominations. He also had stacks of foreign currency in his pants pocket.</strong>&quot; While the source couldn&apos;t give a dollar figure, he/she said, &quot;The guy was oozing money. He was living large.&quot;</p>
