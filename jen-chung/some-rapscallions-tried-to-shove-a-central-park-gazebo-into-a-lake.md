<p>Central Park turns 161 years old today&#x2014;which makes us particularly sad to share this news: Some miscreants were damaging structures, including a gazebo on the west side of the park, over the weekend.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015542/http://www.westsiderag.com/2014/07/21/property-damage-reported-in-central-park-gazebo-pushed-into-lake">West Side Rag received this tip</a>: </p><blockquote>According to information received from a Central Park Volunteer, several structures were vandalized late Saturday evening, including the gazebo along the west side of the lake near 75th Street and the Information Booth just outside of Strawberry Fields.  It seems that the vandals attempted to push the gazebo near Wagner&#x2019;s Cove into the lake.  The Information Booth has since been repaired, but the two gazebos will require some reconstruction before they&#x2019;re accessible to the public.</blockquote>We&apos;ve contacted the Central Park Conservancy and Parks Department for comment&#x2014;the former directed us to the NYPD, who have no information about the vandalism.<p></p>
