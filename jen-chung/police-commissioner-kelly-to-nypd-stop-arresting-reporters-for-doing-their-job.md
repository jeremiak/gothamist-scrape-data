<p>After the police arrested numerous journalists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405031423/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/nypds_zuccotti_eviction_swift_shrew.php">covering the raid on Occupy Wall Street&apos;s Zuccotti Park encampment</a> as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405031423/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/occupy_wall_street_claims_new_park.php">subsequent protester actions</a>, media outlets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405031423/http://www.nypressclub.org/newsletter/2011-11-21.html">condemned the NYPD&apos;s actions</a> which also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405031423/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/nypds_zuccotti_eviction_swift_shrew.php">included restricting access to witness events.</a>  Yesterday, representatives from the AP, the NY Times, the Daily News, the NY Post, and the National Press Photographers Association met with Police Commissioner Kelly and chief police spokesman Paul Browne to discuss the situation&#x2014;resulting in Kelly issuing a memo to the department saying the press should be allowed to do its job.  </p>

<p>The AP&apos;s senior managing editor, Michael Oreskes, said, &quot;This is a welcome step to assure that journalists can do their jobs. If followed, these instructions should prevent a recurrence of at least some of the unfortunate interference that journalists experienced as they covered the Occupy Wall Street events last week.&quot; </p>
