<p>Gooding has been in the New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center&apos;s burn unit and will undergo skin graft surgery on Tuesday.  His brother Joshua Barker spoke to the Daily News: &quot;He&apos;s scared about using his hands and being able to walk. Those burns really made him suffer. He&#x2019;s going through a lot of pain. To be honest, I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s going to be recovering anytime soon.&quot; </p>

<p>Attorney Sanford Rubenstein, who is representing Gooding, said, &quot;His right hand is badly burned and he may not be able to have full use. He&#x2019;s scared about that.&quot;</p>

<p>When he&apos;s well enough, Rubenstein expects Gooding to show him the store where he bought the e-cigarette, &quot;He knows how to find the store by sight,&quot; and added, &quot;A government agency should shut down the manufacturing of these cigarettes until they can discover why they&#x2019;re exploding.&quot;</p>

<p>Gooding&apos;s family was in the hospital yesterday to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161128130202/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/24/e-cigarette-explosion/">celebrate Thanksgiving with him</a>. &quot;I thank God at the end of the day that he&apos;s alive, because this could have ended up a lot worse,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161128130202/http://abc7ny.com/news/victims-brother-in-grand-central-e-cig-explosion-i-thank-godhes-alive/1623932/">his brother said</a>.</p>
