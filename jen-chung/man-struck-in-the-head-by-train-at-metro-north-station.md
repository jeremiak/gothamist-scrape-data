A<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042844/http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20100727/NEWS11/100729602/-1/NEWS09">ccording to the AP</a>, &quot;Metro-North said Christopher Newman was sitting on the train platform in Ossining, leaning forward with his legs dangling over the tracks on Saturday. He was struck in the head and is at Westchester Medical Center.&quot;</p>

<p>Newman suffered severe head and back injuries; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042844/http://www.lohud.com/article/20100727/NEWS01/7270325/Ohio-man-still-critical-after-Ossining-train-accident">Journal News reports</a>, &quot;he only bruised his legs, thanks to the gap between the train and platform, [Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie] Anders said.&quot;  </p>

<p>Newman had been in New York City with friends.  The friends got out at the Tarrytown station, but then realized Newman wasn&apos;t with them (Ossining is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042844/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/mnrmap.htm">two stops after Tarrytown</a>). The friends then went from station to station to find him and &quot;happen[ed] upon the accident scene in Ossining.&quot;  </p>
