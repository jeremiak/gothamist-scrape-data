<p>One day, we&apos;ll all look back at this election cycle as a bad acid trip. But for now, we have <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to slightly take the edge off the insanity that is our reality. This weekend&apos;s cold open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042157/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/trump_clinton_last_debate.php">tackled the third presidential debate</a>, of course, and Alec Baldwin&apos;s portrayal of Donald Trump continues to crystallize everything about the Republican nominee. </p>

<p>A confident Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, said, &quot;In the first debate, I set the table. In the second debate, I fired up the grill, and tonight&quot;&#x2014;taking out two large kitchen knives&#x2014;&quot;I feast.&quot; As for Trump, Baldwin referenced the candidate&apos;s calm manner during the first 30 minutes, &quot;In the past, I have been big and loud, but tonight, I am a sweet baby Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>This week&apos;s host, Tom Hanks, played moderator Chris Wallace, and asked first about reproductive rights. Baldwin-as-Trump yelled, &quot;They&apos;re ripping babies out of vaginas!&quot; which is essentially what Trump said on Wednesday night (&quot;You can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother&quot;).</p>

<p>Clinton&apos;s pivot from talking about possible Clinton Foundation improprieties and Baldwin&apos;s furious sniffling were also fodder, as was Clinton&apos;s bragging about her decades of experience and Trump&apos;s insistence that he respects women. Hats off to SNL for noting there are now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042157/http://laist.com/2016/10/22/an_eleventh_woman_comes_forward_acc.php">11 allegations</a>.</p>

<p>Baldwin&apos;s Trump also made a very special shout-out to the &quot;best Baldwin brother&#x2014;Stephen&quot; who is a real life <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042157/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/donald-trump-gets-support-from-stephen-baldwin-charlie-sheen-ted-nugent-more-1.11506360">Trump supporter</a>, and this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042157/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-baldwin-doesnt-think-alec-baldwins-snl-trump-impression-is-funny_us_5808b518e4b0dd54ce384b0d">criticized Alec&apos;s impression as &quot;not funny.&quot;</a></p>

<p>And have you been playing Trump Bingo?</p>
