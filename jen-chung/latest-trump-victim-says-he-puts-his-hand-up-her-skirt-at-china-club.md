<p>Yet another woman has come forward with allegations that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, molested her. The incident happened in the 1990s at a Manhattan nightclub, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017184327/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/woman-says-trump-reached-under-her-skirt-and-groped-her-in-early-1990s/2016/10/14/67e8ff5e-917d-11e6-a6a3-d50061aa9fae_story.html">Kristin Anderson told the Washington Post</a> that she &quot;did not notice the figure to her right on a red velvet couch &#x2014; until, she recalls, his fingers slid under her miniskirt, moved up her inner thigh, and touched her vagina through her underwear.&quot;</p>

<p>Anderson is the latest to allege that Trump actually does just grab women, the way he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017184327/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">bragged on a 2005 <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape</a>, &quot;When you&#x2019;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything... Grab them by the pussy.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, &quot;Anderson, who said she doesn&#x2019;t support Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton, did not initially approach The Post. A reporter contacted her after hearing her story from a person who knew of it, and she spent several days trying to decide whether to go public.&quot; That was before others spoke up: Two women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017184327/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/more_trump_groping_claims.php">told their stories to the NY Times</a>&#x2014;one was suddenly kissed by Trump in a Trump Tower elevator in NYC and the other was grabbed under her skirt on a plane&#x2014;and another described how he grabbed her butt to the Palm Beach Post. A People writer also gave a first-hand account of how Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017184327/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/people_trump_assault.php">forced his tongue down her throat</a> during an interview, adding, &quot;You know we&#x2019;re going to have an affair, don&#x2019;t you?&quot; </p>

<p>From the WaPo:</p><blockquote>That decided it for Anderson. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a sexual assault issue, and it&#x2019;s something that I&#x2019;ve kept quiet on my own,&#x201D; Anderson said. &#x201C;And I&#x2019;ve always kept quiet. And why should I keep quiet? Actually, all of the women should speak up, and if you&#x2019;re touched inappropriately, tell somebody and speak up about it. Actually go to the authorities and press some charges. It&#x2019;s not okay.&#x201D;</blockquote>The article does make clear that, since this happened so long ago, not all details are entirely clear to her, but &quot;The episode, as Anderson described it, lasted no more than 30 seconds. Anderson said she and her companions were &apos;very grossed out and weirded out&apos; and thought, &apos;Okay, Donald is gross. We all know he&#x2019;s gross. Let&#x2019;s just move on.&apos;&quot; Anderson had told some people about it: &quot;One friend, Kelly Stedman, told The Washington Post that Anderson informed her about the encounter a few days after it happened. &apos;We were out at a girls&#x2019; brunch&apos; at the Great Jones Cafe in Manhattan, Stedman said, recalling that when she and two other friends heard the story, they found themselves &apos;laughing at how pathetic it was&apos; on Trump&#x2019;s part.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Anderson, who &quot;knows that because she has come forward, her personal life may be intensely scrutinized&quot; (divorces, restraining orders)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017184327/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/woman-says-trump-reached-under-her-skirt-and-groped-her-in-early-1990s/2016/10/14/67e8ff5e-917d-11e6-a6a3-d50061aa9fae_story.html">also said in the interview</a>, &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t a sexual come-on. I don&#x2019;t know why he did it. It was like just to prove that he could do it, and nothing would happen. There was zero conversation. We didn&#x2019;t even really look at each other. It was very random, very nonchalant on his part.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump denies that he assaulted Anderson or any of the other women. His spokeswoman told the Post, &quot;Mr. Trump strongly denies this phony allegation by someone looking to get some free publicity. It is totally ridiculous.&quot; Yesterday, Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017184327/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/donald_trump_i_couldnt_have_attacke.php">insinuated that the People magazine writer wasn&apos;t hot</a> enough to assault.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reports, &quot;In May, records show, [Anderson] switched her voter registration from Democrat to &apos;no party preference.&apos;&quot; She said of Trump and Hillary Clinton, &quot;Both of them have some things that are good. And both of them have some things that are bad. But mostly, I&#x2019;m just thinking &#x2014; wow, this is the choice we have? This is it?&quot;</p>
