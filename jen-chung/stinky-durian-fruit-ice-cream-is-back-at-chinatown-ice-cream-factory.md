<p>Durian, the signature smelly South Asian fruit, is back in season&#x2014;which means that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331090737/http://chinatownicecreamfactory.com/">Chinatown Ice Cream Factory</a> has durian fruit ice cream! </p>

<p>The Chinatown sweet shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331090737/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151392085767096&amp;set=a.10150272157432096.330293.231362577095&amp;type=1&amp;theater">announced the news earlier this week</a>, and a store employee told us it&apos;s very popular and many customers were coming specifically to have their fill. </p>

<p>Durian, which has a thick spiky husk around its fleshy pulp, is infamous for smelling horrible. It&apos;s actually banned from the Singapore subway as well as many airlines and hotels and has been described as smelling like &quot;garbage, moldy cheese or rotting fish.&quot; One food writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331090737/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/world/asia/08durian.html?%20">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;To anyone who doesn&#x2019;t like durian it smells like a bunch of dead cats. But as you get to appreciate durian, the smell is not offensive at all. It&#x2019;s attractive. It makes you drool like a mastiff.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331090737/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian#cite_note-29">Another said</a>, &quot;Its odor is best described as pig-shit, turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock&quot; and Anthony Bourdain said on his show, No Reservations, &quot;Your breath will smell as if you had been French-kissing your dead grandmother.&quot;</p>

<p>So imagine that...in ice cream form! Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331090737/http://chinatownicecreamfactory.com/ice-cream-flavors-cakes-shakes">here are some other flavors</a> at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory (black sesame rules!).</p>
