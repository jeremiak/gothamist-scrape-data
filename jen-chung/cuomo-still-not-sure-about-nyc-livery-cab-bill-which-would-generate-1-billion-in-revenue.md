<p>Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s proposed plan to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/street_hail_livery_plan_stalls_as_d.php">legalize livery cab hails in the outer-boroughs</a> is being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/hoping_for_handicap_cabs_cuomo_coul.php">held up by Governor Cuomo</a>, who feels there are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/democrats-send-taxi-bill-as-is-gov-andrew-cuomo-veto-threat-article-1.988421">some unresolved questions</a> (like how many livery and taxi cabs are handicap-accessible, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://brooklyn.ny1.com/content/top_stories/152235/cuomo-signs-new-jobs-effort-into-law-but-isn-t-sold-on-livery-cab-bill">how many get to go to the airport</a>). Cuomo&apos;s sudden indecisiveness is curious to the Daily News, given that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/cuomo_shows_off_political_muscle_in.php">did, after all, steamroll tax reform</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/cuomo-deliver-taxi-reform-boroughs-article-1.989455?localLinksEnabled=false">News editorial says</a> Cuomo has to sign the bill: </p><blockquote>The bill targets a ridiculous status quo in which yellow cabs exercise a monopoly on picking up passengers in the street. They stay in Manhattan and often refuse to go to the boroughs.<p></p>

<p>The result is that livery drivers accept street hails an estimated 10,000 times a day &#x2014; disrespecting the law because it plainly does not work.</p>

<p>The fix on the table, as pushed by Mayor Bloomberg, calls for giving livery cars special permits that would allow them to pick up passengers in the street &#x2014; but only in northern Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island.</p>

<p>Another part of the deal would auction yellow cab medallions to address the shortage of available taxis citywide &#x2014; and raise an estimated $1 billion for a city that could sorely use the extra cash.</p></blockquote>The News even says that Bloomberg&apos;s responses to objections have been reasonable (!!) and News columnist Juan Gonzalez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gov-cuomo-inaction-legalize-livery-cab-street-hails-inexplicable-article-1.988968?localLinksEnabled=false">also points out</a>, &quot;Street hails are strongly opposed by the powerful yellow cab industry, and one of its big players, Medallion Financial, happens to count Mario Cuomo, the governor&#x2019;s father, as a director.&quot; (Cuomo&apos;s people deny that his father has anything to do with his stance.)<p></p>

<p>Some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mayor-bloomberg-livery-cabs-pick-street-hails-boroughs-article-1.989159">problems are rumored</a> to be stemming from personal conflicts between Cuomo and Bloomberg, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/05/bloomberg_not_too_thrilled_about_cu.php">different opinions of tax reform</a>. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154749/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hope_on_special_de_livery_Vu81MHb2mFCgueuVF0dR7N?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">source for the city tells the Post</a> that negotiations are in the &quot;sixth inning&quot; while a Cuomo source claims they are in the &quot;fifth inning.&quot; Cuomo has until December 21 to vote on the bill or veto it; if he does nothing, the bill automatically passes into law.</p>
