<p>Last week, two students at Monclair State University said that racist graffiti was written on their dorm room.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217103125/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Montclair-State-Racist-Threats-Hate-Crimes-139113979.html">According to NBC New York</a>, Olivia McRae, 19,  said &quot;BLACKS ONLY&quot; was written on the wall while the N-word and &quot;Black B---- you will die&quot; were on the floor&#x2014;McRae said she started crying but she wouldn&apos;t drop out of school, &quot;I&apos;m never going to let anybody stop me from being successful -- I already had a hard enough life.&quot;  Now McRae and roommate Tanasia Linton, 19, were arrested for allegedly writing the racist graffiti themselves.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217103125/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/montclair_state_students_are_c.html">Star-Ledger reports</a>, &quot;The pair said on February 7 that graffiti had been left on their door. A police investigation determined that the two women who claimed to be the victims were responsible for it. The case has been turned over to the Passaic County Prosecutor&apos;s Office, the report said.&quot;  The pair were charged with disorderly conduct, false reports to law enforcement and criminal mischief. Last week, McRae had told NBC New York that she wanted Montclair State to install surveillance cameras and that she moved back to her parents&apos; house.</p>

<p>The Montclair State University community has been investigating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217103125/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/homophobic-threats-found-at-montclair-state-20120201">homophobic threats in various areas of the campus</a>.</p>
