<p>Fashion designer L&apos;Wren Scott will be buried in Los Angeles, where her boyfriend, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, is organizing funeral and burial plans. Jagger&apos;s daughter Karis was spotted looking at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142850/http://nypost.com/2014/03/23/jaggers-daughter-scouts-out-cemeteries-for-lwren-scott/">plots at four different memorial parks</a>. However, not all of Scott&apos;s family is pleased.</p>

<p>Scott, 49, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142850/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/17/lwren_scott_mick_jaggers_girlfriend.php">killed herself last Monday</a>, by hanging herself from a scarf on a doorknob. She was found in her Chelsea apartment by an assistant. The Rolling Stones cancelled their tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, and Jagger, who had been dating Scott since 2001, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142850/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/19/mick_jagger_lwren_scott.php">issued a statement</a>: &quot;I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s been speculation about why Scott committed suicide&#x2014;the Post suggested that Jagger and Scott broke up earlier (which Jagger&apos;s rep denied) and numerous reports said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142850/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/18/lwren_scotts_fashion_label_owed_mil.php">her fashion line was struggling</a> (which the label&apos;s rep denied). Her estranged sister, Jan Shane, told the Daily Mail, &quot;I know deep down she wanted a family and kids, and I think she deeply wanted it and couldn&apos;t get it. I think it bothered her.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142850/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2587074/Revealed-LWren-misled-Jagger-secret-loan-family-clashes-rock-star-final-resting-place.html">The Daily Mail, though, claims</a> that Jagger and Scott fought over her company&apos;s problems, &quot;[A] friend added: &#x2018;There was a massive argument last year when Mick learned she had secretly borrowed against the flat. He bailed her out but she was going round saying he had told her, &#x201C;Call me when you sort out your mess.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Shane is upset that her sister is being buried in Caifornia. According to the Daily News, &quot;Only a select group of people close to Scott will attend the funeral, likely to be held in California on Monday or Tuesday, a source close to the Rolling Stones told Confidenti@l. Scott&#x2019;s adopted sister Jan Shane said after last week&#x2019;s suicide that she wanted her adopted sister buried near their childhood home in Utah.&quot; (Scot and Shane were adopted by a Mormon couple.) There is a family plot in Utah, with a gravestone with all the children&apos;s names.</p>

<p>However, the women&apos;s brother, Randall Bambrough, who Scott had tasked with leading her clothing line recently, is &quot;reportedly squeezing Jan out of the conversation. A source close to the Bambrough clan said Jan had yet to hear from her brother about funeral arrangements, and knew nothing more than what she read in the papers.&quot; Shane told the Daily Mail, &quot;No one has told me anything about a funeral.  I&#x2019;ve not had a single call from anyone in the Jagger camp. I&#x2019;m beside myself.&quot;</p>

<p>The source also told the News that Jagger is &quot;fragile&quot; to have his grandchildren visit him at his hotel and one told the Daily Mail that the 70-year-old rocker is &quot;deeply distressed but starting to feel better.&quot;</p>

<p><em>If someone you know exhibits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142850/https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/risk-factors-and-warning-signs">warning signs of suicide</a>: do not leave the person alone; remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt; and call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.</em></p>
