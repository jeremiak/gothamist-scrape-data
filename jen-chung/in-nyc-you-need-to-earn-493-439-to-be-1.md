<p>City Councilman James Oddo, one of the few Republicans in the City Council, has been hearing a lot about this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150120070607/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street stuff</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150120070607/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/12/councils-james-oddo-isnt-buying-that-1-stuff">Daily Politics reports</a> that he was so curious about who really is NYC&apos;s 1%&#x2014;and 10%, for that matter&#x2014;and how much they pay in NYC taxes that he asked the Independent Budget Office for some details.  Oddo shared the IBO&apos;s response today, &quot;I think the numbers bear out the argument that we should not be attacking higher-income New Yorkers because their tax dollars fund, in large measure, all the services that New Yorkers have come to rely on.&quot; Another thing: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150120070607/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/09/video_of_the_da_119.php">don&apos;t get him mad</a>.</p>

<p>Based on 2009 data, the IBO says: &quot;The minimum income of a member of the so-called 1% in New York City is approximately $493,439 with an average income per filer of $2,247,515. To be a member of the top 10% in New York City requires a minimum income of $105,368. The top 10% of city taxpayers (about 345,169 payers) accounts for 71.2% of the city personal income tax. The top 1%, or about 34,598 people, pays 43.2% of the total burden. About 1.18 million filers pay no New York City personal income taxes at all, and some who live in poverty receive &apos;refund&apos; payments of the values of their earned income tax credit, child care and dependent care credit.&quot;</p>
