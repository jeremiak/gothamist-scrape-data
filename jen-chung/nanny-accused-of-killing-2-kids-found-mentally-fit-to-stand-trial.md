Manhattan judge Gregory Carro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070342/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/killer-nanny-yoselyn-ortega-mentally-fit-stand-trial-article-1.1308597?localLinksEnabled=false">said</a>, &quot;Both psychiatrists find the defendant can in a meaningful way assist in her own defense and have found her fit to proceed to trial.&quot;<p></p>

<p>On October 25, 2012, Marina Krim had returned to her Upper West Side home with daughter Nessie, because Ortega didn&apos;t bring Krim&apos;s other children, 6-year-old Lulu and 2-year-old Leo, to a class. Krim entered her darkened apartment and found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070342/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/uws_nightmare_mom_discovered_childr.php#photo-1">Lulu and Leo stabbed in the bathtub</a>, with Ortega apparently trying to stab herself. The children both died while Ortega survived her wounds and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070342/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/03/nanny_charged_with_murder_in_killin.php">was charged with murder.</a></p>

<p>Ortega, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070342/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/nanny_accused_of_killing_children_r.php">reportedly frustrated over wages</a> (she was paid $18/hour), has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070342/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/28/accused_killer_nanny_pleads_not_gui.php">pleaded not guilty</a>. Her lawyer, who has described Ortega as &quot;pathetic,&quot; will challenge the decision in a process <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070342/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/killer_nanny_found_fit_tots_stand_hh5O3XUDks0GFAcLoKaiaM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">that could take months</a>. </p>
