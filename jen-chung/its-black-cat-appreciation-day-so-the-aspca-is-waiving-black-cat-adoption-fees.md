title: It's Black Cat Appreciation Day, So The ASPCA Is Waiving Black Cat Adoption Fees
---

	
										<p>Adopting a cat is always a good idea&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014149/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317329/">Science Says Cat Ownership Is Related To Longer Lifespans</a>&#x2014;but today is an especially great time to contemplate being a kitty parent: August 17th is Black Cat Appreciation Day and the ASPCA is waiving adoption fees for all adult black cats (plus they&apos;ll get a hard cat carrying case), and black kitten adoption fees will be discounted from $125 to just $50!</p>

<p>The promotion run from today, August 17th through August 21st at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014149/http://www.aspca.org/nyc/aspca-adoption-center">ASPCA&apos;s Adoption Center</a> at 424 East 92nd Street. The ASPCA shared pictures of some of the black cats up for adoption and there&apos;s nothing that says you can&apos;t adopt all four.</p>
