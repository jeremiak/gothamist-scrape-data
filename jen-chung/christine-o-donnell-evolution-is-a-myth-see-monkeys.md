Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145428/http://thinkprogress.org/2010/09/24/odonnell-evolution-maher/">he released a new clip</a>&#x2014;this one from October 15, 1998&#x2014; where she says, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145428/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/">Evolution</a> is a myth.&quot;  To which Maher responded, &quot;Evolution is a myth?!? Have you ever looked at a monkey!&quot;  But O&apos;Donnell said, &quot;<strong>Well then, why they &#x2014; why aren&#x2019;t monkeys still evolving into humans?</strong>&quot;  Yes, where is Dr. Zaius when we really need him?</p>

<p>After showing the clip, Maher, on his current program, HBO&apos;s Politically Incorrect, said, &quot;See this is the point I want to make &#x2014; is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145428/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/19/elaine_benes_ringer-senate_hopeful.php">stuff from the witch from last week</a> was silly. Who cares what she did in high school, if she dabbled in witchcraft. But this is someone who could be in the Senate, who thinks that mice have human brains and doesn&#x2019;t understand &#x2018;oh my God, that monkeys don&#x2019;t evolve in the time that it would take to watch them.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

<p>O&apos;Donnell&apos;s stance is that the world was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145428/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/09/the_gops_delaware_senate_nomin.html">created in six 24-hour periods</a>, by the big man upstairs. And recently the Tea Party-backed candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145428/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/09/25/2010-09-25_christine_odonnell_gop_senate_nominee_and_tea_party_favorite_evolution_is_a_myth.html">told the Today show</a>, &quot;I&apos;m in my 40s now. I&apos;ve matured in a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145428/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/15/christine_odonnell_is_mistress_of_h.php">my positions.</a> This campaign is about getting our country back on track.&quot;</p>
