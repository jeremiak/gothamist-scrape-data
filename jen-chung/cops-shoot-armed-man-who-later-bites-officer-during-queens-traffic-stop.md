<p>The NYPD says that an officer shot a driver who ran multiple red lights and aimed a gun at police officers during a traffic stop last night. The wounded suspect allegedly bit one of the officers while they were trying to arrest him.</p>

<p>According to the police, the incident occurred just before 11 p.m., when officers in a unmarked vehicle observed a car running red lights. They stopped the driver at 217th Lane and Hollis Avenue, authorities say. When the driver got out, he was allegedly holding a gun, and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512134402/http://abc7ny.com/news/officer-bitten-suspect-shot-in-queens-traffic-stop/1334714/"> WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;The man told the officers, &apos;I am ready to die.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman says that officers asked him multiple times to drop the gun, but when he ignored the requests, a sergeant fired one, hitting the suspect in the leg. While the officers were trying to arrest him, the suspect bit one of them.</p>

<p>Police recovered a loaded .40 Glock 26.</p>
