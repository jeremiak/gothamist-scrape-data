<p>Alec Baldwin is a talented actor, but it seems like he&apos;s terrible at relaxing.  After news broke this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/09/canadian_woman_arrested_for_alleged.php">week about his alleged stalker</a> (which brought the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/alec_baldwins_alleged_stalker_email.php">disgust of Andrea Pesyer</a>, plus some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/12/alec-baldwin-tweet-causes-30-rock-fans-to-worry/">Today Show employees to try to interview him</a> at his home) and an incident last week where the Daily News sent a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/03/alec_baldwin_1.php">reporter and photographer to his fiancee&apos;s yoga class</a>, Baldwin has been complaining about the media and the kind of attention that&apos;s paid to an Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning and Oscar-nominated celebrity.  So he&apos;s in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/https://twitter.com/#!/alecbaldwin/status/190190436978147328">Rome</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/https://twitter.com/#!/alecbaldwin/status/190239911499149316">right now</a>, yet he&apos;s still lashing out:</p>

<p>Peyser, who found it weird that Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ladies_when_the_cad_away_run_20mMbD5triGZFsbnIYzcFI">took his alleged stalker out a few times</a> and recommended that his fiancee ditch him, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162503/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/look_who_stalking_alec_mad_about_ZEMKQ3yeaICllhJBXz49wI">pretty stoked that Baldwin</a> had been mentioning her on Twitter:</p><blockquote>In his latest tweets, Alec looked into my eyes. And he talked directly into my soul.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Andrea Peyser, you are as bad a writer as you are filled with self-hatred,&#x2019;&#x2019; Alec wrote. Wow. This guy really cares about my well-being!<br>
&#x201C;Go back to Langan&#x2019;s&#x2019;&#x2019; (a great bar on West 47th Street) &#x201C;and bring a Strunk and White. &#x2019;&#x2019; That, by the way, is a stylebook for journalists, y&#x2019;all.</p>

<p>Oh, Alec. The order of protection is on its way to you in the mail.</p>

<p>As Alec and I know, he just can&#x2019;t get enough of me and my column.<br>
Sweet Alec is quite a busy guy.</p>

<p>Alec&#x2019;s day is jampacked with making a TV show, as well as torturing a Canadian alleged stalker. Alec had pretty, thin Genevieve Sabourin, 40, arrested Sunday after she sent him hundreds of texts and e-mails.</p></blockquote>All we can say is, &quot;Alec, you&apos;re in Rome with your fiancee&#x2014;just enjoy life and STEP AWAY FROM TWITTER.&quot;<p></p>
