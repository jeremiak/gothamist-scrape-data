Markoff, 24, was pronounced dead at 10:17 this morning. Tompkins said authorities are investigating.&quot;  However, the Boston Herald&apos;s sources say he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160912/http://bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/20100815sources_craigslist_killer_philip_markoff_commits_suicide/srvc=home&amp;position=0">alone and had suffocated</a>.<p></p>

<p>Markoff&apos;s attorney John Slasberg confirmed his death, &quot;Sad to say, it&#x2019;s very true. It&#x2019;s shocking and very saddening.&quot;  Markoff&apos;s next court hearing was scheduled for next month.  In April 2009, NYC masseuse Julissa Brisman was fatally shot at the Marriott Copley Place; it turned out she had planned the appointment via her Craigslist massage ad in the erotic services section.  A few days later, police managed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160912/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/21/bu_med_student_suspected_of_being_c.php">trace the IP address of the email</a> sent to Brisman to Markoff&apos;s apartment, where they found plastic handcuffs, guns, and women&apos;s panties.  It was suspected that Markoff, a SUNY Albany graduate and medical student at Boston University, had run up gambling debt and turned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160912/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/27/craiglist_killers_first_victim_desc.php">robbing escorts</a> he met on Craigslist.  </p>

<p>The clean-cut suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160912/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/28/craigslist_killer_suspect_130k_in_d.php">had been engaged </a>at the time of his arrest and his fiancee even defended him, but later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160912/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/30/craigslist_killer_suspect_dumped_by.php">she dumped him</a>. He had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160912/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/23/craigslist_killer_suspect_on_suicid.php">placed on suicide watch</a> shortly after his arrest; he was allegedly using shoelaces to strangle himself.</p>
