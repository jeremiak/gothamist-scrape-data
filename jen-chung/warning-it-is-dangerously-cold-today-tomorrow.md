<p>Please be careful&#x2014;it is extremely cold today and tomorrow. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020142/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/14/bundle_up_arctic_cold_wave_arrives.php">Arctic front from the Midwest </a>is now here, and the Office of Emergency Management is urging New Yorkers to take appropriate precautions. </p>

<p>&quot;New York City is expecting the coldest temperatures and lowest wind chills of the season on Thursday and Friday,&quot; NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Joseph Esposito yesterday. &quot;These temperatures will be dangerous for New Yorkers. During this blast of arctic cold, stay indoors, and if you have to go out, bundle up. Remember to check in on your family, neighbors, the elderly, or others with increased health risks to make sure they are protected from the extreme cold.&quot;</p>

Shivering is a signal to return indoors</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Drinking alcohol may make you think you feel warmer, but it actually increases your chances of hypothermia and frostbite</em>.&quot;  <br>
 <br>
The Department of Homeless Services will be operating under a &quot;Code Blue Emergency&quot; because it will be under 32 degrees and OEM says, &quot;No one seeking shelter in New York City will be denied. Anyone who sees a homeless individual or family out in the cold should call 311 immediately and an outreach team will be dispatched to assist them.&quot;</p>

<p>Use caution when heating your home&#x2014;make sure you have a working smoke alarm and only use portable heaters approved for indoor use (and if you use them, never leave them running unattended and plug them directly into the wall, not into a power strip of extension cord). </p>

<p>Also:</p><blockquote>What to Do if You Lose Heat or Hot Water at Home<p></p>

<p>Building owners are legally required to provide heat and hot water to their tenants. Hot water must be provided 365 days per year at a constant minimum temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat must be provided during the &#x201C;Heat Season&#x201D;, between October 1st and May 31st under the following conditions:</p>

<p>Between the hours of 6 AM and 10 PM, if the outside temperature falls below 55 degrees, the inside temperature is required to be at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
Between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM, if the outside temperature falls below 40 degrees, the inside temperature is required to be at least 55 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Any New York City tenant without adequate heat or hot water should first speak with the building owner, manager, or superintendent. If the problem is not corrected, tenants should call 311. For the hearing impaired, the TTY number is (212) 504-4115. The center is open 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. You may also file a complaint via mobile app, 311MOBILE, or online at 311ONLINE.</p></blockquote> <p></p>
