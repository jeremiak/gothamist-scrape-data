<p>A burglar (or burglars) broke into a Bronx apartment yesterday, stealing money, a PlayStation, Air Jordans and, worst of all, a two-month-old puppy. Victim Gaudencio Rosendo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222053101/http://abc7ny.com/pets/bronx-burglars-steal-not-just-money-but-also-family-puppy/1033926/">said of his dog Luna</a>, &quot;I want her back, I don&apos;t care they can keep everything else, I just want the baby back.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Police say that when Rosendo returned to his apartment in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222053101/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_043.shtml">43rd Precinct</a>, he found the front door lock broken and &quot;the inside of his apartment in disarray.&quot; Besides Luna&#x2014;a Siberian Husky&#x2014;being missing, approximately $1,000 cash, numerous pairs of Air Jordan sneakers and a Sony PlayStation 4 were stolen.</p>

<p>Rosendo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222053101/http://abc7ny.com/pets/bronx-burglars-steal-not-just-money-but-also-family-puppy/1033926/">told WABC 7</a> that the money was children&apos;s birthday money and, worse, whoever broke in &quot;attacked the family&apos;s three other dogs with pepper spray.&quot; He said, &quot;There was no noise around the house like usually with the dogs, it was so quiet, and when I got upstairs everything was a mess.&quot; </p>

<p>Also, his dogs were &quot;splattered on them from being hit with a paintball gun.&quot; Rosendo emphasized that he just wants Luna back, &quot;The money is not everything, the puppy is like a family you can not replace.&quot; </p>

<p>Police released an image of Luna.</p>
