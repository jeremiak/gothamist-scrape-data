<p>While you may just be getting up, thousands of bicyclists have already started&#x2014;or getting ready to&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014757/http://www.bike.nyc/events/td-five-boro-bike-tour">5 Boro Bike Ride</a>. Below are the streets that are closed today, until 5 p.m., for the 40-mile route.</p>

<p>There are four staggered start times, 7:30 a.m., 8:10 a.m., 8:45 a.m. and 9:20 a.m., which all start in lower Manhattan at Franklin and Church Streets, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014757/http://www.bike.nyc/events/td-five-boro-bike-tour/route-services/">tour explains that it then</a> &quot;heads north through the heart of Central Park, and continues on to Harlem and the Bronx before returning south along the East River on the FDR Drive. From there, cyclists cross into Queens and then into Brooklyn, where riders take over the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway before the heart-pumping climb up&#x2014;and thrilling ride down&#x2014;the breathtaking Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and into the Finish Festival on Staten Island.&quot;</p>
