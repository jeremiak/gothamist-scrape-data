<p>A 33-year-old man is dead and three others&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132910/http://abc7ny.com/news/rapper-troy-ave-shot-1-killed-at-shooting-during-ti-concert-/1356567/">including rapper Troy Ave</a>&#x2014;suffered injuries after shots were fired at a rap concert at Irving Plaza last night. Police are treating the death as a homicide, and the violence may have started in the green room. Concertgoers called the flight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132910/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/26/irving-plaza-shooting/">from the venue a &quot;stampede.&quot;</a></p>

<p>T.I., the headliner, hadn&apos;t appeared yet when the gunfire erupted during openers Maino and Uncle Murda, who were performing around 10 p.m.</p>

All the people in the green room were credentialed, and it is possible the suspect was also credentialed.&quot; </p>

<p>However, one attendee called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132910/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Irving-Plaza-Shooting-Rapper-TI-Concert-New-York-City-380907521.html">said there wasn&apos;t much security</a>, &quot;They didn&apos;t search nobody, they didn&apos;t check no IDs.&quot;</p>

<p>The 33-year-old victim was shot in the stomach and died at Beth Israel Hospital. The other victims were a 26-year-old woman with a gunshot wound to the leg and a 34-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the chest; both were taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.</p>

<p>Police say that a 30-year-old man&#x2014;Troy Ave&#x2014;went to NYU Hospital on his own for a gunshot wound to the leg.</p>

The News reports</a> &quot;the carnage started as a beef between two rival crews associated with Maino and rapper Troy Ave. The gunman and the victims were all credentialed guests with access to the VIP area, a source said.&quot; A person in the green room said the altercation &quot;was a fight over a push, it was over some b-------. It was like 50 or 60 people in the VIP room. It was crazy. It&#x2019;s crazy more people didn&#x2019;t get shot.&#x201D;

For two to three minutes we still heard firing, still heard shots, we were clutching each other making sure no one was getting hit.&quot;</p>

<p>No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132910/http://nypost.com/2016/05/25/three-shot-during-concert-at-irving-plaza/">Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said this morning</a>, &#x201C;We feel we&#x2019;ll wrap it up very quickly. The crazy world of the so-called rap artists who are basically thugs that basically celebrate the violence&#x2026;and unfortunately that violence often times manifests itself during their performances and that&#x2019;s exactly what happened last evening.&#x201D;</p>
