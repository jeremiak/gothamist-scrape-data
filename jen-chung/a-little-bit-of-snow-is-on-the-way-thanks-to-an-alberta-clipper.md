<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312182434/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/forecast_light_snow_tomorrow_turnin.php">As we mentioned yesterday</a>, an inch, maybe a little more, of snow is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312182434/https://twitter.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/826212775219314688">expected to grace</a> New York City today. The white stuff is the result of an &quot;Alberta Clipper&quot; heading our way.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312182434/http://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=alberta%20clipper">NOAA defines</a> the Alberta Clipper as &quot;a fast moving low pressure system that moves southeast out of Canadian Province of Alberta (southwest Canada) through the Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes region usually during the winter. This low pressure area is usually accompanied by light snow, strong winds, and colder temperatures.&quot; They usually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312182434/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-glossary/what-is-an-alberta-clipper/5559334">don&apos;t bring that much snow</a>, but they have another fun nickname: &quot;Saskatchewan Screamer.&quot;</p>

<p>The snow will probably mix with rain this afternoon, and roads may be slick. </p>
