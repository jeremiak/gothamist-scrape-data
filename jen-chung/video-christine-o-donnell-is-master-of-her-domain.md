<p>Last night in Delaware, Tea Party upstate Christine O&apos;Donnell defeated mainstream Republican candidate Mike Castle to win the Republican Senate primary.  The victory for O&apos;Donnell, a marketing consultant who got a boost from former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, is being called a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173258/http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20100915/NEWS02/9150356/O+DONNELL+IN+SHOCKER">&quot;shocker&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173258/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/14/hours-polls-close-gloves-come-delaware/">&quot;stunning&quot;</a> as well as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173258/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42172.html">&quot;GOP nightmare.&quot;</a> But the most interesting thing that came out last night was when MSNBC&apos;s Rachel Maddow showed a clip of O&apos;Donnell in a 1996 MTV &quot;Sex in the &apos;90s&quot; segment:  O&apos;Donnell, looking like a dead ringer for Elaine Benes, explaining why even masturbation is a sin, &quot;<strong>The Bible says that lust in your heart is committing adultery.
