<p>While her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626175330/http://gothamist.com/tags/rudygiuliani">dad is lying through his teeth</a> while defending Donald Trump, Caroline Giuliani, the daughter of the former NYC mayor, is publicly supporting The Orange One&apos;s rival. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626175330/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/caroline-giuliani-hillary-clinton-229258">She told Politico</a>, &quot;I love Hillary, I think she&apos;s by far the most qualified candidate that we&apos;ve had in a long while.&quot;</p>

<p>The younger Giuliani changed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626175330/https://www.facebook.com/CaRoseG">her Facebook profile</a> photo to the Clinton campaign logo, and the header of her Facebook page now says &quot;#ImWithHer.&quot; &quot;My dad knows. I was for Barack in 2012,&quot; Caroline Giuliani, who now lives in Los Angeles, told Politico. &quot;He knows and is fully comfortable with it and thinks I have a right to my opinion.&quot;  </p>

<p>She previously expressed interest of Obama in 2007&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626175330/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/06/giulianis_daugh.php">joining a Barack Obama Facebook group</a>&#x2014;but a spokesperson claimed, &quot;Before the presidential campaign got underway, Caroline added herself to a list on Facebook as an expression of interest in certain principles. It was not intended as an indication of support in a presidential campaign and she has removed it. Caroline is not commenting on the 2008 election.&quot; Rudy, at the time, was running for president himself.</p>

<p>Caroline is one of Rudy Giuliani&apos;s two children with second wife Donna Hanover. Rudy famously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626175330/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/nyregion/mayor-s-seperation-overview-giuliani-his-wife-16-years-are-separating.html?_r=0">dumped Hanover during a press conference</a>. It turned out he was having an affair with Judi Nathan, who he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626175330/http://people.com/archive/cover-story-threes-a-crowd-vol-55-no-21/">invited to public functions</a> while still married to Hanover. Giuliani married Nathan after his divorce. Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626175330/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-presidential-race.html">has been publicly attacking</a> Hillary Clinton&apos;s marriage.<br>
