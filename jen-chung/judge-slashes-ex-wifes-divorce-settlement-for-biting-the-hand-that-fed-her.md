<p>The rancorous divorce proceedings between Janice Schacter and Ira Schacter have dragging on since 2008, when Janice Schacter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150305/http://abovethelaw.com/2008/05/lawyer-of-the-day-ira-schacter/">accused her husband of domestic violence</a> at their Upper East Side townhouse. Ira Schacter was eventually cleared, and tipsters told Above the Law things like, &quot;Not a particularly likable guy. Very controlling of his little fiefdom, and very nasty to anyone perceived to be hitting his bottom line. I am loathe to blame what may be the victim or defend anyone at CWT, but his wife was known around the firm to be extremely abusive to everyone she came in contact with. [She] could be heard screaming obscenities at undeserving secretaries and Ira over the phone.&quot;</p>

<p>Janice Schacter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150305/http://nypost.com/2011/10/24/lawyer-refuses-to-pay-for-daughters-hearing-aids-but-bought-fiancee-diamond-ring/">went to the tabloids to accuse</a> Ira Schacter of not paying for $12,000 in hearing devices for their deaf daughter, while spending $215,000 on an engagement ring for his Playboy Bunny fiancee. (The Bunny eventually broke it off.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150305/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/woman-divorce-lawyer-public-accusations-hurt-business-judge-article-1.1749679">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;In her ruling, [Justice Laura] Drager noted the report about the hearing aids was wrong&#x2014;the daughter had the hearing aids, and the two sides were simply having legal arguments about who should pay.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly, this divorce was not a GOOPy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150305/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/conscious_uncoupling_gwyneth_paltro.php">conscious uncoupling</a> situation&#x2014;this was more like a scorched earth, War of the Roses type-situation. Now a Manhattan judge has ruled that the ex-wife&apos;s public allegations against her former spouse means she&apos;s entitled to a much smaller share of his law partnership. Justice Drager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150305/http://nypost.com/2014/04/08/divorcee-damaged-exs-career-loses-most-of-her-payout/">decided</a>, &quot;In essence, the wife chose to bite the hand that fed her.&quot;</p>

<p>Justice Drager cut Janice Schacter&apos;s share of her ex&apos;s law partnership from $2.5 million to $855,000&#x2014;just 17% of the $5 million value. But don&apos;t worry, we&apos;re sure she&apos;ll make do somehow; the Post reports: &quot;She was also awarded half of the former couple&#x2019;s $10.5 million in other marital assets including proceeds from the sales of a $4.4 million Manhattan townhouse, a $4.5 million Bridgehampton summer home and $400,000 worth of jewelry. Finally she&#x2019;ll get up to $21,000 a month in spousal and child support plus the family Lexus.&quot; </p>
