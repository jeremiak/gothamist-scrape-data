When we checked, it was just flaming at the top.&quot;</p>

<p>The injured civilian who suffered the most serious injuries was rescued from the fifth floor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030050400/http://pix11.com/2016/10/27/huge-fire-erupts-at-ues-apartment-2-civilians-have-life-threatening-injuries-fdny/">One of the firefighters explained</a>, &quot;It was a gentleman partly out the window with a lot of smoke coming out of his head... Myself and two members from Ladder 13 and 43 set up the life-saving rope and they lowered me over. Probably one of most dangerous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030050400/http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2012/11/firefighter-training-days-timed-evolutions.html">evolutions</a> that we do and that&apos;s why we train so much on it.&quot;</p>

<p>The rope apparently caught on fire and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030050400/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Fire-Yorkville-Building-Residents-Displaced-Periscope-Video-398829921.html">burned through just as the two of them reached the ground</a>.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030050400/http://abc7ny.com/news/firefighter-who-rescued-man-at-93rd-st-fire-hope-you-enjoyed-the-ride-/1575396/">Lee added</a>, &quot;You couldn&apos;t see anything over the edge, there was so much smoke and flames going out the window,&quot; and when he managed to secure the man, I told him to stay calm and when we got down, I said, &apos;hope you enjoyed the ride.&apos; He sort of smiled and he was thankful.&quot;</p>

<p>The building, plus two others, were evacuated, &quot;leaving dozens of residents homeless,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030050400/http://abc7ny.com/news/1-dead-1-critical-in-fire-at-upper-east-side-building/1575272/">WABC 7 reports</a>. FDNY Chief of Department James Leonard said, &quot;We are talking about anywhere from 10 to 20 apartments in each building. You can do the math on that.&quot;</p>

<p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Update 8:20 a.m.:</strong> The Red Cross says they are currently assisting 18 displaced families, and their &quot;caseworkers will meet with the impacted families regarding their needs for shelter, financial assistance, and mental health support.&quot;<br>
<strong><br>
Update 9:08 a.m.:</strong> A large part of First Avenue is currently closed to traffic this morning.</p>
