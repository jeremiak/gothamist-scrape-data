<p>Yesterday, we noted that parts of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505161954/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/some_williamsburg_greenpoint_waterf.php">Williamsburg and Greenpoint waterfront would be closed</a> for tonight&apos;s big Macy&apos;s July 4th fireworks display in the East River. Now, here&apos;s the deal with what will be closed in Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p>

<p>According to the BBP website, there areas will be closed:<br>
</p><blockquote>Squibb Park and Bridge will be closed.<br>
The Main Street section of the park will close at 4pm<br>
Barbeques on Picnic Peninsula will be closed.<br>
All playgrounds will close at 4pm.<br>
The Pop-Up Pool &amp; Beach will close at 4pm.<br>
Pier 4 Beach will close at 4pm.<br>
Jane&#x2019;s Carousel will close at 6pm.<br>
Volleyball courts will close at 4pm.<br>
The Pier 2 sports courts will close at 4pm.<br>
The Pier 5 sports fields will close at 4pm.</blockquote>The promenades will stay open, and the BBP Corporation spokeswoman Belinda Cape said the &quot;half acre turf at the end of Pier 2&quot; will be open, as will the lawns. Cape explained, &quot;We are encouraging visitors to use our main entrances at Old Fulton and Furman Streets or Atlantic Avenue and Furman Street.&quot; Also, the Empire Fulton Ferry area, between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, will be open (entrances are at New Dock, Old Dock and Water St, and Main St.). <p></p>

<p>There will also be 100 extra portapotties!</p>

<p>People watching the fireworks will be subject to bag checks, and residents in Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO should have their ID to gain access to their homes as the police will be establishing &quot;frozen zones.&quot;</p>
