<p>Morgan was critically injured and in a coma for two weeks after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235853/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/07/cops_say_dozing_truck_driver_caused.php">dozing Wal-Mart truck driver</a> barreled into a Mercedes Benz van carrying him, fellow comedians, and assistants on the NJ Turnpike last year. One of the passengers, comedian James McNair, died. Morgan settled with Wal-Mart, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235853/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/tracy_morgan_today_show.php">said in an interview</a> in June, &quot;I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m here. I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m in front of you. I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m just here, and just seeing the tragedy that happened. It touches me.&quot; He added, &quot;I love comedy. I&apos;ll never stop loving her. I love comedy and I can&apos;t wait to get back to her, but right now my goal is just to heal and get better because I&apos;m not 100 percent yet, I&apos;m not. And when I&apos;m there, you&apos;ll know it. I&apos;ll get back to making you laugh. I promise you.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235853/http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/12/tracy-morgan-returns-stage-comedy">According to TMZ</a>, &quot;We&apos;re told he absolutely destroyed both shows, as he prepped to host an upcoming episode of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. We&apos;re told the crowds were very small ... [the club] and absolutely prohibited any recording.&quot;</p>

<p>Morgan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235853/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/17/tracy_morgan_snl_host.php">is hosting SNL</a> this Saturday, October 17th. Last week&apos;s host, Amy Schumer, also hit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235853/http://pagesix.com/2015/10/09/amy-schumers-impromptu-snl-prep/">a stand-up stage</a>, with Chris Rock in the audience, before her SNL appearance.</p>
