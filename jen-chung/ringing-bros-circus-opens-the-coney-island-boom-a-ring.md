</div></div>					<p>Last night, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus opened its new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/18/city_announces_ringling_bros_circus.php">one-ring circus</a> in Coney Island.  Mayor Bloomberg and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz were on hand to welcome the show, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://www.ringling.com/TopLanding.aspx?id=21270">The Coney Island Boom-A-Ring</a></em>&#x2014;Mayor Mike even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://nyc.gov/portal/beans/photogallery/images/2009/06/18/23411/34465/234K0537.jpg">checked out the Monster Trucks</a>.</p>

<p>While ticketholders get to see the 29 performers, 6 musicians, 7 dachshunds, 3 Asian elephants and 6 Tigers, there&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://www.ringling.com/FlashSubContent.aspx?id=21272&amp;parentID=848&amp;assetFolderID=876">pre-show access</a> where they can meet performers.  Production manger Jason Gibson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/100953/protestors-greet-circus-opening/Default.aspx">told NY1</a>, &quot;We have a wardrobe rack and you can try on costumes from previous editions of Ringling Brothers Circus. You can learn how to juggle. We have hula-hopping and jump roping, a practice trapeze. Plus there&apos;s an actual ring you won&apos;t see during the show itself.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, when the circus is in town, protesters are on hand also.  Apparently dozens were on hand before last night&apos;s show (though there were closer to eight near show time), to protest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://www.circuses.com/">Ringling Bros.&apos; alleged mistreatment of animals</a> (Ringling is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://www.hsus.org/in_the_courts/news_press/ringling_brothers_courtroom.html">currently facing a lawsuit</a> from the ASPCA and other groups for allegedly inhumane treatment of its Asian elephants in violation of the Endangered Species Act).</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Ringling Bros. performers will participate in the Mermaid Parade and the pre-show will include performers from Coney Island U.S.A. with Coney Island U.S.A.&apos;s Dick Zigun as special guest Ringmaster.  <em>The Coney Island Boom-A-Ring</em> has performances on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday through September 7 (info on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083713/http://www.ringling.com/TourSchedule.aspx?action=details&amp;engagementId=101066">schedule &amp; tickets</a>).</p>
