</div></div>					<p>Chase Utley, the kind of baseball player everyone hates (unless he&apos;s on your team), was issued a two-game suspension after his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/11/chase_utley_most_hated_man_in_nyc_a.php">ugly slide that left Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada with a broken leg</a>. MLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre said, &quot;After thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley&apos;s action warrants discipline.&quot;</p>

<p>Utley&apos;s slide&#x2014;or &quot;tackle&quot; as some Mets have called it&#x2014;during Game 2 of the NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Mets was meant to break up a potential double play. (The Mets ended up getting no outs and the Dodgers won the game, splitting the series so far.) Torre, who previously managed the Mets and Dodgers, said in his statement, &quot;While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intention of injuring Ruben Tejada, and was attempting to help his Club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a)(13), which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LAD INF Utley has been suspended for Games 3 &amp; 4 of NLDS as a result of his illegal slide in the 7th inning on Sat. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://t.co/ktAjmXWFaR">pic.twitter.com/ktAjmXWFaR</a></p>&#x2014; MLB Communications (@MLB_PR) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/https://twitter.com/MLB_PR/status/653378536347201536">October 12, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20151223092936js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>From MLB.com, the rule in question states:</p><blockquote><p></p>

<p> &quot;A batters is out when:</p>

<p>&quot;A preceding runner shall, in the umpire&apos;s judgment, intentionally interfere with a fielder who is attempting to catch a thrown ball or to throw a ball in an attempt to complete any play.</p>

<p>&quot;Comment: The objective of this rule is to penalize the offensive team for deliberate, unwarranted, unsportsmanlike action by the runner in leaving the baseline for the obvious purpose of crashing the pivot man on a double play, rather than trying to reach the base. Obviously this is an umpire&apos;s judgment play.&quot;</p>

<p>Umpires reviewed the play and awarded Utley second base. A replay review showed that Tejada did not make contact with the second-base bag as he attempted to turn the double play, nor did Utley. The Dodgers parlayed that call into a four-run inning, taking a 5-2 lead. Had the play been interpreted differently in the moment it occurred, the seventh inning could have ended with the Mets leading, 2-1, regardless of how far up the line the runner heading to first had advanced.</p></blockquote>Still, the decision has upset some Mets fans...<p></p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So Utley&apos;s &quot;slide&quot; was illegal enough to merit suspension but NOT enough to have been interference and an automatic double play <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Insanity?src=hash">#Insanity</a></p>&#x2014; Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/653384444531900416">October 12, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Utley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://m.mlb.com/news/article/154097810/dodgers-chase-utley-suspended-for-slide">is planning to appeal the decision</a>, and the Dodgers said, &quot;The Dodgers stand behind Chase Utley and his decision to appeal the suspension issued tonight by Major League Baseball.&quot; And his agent said, &quot;A two-game suspension for a legal baseball play is outrageous and completely unacceptable. Chase did what all players are taught to do in this situation - break up the double play. We routinely see plays at second base similar to this one that have not resulted in suspensions. Chase feels terrible about Ruben Tejada&apos;s injury and everyone who knows him knows that he would never intentionally hurt anybody. We will be appealing this suspension immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>Utley has a history of questionable, if legal, slides. Here&apos;s one from a month ago:</p>

<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20151223092936js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>ESPN&apos;s David Schoenfeld <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/64212/kudos-to-joe-torre-for-taking-a-stand-with-utley-suspension">lauded Torre&apos;s decision</a>, noting how Utley&apos;s slide started late, &quot;[Y]es, suspending Utley now, when everyone is paying attention, is absolutely the right time to say enough is enough.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/10/11/chase-utley-rule-slides-mlb-ruben-tejada/73775582/">USA Today&apos;s Bob Nightengale wrote</a>, &quot;We had the Buster Posey Rule two years ago, with players no longer permitted to clobber catchers at home plate, reducing the number of concussions and other injuries. Now we&#x2019;ll have the Utley Rule, where players can no longer wipe out middle infielders at second base, reducing the number of broken legs.&quot;</p>

<p>Many are expecting a chippy Game 3 tonight at Citi Field. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://nypost.com/2015/10/12/mets-fans-still-rage-at-bulls-t-ban-for-dirty-chase-utley/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;The Mets had been thirsty for revenge for the Tejada takeout slide. Hurler Matt Harvey was seething as he prepared for his Game 3 start. &apos;As far as sticking up for your teammates, I think being out there and doing what&#x2019;s right is exactly what I&#x2019;m going to do,&apos; said Harvey, who beaned Utley during a game in April over another incident. &apos;I think the most important thing is going out and doing my job and doing what&#x2019;s best for the team.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Harvey also brought up another of Utley&apos;s slide into Tejada, this one from 2010:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Video of Utley taking out Tejada with a slide 5 years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://t.co/siwWEPbaeM">pic.twitter.com/siwWEPbaeM</a></p>&#x2014; Mike Rosenberg (@RosenbergMerc) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/https://twitter.com/RosenbergMerc/status/653072454747721728">October 11, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20151223092936js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Manager Terry Collins added, &quot;All I know is, for years and years and years, as long as this game is played, and we know there are a lot of changes, players always took care of stuff themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>If Utley&apos;s suspension is upheld, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223092936/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/sports/baseball/payback-for-a-hard-slide-mets-collins-and-harvey-arent-saying.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0">the NY Times points out</a>, &quot;Utley&#x2019;s absence could allow both teams to turn their focus to simply winning Game 3 and perhaps be less concerned about potential beanballs.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mets and Harvey, who is starting tonight, will face the Dodgers, at 8:37 p.m. on TBS. Dodgers starter Brett Anderson Tweeted about the suspension:</p>
