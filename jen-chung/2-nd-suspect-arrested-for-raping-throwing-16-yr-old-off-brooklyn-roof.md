<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623004044/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/victim-brooklyn-rape-serious-condition-article-1.1403614?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News,</a> &quot;Desouza, 24, connected with the teen through Backpage.com &#x2014; a classified advertising website often used to peddle sex &#x2014; and had her come to his East New York apartment early Sunday, the sources said The girl arrived, and the pair went to the roof, where they ran into Desouza&#x2019;s pal, 26-year-old Antonio Owensford, shortly after 3 a.m., sources said. Desouza, while negotiating the terms of their $100 tryst, told the teen that he refused to wear a condom, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>After arguing, the News&apos; sources say that the men raped the girl and then Owensford threw the girl off the building. She suffered injuries to her  leg, arm and back and is in serious condition. Owensford was charged with attempted murder, two counts of rape, assault and strangulation.</p>

<p>Desouza was arraigned yesterday on charges of attempted murder, assault, rape  and strangulation, and his attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623004044/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_busts_in_roof_toss_rape_dvrmvQKonbxtE3sPDFYWNJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">proclaimed his innocence,</a> &quot;He has a job for six years at Whole Foods, lives with wife and children,&#x201D; said his attorney. He strongly denies the allegations and having any involvement in what happened on the roof.&quot;</p>

<p>The president of the 75th Precinct Community Council, Juan Rodriguez, told the Post he saw the victim in the hospital, &quot;The parents are very sad. Who wants to get their 16-year-old daughter raped and thrown off a roof? These guys are monsters.&quot;</p>

<p>One neighbor told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623004044/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brooklyn-Rape-Girl-Thrown-Roof-Police-Suspect-Crime-Attempted-Murder-216135941.html">NBC New York</a>, &quot;I felt bad because I got a daughter and I wouldn&apos;t want that to happen to my child. And I&apos;m a girl and I wouldn&apos;t want that to happen to me. I go out and I come in late at night, and you don&apos;t know what might happen.&quot;</p>
