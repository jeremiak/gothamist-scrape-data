<p>Mayor Bloomberg had very harsh words for Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115023/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/01/plaxico_burress_turns_himself_in.php">turned himself in to the police</a> today (after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115023/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/30/everyone_agrees_plax_is_in_an_idiot.php">shooting himself in the thigh</a> at a nightclub on Friday).  The mayor took some time out to discuss the matter; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115023/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12012008/news/regionalnews/plax_turns_himself_in_141719.htm">Post has quotes</a>:</p><blockquote> &quot;The police only found out about this because of a story on television. The hospital didn&apos;t call and the Giants didn&apos;t call,&quot; he said. &quot;The Giants should have picked up the phone right away as good corporate citizens. I don&apos;t care if there&apos;s a legal responsibility for them to do it.<p></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>They are a team that is here in this region - I know they&apos;re in New Jersey but it&apos;s the New York Giants - and they have a responsibility as a team that depends on the public and wants to be a role model for the public.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;So the police certainly didn&apos;t have any knowledge in advance and once they found out about it they right away went after it.&quot;</p></blockquote>Bloomberg added, &quot;I think it is also an outrage the hospital didn&apos;t do what they&apos;re legally required to do. It&apos;s a misdemeanor. It&apos;s a chargeable offense,&quot; referring to how New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell didn&apos;t contact the police to say they were treating a gunshot wound.<blockquote> &quot;I think that the district attorney should certainly go after the management of this hospital. The lame excuse that they didn&apos;t know - this is a world class hospital in a city where we all know what goes on in the streets of our city and we all should be working together to get guns off our streets.  There&apos;s a reason why hospitals are required by law to immediately call the police department. They didn&apos;t and they should make sure that they people who didn&apos;t no longer work there and I would question why the management didn&apos;t have training in place and didn&apos;t discipline them immediately.&quot;</blockquote>TMZ, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115023/http://www.tmz.com/2008/12/01/plaxico-books-it-to-criminal-court/">video of Burress in handcuffs</a>, spoke to a source who said the player &quot;looked really, really down ... shellshocked.&quot;  And his bail <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525115023/http://www.tmz.com/2008/12/01/bail-set-for-plaxico-burress/">was set at $100,000</a>; the grand jury hearing is scheduled for March 31.<p></p>
