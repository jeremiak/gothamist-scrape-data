<p>The NYPD says that on Sunday, right before 7 a.m., a woman was walking her dog near West 212st Street when a man tried to grab her and remove her clothing. The victim was able to fight off him off, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424005302/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130729/inwood/woman-fights-off-would-be-rapist-inwood-police-say">as did a nearby resident</a>. The victim, who is pregnant, was not injured.</p>

Still, that didn&apos;t reassure residents, one of whom said, &quot;If I had caught him, it would&apos;ve been street justice.&quot;</p>

<p>The initially released video shows the suspect following the victim and grabbing her; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424005302/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/pregnant-woman-assailant-stopped-drink-nypd-article-1.1413490">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said</a>, &quot;It was very brazen, and there was no attempt to cover up what the individual was trying to do, so we&apos;re concerned about it.&quot;</p>
