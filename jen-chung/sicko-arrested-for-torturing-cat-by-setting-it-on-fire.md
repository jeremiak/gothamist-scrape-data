<p>A Bronx man was arrested after allegedly torturing a cat to death by setting it on fire yesterday.</p>

<p>The police say that at 11 a.m. officers responded to a report about a dead animal in front of 690 East 182nd Street. According to the NYPD, a building superintendent showed the cops a video &quot;of a male pouring fluid on a cat who was lying on the ground in front of the location.  The male then proceeded to use a lighter to light the cat on fire before fleeing.&quot;</p>

<p>After seeing the suspect in the video, they canvassed the building, police say, and found Ernesto Bailey, 31, in his apartment and arrested him.  He has been charged with aggravated cruelty to animals, torture of an animal, reckless endangerment and arson. The police released a photograph of the sidewalk where the arson occurred, as well as a truly distressing photo of the dead cat. </p>

And then I saw (Bailey) kick it... From there, I smelled smoke and looked outside and I saw something moving in the smoke. I don&#x2019;t know what possessed him to do that. He must have some sort of mental issues. Only sick people, crazy people, do that. Like serial killers.&quot;</p>
