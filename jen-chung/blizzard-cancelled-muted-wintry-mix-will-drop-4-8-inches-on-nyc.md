<p>The National Weather has measured 4 inches in Central Park as of 8 a.m.; 6 inches was measured in the Bronx (Pelham Parkway), 5.9 inches at Laguardia Airport, and 3.9 inches at JFK Airport. Eighteen to 24 inches of snow may still be in store for Northeastern NJ, Hudson Valley and Southwestern Connecticut. </p>

<p>The city still warned that New Yorkers can still expect &quot;Wind gusts up to 50mph &amp; possible snowfall rates of 2-4&quot; per hour,&quot; which &quot;may result in visibilities of one quarter of a mile or less at times.&quot;</p>

<p>The National Weather Service said reports &quot;significantly decreased snowfall amounts&quot; south and east of I-95, with a &quot;quicker and farther north transition to mixed precipitation and rain.&quot; This &quot;transition&quot; is reportedly &quot;working north through NYC and LI this morning.&quot;</p>

By 6:30 a.m., early-morning snow in Bay Shore had already shifted to rain.&quot;</p>

<p>A big concern is flooding: There are flood warnings along Queens and Staten Island, as well as Long Island and NJ. &quot;During much of the storm, tides will likely run 1-2 feet above normal and can result in coastal flooding at times of high tide. Some beach erosion should be expected,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716134223/http://abc7ny.com/weather/accuweather-alert-blizzard-warning-shifts-nw-canceled-in-nyc/1729386/">WABC 7 reports</a>.<br>
