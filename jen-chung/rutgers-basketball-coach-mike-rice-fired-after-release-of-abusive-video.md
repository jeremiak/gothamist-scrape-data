	<p>Rutgers University fired men&apos;s basketball coach Mike Rice the day after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173737/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/02/video_rutgers_basketball_coach_thro.php">video of Rice&apos;s abusive treatment of players</a> was released. Rice had previously been suspended, but the shocking video appears to have forced Rutgers to reconsider. The school&apos;s Athletics Director Tim Pernetti said, &quot;I am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice. Dismissal and corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong. Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community.&quot;</p>

<p>ESPN&apos;s Outside The Lines featured footage of Rice&apos;s coaching, which showed him calling a player a &quot;f---ing fa---t&quot; and throwing basketballs at players, sometimes in the face (Rice said in one instance, &quot;I hope that hurt. Did it hurt?&#x201D;). </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173737if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/IVoOtpDuZwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The video was compiled by former assistant coach Eric Murdock who was fired last summer. Murdock claims he was fired for speaking out against Rice&apos;s actions (Pernetti says Murdock&apos;s contract was not extended because of &quot;insubordination&quot;). Murdock said that Rice would act nice when Pernetti would come into the gym. In November, Murdock showed Pernetti the footage. Pernetti then decided to suspend Rice and fine him last December. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173737/http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20130402/NJSPORTS0210/304020052/Bridgewater-s-Eric-Murdock-whistleblower-Mike-Rice-abuse-video">Murdock said</a>, &quot;Unbelievable to me that someone would feel that technique can be successful To witness that video and see your coach physically putting his hands on players, physically kicking players, firing balls at players at point-blank range &#x2014; the verbal abuse, the belittling. Yeah, I was in total shock that this guy wasn&#x2019;t fired.&quot;</p>

<p>Pernetti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173737/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/sports/ncaabasketball/rutgers-coach-mike-rice-facing-scrutiny-after-video-airs.html">told WFAN yesterday</a>, &quot;I made that decision. I am accountable for it. I have to live with it... In the end, I am not going to look back and say shoulda, woulda. All I can do is figure out going forward the decisions I can make to fix the problem for Rutgers.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173737/http://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/index.ssf/2013/04/mike_rice_and_his_abusive_beha.html#incart_m-rpt-1">He also said</a>, &quot;We took notice of everything that we saw on that tape that we hadn&#x2019;t seen with our own eyes at practice or at games &#x2014; and dealt with it. You know, the suspension was significant. We certainly saddled Mike on a going-forward basis with some things that are not easy to manage when you&#x2019;re the head basketball coach and you&#x2019;re trying to get better at recruiting and do all those things. But the suspension was necessary.  We chose to take this as an opportunity to re-educate Mike Rice about the Rutgers standard. Because clearly he wavered from that and we don&#x2019;t put up with that here.&quot;</p>

<p>NJ Governor Chris Christie&apos;s office said, &quot;Governor Christie saw the video today for the first time, and he is obviously deeply disturbed by the conduct displayed and strongly condemns this behavior. It&#x2019;s not the type of leadership we should be showing our young people, and clearly there are questions about this behavior that need to be answered by the leaders at Rutgers University.&quot;</p>

<p>Rutgers President Robert Barchi issued a statement:</p><blockquote>Rutgers University has a long and proud history as one of the nation&#x2019;s most diverse and welcoming academic institutions. Coach Rice&#x2019;s abusive language and actions are deeply offensive and egregiously violate the university&#x2019;s core values.  <p></p>

<p>When video excerpts of basketball practices were reviewed last fall by Athletic Director Tim Pernetti, he immediately notified me and sought the advice of internal and outside counsel.  The university hired an independent investigator to look into this matter thoroughly. Based on the external investigator&apos;s findings and recommendations, Tim and I agreed that Coach Rice should be suspended, penalized $75,000 in fines and lost salary, ordered to undergo anger management counseling, and put on notice that his behavior would be closely monitored. Tim Pernetti also made it clear to Coach Rice that there would be zero tolerance for additional infractions. Tim kept me fully apprised and I supported his actions.     </p>

<p>Yesterday, I personally reviewed the video evidence, which shows a chronic and pervasive pattern of disturbing behavior. I have now reached the conclusion that Coach Rice cannot continue to serve effectively in a position that demands the highest levels of leadership, responsibility and public accountability. He cannot continue to coach at Rutgers University.  Therefore, Tim Pernetti and I have jointly decided to terminate Mike Rice&#x2019;s employment at Rutgers.</p></blockquote>Rice&apos;s continued employment was blasted by gay rights advocates. The Human Rights Campaign&apos;s Chad Griffin said, &quot;Imagine the kids at home who look up to Rice as a role model and may view his behavior as a license to bully. Rutgers has an opportunity to send a powerful message that this sort of disgusting behavior should never be tolerated,&quot; while Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, said, &quot;The pattern of behavior in this video is deplorable, inexcusable, in direct violation of the state&apos;s anti-bullying laws, and it&apos;s indefensible that Rutgers hasn&apos;t fired Coach Rice as a result. Further, why did the university wait months to disclose this disturbing footage? The apology and fine issued do not go nearly far enough.&quot;<p></p>
