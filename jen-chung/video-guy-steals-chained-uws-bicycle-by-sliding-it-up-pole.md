<p>Want to steal a bicycle but it&apos;s chained to a sign post? No worries&#x2014;this guy will show you how to set it free! The NYPD is looking for an industrious bicycle thief who decided to steal a bicycle chained to a pole on West 76th Street by <em>sliding it up the pole</em>.   But he didn&apos;t do it with brute strength and an incredible reach&#x2014;he apparently found a ladder in front of a house to aid him! Check out this video the cops released: </p>

<p>Cops say the crime occurred on Saturday, May 26, at 4:56 p.m.: &quot;The suspect, using a ladder, lifted the bicycle up and off a pole it  that is was chained.  The suspect then fled with the bicycle.&quot; What the NYPD neglects to mention is that while the dude has no problem stealing a bike, he&apos;s considerate enough to return the ladder back to the house where he got it.  </p>
