A mattress caught fire in the Bushwick two-family home on Putnam Avenue&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628042517/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/nyregion/30fire.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">according to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Some of the building&#x2019;s residents tried to put the fire out before calling 911 by dragging the burning mattress to a lower floor.&quot; </p>

<p>A FDNY source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628042517/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/29/2011-03-29_grieving_widow_who_lost_2_kids_husband_in_fire_finds_small_comfort_in_salaved_ur.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;They tried to smother the fire. Then they made an attempt to remove the burning mattress. They dragged it down the steps to the third floor,&quot; but instead the fire spread. It&apos;s also believed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628042517/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704559904576230953756161140.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">delay in calling 911</a> may have contributed to the deaths.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Larmond, 62, and daughter Dijahna, 14, were found dead on the fourth floor.  Three-year-old Ja&apos;mayah Larmond was rescued but later died at the hospital; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628042517/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_fire_kills_dad_and_two_k1yA43r5qww5OOErDBBhqN">neighbor said</a>, &quot;I saw a firefighter coming out of the flames cradling a little girl&apos;s body. She looked badly burned. It was horrifying.</p>

<p>Larmond&apos;s wife, Theresa Wilson, had been working at her party-planning store on DeKalb Avenue when the fire occurred. Yesterday, she was grateful when a Department of Buildings official was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628042517/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/29/2011-03-29_grieving_widow_who_lost_2_kids_husband_in_fire_finds_small_comfort_in_salaved_ur.html">able to retrieve an urn from the damaged house</a>; the urn contained ashes from her daughter who died of leukemia a few years ago.  The family, which includes six other children, had apparently moved to the Bushwick home because their previous home was damaged by an electrical fire.</p>
