<p>Chances are good for another massive line outside the Barnes &amp; Noble in Union Square&#x2014;but this time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421224741/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/14/guess_whats_at_the_end_of_this_mass.php">James Franco won&apos;t be at the end of it</a>. Instead, it&apos;ll be former Secretary of State, future Grandmother and <em>still</em> undecided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who will be on hand to promote her new memoir, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421224741/http://books.simonandschuster.com/Hard-Choices/Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/9781476751443"><em>Hard Choices</em></a>.</p>

<p>The signing will begin at 11 a.m., but Simon &amp; Schuster, Clinton&apos;s publisher, says, &quot;A limited number of wristbands will be distributed starting at 8am on Tuesday June 10, and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. Customers will have their copies of HARD CHOICES in the order they arrive. A limit of one book per customer will be signed and the signing of other books and memorabilia will not be permitted. The author will sign a limited number of copies of HARD CHOICES.&quot;</p>

<p>So do not bring any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421224741/http://www.people.com/article/hillary-clinton-people-cover-chair">patio furniture</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421224741/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/06/04/solved-people-magazines-hillary-clinton-cover-mystery/">walkers</a> for her to sign! It&apos;s unclear if she&apos;ll be accepting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421224741/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/17/chelsea_clinton_is_pregnant_fueling.php">baby gifts</a>.</p>
