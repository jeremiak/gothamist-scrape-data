<p>As part of its Food issue, the NY Times Magazine asked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512024948/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/07/magazine/food-disasters.html?ref=magazine&amp;_r=0">different NYC chefs for their &quot;worst kitchen disasters.&quot;</a> Some of the stories were about the lack of electricity (either you get a generator or you comp dinner for everyone who made reservations) or stepping in a bucket of chicken stock, but the most touching one might be about some pot cookies that were too potent.</p>

<p>Brian Leth, chef of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512024948/http://www.vinegarhillhouse.com/index.htm">Vinegar Hill House</a> and Hillside, recounted, &quot;One of the line cooks at a somewhat new restaurant used this incredibly powerful marijuana butter to make cookies. The whole staff was eating them, but only a third of them knew. Everyone found themselves radically out of their depth. I&#x2019;d almost made it through service when someone walked in and ordered two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512024948/http://principiagastronomica.com/post/61">c&#xF4;tes de boeuf</a>. I had to get them down and butcher them. It took an hour to get the entrees to the table.&quot;</p>

<p>The Weed Blog has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512024948/http://www.theweedblog.com/easy-marijuana-butter-recipe/">marijuana butter recipe</a>, natch&#x2014;it&apos;s very elaborate, but it does say, &quot;Marijuana butter is the backbone of many edible marijuana endeavors. Learn how to make marijuana butter, and you will be very popular.&quot;</p>
