But don&apos;t worry: It doesn&apos;t seem terror-related!  U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia describes the suspect, Denis Nekrasov, 28, as a &quot;<strong>homeless immigrant from Kyrgyzstan who had past training in math, physics and mechanical engineering</strong>. &quot;  If you read the complaint (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115935/http://www.wnbc.com/download/2008/0919/17508946.pdf">PDF</a>), you find that he saved the explosive materials from construction sites <em>in hopes of making his own gun</em>.  Nekrasov had gone to 1 Police Plaza to apply for a gun-making permit and left the backpack outside since he knew he couldn&apos;t bring it inside.  And when Nekrasov went to pick up his bag, authorities were waiting and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115935/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09192008/news/regionalnews/gun_maker_gets_nailed_129810.htm">admitted his homemade gun scheme</a>, but it was &quot;<strong>in case he needed to protect or defend himself from others.</strong>&quot;</p>
