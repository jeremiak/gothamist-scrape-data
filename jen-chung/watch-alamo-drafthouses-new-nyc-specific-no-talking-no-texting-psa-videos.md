<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134806/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/05/alamo_draft_house_is_coming_to_the.php">long</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134806/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/alamo_drafthouse_no_longer_coming_t.php">long</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134806/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/05/nyc_is_finally_getting_an_alamo_dra.php">long-awaited</a> Alamo Drafthouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134806/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/25/lets_go_out_to_dinner_and_see_a_movie.php">will finally open its doors tomorrow</a> in downtown Brooklyn.

<p>The Alamo Drafthouse is famous for its reminders about proper movie etiquette, and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134806/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/07/video_should_nyc_bring_this_kind_of.php">used a customer&apos;s drunken dial voicemail</a> complaining about being kicked out for texting in one video. For the Brooklyn location, the movie chain has created videos featuring <em>High Maintenance</em> creators Kaja Blichfeld and Ben Sinclair; Mike Birbiglia, Gillian Jacobs, Keegan-Michael Key, Chris Gethard and Kate Micucci; and Janeane Garofalo. </p>

&quot;While each offers its own uniquely funny spin, the core message of these PSAs is no joke: When watching a movie at Alamo Drafthouse, knock off your chit chat and keep your phone dark, silent, and out of sight&#x2026; or there will be consequences,&quot; a press release explained. &quot;Alamo&#x2019;s policy is indeed serious business: Those who talk, text or otherwise disrupt the movie get one warning. If they persist, they&#x2019;re ejected without a refund.&quot;</p>

<p>Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League adds, &quot;Our commitment to the sanctity of the moviegoing experience, to honoring the hard work and vision of filmmakers with a reverent screening environment, and to having just plain good manners in the public space is unwavering. It has been since the very beginning.&quot; </p>
