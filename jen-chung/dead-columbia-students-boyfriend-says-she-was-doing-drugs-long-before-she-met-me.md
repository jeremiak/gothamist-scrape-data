Relatives of Jessica Fingers accused Peter Russell, who discovered Fingers unconscious, of killing her.  <p></p>

<p>While it&apos;s suspected that Fingers died of an overdose, the Medical Examiner&apos;s autopsy was inconclusive and the ME&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151545/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130401/morningside-heights/columbia-student-found-dead-had-blood-clots-from-birth-control-suit-says">will need to conduct further tests</a>. Fingers had been on leave from Columbia for undisclosed reasons since last year but she and Russell were visiting a friend. </p>

<p>Russell wrote on his Facebook page&#x2014;which he has since deleted&#x2014;that he discovered her body. After Fingers&apos;s relatives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151545/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130401/morningside-heights/columbia-student-found-dead-had-blood-clots-from-birth-control-suit-says">started to post things</a> like he &quot;killed my cuz&quot; and should &quot;go to jail for life,&quot; Russell fired back, claiming, &quot;If any of u idiots knew her then u know she was doing drugs long before she met me,&quot; and &quot;She bought that methadone her damn self.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_03_prussellchat.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151545im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_03_prussellchat.jpg" width="640" height="283"> <br> <i> Peter Russell&apos;s Facebook comments yesterday, before he took down the page</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Russell&apos;s former roommate Thomas Meyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151545/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mom-boyfriend-jessica-fingers-bad-news-article-1.1304616">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;The friends that Jessica had prior to Peter were a party crowd. I understand that her family is grieving and they need someone to blame. But they can&#x2019;t solely put her death on Peter. The two made a conscious decision to do these things.&quot;</p>

<p>Fingers had suffered blood clots in her brain, and was in the process of suing Merck, accusing the pharmaceutical company&apos;s NuvaRing birth control of causing the clots.  She had posted on Facebook last May, &quot;my brain blood clots dissolved!!! no more blood tests &amp; coumadin woot woot!!!&quot; she said about the blood-thinning drug coumadin... Now that I&apos;m off blood thinners and no more MRIs...time to get body parts pierced and re-pierced.&quot; </p>

<p>Her mother said that her daughter had recovered completely, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151545/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mom-boyfriend-jessica-fingers-bad-news-article-1.1304616?localLinksEnabled=false">adding that she &quot;never liked&quot; Russell</a>, &quot;He influenced the decisions she made in the last few months. He wasn&#x2019;t good for her.&quot;</p>
