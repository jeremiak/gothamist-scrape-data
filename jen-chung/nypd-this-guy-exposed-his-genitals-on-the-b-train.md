<p>A Thursday afternoon subway ride turned disgusting for one woman and now police are looking for a suspect wanted for public lewdness. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at about 3 p.m. on March 3rd, a man aboard a Brooklyn-bound B train &quot;exposed his genitals to a 23-year-old female. The [suspect] then exited the train as it entered into the Sheepshead Bay train station.&quot;</p>

<p>The police released images of the suspect, who is described as last seen wearing black sneakers, a black jacket and blue jeans.<br>
 <br>
Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
