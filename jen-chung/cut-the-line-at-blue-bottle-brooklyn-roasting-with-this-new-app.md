<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405003923/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/how_to_wait_on_line.php">Waiting on line</a> is part of life&#x2014;so is searching for ways to bypass lines. Our civilization has been vastly improved by innovations like &quot;Express Checkout&quot; or &quot;VIP Fast Pass,&quot; but if your local artisanal coffee joint is still stuck in the Stone Age with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405003923/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/12/best_coffee_shops_nyc.php">&quot;uncivilized dual-line ordering systems&quot;</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405003923/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrWiWrhID4o">Larry David</a> knows what we&apos;re talking about) then maybe you should look into the new app, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405003923/https://squareup.com/order">Order</a>.</p>

<p>Order is from Square, so if you already use Square, you can just sign in and get ready to go. (Otherwise, you register and link a credit card to your account, etc.) There are hundreds of coffee shops, like Blue Bottle, that have started using Order; the app only launched last month, so some are still working out some kinks. But here&apos;s the gist: Square developed a special &quot;arrival prediction technology&quot; which allows customers to pre-order at participating establishments. &quot;Sellers get alerts to prepare orders when the buyer is close by, providing hot coffee and a cool experience,&quot; the company says.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="orderapp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405003923im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/orderapp.jpg" width="640" height="559" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>After placing your order, you&apos;ll get alerts saying that they are working on your coffee and when the drink is ready. I tried it out at Brooklyn Roasting Company in DUMBO. My alert said it would be ready in the back right&#x2014;but it wasn&apos;t there. An employee had to ask where the Square Order was being made, and pointed me to the other side. I waited about a minute for my perfectly prepared latte.</p>

<p>However, when I ordered an iced coffee about an hour later, the staff at Brooklyn Roasting was a little bewildered why I&apos;d order an iced coffee in advance. A Square employee emphasized that Brooklyn Roasting only joined the program recently and would be working on its Order service.</p>

<p>Square tested the app with Blue Bottle, and Blue Bottle CEO and founder James Freeman said, &quot;We&apos;re always looking for new ways to foster hospitality at our stores and acknowledge regular guests.&quot;</p>
