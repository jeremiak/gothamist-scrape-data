                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_08_mbilala.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127155441im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_mbilala.jpg" width="300" height="271" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday just before 1:30 p.m., a 32-year-old employee at a Brooklyn electronics store was fatally shot. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127155441/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9220163">A witness, Ron Rogers, said</a>, &quot;A guy with a bike, he had on all black, he put his bike right here up against the fence. <strong>My understanding, he went and shot the guy, ran to his bike and took off.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Mohamed Bilal, who was a computer repairman at the New Attitude Variety Store in East New York, was taken to Brookdale Hospital where he was pronounced dead. He had moved to New York from Pakistan, where his wife and child still live, a few months ago to make a better living. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127155441/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/26/brooklyn-electronics-store-owner-shot-dead-during-robbery/">His friend told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;A young man lost his life. He left home probably happy coming to work at a store, and look what happened to him. It&#x2019;s a big tragedy.&quot;</p>

<p>Police are investigating the killing and there&apos;s some suspicion there was an argument before the shooting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127155441/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/26/brooklyn-electronics-store-owner-shot-dead-during-robbery/">One co-worker said</a> that it could have been a fight over a cellphone, adding that there are many surveillance cameras, &quot;<strong>You know a picture tells 1,000 words? So we got those 1,000 words. </strong>Anybody who takes someone&#x2019;s life, they need to be caught.&quot;</p>
