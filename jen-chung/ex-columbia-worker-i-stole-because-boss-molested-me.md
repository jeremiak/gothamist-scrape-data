John Bzdil III, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud, spent $25,000 on his Poconos wedding and thousands on spa products; the Daily News reports, &quot;<strong>Charges against Bzdil&apos;s estranged wife, Heather Brooke Rinehart, were dropped by prosecutors after Bzdil claimed she had nothing to do with the purchase of Bliss items like Mammoth Minty Scrub and Lovehandler.</strong>&quot; Bdzill, who faces 21-27 months in prison, told a judge, &quot;Columbia was turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the fact that I was being sexually abused by [the boss]. Subconsciously, I was trying to make them pay attention to my situation and protect me from [him]. I felt deep shame for what he was doing to me and my inability to make him stop.&quot; However, his old boss, Cesar Rodriguez, who used to be financial director in the department, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522132644/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06122009/news/regionalnews/manhattan/columbia_sex_claim_173838.htm">denied the accusations and told the Post</a>, &quot;When you are desperate, you&apos;ll do whatever you have to.&quot;</p>
