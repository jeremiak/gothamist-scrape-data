<p>One of the most competitive races in yesterday&apos;s state primary was the one for disgraced Lower East Side Assembly Speaker/kingpin Sheldon Silver&apos;s seat&#x2014;and it turns out Shelly&apos;s political machine isn&apos;t as powerful as it once was. Yuh-Line Niou, backed by the Working Families Party, beat Silver&apos;s anointed heir, Alice Cancel, and four other candidates in the Democratic match-up.</p>

<p>&quot;I am humbled to be the first Asian American to represent Chinatown or any part of Manhattan in the state legislature,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2016/09/14/les-democrats-make-history--select-first-asian-american-to-represent-chinatown-in-albany.html">Niou said</a>. </p>

<p>Cancel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/19/alice-cancel-sheldon-silver/">won an April election</a> to replace Silver, garnering 7,873 votes; Niou got the second most votes, with 6,654. Cancel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/fbi_de_blasio_nypd.php">had supported Silver</a>, calling him  &quot;a hero in this community&quot;... right before he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/03/sheldon_silver_sentenced.php">convicted of rampant corruption</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/nyregion/assembly-primary-yuh-line-niou-sheldon-silver.html?_r=0">The NY Times calls</a> Niou&apos;s victory a possible sign that &quot;Mr. Silver&#x2019;s clout is truly on the wane &#x2014; and that voting patterns are beginning to reflect shifting demographics in the area, which is nearly half Asian.&quot; Niou got 2,742 votes (31.8%), while 	Jenifer Rajkumar had 1612 (18.7%	); Paul Newell	had 1381 (16.0%); Cancel received 1069 (12.4%); Don Lee had 984 (11.4%); and Gigi Li got 827 votes (9.6%).</p>

<p>Niou is the Chief of Staff for Assemblymember Ron Kim. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://observer.com/2016/09/sheldon-silvers-anointed-heir-ousted-in-primary/">The Observer explains</a> that she &quot;retained much of the coalition of labor unions and city and state Democratic Party leaders that supported her unsuccessful bid in the special election. The strength of Yuh-Line&#x2019;s fundraising and political backing owes much to Congressman Joseph Crowley, the Queens County Democratic boss, and his ally John Liu, the former city comptroller.&quot; In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2016/04/our-interview-with-assembly-candidate-yuh-line-niou.html">interview with The LoDown</a>, she emphasized how she knows how to work hard and serve the community:</p><blockquote>The former speaker had over $1 million just to do constituent services&#x2026; We&#x2019;re going to be at an $85,000 budget, whoever comes in&#x2026; I run a freshman office, so I know exactly how it&#x2019;s done&#x2026; Because you have such a limited amount of funds and because you have such a limited amount of time, you really need to hit the ground running on day one&#x2026; In Ron&#x2019;s office I was able to help service 30-60 people a day. That&#x2019;s like 10,000 constituent cases a year&#x2026; I&#x2019;m going to make sure that folks really feel taken care of. That&#x2019;s my mission and the reason I want to serve. As I look around, I just see the need.</blockquote>In another hotly contested primary, Marisol Alcantara won the Democratic primary for Adriano Espaillat&apos;s State Senate seat (Espaillat is poised to take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/29/espaillat_claims_victory.php">Rep. Charles Rangel&apos;s House seat</a> in November), narrowly beating Robert Jackson and Micah Lasher, with 8309 (Lasher had 7737 votes and Jackson got 7616). <p></p>

<p>Alcantara, a union organizer, is aligned with the State Senate&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/state/6492-in-race-to-replace-espaillat-ramifications-for-senate-control-his-power-and-more">Independent Democratic Conference</a> [IDC], led by State Senator Jeff Klein. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2016/09/14/alcantara-wins-democratic-primary-for-west-side-senate-seat--but-her-alignment-with-bipartisan-caucus-concerns-dems.html">Klein told NY1</a>, &quot;More importantly I think It means the IDC is going to be around a long time. And we should be. It is responsible for getting a lot of very important things done. We are responsible for the $15 an hour minimum wage. We are responsible for paid family leave, the best program in the nation. The largest middle class tax cut in probably a generation. And we&apos;ve been able to do that by bridging the gap between Democrats and Republicans.&quot;</p>

<p>Or, as we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021224/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/12/primary_guide_nyc_september_13th.php">previously mentioned</a>,  &quot;a vote for [Alcantara] is more or less a vote to keep the Senate under Republican/Cuomo control.&quot;</p>
