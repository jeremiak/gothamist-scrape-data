<p>In last night&apos;s episode, young Annie Reilly tells Detective Kevin Corcoran that she was threatened with being sent to Blackwell&apos;s Island.  And she was right to be scared: Located in the East River, Blackwell&apos;s Island was where New York City had its penitentiary and workhouse.  </p>

<p>Blackwell&#x2019;s Island&#x2014;named after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111419/http://www.rihs.us/landmarks/blackwell_house.htm">Robert Blackwell</a>, whose family had farmed on the land&#x2014; was purchased for $32,500 in 1828, to replace prisoner facilities near Bellevue Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111419/http://www.correctionhistory.org/html/chronicl/nycdoc/html/blakwel1.html">According to NYC Corrections History</a>, the penitentiary was built in 1832 and housed &quot;nearly a thousand inmates, most serving misdemeanor sentences but all were required to perform some daily labor, the tasks varying according to inmate skills and strengths&quot; while a workhouse, built in 1852, had 221 beds for the &quot;punishment of petty violators, many of whom were classified as habitual &apos;drunks and disorderlies&apos; including several who virtually became permanent residents even though the usual stays were counted in days.&quot; The workhouse inmates &quot;were assigned work either in the workhouse shops or at other city institutions.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides the penitentiary and workhouse, there was also a lunatic asylum (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111419/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/what-nellie-bly-found-on-blackwells-island/">where patients were abused</a>), a smallpox hospital and an almshouse where the sick, destitute, and homeless were sent.  Abandoned children were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111419/http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/collections/collections_almshouse.shtml">also sent to the almshouse</a>&#x2014;here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111419/http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/images/childrenx.jpg">report from 1863</a>&#x2014;and many didn&apos;t survive infancy.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a 1903 look at Blackwell&apos;s Island:</p>

<p>Now Blackwell&apos;s Island is known as Roosevelt Island. With 12,000 residents, it&apos;s perhaps most familiar to the public as the place where the tram goes when Spider-Man and the Green Goblin fight:</p>
