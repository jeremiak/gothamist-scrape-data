<p>The day after he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104338/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/robert_de_niro_defends_inclusion_of.php">defended  screening a documentary</a> purporting to show the link between vaccines and autism, Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Robert De Niro said that the film would no longer be included in the line-up.</p>

<p>In a statement released last night, the Oscar-winning actor said, &quot;My intent in screening this film was to provide an opportunity for conversation around an issue that is deeply personal to me and my family. But after reviewing it over the past few days with the Tribeca Film Festival team and others from the scientific community, we do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion I had hoped for. The Festival doesn&apos;t seek to avoid or shy away from controversy. However, we have concerns with certain things in this film that we feel prevent us from presenting it in the Festival program. We have decided to remove it from our schedule.&quot;</p>

<p>The film, <em>Vaxxed</em>, is by Andrew Wakefield, the doctor whose study that claimed autism was caused by the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. His study was later retracted; Wakefield&apos;s license was also yanked, and he&apos;s not allowed to practice medicine in the United Kingdom or United States.</p>

<p>The medical community was aghast at the platform the film was going to have at the Tribeca Film Festival. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104338/https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md">Dr. William Schaffner,</a> Vanderbilt University School of Medicine professor of preventive medicine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104338/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/movies/robert-de-niro-pulls-anti-vaccine-documentary-from-tribeca-film-festival.html?_r=0">told the NY Times yesterday</a> that he &quot;believed &apos;the entire board as well as Mr. De Niro have learned a lot in the last several days.&apos;&quot;</p><blockquote>&#x201C;My hat is off to them for listening, thinking about it, discussing it and responding,&#x201D; he said.<p></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Dr. Schaffner said, it was troubling for scientists that a film promoting &#x201C;discredited ideas&#x201D; got so close to a forum as prestigious as the Tribeca Film Festival.</p>

<p>It gave these fraudulent ideas a face and a position and an energy that many of us thought they didn&#x2019;t deserve,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re all for ongoing reasonable debate and discussion, but these are ideas that have been proven to be incorrect many, many, many times over the past 15 years.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tribeca Film Fest just announced it will screen a vaccine &#x201C;documentary&#x201D; by Andrew Wakefield.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Robert De Niro and his team did the right thing in the right way.

<p>On Friday, De Niro tried to address criticism over the selection of <em>Vaxxed</em>, explaining, &quot;[My wife] Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.&quot;</p>

<p>Filmmaker Penny Lane, who had posted an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104338/https://filmmakermagazine.com/97862-an-open-letter-to-the-tribeca-film-festival-about-vaxxed/">open letter decrying the film last week</a>, told the NY Times, &quot;This wasn&#x2019;t about exposure; it was about credibility. The kind of credibility an A-list film festival, or any important, respected gatekeeper, can give you, especially once you&#x2019;ve been discredited by everyone else.&quot; </p>

<p><em>Vaxxed</em> was to have screening on April 24, with a post-screening discussion with Wakefield and others in the film. It&apos;s unclear whether another film or discussion will take its place.</p>
