<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_07_brmads.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_07_brmads.jpg" width="260" height="223" class="image-left"> </span>Months after appearing on television to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/bernard_madoffs_wife_son_continue_t.php">insist that she had cut off contact with her infamous husband</a>, Ruth Madoff is back in the news.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/ruth-madoff-living-old-greenwich-sources-unwarm-florida-article-1.1036550">Daily News reports</a> that she &quot;has not talked to her spouse for a good six months &#x2014; about the same time that she quietly relocated from Boca Raton, Fla., to Old Greenwich, Conn., to spend more time with her family.&quot;</p>

<p>Ruth Madoff, who also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/29/ruth_madoff_breaks_silence_denies_i.php">claims she had no idea Bernie</a> was running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve moved back to the New York area for one reason: to spend time with my family, particularly Andy and my grandchildren, whom I love dearly... This has been a healing period for me.&quot; Well, let&apos;s see: The Madoff had two sons, Mark and Andrew.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/12/mark_madoffs_suicide_followed_final.php">Mark killed himself</a>, apparently upset at lawsuits saying that he and his brother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/26/trustee_to_sue_madoffs_relatives_fo.php">owed tens of millions</a>, and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/bernard_madoffs_wife_son_continue_t.php">Andrew&apos;s fiancee &quot;wrote a book,&quot;</a> whose publication was moved up because Mark&apos;s widow had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/30/bernard_madoff_thought_his_daughter.php">written a book slamming the Madoff family</a>.  </p>

<p>Ruth Madoff&apos;s sister and brother-in-law <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/madoffs_in-laws_are_chauffeurs_now.php">run a car service</a> in Florida because their assets were wiped out by Bernie. And in the months after her husband&apos;s fraud was uncovered, Ruth Madoff was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210415/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/25/ruth_madoff_takes_the_f_train_to_sc.php">spotted on the F train to Schadenfreude Station</a>.  Anyway, she says the past few years &quot;have been terribly difficult... I lost a son whom I loved dearly. I don&#x2019;t talk to Bernie anymore, and I find it so hard to reconcile my feelings for the man I was married to for over 50 years. Despite this, I&#x2019;ve chosen to move forward with my life and focus on my remaining family, particularly my grandchildren.&quot;</p>
