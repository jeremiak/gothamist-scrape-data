<p>Police released surveillance video of a person of interest in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011859/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/16/cops_man_fatally_struck_by_train_ma.php">yesterday&apos;s fatal subway shoving in the Bronx</a>. Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, had been waiting on the southbound 167th Street D train platform with his wife when a man, an apparent stranger, suddenly shoved him into an oncoming train. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011859/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/nyregion/man-killed-by-train-was-pushed-onto-tracks-police-say.html?_r=0">His 29-year-old son said</a>, &quot;Please tell the world he is a fine, regular family man.&quot;</p>

<p>Kwok and his wife had been on their way to have lunch and buy groceries in Chinatown. <br>

Kwok&apos;s wife wasn&apos;t injured but she was taken to the hospital for trauma. </p>

He then hopped onto a Bx35 bus at Grand Concourse and East 167th Street, where at least one straphanger also was waiting because train service was halted after Kwok&#x2019;s death.&quot;<blockquote>The &#x201C;customer recognized him and thought he was the subway pusher,&#x201D; a source said. &#x201C;The person was too scared [to speak up] and feared for his life, so he waited until the end of the line [before alerting the bus driver].&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>By that time, up to 30 minutes had passed since the man he suspected was the subway pusher had gotten off, sources said. The bus driver quickly called police, who tracked down surveillance video near where the suspect had exited the bus just a few blocks from the subway station.</p></blockquote>The Post adds that Kwok worked six days a week at a factory in DUMBO that produces kitchen accessories; one of his two sons said, &quot;He provided for his family. He wanted us to be successful. His plan was to work and get his sons through school.&quot; <p></p>
