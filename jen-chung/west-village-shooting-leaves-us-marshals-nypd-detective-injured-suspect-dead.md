<p><b>1:57 p.m.</b>: Police Commissioner Bratton confirmed that the suspect was killed. He added that a firearm was recovered.</p>

<p><b>2:45 p.m.</b>: The U.S. Marshals and police officer were trying to execute a warrant for Charles Mozdir, 32, who was wanted for allegedly molesting a child in San Diego in June 2012. He posted $1 million bail but then fled.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2014_07_mozdir.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015335im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_07_mozdir.jpg" width="230" height="293"> <br> <i style=" width:230px; ;display:block"> Charles Mozdir</i></div>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015335/http://nypost.com/2014/07/28/u-s-marshal-nypd-detective-shot-in-nyc-raid/">The Post reports</a> that Mozdir was inside Smoking Culture, &quot;Mozdir opened fire struck the detective in the stomach and also hit the two feds.&quot;<p></p>

<p>CNN&apos;s The Hunt with John Walsh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015335/http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/06/us/the-hunt/">aired a segment about Mozdir recently</a>. Apparently a couple befriended Mozdir after he photographed their wedding and asked him to watch their ailing 7-year-old:</p><blockquote>As she slept in the same king size bed with her son, Mozdir stayed awake by the bedside keeping an eye on the feverish child. The next morning, she thanked Mozdir for being &quot;a great godfather&quot; and she said &quot;that was the last time I saw him.&quot; She said her son told her a short time later about how Mozdir had touched his private parts and told the boy this was normal and that his parents would be upset if he said anything to them.<p></p>

<p>The mother said she was physically ill after hearing this and, after telling her husband, they immediately went to the police. Coronado, California, investigators executed a search warrant on Mozdir&apos;s house and found evidence of child pornography and bestiality on his cell phone and computers, according to U.S. Marshals Service deputy Brian Grimes.</p>

<p>Mozdir was arrested four days after the incident and booked into the San Diego County jail before posting bail the next day. The district attorney told the couple that Mozdir had been accused in another child assault case when he was babysitting a young boy who told his mother. On June 15, 2012, Mozdir failed to appear at his arraignment.</p>

<p>Charges were immediately filed and arrest warrants were issued. Grimes said investigators believe he took all his money and fled. Mozdir indicated he was considering going to Mexico or Japan during one of his last phone calls. His roommate told police that Mozdir had two guns and had threatened to kill himself and kill a victim&apos;s father.</p></blockquote><p></p>
