However, Robert Straniere is the GOP nominee and says he won&apos;t step aside, saying this sounded like &quot;more spin and dirty tricks from disgruntled members of the GOP&quot; (some SI Republicans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122026/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/13/si_beep_molinaro_crosses_party_line.php">don&apos;t like him very much</a>).
