<p>Louis C.K. is busy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108073741/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/27/videos_jerry_seinfeld_turns_up_in_n.php">promoting the new season of <em>Louie</em></a> (which premieres on Monday, May 5th), and he&apos;s also taking advantage of the increased media attention to slam the frenzy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108073741/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/29/louis_ck_hates_common_core_because.php">standardized testing that NYC public school students</a> must endure. Last night, while appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman, the C.K. explained, &quot;The way I understand it, if a school&apos;s kids don&apos;t test well, they burn the school down. So it&apos;s pretty high pressure.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, C.K. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108073741/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/29/louis_ck_hates_common_core_because.php">blasted the questions</a> his daughters&#x2014;ages 9 and 12&#x2014;are facing, Tweeting photographs of the problems, &quot;My kids used to love math. Now it makes them cry. Thanks standardized testing and common core!&quot; He also took the time to reply, via Twitter, to people who think he&apos;s wrong (all while maintaining his support for public school teachers):</p>

<p>One of C.K.&apos;s Twitter exchanges was with Newsweek&apos;s Alex Nazarayan, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108073741/http://www.newsweek.com/sorry-louis-ck-youre-wrong-about-common-core-249313">criticized&apos;s C.K.&apos;s complaints</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108073741/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2014/05/louis-ck-against-the-common-core.html">New Yorker&apos;s Rebecca Mead</a>, though, found C.K.&apos;s issues with testing in line with many parents, teachers and administrators.</p>

<p>On The Late Show, C.K. explained how &quot;the tests are written by people that nobody knows who they are... it&apos;s very secretive&quot; and how much of the year is focused on preparing for the test. He acknowledged that learning can be scary and his math teacher mother taught him the moment when you&apos;re panicking is the moment where you&apos;re about to figure it out. &quot;I&apos;m there for [my kids] in those moments. I say, &apos;Come on, look at the problem.  <strong>And then I look at the problem and it&apos;s like, &apos;Bill has three goldfish. He buys two more. How many dogs live in London?</strong>&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Letterman cracked, &quot;Better notify the Fire Department.&quot; Anyway, here are more of C.K.&apos;s thoughts on standardized testing from yesterday&#x2014;hopefully he&apos;ll pick up again today!</p>
