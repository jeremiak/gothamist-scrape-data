										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2009_12_adupre2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101548im_/http://gothamist.com/2009_12_adupre2.jpg" width="640" height="524"> <br> <i>How time flies! Last year, Dupre was on the Post&apos;s cover as Spitzer&apos;s fling&#x2014;now she&apos;s a columnist.</i></div> <p></p>

<p>We sort of called it&#x2014;after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101548/http://gothamist.com/tags/ashleydupre">Ashley Dupre</a>, best known as former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101548/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/07/ashley_dupre_had_advice_for_elin_no.php">Governor Spitzer&apos;s high-class escort</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101548/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/07/ashley_dupre_had_advice_for_elin_no.php">dished advice to Tiger Woods&apos; wife,</a> we thought she should consider a career as marriage counselor. Instead, she&apos;s found something way more fun for the NY Post&#x2014;an assignment as their new sex columnist!</p>

<p>Yes, Dupre has put on a (sexy) suit and a pair of glasses is posed to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101548/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/spitzer_babe_answers_4duaVqTCJHA38suGawuaiM"> take sex, love and relationship questions in her &quot;Ask Ashley&quot; column</a>. (is this the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101548/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/14/ashley_dupre_already_planning_her_c.php">amazing something</a> she was hoping for?) One question is &quot;Are there telltale signs a man isn&apos;t happy in his marriage?&quot;&#x2014;Dupre suggests, &quot;Ask yourself, when was the last time you did something to make your husband feel loved, special and appreciated... and if you can&apos;t remember, then that&apos;s your sign right there&quot;&#x2014;and another wonders, &quot;How do I know if my daughter may be getting into trouble?&quot;  And here&apos;s a timeless one:<br>
</p><blockquote><strong>My boyfriend wants to know how many men I&apos;ve slept with. Do I give an honest answer? --Anonymous, NYC</strong><p></p>

<p>You don&apos;t give him an answer at all. It&apos;s really none of his business (and vice versa).</p>

<p>It&apos;s like you asking him how many lap dances he&apos;s gotten in his life. You know you&apos;ve each slept with people in the past. It&apos;s part of being an adult and has nothing to do with your relationship now and your possible future together.</p>

<p>Some things are better left unsaid.<br>
</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>After the jump is video of Dupre herself discussing her new column.  What would you want to ask her? </p>
