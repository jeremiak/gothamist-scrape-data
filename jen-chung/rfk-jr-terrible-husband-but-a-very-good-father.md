Kennedy Jr.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191554/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/kenne_diss_by_mary_kin_T8dTCHle26PLsJgmxiQcPJ"> The Post reports</a>, &quot;Instead, he&#x2019;ll take their four children to Florida, according to another source... In Florida, the kids are likely to stay at their grandmother Ethel&#x2019;s oceanfront home in Palm Beach, said a family friend.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary Kennedy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/mary_kennedy_estranged_wife_of_rfk.php">hanged herself in a barn</a> on her Mt. Kisco property last Wednesday; she and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had been estranged, with RFK filing for divorce in May 2010, around the time of Mary Kennedy&apos;s drunk driving incidents. Her friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/mary_kennedys_friends_blame_rfk_jr.php">blamed RFK&apos;s behavior</a> (his alleged cheating and abandonment) for her decline into drinking and depression. They also cited her concern <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191554/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mary-richardson-kennedy-funeral-divided-families-bid-rfk-jr-wife-fairwell-days-suicide-article-1.1081118?localLinksEnabled=false">over sharing custody of their four children</a>.  </p>

<p>RFK and the Richardsons had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/fight_over_mary_kennedys_body_betwe.php">battling over control of Mary Kennedy&apos;s body</a> before the funeral, with the Richardsons trying to prevent her from being buried near the Kennedy family compound in Hyannisport, MA.  But a judge ruled for RFK, who will also give him the $4 million house she had designed.  </p>

<p>A friend told the Post that Robert Kennedy Jr. is a &quot;<strong>terrible husband, but he&#x2019;s a very good father</strong>.&quot; (The Post has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191554/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/the_real_curse_of_the_kennedys_oD8hoAIqjScISxTvboXfQO?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">pretty anti-RFK Jr.</a>) At the funeral on Saturday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191554/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/rfk_jr_at_estranged_wifes_funeral_i.php">RFK said</a>, &quot;I know I did everything I could to help her.&quot;</p>

<p>The private memorial is at the Standard Hotel in the Meatpacking District.</p>
