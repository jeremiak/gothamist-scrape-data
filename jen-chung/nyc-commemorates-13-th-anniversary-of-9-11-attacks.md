The city is holding the remembrance ceremony this morning at the National September 11 Memorial plaza at the World Trade Center. There are six moments of silence&#x2014;two for when the planes hit the towers, two for when each tower fell, one for the attack on the Pentagon and one for Flight 93, which crashed in Shanksville, PA. The names of all victims from the WTC, Pentagon and Flight 93 attacks will be read, as well the 1993 WTC attack victims. Here&apos;s the program:</p>
