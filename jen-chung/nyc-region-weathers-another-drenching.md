<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_flooding2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_flooding2.jpg" width="200" height="163" class="image-left"> </span>With anywhere from one to four inches of rainfall expected in this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/29/more_rain.php">current storm</a>, it&apos;s not hard to see why some residents and business owners are upset.  There was already a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/14/storm_causes_damage_kills_3_across.php">mid-month Nor&apos;easter</a> that flooded homes and downed trees (that caused power outages).  Westchester County&apos;s commissioner of Emergency Services Tony Sutton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nyc_to_set_record_rainfall_totals_NpwXR0NRIVlFcobkioEpTL">told the AP</a>, &quot;Our ground is so wet it&#x2019;s like pouring water into an already saturated sponge,&quot; adding, &#x201C;Thank God we&#x2019;re not expecting real strong winds. That&#x2019;s a break.&#x201D;</p>

<p>NYC is within three inches of breaking the March rainfall record&#x2014;10.53 inches in 1983.  However, WCBS 2 meteorologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535/http://wcbstv.com/local/tri.state.flooding.2.1599178.html">John Elliott said</a>, &quot;This is going to be one for the record books, but it probably won&apos;t break it. It&apos;ll finish somewhere in the top 5 or 3. And remember, this comes after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/27/february_2010_officially_nycs_snowi.php">record February for snow fall total</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>Some NJ residents and businesses were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535/http://wcbstv.com/local/bound.brook.little.2.1597869.html">putting sandbags in front of their buildings</a> to prevent flooding. And Pequannock resident, whose home was flooded with six feet of water, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504073535/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/03/nj_floods_heavy_rains.html">told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s sickening. We&#x2019;re not even done cleaning out from the first storm. You have to laugh, otherwise you&#x2019;re just going to cry.&quot;</p>
