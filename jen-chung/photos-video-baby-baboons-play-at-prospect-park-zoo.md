<p>According to the WCS, &quot;Hamadryas baboons are native to northeastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. They are large, ground-dwelling primates that are found in rocky areas and cliffs. They live in troops that typically include one dominant male and many females. They are highly social and spend much of their time grooming one another, a behavior that maintains and reinforces social bonds within the troop.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see the baboons at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155250/http://www.prospectparkzoo.com/">Prospect Park Zoo</a>&apos;s Animal Lifestyles building. </p>
