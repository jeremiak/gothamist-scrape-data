<p>Yesterday, a woman was killed after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003192133/http://westwood-hillsdale.patch.com/articles/one-dead-in-washington-township-garden-state-parkway-crash">ejected from a car</a> that crashed with another vehicle on the Garden State Parkway around 11 a.m. Now it turns out the incident, near mile marker 168 in Washington Township, NJ, was sparked by the two drivers&apos; road rage.</p>

<p>John Emili, 20, of New City, NY, tried to pass SUV driver Thomas Vanderweit, 27, of Saddle Brook, NJ.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003192133/http://www.northjersey.com/news/One_person_seriously_injured_in_Parkway_crash_in_Washington_Township.html">According to the Bergen Record</a>, &quot;Emili lost control of [his Honda Pilot], which ran off the road to the left, struck a guardrail and was redirected into the travel lanes, where it overturned and struck the left side of Vanderweit&#x2019;s Trailblazer... Witnesses told investigators that both drivers had been moving erratically, tailgating and making numerous lane changes and traveling in excess of the 65 mph speed limit before they crashed.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim, who was a passenger in Emili&apos;s car and not wearing a seat belt, was ejected and later pronounced dead at a hospital.
