</div></div>					<p>We know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528182131/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170526/williamsburg/mekelburgs-325-kent-domino-sugar-factory-two-trees">there will be babka</a>, but now Two Trees has shared new images of what their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528182131/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/15/domino_sugar_factory_sold_to_develo.php">long-gestating</a> Domino Sugar Factory project along the Williamsburg waterfront in Brooklyn. One of the rental buildings will have a 7,000-square foot roof deck and a &quot;chef&apos;s kitchen for catered parties and dinners.&quot; </p>

<p>Developer Two Trees plans to open 325 Kent Avenue this July, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528182131/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/realestate/rental-building-rises-on-domino-sugar-site.html?_r=1&amp;mtrref=undefined">the NY Times reports</a>, &quot;There will be 522 units, 20 percent of which will be affordable-rate apartments. Rent on market-rate units will start at $2,495 for studios, $3,250 for one-bedrooms and $5,195 for two bedrooms.&quot; Yes, this is the building where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528182131/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/16/87000_people_applied_for_affordable.php">87,000 applicants vied for</a> those 100+ affordable apartments.</p>

<p>The facade of the building is &quot;made of zinc and copper and &quot;will oxidize over time,&quot; according to the Times, which also noted that the facade is more staid, while there are terraces in the back:</p><blockquote>Christopher Sharples, a principal at SHoP Architects, said he understands how some might think placing terraces at the rear of the building, rather than toward the water, would seem counterintuitive.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Kent Avenue can handle the scale of a large building facade,&#x201D; Mr. Sharples said. &#x201C;But residents in the rest of the neighborhood don&#x2019;t need to have all the light blocked.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Many of the amenities, including a gym lounge and a chef&#x2019;s kitchen for catered parties and dinners, will occupy the top floors, facing a new park and the East River. There will also be a 7,000-square-foot roof deck and a 2,000-square-foot inner courtyard on the fourth floor with a garden and water feature. Some of the units facing the courtyard will also have private terraces.</p></blockquote>Last month,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528182131/https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-neighborhood-emerging-on-the-domino-refinery-site-1493235312?tesla=y&amp;mg=id-wsj"> the Wall Street Journal said</a> that work on a second, 42-story mixed use tower was &quot;poised&quot; to begin&#x2014;260 Kent Avenue, which will have &quot;a residential tower shaped liked an upside-down letter L, attached to another, fatter 22-story leg, that will house offices, with retail below&#x2014;and there are two more 55-story towers planned, in addition to the old refinery, which Two Trees hope a single commercial tenant will take over. <p></p>

<p>In the public space along the complex, an<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170528182131/http://www.archdaily.com/869762/new-images-revealed-of-brooklyns-domino-sugar-factory-redevelopment"> &quot;Artifact Walk&quot; will feature relics</a> from the Domino Sugar Factory&apos;s past, like &quot;21 Raw Sugar Warehouse columns, approximately 585 linear feet of crane tracks and over 30 industrial artifacts (including several 36-feet tall cylindrical syrup tanks),&quot; per Arch Daily.</p>
