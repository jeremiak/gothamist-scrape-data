He didn&#x2019;t realize what he was doing.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A 36-year-old Asian woman had gotten off a J train around 1 a.m. on Wednesday and was on the escalator when a man threatened her with a &quot;drill bit attached to a wooden handle&quot; and threw her onto the tracks.  The suspect dragged her into the tunnel, where he raped and beat her.  The victim noticed a light in the tunnel and screamed&#x2014;it turned out it was a MTA worker, whose presence apparently scared the attacker.  Police looked at surveillance footage from cameras for the fleeing suspect.  </p>

<p>Michael Torres, 29, was arrested at a Bowery men&apos;s shelter.  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, &quot;That [surveillance image] was taken by detectives to the surrounding area, someone recognized him, and he has a very lengthy record.&quot; Torres has at least 27 previous arrests, for assault and drugs.</p>

<p>Torres&apos;s ex told the Post, &quot;<strong>He blacked out [from alcohol] and when she screamed he realized what he was doing and ran away.</strong> He told me over the phone.&quot;  He was charged with assault, rape, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal sex acts.  A man who lives in Torres&apos; building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154219/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-subway-tunnel-rape,0,4281803.story">spoke to WPIX 11</a> that he was &quot;totally astonished, totally shocked ... if it&apos;s true they should lock him up and throw away the key.&quot;</p>

<p>In the meantime, female subway riders are on edge, &quot;I&apos;m on the subway all the time, it&apos;s scary. It&apos;s terrible&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s scary to know someone here is doing malicious crimes like that.&quot;<br>
