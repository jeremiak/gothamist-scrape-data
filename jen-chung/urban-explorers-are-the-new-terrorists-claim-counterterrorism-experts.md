</div></div>					<p>Now that Osama bin Laden is dead, let&apos;s look at the people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122244/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/10/illicit_photos_from_deep_inside_the.php">trespassed into the Domino Sugar Factory</a> earlier this month! A counterterrorism authority has cited photographs on urban exploration website as being aids for terrorists. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122244/http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/urban-exploration-terrorism/">According to Wired</a>, the National Counterterrorism Center is the nation&#x2019;s premiere all-source center for counterterrorism analysis, and the group wrote, &quot;Urban Explorers (UE) &#x2014; hobbyists who seek illicit access to transportation and industrial facilities in urban areas &#x2014; frequently post photographs, video footage, and diagrams on line [sic] that could be used by terrorists to remotely identify and surveil potential targets.&quot;</p>

<p>The group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122244/http://publicintelligence.net/nctc-urban-exploration/">Public Intelligence</a> the NCTC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122244/http://publicintelligence.net/nctc-urban-exploration/">PDF warning</a> (above), which included, &quot;Any suspicious UE activity should be reported to the nearest State and Major Area Fusion Center and to the local FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force.&quot; </p>

<p>The LTV Squad, whose members are passionate urban explorers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122244/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/31/the_underbelly_project.php">thinks the NCTC is full of it</a>, pointing out that there&apos;s tons of material out there, from government agencies (hello, MTA Flickr stream) to Google Maps. Also: &quot;When we find something that isn&#x2019;t right, we make sure it gets reported immediately. Over the last few decades NYC explorers have reported gas leaks &amp; harmful conditions, reported at least 2 dead bodies, and prevented at least one enormous fire. No one would have noticed or reported any of these if we weren&#x2019;t out going where &#x2018;you&#x2019;re not suppose to be&#x2019;.&quot;</p>
