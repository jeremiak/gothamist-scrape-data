He targets his victims on the subway platform, grabs their purses and then runs into the subway tunnels.</p>

<p>The suspect has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142012/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6146017">committed four robberies in the past five days</a>, all during the morning rush hour, all with female victims.  Here&apos;s a list of the robberies, via WNBC:</p><blockquote>The man first struck at approximately 8:30 a.m. Sunday on the L subway at 14th Street and First Avenue, police said. The man approached a 24-year-old female who was sitting on a platform bench, grabbed her purse and then fled, police said.<p></p>

<p>Two days later, at about 9:20 a.m. on the 1 subway at Seventh Avenue South and Christopher Street, the suspect approached a 38-year-old woman, grabbed her purse and then fled.</p>

<p>The next morning, at about 9:05 a.m., the same man is believed to have approached a 30-year-old woman on the L subway at 14th Street and Third Avenue, grabbed her purse and then fled into the subway tunnel for a third time.</p>

<p>His most recent attack was just after 7:30 a.m. on the northbound 6 platform at Lafayette and Bleeker streets. He is said to have approached a 27-year-old woman&#x2019;s purse before fleeing into the subway tunnel.</p></blockquote>The NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142012/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=81650">released a sketch of the suspect</a>, described as a man who is age 30 to 35 years old and approximately 5&apos;9&quot;, with a medium build.
