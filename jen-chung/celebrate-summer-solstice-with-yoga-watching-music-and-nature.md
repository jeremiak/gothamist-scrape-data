<p>Tomorrow, June 21, is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, and there are definitely ways to mark the occasion. The biggest event is tomorrow&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162124/http://timessquarenyc.org/events/solstice-in-times-square/index.aspx">annual Solstice in Times Square</a>, where people flock to practice yoga in the middle of the city. Pre-registration for the 1,200 spots has closed, but you can sign up for the waiting list. </p>

<p>You can also admire the yogis in action throughout the day (there are five classes)&#x2014;besides seeing them in person, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162124/http://timessquarenyc.org/events/solstice-in-times-square/yoga-live-webcast/index.aspx">you can watch a webcast</a>&#x2014;and perhaps be inspired to sign up for a yoga class yourself. Plus there are fashion shows from Athleta. (<em>Friday, June 21, starting at 7:25 a.m.; Broadway between 43rd and 48th Streets in Times square</em>)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162124/http://northbrooklynboatclub.org/">North Brooklyn Boat Club</a>, a volunteer group advocating for more human-powered boating around  around Greenpoint and Williamsburg, is having its second annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162124/https://www.facebook.com/events/133762786828436/">Summer Solstice Party</a>, also tomorrow.

<p>A stunning concert will be held very early on Saturday at The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine: Paul Winter is presenting his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162124/http://www.stjohndivine.org/Solstice2013.html">18th annual Summer Solstice Concert</a>. Here&apos;s how St. John the Divine describes it, &quot;Imagine yourself inside the world&#x2019;s largest Gothic Cathedral in the predawn darkness as the canyon-esque space resounds with earth music.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162124/http://solsticeconcert.com/">Winter himself says</a>, &quot;We begin playing in total darkness at 4:30 a.m. within the awesome space and acoustics of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. We embark on a continuous two-hour musical journey, with players stationed in distant corners or moving among the audience. Somewhere near the halfway point, listeners gradually realize that the Cathedral&#x2019;s great stained-glass windows are beginning to illuminate. The light joins the sound to carry us into the first dawning of summer.&quot; (<em>Saturday, June 22, 4:30 a.m.; $35, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan<em>)</em></em></p><em><em>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162124/http://queensbotanical.org/">Queens Botanical Garden</a> also has solstice fun planned on Sunday: There&apos;s a bird walk and nature walk, as well as old fashioned children&apos;s games and face-painting.
