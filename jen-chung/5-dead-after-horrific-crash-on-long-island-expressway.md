---

	
										<p><br>
Five people, including a 10-year-old boy, are dead after an SUV driver going east apparently lost control of his car and crossed a Long Island Expressway median in Manorville&#x2014;and then went airborne hitting two other vehicles. Many first responders called it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015736/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Long-Island-Expressway-Dead-Accident-390845511.html">one of the &quot;worst&quot; crashes</a> they&apos;d ever seen.</p>

<p>The crash occurred around  9:35 a.m. near Exit 68 on the LIE, and the Suffolk County police said that Carmelo Pinales, 26, was driving east in the Subaru Outback that barreled into the westbound lanes, hitting a Honda and a BMW. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015736/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/lie-crash-in-manorville-results-in-5-killed-6-hurt-cops-say-1.12206004#autoplay=true">Suffolk County Chief of Detectives Gerard Gigante said</a>, &quot;It looks like the Outback went airborne, hit the top of the Honda &#x2014; the Honda doesn&#x2019;t have front-end damage, but has significant roof damage. And it appears the BMW and the Outback collided. The engine of the Outback was thrown several hundred feet into the woods. The car is pretty much destroyed. It&#x2019;s broken up into numerous pieces.&quot;</p>

<p>Investigators are looking into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015736/http://pix11.com/2016/08/22/5-dead-including-10-year-old-boy-and-former-cuomo-aide-in-lie-multi-car-crash/">whether Pinales was speeding</a>. However, according to WABC 7, &quot;Relatives of the Pinales&apos; family say they believe an earlier accident left an oil spill, which contributed to the crash.&quot;</p>

<p>Governor Cuomo issued a statement, &quot;I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of those lost in the accident that occurred on Sunday morning on the Long Island Expressway... I personally knew Scott Martella who was among those killed in the crash as he served in my administration for more than four years. Scott was a dedicated, beloved public servant who worked day in and day out to improve the lives of his fellow New Yorkers. Scott was always full of big ideas to help solve the toughest challenges of the day, and he was deeply respected for his strong work ethic, candor and fighting spirit. Long Island is a better place today because of his service and dedication to the community.&quot;</p>
