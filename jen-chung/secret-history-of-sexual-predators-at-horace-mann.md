<p>Today, the NY Times published its big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608032657/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/magazine/the-horace-mann-schools-secret-history-of-sexual-abuse.html?ref=magazine">weekend magazine feature online</a>, and it&apos;s a sprawling look at decades of alleged sexual abuse at one of New York City&apos;s top private schools.  Former student Amos Kimel, who graduated in 1982, begins by describing about the lush campus was a world away from his I.S. 144 in the Bronx, &quot;Shortly after my arrival, a new friend walked me around the school, pointing out teachers to avoid. &apos;What do you mean? Like, they&#x2019;re hard graders?&apos; &apos;No. Perverts. Stay away from them. Trust me.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>What follows are anecdotes from other former students&#x2014;all male&#x2014;who discuss how various male teachers preyed upon them.  One recalled that as an eighth grader, a popular art teacher and football coach asked to draw a portrait of him, &quot;He told me to bring a bathing suit, but when I got there he said not to bother putting it on. I was really uncomfortable but did it anyway since he was across the room. I remember exactly what he said: that he needed to see the connection between my legs. The next thing I knew, he had my penis in his hand. I was so scared.&quot;</p>

<p>There are numerous other instances of former students recounting how they were assaulted by teachers.  One alum started a website about one teacher that abused him in 1973, and decades later, that same teacher assaulted a Class of 1994 student, Ben Balter.  When Balter&apos;s mother confronted the Swiss teacher, he allegedly claimed, &quot;Ben kissed me first,&quot; and when she said, &quot;How dare you put your tongue down my son&#x2019;s mouth!&quot; he told her, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s how we Swiss kiss.&quot;  His mother confronted the administration, but was stymied when a lawyer demanded evidence.  Balter killed himself in 2009.</p>

<p>Still, Kamil notes:</p><blockquote>I have several friends who confided in me, back in high school, about their own sexual encounters with teachers, but who are now unwilling to talk about it. I can&#x2019;t say I blame them. Victims rarely speak out, said Paul Mones, a lawyer who represents people who have been sexually abused by authority figures. &#x201C;The whole goal of the grooming process is to wrap the child close,&#x201D; he told me. &#x201C;The affection and trust is to make the kid complicit in the act. Make them feel like it was their fault, so it won&#x2019;t even occur to them to talk.&#x201D; Even if they do, New York State&#x2019;s statute of limitations, which says people who were victimized as minors cannot take civil action against an abuser after they turn 23, makes it unlikely that they would find justice.</blockquote>The school would not comment about the accusations, only saying that there are policies in place for people to report incidents of sexual abuse; a former board of trustees member told Kamil, &quot;No one will talk to you. They are all lawyering up.&quot;<br>
