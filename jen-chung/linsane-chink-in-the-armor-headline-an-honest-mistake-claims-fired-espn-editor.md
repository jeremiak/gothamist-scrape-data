<p>After being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/19/espn_fires_linsanely_racist_headlin.php">fired by ESPN</a> for penning a racist headline <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/18/wtf_espn_offers_linsanely_racist_he.php">highlighting Jeremy Lin&apos;s shortcomings&#x2014;&quot;Chink In The Armor&quot;</a>&#x2014; for the Knicks&apos; loss against the Hornets, the wordsmith spoke out.  Anthony Federico <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/jeremy-lin-slur-honest-mistake-fired-espn-editor-anthony-federico-claims-article-1.1025566">spoke to the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>This had nothing to do with me being cute or punny. I&apos;m so sorry that I offended people. I&apos;m so sorry if I offended Jeremy</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Federico also said, &quot;ESPN did what they had to do,&quot; but he emphasized that he meant no ill will, explaining that he allegedly used the phrase &quot;at least 100 times.&quot; (Fun fact: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://espn.go.com/">ESPN.com&apos;s search</a> won&apos;t let you search for the phrase&#x2014;it turns up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://search.espn.go.com/s/404/?ref=http%3A%2F%2Fespn.go.com%2F404.html&amp;404=true">404 error</a>!) The 28-year-old also described himself as an &quot;outspoken Christian... My faith is my life. I&apos;d love to tell Jeremy what happened and explain that this was an honest mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides Federico&apos;s firing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/19/espn_fires_linsanely_racist_headlin.php">ESPN suspended anchor Max Bretos</a> for using the phrase when asking Walt Frazier about Lin&apos;s weaknesses (&quot;If there is a chink in the armor, where can he improve his game?&quot;).  Bretos said on Twitter, &quot;Wanted 2 apologize 2 all those I have upset. Not done with any racial reference. Despite intention,phrase was inappropriate in this context...My wife is Asian, would never intentionally say anything to disrespect her and that community.&quot;</p>

<noscript><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://polldaddy.com/poll/5960643/">Is the outrage of the ESPN.com headline justified?</a></noscript></p>

<p>Lin himself said of the controversy, &quot;They&apos;ve apologized, and so from my end, I don&apos;t care anymore. You have to learn to forgive, and I don&apos;t even think that was intentional.&quot;  The streaking player is no stranger to hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110104118/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Lin#Racial_issues">racial taunts during games</a>.</p>
