<p>The stock trader-turned-backgammon federation founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052458/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/02/estranged_husband_finally_arrested.php">arrested for killing his wife</a> in 2009 has been barred from talking to anyone except for his lawyer, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052458/http://nypost.com/2015/11/09/wife-killer-plotted-to-marry-off-daughter-to-get-her-inheritance-prosecutor/">prosecutors suggest that he was trying to</a> &quot;kidnap his teen daughter and marry her off in a diabolical bid to access her inheritance.&quot;</p>

<p>Roderick Covlin was indicted last week for the murder of his estranged wife Shele Danishefsky Covlin. The couple was in the middle of an acrimonious divorce&#x2014;she had a restraining order against him&#x2014;but lived across the hall in the same Upper West Side apartment building. On December 31, 2009, their young daughter discovered Danishefsky Covlin&apos;s unconscious body in a bathtub. It was initially believed that she slipped and fell, but an autopsy showed she was killed: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052458/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/nyregion/manhattan-man-charged-in-wifes-killing-is-barred-from-talking-to-anyone-but-lawyer.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, she died during a struggle, &quot;Her neck had been squeezed with such force that it fractured the hyoid bone. There was bleeding in her right eye. Two ribs were dislocated.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Danishefsky Covlin was scheduled to meet with a lawyer to cut Covlin out of her will; her estate is worth a reported $4 million. While he was always a suspect, Covlin was arrested nearly six years after the crime, after his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052458/http://nypost.com/2015/11/03/man-busted-in-wifes-killing-told-girlfriend-what-hed-done-sources-say/">girlfriend allegedly went to the authorities</a>.</p>

<p>At a hearing yesterday, prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos said, &quot;He comes up with a plan to kidnap his 13-year-old daughter, take her to Mexico and pay some Mexican $10,000 to marry her so she&#x2019;ll no longer be a minor and he&#x2019;ll get access to the money.&quot; </p><blockquote>The prosecutor then played a 2013 audio recording of the suspect talking &#x200B;on the phone &#x200B;to an unidentified person about the marital scheme.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I have a passport for Anna,&#x201D; he can be heard saying. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure that for 10,000, there&#x2019;s not some 18- year-old who would be willing to marry her and remain married and obviously not live with her but like whatever and like sign a pre-nup or whatever.&#x201D;</p>

<p>He then discusses hiring a Mexican law firm &#x201C;to make sure it&#x2019;s done properly.&#x201D;...</p>

<p>In another sick twist, Bogdanos told Justice Bonnie Wittner that Covlin had &#x201C;poked&#x201D; several adolescent girls as young as 11 on Facebook in 2012.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Please stop poking me or I will report you as a pedophile so watch out!&#x201D; one girl replied.</p></blockquote>Covlin&apos;s defense attorney Robert Gottlieb called the evidence &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;circumstantial,&quot; and said that even if he was able to access his children&apos;s inheritance, he would only be allowed the $30,000-50,000/year in interest and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052458/http://nypost.com/2015/11/09/wife-killer-plotted-to-marry-off-daughter-to-get-her-inheritance-prosecutor/">said of the Mexican marriage scheme</a>, &quot;It was not to gain money, it was not to kidnap somebody, it was not to leave the jurisdiction, it was to protect his children.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The children are currently in the custody of Covlin&apos;s parents.</p>

<p>Still, Justice Bonnie G. Wittner ruled Covlin remain held without bail&#x2014;and that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052458/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/nyregion/manhattan-man-charged-in-wifes-killing-is-barred-from-talking-to-anyone-but-lawyer.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">he can only have contact with Gottlieb</a>, &quot;Who else had the motive? Who else had the opportunity? If you credit the medical examiner&#x2019;s findings at autopsy, it&#x2019;s a very powerful case.&quot;</p>
