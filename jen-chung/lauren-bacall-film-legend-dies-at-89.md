</div></div>					<p>Lauren Bacall, who played femme fatales and other commanding women in countless films and plays, died this morning at age 89. She had a stroke in her New York home.</p>

<p>Bacall, born Betty Joan Perske in the Bronx, was an aspiring actress and part-time model, was discovered by director Howard Hawks&apos; wife, who said she should be tested for an upcoming Humphrey Bogart movie, <em>To Have And Have Not</em>, after seeing Bacall on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014756/http://www.sheilaomalley.com/?p=2823">cover of Harper&apos;s Bazaar</a>. She got the part and, at 19, played opposite Bogart in the 1944 film. Her film debut was memorable, because she held her own against Bogart with what was called &quot;The Look&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014756/http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/08/12/arts/12reuters-people-laurenbacall.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=WireFeed&amp;module=pocket-region&amp;region=pocket-region&amp;WT.nav=pocket-region&amp;_r=0">which she explained</a>, &quot;I used to tremble from nerves so badly that the only way I could hold my head steady was to lower my chin practically to my chest and look up at Bogie.&quot;</p>

<p>And, of course, she had one of the most famous lines in movie history: &quot;You know how to whistle, don&apos;t you? You just put your lips together and blow.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150510014756if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/KY15R3yHBEI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>She and Bogart, who was married at the time, also began an affair during the filming and were married a year later. They had two children and were together until his death in 1957. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014756/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/legendary-actress-lauren-bacall-dies-at-age-89/">According to CBS News</a>, &quot;Bacall said she never got over the loss.... Bacall once worried her obituary would be all about Bogart. But stealing Bogie&apos;s heart was just the opening act in a career that lasted decades and made her one of the last of the stars of Hollywood&apos;s golden age.&quot; </p>

<span class="photo_caption">Lauren Bacall sits atop a piano played by President Harry Truman in 1945</span></p>

<p>Bacall also starred in more film noire with Bogart&#x2014;<em>The Big Sleep</em> (1946), <em>Dark Passage</em> (1947) and <em>Key Largo</em> (1948)&#x2014;as well as <em>How to Marry a Millionaire</em> (1953) with Marilyn Monroe, <em>Designing Woman</em> (1957) with Gregory Peck and <em>Harper</em> with Paul Newman. But her only Academy Award nomination was for 1996&apos;s <em>The Mirror Has Two Faces</em>, as Barbra Streisand&apos;s mother.</p>

<p>She was also active on Broadway, winning Tony Awards for <em>Applause</em> (1970) and <em>Woman of the Year</em> (1981). She even made instant decaffeinated coffee seem glamorous:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014756/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lauren-bacall-dead-hollywood-icon-719699">The Hollywood Reporter says</a>, &quot;She admitted that being a &apos;legend&apos; and &apos;special lady of film&apos; unnerved her because &apos;in my slightly paranoiac head, legends and special ladies don&#x2019;t work, it&#x2019;s over for them; they just go around being legends and special ladies.&apos;&quot; Well, legends mean nothing to Christopher Moltesanti:</p>

<p>After Bogart&apos;s death, Bacall was engaged to Frank Sinatra (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014756/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20072825,00.html">&quot;he behaved like a complete shit&quot;</a> though he was good to break off the engagement) and was married to Jason Robards (&quot;The marriage ended when I came across a letter written to him by his girlfriend.&quot;). She said what tied all three men together was how they were &quot;all off-center people&#x2014;trouble and troubled. They all had talent, humor and were very complex. I suppose I must like all of that. No one simple ever thought I was great.&quot;</p>
