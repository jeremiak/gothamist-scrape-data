<p>If you&apos;ve been wondering when bears would finally wise up and partake in NJ&apos;s fine public school system, you can stop: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510012947/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/07/exclusive-bear-smashes-into-n-j-elementary-school-gets-chased-by-custodian/">WCBS 2 has video</a> of a little bear visiting Ogdensburg Elementary School on Friday.

<p>Custodian  Earl Hornyak said, &quot;I see a bear running down the hallway. I kind of &#x2026; I am not afraid of a bear cause I see &#x2018;em a lot around here.&quot;  He ended up running after the bear but &quot;then it decides to go in a classroom.&quot; The teacher, who hustled her class out, said that the bear seemed disoriented as he sat down destroying math books.  </p>

<p>The police helped remove the bear out of a window, but, having developed a taste for academia, the<em> bearudite </em>carnivore returned to the campus (though didn&apos;t break in), according to WCBS 2. And Hornyak admits that he wouldn&apos;t have chased the bear if it had been a big one.   </p>

<p>Back in 2007, a NJ school was locked down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510012947/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/17/d_is_for_deer.php">because a deer was inside</a>.</p>
