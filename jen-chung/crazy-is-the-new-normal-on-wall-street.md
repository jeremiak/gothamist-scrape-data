<p>Stocks are down about 1% now. The director of floor operations at UBS, Art Cashin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628185045/http://www.cnbc.com/id/27400520">told CNBC</a>, &#x201C;<strong>It&#x2019;s a little crazy again today. I wish we could see a little more signs of panic. </strong>It&#x2019;s the last Monday in October, it&#x2019;s a perfect day for it if we could really get &#x2018;em to throw &#x2018;em out the window, this could be important today.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>The Dow&apos;s downward spiral has spawned a race to forecast the economy--one former Yale professor who studied economic forecasting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628185045/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/business/27markets.html?ref=business">tells the NY Times</a>, &quot;To make a crazy forecast today is not crazy.  <strong>It&apos;s not crazy to predict the Dow is going to 2,000.  That&apos;s in the realm of possibiity.</strong>&quot;</p>

Also, 14 more banks have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628185045/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/business/economy/28assist.html?ref=business">signed up for bailout money</a>, including PNC, Capital One, and State Street.</p>
