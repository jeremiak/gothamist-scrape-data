<p>Last month, a number of real estate developers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104839/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/24/freedom_tower_now_coveted_by_real_e.php">vying to buy a minority stake</a> in One World Trade Center, also known to the patriotic as Freedom Tower, because, as one stated, it &quot;has real international significance, and it&#x2019;s important for New York.&quot;  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104839/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/nyregion/14wtc.html?hp">NY Times reports</a> that there may be enough international significance to prompt publisher Conde Nast to <em>move</em> its publications there.  </p>

<p>The Times calls it &quot;a potential coup for the signature skyscraper&quot; and says that &quot;secret&quot; talks are taking place about Conde Nast possibly taking up to 1 million square feet.  Alliance for Downtown New York president Elizabeth Berger thrills at the idea of Vogue, GQ, Vanity Fair, New Yorker, etc. staffers traipsing on Church Street, &quot;It&#x2019;s the perfect place for them. <strong>The lunch crowd will be very well dressed. And where else can you go to Tiffany and Century 21 on your lunch hour?</strong> Lower Manhattan is increasingly a place where progressive, interesting companies want to be. They&#x2019;d do for us what Cond&#xE9; Nast did for Times Square when they built their current building.&quot; </p>

<p>Conde Nast&apos;s spokesman told the Times, &quot;At this time we&#x2019;ve got nothing to say.&quot;</p>
