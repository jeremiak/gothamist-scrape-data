<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092405/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ambulance_hit_xGHsKj6FB4JJj4ZSXhjpcJ">Post reported on an interesting statistic</a>: &quot;The FDNY is writing off $120 million in EMS ambulance services provided each year to uninsured patients, a top official yesterday told the City Council.&quot;  Assistant FDNY Commissioner Steve Rush explained, &quot;If a person doesn&#x2019;t have insurance, in most cases they do not pay.&quot;</p>

<p>He further explained that even though the FDNY offers uninsured patients a reduced charge, it&apos;s rarely paid, and no collection agencies are interested in trying to collect that debt.  The Post adds, &quot;The unpaid ambulance bills represent 32 percent of the $380 million that it costs taxpayers annually to run the fleet of ambulances.&quot;  Remember when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092405/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/10/fdny_charging_for_car_accident_help.php">FDNY wanted to charge for responding to accidents</a>:  $490 to respond to a crash or car fire involving injuries, $415 for a car fire without injuries and $365 for a basic crash without injuries?  That was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092405/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/phew_the_fdny_crash_tax_is_dead.php">squashed last year</a>.</p>
