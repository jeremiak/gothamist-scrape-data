<p>A little afternoon debate humor: Late Night with Conan O&apos;Brien&apos;s canine correspondent, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog went to Hofstra to revel in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806154714/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/15/mccain_obama_get_in_last_shots_in_l.php">Wednesday night&apos;s debate</a> excitement.  He also brought Mr. Met for surprise appearance in &quot;Spin Alley&quot; and chatted up Fox News personalities, like that girl Alan Colmes.  </p>

<p>Also, The Daily Show&apos;s take on Joe the Plumber&apos;s 15 minutes of fame was pretty amusing (video after the jump):</p>
