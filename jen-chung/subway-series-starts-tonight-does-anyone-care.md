<p><img alt="2008_05_metsyankes.JPG" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811084250im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_05_metsyankes.JPG" width="231" height="167" class="right">Tonight (if it&apos;s not rained out), the Yankees and Mets will begin this season&apos;s first subway series at Yankee Stadium.  </p>

<p>The thing is, there doesn&apos;t seem to be the same kind of excitement for this meeting.  In today&apos;s Post, Mike Vaccaro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811084250/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05162008/sports/yankees/rivalry_goes_from_subway_to_subpar_111052.htm">wrote</a>, &quot;What happens when the Subway Series arrives and one team is only a game north of .500 and the other is two games south? What happens when the teams are a combined 40-41 across fully one-quarter of the baseball games they will play this year?&quot; </p>

<p>Mike Lupica <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811084250/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/2008/05/15/2008-05-15_basement_bombers_vs_bickering_mets.html">wrote in the Daily News</a>, &quot;Somehow the Mets have a better record than the Yankees, the last-place Yankees, and still look like a team in more trouble.&quot;  Ouch, but of course those remarks aren&apos;t as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811084250/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/sports/baseball/16wagner.html?ref=baseball">bad as Mets closer Billy Wagner&apos;s rant</a>, who is either a loudmouth or just someone who tells it like it is.</p>

<p>Oh, and Jason Giambi reportedly wears a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811084250/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05162008/sports/jason_giambi_wears_gold_thong_for_luck___111139.htm">gold, tiger-striped lam&#xE9; thong</a> for good luck.   He said, &quot;I only put it on when I&apos;m desperate to get out of a big slump,&quot; and claims fellows Yanks Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, Johnny Damon, Robin Ventura and Robinson Cano have worn it too.  Now the Bleacher Creatures will be wearing gold thongs!</p>
