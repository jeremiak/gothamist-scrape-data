<p>See for yourself what many in Los Angeles have been raving out by ordering the special Sqirl Dinner Bowl at Sweetgreen&apos;s Meatpacking District location today. The beloved Los Angeles restaurant and the healthy food chain are offering the special warm bowl to the first 100 people who order the item online or on the app. </p>

<p>The collaboration between Sweetgreen and Sqirl, a popular and delicious eatery (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202130543/http://laist.com/2016/04/13/sqirl_still_got_it.php">our own Jen Carlson said</a> raves: &quot;Everything tastes unique, like an effort was put into not just every dish, but every bite&quot;), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202130543/http://laist.com/2016/10/07/sqirl_sweetgreen_dinner_bowl.php">kicked off in October</a>, where the Sqirl Dinner Bowl was rolled out for four weeks in LA. </p>

<p>Sqirl Chef Jessica Koslow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202130543/http://laist.com/2016/10/07/sqirl_sweetgreen_dinner_bowl.php">said at the time</a>, &quot;Since Sqirl is only open for breakfast and lunch we wanted to partner with Sweetgreen to create a protein-packed version of our sorrel pesto bowl that diners would eat all day and into the night.&quot; Then the lines and demand for the bowl prompted Sweetgreen to extend the special bowl for another two weeks. </p>

<p>Now the Meatpacking District Sweetgreen is offering the bowl, which features shredded kale, warm quinoa, avocado, roasted steelhead, tahini-marinated Hodo Soy yuba noodles, pickled carrots, cucumbers, parsley, dill, basil, and a sorrel pesto dressing, topped with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, which sounds like a win on this dreary day.</p>

<p>You can start ordering the Sqirl Dinner Bowl now, both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202130543/http://www.sweetgreen.com/">online</a> and on the Sweetgreen app.<br>
