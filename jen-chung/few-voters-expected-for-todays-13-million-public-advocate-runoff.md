                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_09_tish1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003202703im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_tish1.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Letitia James voted this morning (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003202703/https://twitter.com/TishJames/status/385036244063117312/photo/1">@TishJames</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Today is the runoff election for Public Advocate, which features City Council Member Letitia James and State Senator Daniel Squadron vying for the position. And even though it&apos;s a very high-ranking city position, turnout is expected to be only as high as 200,000 or as low as 100,000. The whole thing is costing taxpayers $13 million, so if you vote today make sure you get your $130 worth!</p>

<p>While the Public Advocate doesn&apos;t really wield any power and has a budget of just $2.3 million, the position is the first in the line of succession if something happens to the mayor and also has the power to audit city agencies. It&apos;s also a stepping stone for greater ambitions&#x2014;the first Public Advocate Mark Green ran for mayor in 2001, and current Public Advocate Bill de Blasio leads in mayoral polls this year. </p>

<p>The 2009 Public Advocate runoff election between Green and de Blasio had a turnout of 233,000. This year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003202703/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/09/democrats-head-to-public-advocate-runoff-polls-tuesday-but-how-many">the Daily News reports</a>, &quot;City Board of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan said the agency is estimating a turnout of perhaps 100,000 of the city&apos;s 2.8 million registered Democrats.&quot; FWIW, de Blasio has declined endorsing in this race, saying that both are friends.</p>

<p>The two candidates are pretty similar&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003202703/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/24/public_advocate_redux.php">see our guide to the race</a>&#x2014;so they have tried to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003202703/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/public_advocate_runoff_debate.php">beat each other up on very specific issues</a>. Last night,  NY1&apos;s Errol Louis questioned Squadron about a questionable robocall that went out (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003202703/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po--QJf9Ex4&amp;feature=youtu.be">see it</a>). Squadron didn&apos;t deny it was from his campaign, so Louis said, &quot;Because you&#x2019;re not answering the question I&#x2019;m gonna assume that your campaign put out that anonymous robocall and I think most of our viewers are going to assume the same thing. Are you okay with that?&quot; To which Squadron answered, &quot;Uh, look, people will assume what they want to assume&#x2026;&quot;</p>

<p>The polls close at 9 p.m., so there&apos;s still time to vote!</p>
