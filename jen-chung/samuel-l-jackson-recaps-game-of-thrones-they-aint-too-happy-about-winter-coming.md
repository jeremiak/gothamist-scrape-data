<p>Now that the seventh season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> will be delayed&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023121915/http://www.eonline.com/news/778135/game-of-thrones-season-7-delayed-find-out-why-the-wait-will-be-even-longer-than-usual">silly producers want &quot;winter&quot; weather</a>&#x2014;Westerosiologists are craving something... anything! So HBO has thrown them (us) a bone by having Samuel L. Jackson recap seasons one through five in a perfect seven minute, 40 second video: &quot;When we start this, everyone&apos;s just come out of a long, long, long summer. So let&apos;s just say they ain&apos;t too happy about winter coming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All hell has broken loose and there&apos;s things I don&apos;t have the time to explain&quot;&#x2014;cut to birth of Shadow Baby&#x2014;&quot;...Just know that in all of the seven kingdoms of Westeros peacetime is DONE. FINITO! Everybody thinks they should sit on the Iron Throne,&quot; Jackson explains.</p>

<p>He also notes the various alliances made through marriage: &quot;Sansa&apos;s stuck in King&apos;s Landing with this motherfucker,&quot; as Joffrey is shown. </p>

<p>Anyway, <em>Game of Thrones</em> producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023121915/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-end-date-season-8-1201752746/">considering doing a final run of 13 episodes</a> over the last two seasons (seven for season 7, six for season 6). Sigh&#x2014;at least there are ComiCons for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023121915/https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4sn26p/everything_went_to_montreal_comiccon_as_hodor/">people to attend as Hodor</a>.</p>
