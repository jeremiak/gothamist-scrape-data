					<p>Have you ever watched a K9 unit or an explosives unit dog and thought, &quot;Wow, I would love to own a dog with such a specific skill set&quot;? Well, your wish has come true: The Transportation Security Administration is looking for new, forever homes for explosives detection dogs that have either retired from the gig or didn&apos;t make it through the training program (aww, explosive detection school dropouts!).</p>

<p>According to the TSA, &quot;The dogs typically range in age from two to 10 years and the breeds usually include German Short-Haired Pointers, Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds and Belgian Malinois. The dogs available for adoption were procured to serve as working dogs, and their breeds were selected for their elevated level of &apos;drive,&apos; and thus are very active. Some are well trained, others are not. Canines which were eliminated from the program typically have received some explosives detection training. Most of TSA&#x2019;s dogs have lived in kennels, not houses, and thus are not familiar with living in a home environment. All are spayed or neutered prior to adoption.&quot;</p>

<p>This sounds a little like bringing a T-800 into your home:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224152338/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9PBtnnPmLQ"> Hard work, but worth it in the end</a>. While there&apos;s no cost to adopt the dogs, the dogs are located in San Antonio, Texas, so prospective owners who undergo the application process will have to travel to Texas to pick up their new dog. And here are three of the adoptable dogs (there are usually about a dozen dogs available):</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_10_tsaadoptiondogs.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224152338im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_tsaadoptiondogs.jpg" width="640" height="421"> <br> <i> TSA dogs that are up for adoption (TSA)</i></div> <br>
 <br>
Anyone considering adopting one of these dogs must submit an application. From the TSA: &quot;Applicants must meet the requirements and then photos and information on the dogs will be provided via email. The Adoption Coordinator will assist in identifying a dog that best suits each home and family. Applicants will need to provide a signed and notarized indemnity letter, travel to San Antonio to meet the canine and travel home with the dog at the owner&#x2019;s expense. People interested in adopting one of the dogs can contact the TSA Adoption Coordinator via email at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224152338/mailto:AdoptaTSAcanine@OLE.tsa.dhs.gov">AdoptaTSAcanine@OLE.tsa.dhs.gov</a>.&quot;<p></p>
