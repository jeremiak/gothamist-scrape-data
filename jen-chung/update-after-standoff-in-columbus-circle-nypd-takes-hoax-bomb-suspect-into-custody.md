<p>Police have effectively shut down Columbus Circle as they try to establish communication with a man who has barricaded himself in a vehicle. Authorities believe the man is the suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093426/http://abc7ny.com/news/suspicious-object-thrown-at-police-cruiser-in-midtown;-all-clear-given/1436105/">threw a fake bomb</a> into a police van in Midtown last night.  </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The suspect has been taken into custody, but police are still on the scene. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called the officers who dealt with the fake bomb in Times Square &quot;heroes of the NYPD, heroes of New York City.&quot; And the NYPD has released security camera video showing the suspect driving by and tossing the hoax bomb into the NYPD van:</p>

 [<strong><em>More updates below.</em></strong>]</p>

<p>The 1, 2, A, C, B and D trains are currently bypassing Columbus Circle.</p>

<p>According the NYPD, the incident began around 11:30 p.m. A police sergeant and an officer were inside a marked van near Duffy Square in Times Square, when a man in a dark SUV threw an item into the NYPD vehicle. </p>

<p>The item apparently made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093426/http://pix11.com/2016/07/21/police-close-off-columbus-circle-surround-person-barricaded-in-car/">&quot;clicking&quot; noises and was &quot;flashing.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Because Times Square is filled with so many people, the sergeant drove the van east on 46th Street to a less-populated area near Sixth Avenue. The cops removed the device from the van and onto the street.</p>

<p>After evacuating the area, the NYPD Emergency Services Unit determined the item was not a threat. According to WABC 7, it was a &quot;battery powered lantern, a wax candle wrapped in tin foil and a white cloth.&quot;</p>

<p>Just after 2 a.m., police found the suspect in the SUV near 57th Street and 8th Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093426/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/21/nypd-midtown-suspicious-device/">Chief of the department James O&apos;Neill said</a>, &quot;Upon stopping the SUV, a male driver was observed placing a red plastic helmet on his head. The male did not communicate with the officers, who then called for backup.&quot; A police spokesman added that the suspect was wearing a vest.</p>

<p>WCBS 2 reports, &quot;At one point, police had a bomb robot next to the vehicle to try to coax the suspect out.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect was identified as Hector Meneses; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093426/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-standoff-man-vehicle-columbus-circle-article-1.2719710">a witness told the Daily News</a>, &quot;We were sleeping by the water fountain when we heard a cop saying &apos;come out with your hands up.&apos; Next thing I know a cop tells us to leave.&quot;</p>
