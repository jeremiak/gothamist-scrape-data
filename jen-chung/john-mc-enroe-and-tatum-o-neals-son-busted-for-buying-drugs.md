Mr. McEnroe allegedly had six bags of cocaine and more than 30 pills on him when he was arrested around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday night on the sidewalk near 167 East 4th Street, the official said.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015643/http://pagesix.com/2014/07/16/john-mcenroes-son-arrested-for-drugs/?_ga=1.107285890.1242379602.1295536070">Post reports</a> that he was &quot;buying drugs from 22-year-old Niro Meneses... Meneses gave McEnroe six bags of cocaine, 20 oxy pills, 20 morphine pills and one anti-anxiety pill, sources said.&quot; </p>

<p>O&apos;Neal was arrested in 2008 after she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015643/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/02/tatum_oneal_bus.php">caught buying crack on the Lower East Side</a>. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015643/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/03/tatum_oneal.php">told the Post at the time</a> that her dog&apos;s death &quot;set me off. She got old. She got cancer. She was the fabric of our family. We had to let her go to heaven. My daughter and I had to put her down. It was too horrible for words. I couldn&apos;t get out of it. I was going to my psychiatrist. I was doing everything I could do. I have the disease of alcoholism. It&apos;s lifelong. I treat it every day by going to my 12-step program.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, the Post says that she &quot;called the 9th Precinct in a panic on Wednesday morning looking for her son.&quot;</p>
