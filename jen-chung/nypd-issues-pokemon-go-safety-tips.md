Because I totally caught it, but then the stupid Pokemon Go servers froze and it didn&apos;t count in my Pokedex... WHY GOD (Jen Chung / Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>We&apos;ve given up as a society and devolved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022629/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/11/pokemon_go_black_mirror.php">into Pok&#xE9;mon Go Zombies</a>. It&apos;s a world where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022629/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/12/pokemon_go_trainer_for_hire.php">unofficial Pokemon Trainers</a> can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022629/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/13/bright_stars_burn_fast.php">retire in just a few days</a> and you can meet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022629/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/13/pokemon_go_celebrity_hookup.php">Millennial Daily Show hosts setting lures</a> in Riverside Park. So now the NYPD has stepped in with official Pok&#xE9;mon Go Safety Tips, probably because Police Commissioner Bratton is tired of getting questions about Pok&#xE9;Crime. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s NYPD&apos;s Community Affairs division&apos;s helpful hints:</p><blockquote>As the Pok&#xE9;monGo fever hits New York City, the NYPD wants to remind you and your kids of some simple safety tips.  As you battle, train, and capture your Pok&#xE9;mon just remember you&apos;re still in the real world too!  Around the country the Pok&#xE9;monGo craze has seen reports of accidents, injuries and even crimes where suspects have set-up fake &apos;Pok&#xE9;stops&apos;.  So as you or your kids set out to capture them all:<p></p>

<p>- Be alert at all times<br>
- Stay aware of your surroundings<br>
- Play in pairs or as a group to ensure your safety  <br>
- Do not drive or ride your bike, skateboard, or other device while interacting with the app...you can&apos;t do both safety<br>
- Do not trespass onto private property or go to areas you usually would not if you weren&apos;t playing Pok&#xE9;mon Go<br>
- Be aware and tell your kids about &quot;stranger-danger&quot;.  The app may draw strangers together in real life at &apos;Pok&#xE9;stops&apos;<br>
- Parents - be aware of 3rd party software apps claiming to enhance the gaming experience however, these 3rd party apps only gives access to sensitive data - i.e. name, email, calendar<br>
- Have fun AND stay safe.  Good luck in your quest, and happy hatching, trapping, and training at the Pok&#xE9;mon Gym!</p></blockquote>But to be fair, Pok&#xE9;mon Go players aren&apos;t just zombies; they&apos;re also out there catching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022629/http://laist.com/2016/07/13/pokemon_go_detectives.php">attempted murder suspects</a>. <p></p>
