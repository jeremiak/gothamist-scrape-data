<p>Days after the police arrested a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175715/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/20/brooklyn_serial_rape_suspect_found.php">man suspected of three Brooklyn rapes</a>, the NYPD is asking the public for help on identifying a man wanted for rape as well as a forcible touching incident in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175715/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_083.shtml">precinct that covers Bushwick</a>.</p>

<p>Police say that on Friday, February 1st, a man approached a 39-year-old woman from behind, &quot;pushed her to the ground and grabbed her buttocks and breasts over her clothing.&quot; The victim was able to fight him off, and the suspect ran off on foot. </p>

<p>Then, on Saturday, April 6th, 2013, the NYPD says a 37-year-old woman was inside a building when she was approached from behind &quot;by the suspect who placed an unknown object against her back, demanded money and went through her pockets. The victim said she did not have any money, and the suspect then raped her.&quot; Here&apos;s video of the suspect after that incident:</p>

 <br>
The suspect is described as a Hispanic male in his 20s, about 5&apos;9&quot;-5&apos;10&quot; and 160 pounds with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and black jeans.<br>
 <br>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175715/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/nyregion/police-seek-another-rape-suspect-in-brooklyn.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The overlapping patterns of rapes and sexual assaults formed part of what police statistics show is a 23 percent increase in the number of rapes in Brooklyn this year, with 137 reported through mid-April compared with 111 during the same period the year before. The number is also higher compared with the same period in 2011. Citywide, the number of rapes is about 7 percent higher than last year.&quot; While many sexual assaults involve people who know each other, &quot;assaults by strangers, like those in the Brooklyn cases, can produce a greater sense of unease on the street.&quot;</p>

<p>NYPD spokesman Paul Browne pointed out to the NY Times that rapes are generally underreported, and an increase of reported incident could be due to more people reporting them. &quot;He added that &apos;even when you consider this year-to-date increase, rapes are down in Brooklyn South and Brooklyn North compared to 12 years ago by 33 percent.&apos;&quot;<br>
