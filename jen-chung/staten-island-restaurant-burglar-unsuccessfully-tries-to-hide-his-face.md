<p>The police are looking for a burglar who has struck two Staten Island restaurants in the same shopping mall four times since December. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the first incident happened between Saturday, December 5th at 11 p.m., and Sunday, December 6th, at 8:45 a.m., when the male suspect &quot;entered a Subway restaurant located at 1650 Richmond Avenue, and removed $196 from the cash register and counter before fleeing the location.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, on Wednesday, December 30th, at 4 a.m., the burglar &quot;threw a rock through the front window of Red Ginger, a restaurant located at 1650 Richmond Avenue, entered the location and removed $250 from the cash register and the counter.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, this past Sunday, January 3rd, he struck again: Police say that a 3:30 a.m., the same burglar &quot;threw a rock through the front door of Subway, a restaurant located at 1650 Richmond Avenue, entered the location and removed $228 from the cash register before fleeing the location.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s video from this past weekend&apos;s incident. As you can see, he tries to hide his face when he enters the restaurant, but you can pretty clearly see it from when he&apos;s peering inside:</p>
