<p>Smartphone muggers still haven&apos;t gotten the message that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131008124540/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/11/criminals_still_havent_learnt_to_tu.php">&quot;Find My iPhone&quot; really works</a>. The NYPD announced that a pair of robbery suspects were apprehended&#x2014;along with a loaded .25-caliber semiautomatic handguns and two stolen iPhones&#x2014;after cops used the phone recovery app yesterday morning.</p>

<p>According to the police, a couple leaving a Bronx nightclub at 2520 Park Avenue were approached by two men in a dark colored vehicle. Here&apos;s the NYPD account:</p><blockquote>The suspects exited and one of them pointed a silver handgun at the male victim, stating &#x201C;You know what this is give up everything.&#x201D; While the male complied and handed him his belt, $30 and his iPhone, his accomplice forcibly removed his wallet.  The first suspect then pointed the gun at the female&#x2019;s head and said &#x201C;What else does this b*tch have?&#x201D; and removed her iPhone. The perpetrators fled in their vehicle, and fired a gun as they drove away. Police later recovered one shell casing from the vicinity of 140th Street and Park Avenue in the Bronx.</blockquote>The victims found an ESU truck at East 149th Street and Morris Avenue, and the ESU officers notified the 40th Precinct. One cop, Police Officer Krug, used &quot;Find My iPhone&quot; on his iPhone and found the phone in East Harlem, at East 120th Street and First Avenue. <p></p>

<p>Krug and other cops went to the location and found a dark colored vehicle next to a fire hydrant. So they conducted a traffic stop and recovered the phones and a belt wallet&#x2014;plus discovered a gun in the glove compartment. </p>

<p>Antoine Ross, 21, of Rochester,  and Trevor Robinson, 22, of the Bronx, were hit with charges such as &quot;Robbery, Criminal Possession of a Weapon, Grand Larceny, Menacing, Reckless Endangerment, Criminal Possession of Stolen Property and Criminal Possession of Marijuana.&quot;</p>
