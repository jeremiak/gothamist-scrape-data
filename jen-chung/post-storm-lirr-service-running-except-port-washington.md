</div></div><p>According to the MTA, all service has been restored, except to the Port Washington line which is still suspended.  Trains, which were stopped because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124750/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/16/sheets_of_rain_hail_pound_nyc.php">yesterday quick, pummeling storm</a> that hit Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island hard, started moving around 11 p.m. last night and most service was back around 5 a.m. this morning.  We&apos;ve added some pictures of last night&apos;s totally haywire commute&#x2014;make that non-commute, since service was shutdown.  </p>

<p><b>Update 8:30 a.m.</b>: There&apos;s partial service on the Port Washington line (with delays) and there are delays on the  Hempstead, Oyster Bay and Port Jefferson lines, too.</p>
