<p>Earlier this morning, the Ronkonkoma Branch on the Long Island Rail Road was suspended both ways because of damage to the third rail.  What happened?  Well, a minivan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122951/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/lirr-service-suspension-ronkonkoma-branch-20120417-KC">drove onto the tracks in Wyandanch</a>.</p>

<p>According to Newsday, the minivan&apos;s driver was &quot;an unlicensed 17-year-old&quot; who &quot;lost control of her car.&quot;  Her crash damaged the third rail, but luckily no trains were headed her way.  Newsday adds, &quot;The teenage driver was taken to a hospital where she was treated and released... She was issued a traffic summons by the MTA Police for unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.&quot;</p>

<p>Train service is back and running, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122951/http://twitter.com/#!/LIRRScoop">though there are some delays</a>.</p>
