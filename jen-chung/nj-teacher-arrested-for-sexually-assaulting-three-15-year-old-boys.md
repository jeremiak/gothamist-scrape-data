Nicole Dufault is being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility on $500,00 bail, and her two children have been removed from her custody.<p></p>

Authorities allege Dufault had oral sex and vaginal intercourse with the students on school property and in her car on multiple occasions.&quot;</p>

<p>One recent Columbia High graduate was puzzled, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402035750/http://7online.com/news/nj-teacher-charged-with-having-sex-with-3-of-her-students/314971/">telling WABC 7</a>, &quot;In her car? Where? Where could that have happened?&quot; A parent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402035750/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/18/maplewood-nj-teacher-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-3-male-students/">said to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;They do background checks on the teachers, so I don&#x2019;t understand.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402035750/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-Jersey-High-School-Teacher-Arrested-Sex-Three-Students-275660941.html">NBC New York spotted another parent</a> at the school looking for answers; she demanded, &quot;We need to know what happened, when it happened and why it happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Dufault, who faces charges of aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, was ordered to have no contact with the victims. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402035750/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/18/maplewood-nj-teacher-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-3-male-students/">neighbor said</a> that she &quot;seemed like a, you know, just an average mom going to work.&quot;</p>
