Owners Jenifer and George Lang &quot;said they had closed for vacation earlier this month and had planned on reopening in September, but changed their minds,&quot; with Jenifer Lang explaining, &quot;<strong>George is 85, business has been down - not terrible, but down, like everybody else&#x2019;s - and we feel it&#x2019;s time</strong>.&quot;  In 2003, NY Times restaurant critic William Grimes felt the food was uneven, but, &quot;If ever a restaurant had fine, aristocratic bone structure it is Caf&#xE9; des Artistes. Diners have only to take one step inside, and the tumultuous New York world outside disappears in a flash, replaced by lush floral displays, flattering lighting and Howard Chandler Christy&#x2019;s pastel murals of naked beauties prancing through romantic landscapes.&quot; The Diner&apos;s Journal says it&apos;s unclear what will happen to the cafe&#x2014;also seen in Woody Allen&apos;s  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120330045634/http://media.entertainment.sky.com/image/unscaled/2009/6/25/Manhattan-Murder-Mistery-02.jpg">Manhattan Murder Mystery</a>&#x2014;which is owned by the building.  In other news, Meatpacking seafood restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120330045634/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/23/the_john_dory.php">John Dory</a> may <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120330045634/http://eater.com/archives/2009/08/breaking_the_john_dory_closing_tonight.php">have closed</a>, though owner &quot;Ken Friedman will not confirm or deny, telling [Eater] the reservationist was premature in confirming their final night.&quot;</p>
