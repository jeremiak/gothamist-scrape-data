<p>Yesterday, the world was introduced to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116212747/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/02/big_soda_looks_to_battle_bloombergs.php">full-page color ad of &quot;Nanny Bloomberg&quot;</a>, a response to Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s proposed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116212747/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/bloomberg_wants_to_ban_sugary_drink.php#photo-1">ban on sodas and other sugary drinks over 16 ounces</a> in certain venues.  While the mayor&apos;s office wasn&apos;t amused, the group that placed the ad says people are enjoying it!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116212747/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nanny_mike_real_drag_eOLKTcZNLb7TFeIvD6TmzM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Mayoral spokesman Marc LaVorgna told the Post</a>, &quot;It says an awful lot about the state of the soda industry that a tobacco company front group is attacking Mike Bloomberg on their behalf. This is the same organization that was founded to oppose bans of smoking in restaurants and bars.&quot;  Yes&#x2014;the Center of Consumer Freedom got its start with money from Philip Morris, but come on, if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116212747/http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/5890">people want to buy cigarettes...</a></p>

<p>According to the Post, &quot;In the past, the group has received money from Coca-Cola and Wendy&#x2019;s, according to published reports.&quot;  Executive director Richard Berman (who critics call an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116212747/http://www.consumerdeception.com/index.asp">&quot;influence peddler&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116212747/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/05/60minutes/main2653020.shtml">&quot;Dr. Evil&quot;</a>) says, &quot;We get a lot of our support from a variety of industries &#x2014; restaurants are our biggest, historically... The ad is typical of what we do, which is to point out hypocrisy, or overreaching and junk science... [The &quot;soda ban&quot;]  seemed to be the ultimate nanny move.&quot;  As for the Photoshop, &quot;People appreciate the humor, and it&#x2019;s properly targeted.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116212747/https://twitter.com/#!/katetaylornyt">NY Times&apos; Kate Taylor</a> asked Mayor Bloomberg about the ad; he said, &quot;Would I wear a dress like that? No! It was one of the more unflattering dresses.&quot; TRUTH!</p>
