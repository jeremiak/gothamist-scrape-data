He is now resting comfortably and will undergo further tests during the course of the day.&quot;  </p>

<p>Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624023829/http://www.amny.com/news/local/ny-ligov0521,0,2874248.story">turns 54 today</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624023829/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Paterson-Hospital.html">AP says</a> his health has &quot;been a concern in recent years&quot;--he was hospitalized last July when he fainted and in April 2006 for chest pains--but test results have shown no signs of heart disease.  It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624023829/http://blogs.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/7462">unclear if Paterson&apos;s birthday party today</a> will go on as planned.</p>

<p>The Governor was scheduled to speak at a commencement ceremony at Columbia University (he&apos;s class of 1977) but canceled the appearance--Attorney General Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624023829/http://blogs.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/7463">will be filling in</a>.  It would have been funnier if former governor Eliot Spitzer were the back-up.  </p>

<p>Fun fact:  The last time we recall a NY Governor being suddenly taken to a hospital was when Governor Pataki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624023829/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/16/governor_pataki.php">had to have an emergency appendectomy</a>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624023829/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/20/no_exit_for_poo.php">left him constipated</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  The source of Paterson&apos;s symptoms is glaucoma in his left eye and he will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624023829/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6153407">undergo a laser procedure</a>.  His office said, &quot;The governor will remain conscious throughout the procedure, but in an abundance of caution, the Senate majority leader and the Assembly speaker were advised of this pursuant to standard protocol.&quot;</p>
