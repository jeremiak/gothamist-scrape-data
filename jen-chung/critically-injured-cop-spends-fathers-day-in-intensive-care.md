<p>His father, Kenneth Baribault, had returned to his patrol car after pulling over a drunk driver on the Long Island Expressway when another drunk driver slammed into his car (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225051938/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6150486">one description</a>: &quot;The back of that patrol car almost meets where the driver was sitting&quot;).  An off-duty FDNY firefighter ran across six lanes of traffic to attend to Baribault, who later underwent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225051938/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/20/what_suspended.php">surgery to relieve massive swelling in his brain</a>.  </p>

<p>Baribault&apos;s son has been begging to see him for four weeks, and now his family has tried to explain the situation to Christopher, who told Newsday, &quot;He&apos;s not going to talk to me. I know that.  He has stuff in his mouth, like tubes.&quot;  Family members said Baribault, who was a former NYPD cop, said he had been working nights &quot;so he&apos;d be able to see Christopher on and off the school bus.&quot;  The cop is expected to fully recover, but only after a lot of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>The incident prompted Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225051938/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/24/nassau_county_e.php">publicize all drunk driving arrests</a> over the Memorial Day weekend, a controversial move because Suozzi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225051938/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/28/scarlet_drivers.php">released names, addresses, and photographs of arrestees</a>.  Still, Suozzi considers the public shaming a good thing and has continued to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225051938/http://www.nassaucountyny.gov/agencies/CountyExecutive/NewsRelease/2008/6-9-2008.html">release information about DWI arrests</a>.</p>
