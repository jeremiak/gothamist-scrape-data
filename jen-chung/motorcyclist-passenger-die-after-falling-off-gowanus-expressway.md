<p>Two people are dead after a tragic crash on the Gowanus Expressway this morning. A motorcyclist and his passenger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012622/http://pix11.com/2014/10/17/motorcycle-accident-on-gowanus-expressway-leaves-two-dead/">crashed into a concrete barrier</a> and flew off the side of the roadway.</p>

<p>Police say they responded to a call just after 2 a.m. near 17th Street and Third Avenue in Brooklyn. They say that Jose Chevere, 30, was operating his Kawasaki motorcycle while going on the Gowanus Expressway. According to the NYPD, he &quot;failed to navigate a curve in the roadway, losing control of the vehicle and striking a cement wall,&quot; which resulted in Chevere and passenger Jalissa Otero, 24, to be &quot;ejected off the motorcycle falling approximately 36 feet and coming to rest under the expressway on 17th street.&quot;</p>

<p>Both Chever and Otero were pronounced dead at the scene, having sustained serious body trauma. The investigation is continuing. </p>

Some said they saw the crash unfold in front of them.&quot;</p>
