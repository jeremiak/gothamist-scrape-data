                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_04_prisonbreak10.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_04_prisonbreak10.jpg" width="365" height="281"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Wentworth Miller, fools!</i></div> There are delays on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/http://new.mta.info/gss/2/3">A, C, B and D lines right now</a> &quot;due to a police investigation&quot; at 145th Street. And what are the police investigating? Oh, an escaped prisoner.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9091687">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;Police are looking for an escaped prisoner from the 30th Precinct who ran into the 145th Street subway station. He was preliminarily described as a white male, 5&apos;6&quot; wearing blue jeans and a yellow sweatshirt.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the MTA, &quot;There is no A and C trains between 59 St-Columbus Circle and 168 St in both directions. There is no B trains between Brighton Beach and 145 St in both directions. There is no D trains between 34 St-Herald Square and 161 St-Yankee Stadium in both directions. As an alternative customers are advised to use nearby 1 train service or M10, M11 and M7 bus service.&quot;</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: It turns out the prisoner was someone the cops had picked up in connection with a series of thefts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/chase-for-escaped-prisoner-shuts-subway-lines/?smid=tw-share">City Room reports</a>, &quot;After a man was arrested at his home... he jumped out of a police car near 145th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem around 10:15 a.m., pushing an officer and scurrying into a nearby subway station.&quot;</p>

<p>The police say the situation is still under investigation.</p>

<p>By the way, the image is of actor Wentworth Miller, who played Michael Scofield in the 2005-2009 Fox drama, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Break">Prison Break</a>. Scofield got himself sentenced to prison in order to free his brother, who faces a death sentence for killing the vice president&apos;s brother (of course the brother was framed). Scofield happened to be an engineer and tattooed his escape plans on his body. </p>

<p><b>UPDATE 2</b>: The MTA now says, &quot;Following an earlier incident, A, B, C and D train service has resumed with residual delays.&quot; Which would lead one to believe the prisoner has been apprehended (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/https://twitter.com/WPIX/status/331458481594961922/photo/1">WPIX confirms that</a>) &#x2014;but the police only say that the matter is still under investigation. </p>

<p><b>UPDATE 3</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/chase-for-escaped-prisoner-shuts-subway-lines/">According to City Room</a>, the suspect is still at large. Also, he has been identified as Vincens Vuktilaj, who is wanted for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/video_man_snatches_chain_from_93-ye.php">snatching necklaces off old ladies in the Bronx</a>: </p><blockquote>On Monday morning around 10:15 a.m., [Vuktilaj]...was being escorted down the stairs of his building in Harlem when he pushed at least one officer and fled, disappearing into the 145th Street subway station of the A, B, C and D lines on St. Nicholas Avenue, the police said.<p></p>

<p>The entire B line and parts of the A, C and D were shut down at 10:55 a.m., transportation officials said. Normal service was restored shortly after 1 p.m., they said, but as of 1:20 p.m., the police said, Mr. Vuktilaj was still at large. He was last seen wearing jeans, a yellow shirt and no shoes.</p></blockquote>A train conductor apparently told cops that the suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025954/http://pix11.com/2013/05/06/grand-larceny-suspects-escapes-police-custody-sparking-subway-shutdown/#axzz2SXKRpBUs">was seen in the subway</a>.<p></p>
