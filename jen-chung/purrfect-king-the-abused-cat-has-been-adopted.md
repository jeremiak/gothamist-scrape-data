</div></div>					<p>King, the one-year-old cat who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428162009/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/cops_arrest_brooklyn_man_for_kickin.php">viciously kicked by a Brooklyn man</a>, has found a home. Hours after announcing that he was up for adoption, the ASPCA&apos;s Gail Buchwald, SVP of the adoption center, revealed, &quot;We are pleased to have found a wonderful home so quickly for King.&#x201D;</p>

<p>King&apos;s new owner is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428162009/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/king-cat-kicked-brooklyn-finds-home-manhattan-article-1.1822357">apparently a Manhattan man</a>.</p>

<p>Buchwald added, &#x201C;We know some people may be disappointed they did not get a chance to take King home. However, we want to remind you all that this month is Adopt a Shelter Cat Month and there are many adoptable cats and kittens in need of homes in shelters across the country.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The ASPCA also says, &quot;The best way people can help cats like King is to visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428162009/http://www.aspca.org/nyc/adoption-center">ASPCA Adoption Center</a>&#x2014;or any local shelter&#x2014;and meet homeless animals equally deserving of loving families.&quot; </p>

<p>After the video was posted to Facebook, eagle-eyed animal lovers determined where the video was shot, noting the phone number of a scaffolding company in the background. Andre Robinson, 21, was charged with aggravated animal cruelty. </p>

<p>Cat rescuers found King <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428162009/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/07/kicked_cat_found.php">hiding in a Ford Bronco</a>. He has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428162009/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/photos_king_the_cat_kicked_by_brook.php">recovering from his injuries</a> for the past month.</p>
