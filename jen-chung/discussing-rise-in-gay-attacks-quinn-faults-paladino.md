She said, &quot;Some candidates have spoken out - Mr. Paladino - in ways that are extremely offensive, extremely dangerous and it is hard to separate those statements from what is happening on the streets all throughout our city.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Paladino came under fire last week for saying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194115/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/10/paladino_homosexuality_not_an_equal.php">children shouldn&apos;t be</a> &quot;brainwashed&quot; into thinking homosexuality was an equally valid or successful lifestyle and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194115/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/paladino_hates_gay_pride_parade_has.php">slamming gay pride parades</a>.  This came days after reports of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194115/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/04/two_si_men_accused_of_hate_crime_be.php">beating of a gay man at the Stonewall Inn</a>, attacks on a gay couple in Chelsea, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194115/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/09/more_on_latin_king_goonies_alleged.php">brutal series of attacks on gay men</a> in the Bronx.  </p>

<p>This week, police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194115/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/18/bias_attack_alleged_at_nycs_oldest.php">arrested a man for attacking a bartender </a>at Julius&apos; Bar, the oldest gay bar in the city.  Victim Greg Davis said at the meeting, &quot;It was one punch in my right cheek, it was swollen for several days and I had three cuts inside my mouth... It&apos;s upsetting to think that when you got to work, you could be a victim,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194115/http://www.dnainfo.com/20101019/manhattan/victim-of-latest-gay-hate-crime-speaks-out">said of Paladino&apos;s remarks</a>, &quot;I do think it breeds an atmosphere where people are emboldened to come out and express their displeasure with some of us. It&apos;s not right.&quot;</p>
