In February, Bloomberg had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/12/what_do_obama_and_bloomberg_talk_ab.php">lunch with President Obama</a> and, today, he had breakfast with Republican candidate Mitt Romney.  Isn&apos;t it great that Bloomberg Businessweek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://nationaljournal.com/politics/bloomberg-businessweek-s-spiked-romney-cover-will-make-you-cringe-20120124">spiked that &quot;battered Mitt&quot; cover</a>?<p></p>

<p>This was the billionaire&apos;s first meeting with the millionaire.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/romney-quietly-meets-with-bloomberg/?hp">According to The Caucus</a>, they &quot;had a private breakfast with Mr. Bloomberg at the headquarters of the mayor&#x2019;s philanthropic foundation on Manhattan&#x2019;s Upper East Side, according to two people briefed on the meeting... Over coffee and juice, the two discussed several staples of Mr. Bloomberg&#x2019;s agenda in Washington over the last decade: the economy, immigration, education and even gun control (a topic on which the two man are not entirely on the same page).&quot;  What they do agree upon is how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/08/old_man_bloomberg_tired_of_occupy_w.php">Wall Street is being vilified </a>by mean poor people (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://www.politicker.com/2012/03/29/bloomberg-obama-has-adopted-occupy-wall-street-economic-policies/">President Obama</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bloomberg_romney_meet_for_first_f0o0nRBPASJGCasZQThGjI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">Post, though, points out</a>, &quot;The mayor is such a big supporter of Planned Parenthood that he recently donated $250,000 from his own pocket to the organization when it was under attack. In March, Romney said he&apos;d &apos;get rid&apos; of Planned Parenthood if he became President... Romney also recently spoke before the National Rifle Association, which is at war with Bloomberg over toughening gun control laws.&quot;  Plus, conservatives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/bloomberg-endorsement-2012-romney.html">don&apos;t seem to like Bloomberg either</a>! </p>

<p>Bloomberg is reportedly open to endorsing a candidate during this election cycle. Oh, and apparently Bloomberg played golf with Vice President Biden on Friday in the D.C. area and with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Saturday. At press time, it was unclear the outing ended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100633/http://www.theonion.com/articles/biden-asks-white-house-visitor-if-he-wants-to-chec,26171/">with beers up on the &quot;totally kick ass&quot; White House roof</a>.</p>
