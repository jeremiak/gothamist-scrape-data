<p>The man accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090419/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/flag_burning.php">setting fire to the American flag</a> hanging from the Playwright Tavern&apos;s awning has been arrested. Police say Jeffery Schorfheide, 26, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was charged with reckless endangerment, hate crime, criminal mischief and arson, but last night he was arraigned on all those charges except the hate crime.</p>

<p>Pub co-owner John Doherty had just become an American citizen, so he hung the flag outside. However, on July 5 at 4:35 a.m., the flag was incinerated by a passer-by. Surveillance video shows the firebug repeatedly trying to spark the flag with a cigarette lighter as other pedestrians walk by. And then the suspect smoked a cigarette and took photos on his cell phone. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090419/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Irish-Pub-Flag-Burned-Playwright-Pub-Midtown-Manhattan-Surveillance-Video-214835531.html">Doherty said</a>, &quot;Nobody did nothing about it, to my amazement.&quot;</p>

<p>The fire, which spread to the awning, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090419/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9167132">put out by pub workers</a>. Kimberly Kolbert, who manages the pub, told NBC New York, &quot;I think he&apos;s a dangerous person. He obviously doesn&apos;t care who he could have hurt or what could have happened. He should be held accountable for his actions.&quot; </p>

<p>Schorfheide, who the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090419/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/flag_burner_busted_charged_with_t0sBTWmbtaBu8dXCKvoK1I?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=">Post says</a> is Canadian-born, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090419/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-arrested-burning-u-s-flag-cops-article-1.1394715?localLinksEnabled=false">reportedly admitted</a> to cops it took him a few tries to burn the flag. The damage to the awning is about $3,000-4,000</p>
