<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428012130/http://www.centralparknyc.org/">The Central Park Conservancy</a> just announced its selections for its annual film festival, which runs Monday, August 18 through Friday, August 22. And this year&apos;s theme is &quot;Scenes From Our City,&quot; focusing on movies in which NYC plays a prominent role.</p>

<p>The movies are a nice complement to the growing number of free summer movies, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428012130/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/brooklyn_bridge_park_movies.php">animal-themed flicks at Brooklyn Bridge Park</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428012130/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/29/intrepid_announces_summer_movie_lin.php">sea, air, space pictures at the Intrepid</a>:</p>

<p>Monday, August 18: <em>Big</em> (FAO Schwarz is the most famous, but remember Josh Baskin&apos;s amazing SoHo loft?)</p>
