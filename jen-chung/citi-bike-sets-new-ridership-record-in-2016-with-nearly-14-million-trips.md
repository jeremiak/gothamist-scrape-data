<p>Thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/citi_bike_invading_brownstone_brook.php">ongoing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/02/citi_bike_goes_north.php">expansion</a>, Citi Bike has broken its annual ridership record for a third straight year. A press release from Mayor Bill de Blasio&apos;s office bragged that &quot;nearly 14 million trips&quot; were taken, &quot;shattering the record set in 2015 by more than 4 million.&quot;</p>

<p>Overall, 139 docking stations and 2,000 bikes were added this year, and it&apos;s projected that the program will grow to 12,000 bikes by the end of 2017, with the expansion bringing Citi BIke to Astoria, Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. While many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/27/astoria_citibike.php">Astoria residents are happy</a> to see Citi Bike grow, someone is going to have to break the news <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/15/this_is_what_happens_larry.php">to this guy</a>...</p>

<p>Citi Bike, which began under Mayor Michael Bloomberg (even a technocrat like Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/citibike_share_officially_delayed_u.php">had to deal with delays</a>), is now the largest bike-share program in North America. Here are some other factoids from the mayor&apos;s office:</p>

<p>- It regularly serves &quot;60,000 trips per day - on par with Boro Taxis and the Staten Island Ferry.&quot;<br>
- It&apos;s possible that this year&apos;s Citi Bike trips &quot;have kept New Yorkers out of carbon-producing vehicles, sparing nearly 5,000 tons of CO&#xB2; out of New York City&#x2019;s air.&quot;<br>
- There are 23 60,000-trip days this year.<br>
- October 19 had almost 70,000 trips, &quot;a one-day system record&quot;<br>
 <br>
Citi Bike is now managed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/https://www.motivateco.com/">Motivate</a>, whose CEO is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/ex-mta_ceo_jay_walder_leaves_hong_k.php">former MTA CEO</a> Jay Walder. Walder said, &quot;Citi Bike&#x2019;s latest record shows that bike share is fulfilling its promise as a vital part of New York&#x2019;s transportation network - increasing access to the city&#x2019; transit network and communities underserved by public transit.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In 2016, we fulfilled our pledge to grow Citi Bike, a sustainable transit option, to a range of more diverse Manhattan and Brooklyn communities - from upper Manhattan to Red Hook,&quot; the Mayor said. &quot;New Yorkers in these communities really took to Citi Bike, further cementing its reputation as the nation&#x2019;s largest popular bike-share program. With more Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods slated to get bikes in 2017, we can continue to expect great things.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201153/https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing">Citi Bike currently costs</a> $12/day (unlimited 30-minute rides) or $155 for an annual membership (unlimited 45-minute rides). There are also lower-cost options for NYCHA residents and IDNYC holders, as well as some credit union members, Oxford health plan participants and Citi card holders. For comparison, currently one subway ride is $2.75 and a monthly unlimited pass (not including new card fee) is $116.50. </p>
