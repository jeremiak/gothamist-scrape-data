The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811101232/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07052008/news/regionalnews/bonjour__c_rod_a_happy_single_118555.htm">Post spotted</a> the long-suffering wife of Yankees All-Star Alex Rodriguez in the City of Light &quot;beaming with smiles&quot; and looking good, &quot;wearing black, open-toed, high-heeled shoes, tight-fitting blue jeans and a gray hooded top.&quot;  However, she was not wearing her engagement or anniversary rings.  </p>

<p>Cynthia Rodriguez, aka C-Rod, has been staying at friend Lenny Kravitz&apos;s $10 million Parisian residence.  Kravitz has denied that he is having an affair with the 34-year-old former psychology teacher, saying he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811101232/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/04/crod_believes_madonna.php">only giving her a place to get away</a> from the scrutiny over her marriage (the whole, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811101232/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/01/madonnarod.php">&quot;Is A-Rod having an affair with Madonna&quot; thing</a>).  According to the Post, C-Rod later headed to Kravitz&apos;s concert at The Zenith.  </p>

She&apos;s a very strong woman.&quot;  In fact, Cynthia&apos;s sister seemed to point the finger at Madonna for sabotaging the marraige, &quot;She&apos;s probably capable of anything.&quot;  Some other sources suggest that Madonna&apos;s manager, Guy Oseary, brought the the Material Girl and $275 million slugger together--Oseary also managed Kravitz up until two weeks ago--but Madonna&apos;s rep said, &quot;Guy does not get involved in his clients&apos; personal lives.&quot;  </p>

<p>Boston Red Sox fans are loving this latest scandal for A-Rod (last year, they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811101232/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/02/blonds_or_bosto.php">wore blond lady masks</a> when A-Rod was linked to blond stripper), with some telling the Post, &quot;He&apos;s a sad, pathetic human being whose only saving grace is that he is a decent ball player&quot; and &quot;He&apos;s probably the greatest baseball player I&apos;ll ever see in my lifetime, but he&apos;s all about himself. It goes along with his ego.&quot;  A-Rod was 2 for 4 in yesterday&apos;s loss to the Red Sox, with two runs batted in.</p>
