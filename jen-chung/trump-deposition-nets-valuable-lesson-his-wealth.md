Well, as a hearing is scheduled to take place today, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208213617/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124261067783429043.html#mod=testMod">pored over a 2007 deposition</a> that Trump made about his wealth.  He said, &quot;My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feeling,&quot; and when asked if he&apos;s &quot;familiar with the concept of net present value?,&quot; Trump replies, &quot;The concept of net present value to me would be the value of the land currently after debt...<strong>Well, to me, the word &apos;net&apos; is an interesting word. It&apos;s really &#x2014; the word &apos;value&apos; is the important word</strong>.&quot; Ever the cheerleader, the real estate developer explains, &quot;Would you like me to say, oh, gee, the building is not doing well, blah, blah, blah, come by, the building -- nobody talks that way. Who would ever talk that way?&quot;  [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208213617/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/05/donald_trump.html">Daily Intel</a>] </p>
