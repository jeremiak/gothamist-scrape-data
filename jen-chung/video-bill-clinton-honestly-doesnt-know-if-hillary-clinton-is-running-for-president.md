<p>Last night, Bill Clinton added to the &quot;Hillary for President&quot; rumor mill by telling David Letterman that he and the wife are focused on other things that the Republicans are probably going to screw up, like the &quot;government shutdown, delaying health assistance, cutting food stamp assistance.&quot; But Letterman really wanted to know if the former Secretary of State would be throwing her hat in the ring, to which Bubba said, &quot;You know that if I did know, I wouldn&#x2019;t tell you. But I honestly don&#x2019;t know. Chelsea doesn&#x2019;t know, and Hillary doesn&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And that&#x2019;s a good thing for America. We should be focusing on these big challenges now, and talking about how to get this country back on track.&#x201D;</p>

<p>President Clinton, whose Clinton Global Initiative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173235/http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/ourmeetings/2013/">Annual Meeting starts today</a>, criticized how &quot;we&apos;ve created this climate where you&apos;re constantly running&quot; for office, noting that when he ran for President in 1992, he &quot;only&quot; had a 13-month campaign.</p>

<p>He also said of Hillary&apos;s plans, &quot;There&#x2019;s a lot of stuff out there, and she&#x2019;s just - she&#x2019;s still finishing her book. She&#x2019;s still setting up [a] project, &#x2018;Too Small to Fail&#x2019; - a children&#x2019;s effort through our foundation, and we&#x2019;re having a lot of fun - going to movies and restaurants, and taking walks &#x2014; being a normal person. I mean, you know, at our age, that counts for something - being able to have a little fun.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, the New York magazine interview makes Hillary Clinton&apos;s candidacy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173235/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/22/hillary_clinton_running_for_preside.php">a &quot;foregone conclusion.&quot;</a></p>
