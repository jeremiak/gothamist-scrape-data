<p>Residents at over 3,200 buildings in New York City are probably breathing a sigh of relief, as there will be no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140527/http://gothamist.com/tags/doormanstrike">doormen and building worker strike</a>: The 30,000 apartment building workers and owners reached an agreement just after midnight.  According to SEIU 32BJ, the &quot;workers won a tentative four-year agreement early this morning that provides nearly 10% in wage increases, maintains fully employer-paid family health care coverage and keeps pension benefits secure.&quot;</p>

<p>The big issue was that building owners wanted cuts to health care and some other benefits, which the union didn&apos;t want.  Since the tentative agreement keeps their current health care, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140527/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/nyregion/21strike.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;the union agreed to try to help the owners find ways to reduce the cost of providing the workers&#x2019; health benefits by $70 million annually starting in 2012.&quot; </p>

<p>32BJ President Mike Fishman said, &quot;The contract is an important victory for keeping New York a place where working people can call home. We stood together and fought hard to maintain health care and get wage increases that will help thousands of hard working men and women make ends meet in one of the most expensive cities in the world.&quot; The deal now needs to be ratified by the union and the  Realty Advisory Board&apos;s Board of Directors.  </p>
