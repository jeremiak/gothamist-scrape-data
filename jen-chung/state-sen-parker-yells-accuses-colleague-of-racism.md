In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228160015/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/kevin.parker.outburst.2.1660854.html">Parker yelled</a> &quot;How dare you? You racist people in here!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228160015/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/04/28/2010-04-28_state_sen_kevin_parker_erupts_again_with_racedbased_rant_and_even_allies_are_con.html">and</a> &quot;I&apos;ve never seen a white appointee be treated like this, in such rude fashion!&quot;</p>

<p>O&apos;Luck is black and DeFrancisco is white; DeFrancisco was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228160015/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/04/another-day-another-kevin-park.html">apparently questioning O&apos;Luck</a> about a comment he made on CityRoom a year ago, about how if not for programs for minorities and the poor, whites and rich people would have 100% access to government funding.  According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228160015/http://capitaltonight.com/2010/04/parker-unplugged/">transcript from Capitol Tonight</a>: </p><blockquote> Parker, who is speaking off camera, starts yelling at DeFrancisco roughly one minute later, saying: &#x201C;You are totally out of order! You are out of order!&#x2026;How dare you!&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Sen. Carl Kruger, the committee chairman, tries in vain to get Parker to calm down and then shouts: &#x201C;You&#x2019;re out of order&#x2026;Why don&#x2019;t you step outside?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Parker retorts: &#x201C;Why doesn&#x2019;t everybody step outside?..You&#x2019;re allowing somebody to treat an appointee of the governor in a very disrespectful way.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Kruger shoots back: &#x201C;You&#x2019;re disrespecting me as the chairman. I ruled you out of order. One more outburst like that, and I&#x2019;ll ask you to be removed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Parker: &#x201C;OK, then get somebody to remove me. Bring people though.</p>

<p>Kruger: &#x201C;And I&#x2019;ll ignore that remark.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Parker (leaving): &#x201C;Good.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Parker later told the Daily Politics, &quot;We&#x2019;re all prone to hyperbole,&quot; but on his Facebook status <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228160015/http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1645010838&amp;ref=search&amp;sid=748950020.2392386878..1#!/profile.php?id=1645010838&amp;v=wall&amp;ref=search">now reads</a>, &quot;In Albany fighting the evil of White Supremacy! In the NYS Senate an beyond! Dr. Height! Dr. Hooks! We remember you ad honor your legacy!&quot;  Here&apos;s video; Parker&apos;s outburst begins around the 20 minute mark (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228160015/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/25589/behold-the-parker-effect/">it&apos;s loud</a>):<p></p>

<p>Senate Democratic conference spokesman Austin Shafran said of the incident, &quot;Senator Parker is a passionate and engaged advocate, especially when it comes to defending underprivileged communities. During the course of public debate, discussions became somewhat heated. End of story.&quot;</p>
