<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041616/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/11/snl_walter_white_trump_dea.php">taking a break last week</a>, Alec Baldwin returned to the final <em>Saturday Night Live</em> of 2016 to reprise his impression of President-elect Donald Trump. Baldwin teased his Twitter followers in the afternoon&#x2014;and, boy, did the cold open make up for the past few weeks, giving us Kate McKinnon&apos;s Kellyanne Conway; Cecily Strong as future First Lady Melania Trump; a shirtless Vladimir Putin, as delivered by a preening Beck Bennett; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041616/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/13/rex_tillerson_rick_perry_trump.php">Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson</a>&#x2014;played by John Goodman!</p>

<p>The sketch opened with Trump and Conway discussing Secretary of State nominee Rick Perry (&quot;I saw him on <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>!&quot; Baldwin&apos;s Trump enthuses. &quot;This guy has so much energy. It&apos;s just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041616/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/typo-making-trump-calls-china-drone-seizure-unpresidented-article-1.2914276">unpresidented</a>!&quot;); who to choose for President (Conway points out that Trump is the president, but Trump asks if he can do it &quot;three days a week, like Howard Stern&quot;); and possible performers for the inauguration (Conway shares a comically small list, Trump loves &quot;both&quot; choices). Melania Trump interjects, &quot;Let&apos;s do the Christmas!&quot; and suddenly there&apos;s a weird noise from the chimney. No, Trump isn&apos;t being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041616/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096061/"><em>Scrooged</em></a>&#x2014;it&apos;s just Putin, who is &quot;just in town, hiding in the walls&quot;:</p>

<p>The Russian leader praises Trump&#x2014;&quot;We think you are the best candidate, the smartest candidate, the Manchurian candidate&quot;&#x2014;and gives him an Elf on the Shelf that he needs to place next to an internet router, and Trump apologizes for not having a gift in return. Putin says, &quot;Please, Mr. Trump, you are the gift.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Tillerson appears, gleefully greeting his buddy Putin with a secret handshake:</p>

<p>Putin and Tillerson start to discuss plans to lift sanction and for drilling in Russia&#x2014;when Trump asks what&apos;s going on, Putin says, &quot;Don&apos;t worry about this&quot;&#x2014; but Trump asks if they&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041616/http://thehill.com/homenews/news/310754-vanity-fair-breaks-subscription-record-after-trump-attack-on-twitter">destroy Vanity Fair</a> and offers, &quot;Speaking of black and crude, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041616/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/13/kanye_west_trump_tower.php">I know Kanye</a>!&quot;</p>
