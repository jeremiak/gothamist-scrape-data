<p>The possibility of winning votes from the uncounted ballots had former Comptroller Bill Thompson, who ran a very close campaign against Mayor Bloomberg in 2009, telling his supporters, &quot;Tonight is for every one of you out there who have ever been counted out,&quot; and vowed to wait for a full counting of all the ballots. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054408/http://capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/09/8533665/three-more-weeks-thompson-supporters-hopeful-about-run-sick-dantes-?--bucket-headline">Capital New York&apos;s Azi Paybarah reported</a> from Thompson&apos;s event:</p><blockquote>[T]here was a prayer from Victor Brown, a pastor at a church on Staten Island, who joked that some people were &quot;drunk with stupidity&quot; and saying &quot;go with the &apos;fro,&quot; referring to an unofficial slogan of the Bill de Blasio campaign which refers to the celebrated hairstyle of the candidate&apos;s teenage son and campaign-ad star.<p></p>

<p>Greg Floyd, president of Teamsters Local 237, acknowledged de Blasio was getting &quot;a significant amount of support&quot; from black voters. I asked whether it was the Dante ad.</p>

<p>Floyd said it was.</p>

<p>&quot;What was not pointed out is that Dante de Blasio is not the candidate,&quot; he said. &quot;And sometimes people vote for the weirdest thing.&quot;</p></blockquote>Still, many exit polls showed that the majority of voters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054408/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/nyregion/results-of-new-york-citys-mayoral-primaries.html?hp">wanted a change from the Bloomberg years</a>&#x2014;and de Blasio presented the biggest shift from that. In a message to supporters, de Blasio wrote, &quot;When we started this journey on a cold day in January, a small but dedicated group gathered to begin a campaign to address the crippling inequalities that have made New York a Tale of Two Cities. Together, we began a campaign to change this city.&quot;<p></p>

<p>With 98% of precincts reporting, de Blasio had 257,034 votes&#x2014;40.2% of the vote&#x2014;while Thompson had 166,516 votes (26%); candidates need 40% of the vote to avoid a runoff. However, in the 2005 primary, Fernando Ferrer had just under 40% of the vote and Anthony Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914054408/http://gothamist.com/2005/09/15/the_004005_problem.php">conceded the race to him</a>. The Democratic party might urge Thompson to concede, so de Blasio&#x2014;who polls show winning runoffs scenarios against Thompson&#x2014;can concentrate on his campaign against the Republican candidate, former MTA chairman and Giuliani deputy mayor Joe Lhota.</p>

<p>Also: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, the one-time, longtime frontrunner, had 99,226 votes/15.5% of the vote; Comptroller John Liu had 44,387 votes/7%; and former Congressman Anthony Weiner had 31,389 votes/4.9%. </p>
