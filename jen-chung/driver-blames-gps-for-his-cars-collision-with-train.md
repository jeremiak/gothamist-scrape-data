Or did it--because he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095539/http://wcbstv.com/local/gps.beford.hills.2.828972.html">drove onto Metro-North train tracks and into the path of a train</a>.  Luckily Jose Silva and his passengers got out before he was hit, but this is the second time a driver has blamed GPS for making them drive onto the tracks.</p>

<p>The car&apos;s GPS said to make a right, referring to a right up the road, but Silva and the other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095539/http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/01/04/man-follows-gps-directions-onto-train-tracks-car-destroyed/">January driver</a> made <i>immediate</i> rights.  The police said there were a number of warning signs posted on the roadway--as well as railroad crossing gates.  The MTA police told WCBS 2, &quot;If he was paying attention to the road it might not have happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Metro-North was not very happy, since the crash caused hours of delays.  Spokeswoman Marjorie Anders  wondered, &quot;<strong>You don&apos;t turn onto train tracks. Even if there are little voices in your head telling you to do so. If the GPS told you to drive off a cliff, would you drive off a cliff?</strong>&quot; Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095539/http://www.gpsreview.net/turn-right-into-lake-the-office/">if you&apos;re Michael Scott</a>...</p>

<p>Silva was given summons for driving onto the tracks and not obeying signs.</p>
