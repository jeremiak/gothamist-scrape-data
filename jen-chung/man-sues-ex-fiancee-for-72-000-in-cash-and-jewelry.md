<p>Ah, there&apos;s nothing like a love that goes sour and requires a five-figure lawsuit. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061840/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/bride_dough_yHncmEzjV5zAZMxGqkgjTM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">Post reports</a> that a Brooklyn man is suing his ex for ditching him and taking money meant for them and the $24,000 two-carat engagement ring. However, the ex claims that he&apos;s &quot;the devil.&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin Li, of Bay Ridge, is suing Amy Chan for $72,000, which includes the ring, cash, checks, &quot;two diamond necklaces, three gold necklaces, a gold ring and a gold bracelet that generous relatives showered on the happy couple.&quot; Li&apos;s lawsuit says that the couple, both in finance, planned to marry after getting pregnant... but real estate got in the way: &quot;They got engaged, but Li claims that Chan declined to wed legally because she said she was on a waiting list for an apartment and feared their combined marital income would make her ineligible for the Financial District studio.&quot; </p>

<p>So they never got an actual wedding license, but they &quot;celebrated their union by hosting more than 100 friends and relatives at a popular Chinatown dim sum restaurant.&quot; Li says they gave all their &quot;wedding&quot; gifts to her family, but soon after the big wedding banquet, she froze him out. He also accused her of keeping a &quot;betrothal fee&quot; he paid her family. (Yes, betrothal fees are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061840/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_pre-wedding_customs#Betrothal">real in the Chinese culture</a>.)</p>

<p>Chan says Li is &quot;lying. <strong>He is a devil... What I got myself into was a disaster relationship.</strong> He took everything [from] my relatives. They gave me tons of money, that [he] took. If he won&#x2019;t give that back, I&#x2019;m not giving him back anything. He&#x2019;s not a human being.&quot; She added that he was a deadbeat dad to their twin sons, which means that no one wins in this story.</p>
