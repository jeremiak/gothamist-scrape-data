<p>While the media devotes ink to whether <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075308/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/06/knives_come_out_for_palins_2012_cha.php">Sarah Palin has a shot in 2012</a>, we noticed something fun(ny): Rudy Giuliani has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075308/http://JoinRudy2012.com/">JoinRudy2012.com</a> website.  There&apos;s not much there, aside from having visitors contribute, but it looks like our former mayor might be keeping his options open!  </p>

Boo! He couldn&apos;t run for dog catcher,&quot; while one Queens woman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075308/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/giuliani-gives-last-minute-help-to-queens-senator/?apage=1">seeing Giuliani campaign</a> for Serphin Maltese (who lost his State Senate seat), admitted &#x201C;I wish you were running for president.&quot;</p>
