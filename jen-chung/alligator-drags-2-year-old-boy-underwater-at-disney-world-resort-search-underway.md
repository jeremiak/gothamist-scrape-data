<p>A toddler was attacked and dragged underwater by an alligator at a Disney World resort last night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031449/http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/15/us/alligator-attacks-child-disney-florida/">Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said</a>, &quot;The sad reality of it is it&apos;s been several hours, and we&apos;re not likely going to recover a live body.&quot;<b>Update</b>: A dive team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031449/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/toddler_alligator_found.php">found the boy&apos;s body in the afternoon</a>.</p>

<p>The two-year-old boy, his parents and four-year-old sister, who were visiting from Nebraska, were enjoying the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031449/https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/recreation/movies-under-the-stars/">&quot;Movies Under the Stars&quot;</a> program at the Grand Floridian Resort: &quot;Whether on the beach, poolside or surrounded by Floridian woodlands, enjoy relaxing evening entertainment that&#x2019;s fun for the whole family!&quot; The boy had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031449/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/06/14/reports-alligator-drags-child-into-water-fla/85905266/">reportedly been wading</a> along the shore of Seven Seas Lagoon, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031449/http://www.imaginerding.com/2007/11/22/daily-figment-110-seven-seas-lagoon/">man-made 200-acre lake</a>, when, around 9 p.m., the alligator suddenly grabbed him.</p>

The father suffered minor scratches on his hand but was unsuccessful in getting his son back. The mother also went into the water, trying to find her child, he said.&quot;</p>

<p>A massive search was started to find the boy:</p>

<p><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031449/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/15/nebraska-toddler-dragged-into-water-by-alligator-at-disney-resort-in-orlando/">The Washington Post reports</a>, &quot;By early Wednesday morning, authorities from Disney World, the Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission had deployed more than 50 law enforcement officers in helicopters and boats to the Seven Seas Lagoon, desperately searching for the missing toddler. Divers and trappers were on standby, officials said, and they were using sonar technology. After nearly 10 hours of searching, authorities had still found no trace of the boy. Trappers had caught and euthanized four gators, authorities said at a press conference early Wednesday. None seemed to contain any evidence they were the gator that snatched the boy.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed the alligator that attacked the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031449/http://www.wesh.com/news/so-child-dragged-into-water-by-alligator-near-disneys-grand-floridian-resort-spa/40058064">boy was seven feet long</a>.</p>

<p>A Disney spokeswoman said, &quot;Everyone here at the Walt Disney Resort is devastated by this tragic accident. Our thoughts are with the family. We are helping the family and doing everything we can to assist law enforcement.&quot;</p>

<p>Demings noted that there are &quot;no swimming&quot; signs around the lagoon, and another person vacationing at Disney World told CNN that there were &quot;multiple &apos;No Swimming&apos; signs near the lagoon are visible &apos;from any vantage point.&apos;&quot; Sheriff&apos;s spokesman Jeff Wiliamson said, &quot;My understanding is that he was not swimming.&quot;</p>

<p>Williamson, who revealed that the boy&apos;s family was talking to grief counselors, also said, &quot;Right now, all we&#x2019;re doing is searching for a little boy to hopefully bring a family some closure...We just want to keep searching and searching and searching until we can&apos;t search anymore.&quot;</p>
