The man died about 4:30 a.m. when he apparently tripped and fell on the electrified third rail at the Beach 90th St. station in Rockaway Beach, the sources said.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear if the morning&apos;s rain contributed to his death, which is the first NYC Transit fatality since April 2007, when two works were killed within five days (one at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123022/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/25/transit_worker.php">Columbus Circle</a>, the other at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123022/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/30/subway_repair_w.php">Hoyt-Schemerrhorn</a>).</p>
