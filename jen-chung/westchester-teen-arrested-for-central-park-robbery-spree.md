Jesse Wasserman, an 18-year-old New Rochelle resident, was identified by three victims, while his accomplice is still at large.  Apparently they would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150032/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/123309/teen-arrested-in-connection-with-three-central-park-robberies">pretend to be lost and ask for directions</a>: &quot;Once the victims were distracted, one suspect would pull out a gun while the other suspect would rob them.&quot;<p></p>

<p>One of the victims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150032/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/preppy_park_punk_eFnV83D6qg1ZZVTDKRFz0H?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;I was riding my bicycle on East Drive around 11:35 at night. Two guys approached me and asked for directions.  One of them pulled out a gun and said, &apos;Drop your bike and give me your money.&apos; I didn&apos;t have any money so I dropped my bike and ran.&quot; The Post, which adds that Wasserman once attended the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150032/http://www.vermontacademy.org/Page.aspx?pid=513">$42,500/year</a> Vermont Academy, reports the other robberies were at East 84th Street (a wallet and cellphone were taken) and near East 81st Street (the haul: a backpack, cellphone, credit cards and jewelry). </p>

<p>Wasserman was nabbed when a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150032/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/08/05/2010-08-05_teens_rob_three_people_in_central_park_within_30_minutes_.html">person called the police</a>, suspicious that Wasserman had thrown a backpack into the trash. According to the Post, Wasserman was with Driton Rexhaj, 19, a Manhattan resident, but Rexhaj was released because none of the victims id&apos;d him. None of the victims were injured; police did find a rubber gun.</p>

<p>A former classmate of Wasserman&apos;s said he was &quot;a stuck-up rich boy who had everything going for him and thought he lived a different life. He thought he was cool... Jesse had this vision of himself that he was a gangsta from Harlem, when actually, he was from a rich part of New York.&quot; </p>
