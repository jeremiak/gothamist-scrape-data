</div></div>					<p>Have you ever wanted to read 9,000 words about how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> feels bad about Tweeting a photograph of his crotch to a female follower (lying, at first, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php">that he was hacked</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/one_of_weiners_sext_partners_gives.php">sexting all</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weinergate_weiner_and_his_willing_w.php">those other ladies</a>, because he&apos;s got a really awesome wife and a new baby and basically totally screwed up his great dream to be mayor of New York? And yet he&apos;s still playing around with the idea of running for mayor this year anyway? Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/anthony-weiner-and-huma-abedins-post-scandal-playbook.html?ref=magazine&amp;_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all">here&apos;s the NY Times Magazine article for you</a>!</p>

<p>Last month, Weiner, who resigned from Congress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">in June 2011</a>, spent about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/16/weiners_got_a_hard-on_for_campaigns.php">$100,000 on political polling and research</a> and this Times Magazine feature seems like the next obvious move towards announcing <em>something</em>, because &quot;<strong>it&#x2019;s now or maybe never for me.</strong>&quot; </p><blockquote>How would he ultimately decide whether to run?<p></p>

<p>He pondered the question for an uncomfortably long time. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t be something as pedestrian as &#x2018;Do I think I&#x2019;ll win?&#x2019; It will be something more like &#x2018;Does it feel like I should be involved in this debate? Someone should be out there saying A, B or C.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<p>About the current field, he said cautiously: &#x201C;I know them all. I like them all.&#x201D; Then he took a tiny jab at the City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, for supporting Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x2019;s effort to extend term limits. &#x201C;The term-limits thing, as an issue, was a deal breaker for me. But, I think the polls are right: Chris Quinn is leading, and then someone will get into a runoff with her. I don&#x2019;t like runoffs, and I don&#x2019;t think we should have them so you don&#x2019;t have these divisive primaries anymore.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>As for that polling, he says, &quot;People are generally prepared to get over it, but they don&#x2019;t know if they&#x2019;re prepared to vote for me. And there&#x2019;s a healthy number of people who will never get over it.... It&#x2019;s a little complicated because I always attracted a fairly substantial amount of people who didn&#x2019;t like me anyway... I am a bit of a polarizing case.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Yeah, it&apos;s one thing to consider to vote for the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/christine_quinn_is_officially_runni.php">first female (and lesbian!) mayor</a> or NYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnliu">first Asian mayor</a> or our first mayor who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/05/stung_by_close_loss_more_what_if_th.php">would have beat Bloomberg in 2009 if you&apos;d bothered voting</a> or the first mayor to have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/do_you_care_that_public_advocate_de.php">reaffirm his wife&apos;s sexuality</a> or the first mayor to have to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/john_catsimatidis_is_helping_anti-s.php">really brilliant, meme-able holiday card</a>. But is the Big Apple ready for a guy who sent a photo of his big dick (at least, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/01/weinergate_jon_stewart_says_weiners.php">Jon Stewart thinks it&apos;s big</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/12/as_weiner_heads_to_sexting_rehab_hi.php">other photos of him grabbing his crotch</a> to fangirls? </p>

<p>Some other quotes from the article:</p><ul>	<li>Weiner on why he fell into the social media hole: &quot;I wasn&#x2019;t really thinking. What does this mean that I&#x2019;m doing this? Is this risky behavior? Is this smart behavior? <strong>To me, it was just another way to feed this notion that I want to be liked and admired.</strong>&quot;</li><br>
	<li>His brother Jason, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/11/when_did_you_know_you.php">a chef and restaurateur</a>, on Weiner&apos;s evolution following the scandal: &quot;I wouldn&#x2019;t stand for other people saying this about him, <strong>but there was definitely a douchiness about him that I just don&#x2019;t really see anymore.</strong>&quot;</li><br>
	<li>Jon Stewart, his old college friend and roommate, explained all the jokes, &quot;<strong>I may have been impeached by some sort of comedy board if I hadn&#x2019;t made all those Weiner jokes.</strong>&quot;</li><br>
<li>Wife Huma Abedin on how Weiner finally stopped lying about his Twitter account being hacked: &quot;Anthony said: &#x2018;I have something to tell you. <strong>I can&#x2019;t lie to you anymore. It&#x2019;s true. It&#x2019;s me. The picture is me. I sent it. </strong>Yes, these stories about the other women are true.&#x2019; And it was every emotion that one would imagine: rage and anger and shock. But more than anything else, in the immediate, it was disbelief. The thing that I consciously remember saying over and over and over again is: &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t understand. What is going on? What&#x2019;s happening to our lives?&#x2019;&quot;</li><br>
	<li>On running again: &quot;<strong>I want to ask people to give me a second chance.</strong> I do want to have that conversation with people whom I let down and with people who put their faith in me and who wanted to support me. I think to some degree I do want to say to them, &#x2018;Give me another chance.&#x2019;&quot;</li><br>
</ul><br>
Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183808/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/weiner-by-chen/?smid=tw-share">will need to decide by June 10</a> about whether he&apos;ll run for mayor.<p></p>
