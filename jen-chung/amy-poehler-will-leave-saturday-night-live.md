I don&apos;t really have any other details yet.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025717/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/17/arts/television/17poeh.html">According to the NY Times</a>, Poehler, who does a mean Hillary Clinton impersonation on SNL, &quot;will continue to perform on SNL through November or at least until her baby is born.&quot; It&apos;s been a big week for Poehler--she also received an Emmy nomination for best supporting comedy actress for her SNL work.  </p>
