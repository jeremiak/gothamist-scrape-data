<p>Last night, some of the cast of The Royal Tenenbaums <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011220021/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/royal_tenenbaums_cast_reuniting_at.php">reunited at the 10th anniversary</a> screening of the film at the New York Film Festival.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray appeared alongside director Wes Anderson, who also co-wrote the film with Owen Wilson.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011220021/http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/10/14/royal-tenenbaums-10th-anniversary-nyff/">According to Moviefone</a>, much of the discussion centered around Gene Hackman, who played the movie&apos;s patriarch.</p>

<p>Hackman was apparently not very pleasant at times, though it seems the cast forgave him for that, because he&apos;s Gene Hackman.  Paltrow said, &quot;I loved working with him. I loved being in the same scenes as him. He was kind of a bear of a guy, but I also found something very sweet and sad in there. I liked him a lot. I think he&apos;s one of the greatest actors who ever lived. To be in his presence and watch him do his thing. It&apos;s like -- you know, you&apos;re Gene Hackman, you can be in a bad fucking mood.&quot;</p>

<p>And then Murray described how Luke Wilson, who was dating Paltrow at the time, and Anderson regular Kumar Pallana did not make it easy:</p><blockquote>&quot;I&apos;ll stick up for Gene too... I&apos;d hear these stories, like, &apos;Gene threatened to kill me today.&apos; &apos;He can&apos;t kill you, you&apos;re in a union.&apos; &apos;Gene threatened to take all of us and set fire to us.&apos; &apos;It&apos;s a union shoot, it&apos;s New York, he can&apos;t set fire to you.&apos;...<p></p>

<p>&quot;[Gene] does his thing and it takes about 50-60 seconds, and Luke blew his line 13 or 14 times. Luke Wilson. I thought Luke was good? He&apos;s not good. Because at the time, he was in love with this girl over here&quot; -- Murray pointed at an embarrassed Paltrow -- &quot;and he couldn&apos;t think straight. So that&apos;s the problem with Gene. He had to work with Luke who was dizzy in love and Kumar Pallana, every single day...</p>

<p>&quot;He had like a complete spaced-out high school kid and Kumar every single day. How many of you have worked with Kumar? None of you! You wouldn&apos;t be here if you had. Kumar makes Luke Wilson look like Gielgud. If I had to work with Kumar and Luke Wilson, I would have set fire to this whole building.&quot;</p></blockquote>At a talk earlier in the day, Anderson called Hackman &quot;legendary&quot; and &quot;scary,&quot; admitting that Hackman might have been at a disadvantage because Hackman didn&apos;t want to do the film because he doesn&apos;t like parts that are written for him... and doesn&apos;t like being paid scale (Anderson thinks he wore him down over a year and a half):<p></p>

<p>Anderson also mentioned that movies and plays about New York&#x2014;as well as The New Yorker&#x2014;inspired the movie:</p>
