Cardozo had been a lawyer in Colombia, but in NYC (he immigrated in 1999 to flee the violence), he runs a language school.  The lessons are casual conversations, with Mayor Bloomberg driving the discussion and Cardozo gently correcting the mayor.  The Mayor hopes to be fluent by next year.  And back in 2005, Post reporter Sandra Guzman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426194357/http://gothamist.com/2005/05/18/bloomberg_to_voters_voto_para_mi.php">appraised Bloomberg&apos;s Spanish</a> in a campaign ad: &quot;<strong>Bloomberg&apos;s accent is gringo, not in a cowboy way, more like a student who&apos;s really trying hard</strong>.&quot; </p>
