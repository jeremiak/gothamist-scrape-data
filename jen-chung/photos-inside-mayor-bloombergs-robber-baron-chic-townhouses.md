</div></div>					<p>When the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802184118/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/nyregion/a-glimpse-at-bloombergs-lavish-tastes-at-home.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times asked Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s office</a> about the photographs on his longtime decorator&apos;s website that appeared to be of the billionaire&apos;s New York and London homes, &quot;The mayor&#x2019;s chief spokesman, Stu Loeser, declined to discuss the properties or their furnishings, and [decorator Jamie] Drake did not respond to phone or e-mail messages seeking comment. Mr. Loeser would not say whether Mr. Bloomberg was aware that the photos were online, but they were removed from Mr. Drake&#x2019;s site Monday afternoon.&quot; If you were curious, you&apos;re in luck because we dug them up!</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg is one of the world&apos;s richest men, so it figures that his homes would be decorated in a style that reflects his billionaire-many-times-over status.  But he&apos;s a private man (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802184118/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/07/city_council_wants_bloomberg_to_sig.php">do NOT ask him what he does on weekends</a> when he&apos;s not at a local parade), even though he may take the subway to City Hall and chat with his constituents, not much has been written about the splendor of the townhouses. Behavioral science writer Winifred Gallagher tells the Times the style seems to be &quot;a sort of postmodern version of the 16th-century Italian merchant prince or maybe the 19th-century American robber baron,&quot; and the owner seems like one &quot;someone who can afford to express his wealth and taste and bold personality with the best that money can buy, the best art, the best design,&quot; adding, &quot;<strong>This is not the broody, artistic Abraham Lincoln type</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>That fits with a quote Graydon Carter once gave the Times ten years ago: &quot;Michael wants to live large, like a 19th-century railroad baron. He sees himself as very much like the Carnegies or Mellons.&quot; Totally: Who else can afford&#x2014;based on what one antiques dealer believes&#x2014;are $40,000 (each) sconces, &quot;a $1 million Georgian Chippendale couch beneath what appeared to be an 18th-century portrait by a prominent painter like Joshua Reynolds or Thomas Gainsborough, which might be worth $450,000,&quot; plus &quot;more sconces and chandeliers valued in the five or six figures, the dealer said.&quot; <br>
