                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_08_fayeund.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023170054im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_08_fayeund.jpg" width="365" height="292"> <br> <i>Vintage Faye Dunaway</i></div> Faye Dunaway said last week that while her landlord is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023170054/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/03/faye_dunaway_sued_for_not_living_in.php">suing her for not living in her one-bedroom</a> rent-stabilized walk-up on the Upper East Side, he couldn&apos;t evict her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023170054/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/faye_dunaway_fires_back_at_ues_apar.php">since she moved out</a>.  Well, now the Oscar-winning actress has decided to fight to keep the approximately $1,000/month apartment&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023170054/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/nyregion/faye-dunaway-absent-from-housing-court-hearing.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">her lawyer said in housing court</a>, &quot;She&#x2019;s not voluntarily leaving the apartment. She says New York is her home.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Tenants of rent-stabilized apartments are supposed to live in the units and establish them as their primary residences. Many buildings and landlords<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023170054/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/09/watch_out_for_t.php"> hire private investigators</a> to root out tenants who illegally sublet the apartment or live elsewhere in order to get the units back to rent out at market rate; market rate for one-bedrooms in Dunaway&apos;s UES neighborhood is about $2300/month.  Dunaway&apos;s voting and vehicle registrations are in California, and those near her NYC home haven&apos;t seen much of the actress.  Last week, Dunaway told the Times that she left the apartment because &quot;I am spending less and less time in New York&quot; and also complained the landlord Henry Moses &quot;refused to paint the house, and bugs were everywhere,&quot; adding that he&apos;s s  &quot;slumlord.&quot;  </p>

<p>In court, Dunaway&apos;s lawyer claimed that there are exceptions to rent-stabilized apartment laws and pointed out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023170054/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/faye_fight_to_stay_Mq8jqWHMlLlSQrcMmMdHpI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Dunaway&apos;s work &quot;takes her all over the world.&quot;</a>  However, Moses&apos; lawyer emphasized her lack of New York records.  One man waiting to dispute his rent in court told the Times that he was on Dunaway&apos;s side, &quot;It&#x2019;s a good thing to fight. Individual rights are eroding in this country.&quot;</p>
