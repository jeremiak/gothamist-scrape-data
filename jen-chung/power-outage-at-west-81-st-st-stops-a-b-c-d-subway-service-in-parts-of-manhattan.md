<p>Power has been lost on the third rail at Manhattan&apos;s West 81st Street subway station&#x2014;which has resulted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922053348/http://new.mta.info/status/subway/ACE/22984682">subway service</a> suspensions on the A, B, C, and D lines between 59th Street and 125th Street. </p>

<p>The FDNY says it&apos;s on the scene&#x2014;and there&apos;s apparently at least one trapped train car. One passenger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922053348/https://twitter.com/lindstotheay/status/378514143693012992">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Trapped in the subway thanks to a power outage. This is my nightmare. #Atrain @MTA,&quot; later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922053348/https://twitter.com/lindstotheay/status/378518144203382785">adding</a>, &quot;A pregnant woman is about the have a breakdown. #TrappedInASubway.&quot;</p>
