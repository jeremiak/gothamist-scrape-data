<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:270px; "> <img alt="2009_04_astorsapt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065530im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_astorsapt.jpg" width="270" height="196"> <br> <i>Photograph of Brooke Astor&apos;s bedroom, via an apartment listing</i></div> The trial of Brooke Astor&apos;s son Anthony Marshall is a glimpse into high society.  Well, a glimpse of high society amid accusations of elder abuse, swindling money from a senile woman, and more.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065530/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04302009/news/regionalnews/courts_mini_manor_a_model_of_domestic_de_166876.htm">Post reports</a> that one of the the prosecution&apos;s exhibits is &quot;a remarkably detailed scale model of Brooke Astor&apos;s 16th-floor apartment overlooking Park Avenue at 72nd Street.&quot; The model&apos;s rooms appear to emulate the actual decoration of Astor&apos;s co-op, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065530/http://stribling.com/propinfo.asp?webid=1074141&amp;type=SALE">on the market for $29 million</a>, including parquet-type floors and wallpaper.  The Post adds, &quot;<strong>You can almost smell the dog urine on the infamous Blue Room couch.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>Of course, that&apos;s a reference to how Astor was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065530/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/26/astors_scary_pl.php">allegedly left in bad conditions</a> by Marshall, who refused (again, allegedly) proper care for his millionaire philanthropist mother.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065530/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/04/29/2009-04-29_brooke_astor_was_so_senile_when_she_changed_her_will_she_didnt_recognize_jesse_j.html">Two prosecution witnesses testified yesterday</a>, saying that Marshall intimidated his mother into thinking she was poor.  Linda Gillies, who ran the Vincent Astor Foundation, said, &quot;<strong>I&apos;ve bought a lot of pairs of shoes, and Tony isn&apos;t going to approve.&apos; She said, &apos;Tony says I can&apos;t afford it.&apos;</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>A member of the British Astors,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065530/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/04/30/2009-04-30_astor_a_dizzying_look_into_too_much_everything.html"> Lord William Astor recalled</a>, &quot;She said she was staying at the Connaught Hotel and that she shouldn&apos;t be staying there because &apos;it was very expensive and Tony was always saying I&apos;m spending too much money and I&apos;m low on cash.&apos;... I was concerned and made inquiries with a friend at Citibank. I was entirely satisfied that this wasn&apos;t the case.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627065530/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/nyregion/30astor.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times explains</a> that William Astor is &quot;the fourth member of the family with that name and a direct descendant of John Jacob Astor,&quot; and his accent was &quot;so thick a prosecutor had to ask him to slow down several times.&quot;</p>
