After the attacks, a trapper following the coyote saw her eat her own pup&apos;s head and then a police officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195933/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/07/after_attacking_residents_mangy_coy.php">killed the animal</a> after it lunged at him.  The grandfather of the 2-year-old girl who suffered scratches (and her father, who protected her, were treated for rabies) told the Journal News, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s scary to know that this sick animal was roaming around the village.</strong> It&apos;s a good thing to know the animal was ultimately caught. Hopefully there aren&apos;t too many other rabid animals around, but you never know.&quot;</p>
