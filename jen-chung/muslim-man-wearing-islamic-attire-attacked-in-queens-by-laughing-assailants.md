										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_06_mvicq.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016142516im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_06_mvicq.jpg" width="350" height="472"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> (CAIR)</i></div> A 59-year-old man wearing traditional Islamic clothing was brutally beaten by multiple assailants in Queens last week, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations wants the police to investigate whether the assault was a hate crime. <p></p>

<p>According to CAIR, Mohamed Rasheed Khan was approached by &quot;three young men Wednesday night as he was leaving the Center for Islamic Studies on Jamaica Avenue.&quot; He was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016142516/http://pix11.com/2016/06/05/muslim-man-knocked-off-bike-attacked-outside-queens-mosque-nypd/">apparently knocked off his bicycle</a> and punched. From CAIR:</p><blockquote> Khan, who is an American citizen of Guyanese heritage, was wearing traditional Islamic attire at the time of the attack.<p></p>

<p>The alleged assailants did not steal the victim&apos;s wallet, watch or bicycle, and were reportedly seen laughing as they left the scene of the attack.</p>

<p>Khan suffered multiple broken bones in his face, fractured ribs and a concussion. He remains unable to speak or open his eyes, and is scheduled for surgery tomorrow at Jamaica Hospital Center.</p></blockquote>CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher said, &quot;Because of the location of the attack outside a mosque, the Islamic attire of the victim, and because nothing was stolen by the alleged attackers, we urge law enforcement authorities to investigate a possible bias motive for this troubling incident. We urge the NYPD to step up patrols in the area of the mosque, particularly during activities associated with the upcoming fast of Ramadan.&quot;<p></p>

He believes in Islamic ways&#x2014;he was coming to pray, and Islam is all about love and caring for others. The criminals that did this, they don&apos;t identify with that.&quot;</p>
