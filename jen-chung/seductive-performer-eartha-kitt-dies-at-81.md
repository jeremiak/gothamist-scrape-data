She had been suffering from colon cancer.  Known for her hit &quot;Santa Baby&quot; and as Catwoman on the TV series Batman, Kitt was called &quot;the most exciting woman alive&quot; by Orson Welles (see her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011559/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKNEVSh1iME&amp;feature=related">discuss how Welles bit her</a> onstage in his excitement).  She was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011559/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081226/ts_nm/us_usa_kitt">controversial</a> after denouncing the Vietnam War&#x2014;at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011559/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/remember/july-dec07/johnson_07-11.html">White House luncheon given</a> by Lady Bird Johnson (allegedly making the First Lady cry).  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011559/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/arts/26kitt.html?hp">NY Times obituary notes</a> how Kitt influenced many, including Diana Ross, and that critics loved mentioning her feline qualities (the purr of her voice, the slink of her walk&#x2014;see her perform &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011559/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5WVkl_f7_E">C&apos;est Si Bon</a>.&quot;) As a child, she was sent to Harlem to live with an aunt:  &quot;Though she was given piano and dance lessons, a pattern of abuse developed there as well: Ms. Kitt would be beaten, run away and return. By her early teenage years she was working in a factory and sleeping in subways and on the roofs of unlocked buildings.&quot;</p>
