</div></div>					<p>Who doesn&apos;t love a story about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065219/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/29/feds_arrest_suspected_russian_spies.php">alleged Russian spies living <em>amongst</em> us</a> in the city and the suburbs?  And when one of those &quot;spies&quot; seems to be a party girl with a &quot;Victoria&apos;s Secret body.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065219/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ny_spy_life_was_BMpOkSexEMcgIIJTY1YaIL">Post takes a real shine to Anna Chapman</a>, who wrote on her Facebook page, &quot;America is a free country. Over here, it is easy to meet successful people. In Moscow, it is practically impossible because you have to be as successful as they are... here you can meet successful people on the street and go have dinner with them.&quot;</p>

<p>The tabloid says, &quot;&apos;Anna Chapman&apos; sidled up to power players while hobnobbing at society functions, charity events and book openings in slinky designer outfits. It was her apparent way of collecting information to send back to her native Russia -- but she also enjoyed going out clubbing, blogging and seeing the sights.&quot;  OMG, blogging!  &quot;During her two years in the Big Apple, she frequented New York hotspots like the Thompson Hotel, Greenhouse and Juliet -- and even spent some time visiting the Statue of Liberty.&quot;  According to Russian media, &quot;the vivacious vixen grew up in Volgograd -- the former Stalingrad -- until the eighth grade, when her father was posted to the Russian embassy in Kenya. She moved to Moscow after high school, and later got a master&apos;s degree in economics there.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065219/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/06/30/2010-06-30_cant_believe_our_friends_are_spies_we_let_them_watch_our_kids_suspects_nj_neighb.html">Daily News examines NJ couple</a> (or spies!) &quot;Richard and Cynthia Murphy,&quot; who lived in Montclair, NJ and Hoboken, NJ.  A friend of the couple says upon hearing the news, &quot;We&apos;re like, &apos;Holy crap, this is Cyndy and Rick Murphy.&apos; Then we contact the FBI, and they corroborate all this ... but it&apos;s still so surreal. We were stunned... They&apos;d baby-sit our kids. I kind of realized the other day that they never really let us baby-sit their kids - which, thinking back now, I can probably see why.&quot;  </p>

<p>The friend added, &quot;I&apos;m almost wondering if they got caught up in a situation that they didn&apos;t know how to get out of, a situation they didn&apos;t really want to be in but were forced to.&quot; A situation that involved spy sex&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065219/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/06/29/2010-06-29_couples_in_accused_russian_secret_agent_ring_faked_marriage__even_own_spy_kids_d.html">News notes</a> that the couple had &quot;unprotected spy sex&quot;&#x2014;resulting in the &quot;spy kids&quot;&#x2014;to remain undercover.  The Department of Justice&apos;s criminal complaint says, &quot;llegals often operate in pairs - being placed together by Moscow Center while in Russia, so that they can live together and work together in a host country, under the guise of a married couple. Illegals who are placed together and cohabitate in the country to which they are assigned will often have children together. This further deepens an illegal&apos;s &apos;legend.&apos;&quot;</p>
