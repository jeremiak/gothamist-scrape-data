The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505004003/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/business/03bayou.html">NY Times reports</a> Israel had been in Southwick, Massachusetts where he &quot;<strong>was talking to his mother on the phone when he walked into a local jail and surrendered</strong> to the United States Marshals task force.&quot;</p>

<p>Israel, who was convicted of swindling hundreds of millions from investors in his Bayou Hedge Fund Group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505004003/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/10/convicted_hedge_funders_mysterious.php">left his SUV on Bear Mountain Bridge on June 9</a>, with the keys still on the ignition and the words &quot;Suicide is painless&quot; written on the dusty hood. His girlfriend gave investigators a suicide note and claimed not to know more, only to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505004003/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/20/missing_hedge_funders_girlfriend_he.php">later confess she helped him escape</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the people he had scammed were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505004003/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/13/sam_israel_is_wanted.php">skeptical Israel actually killed himself</a>, suspecting he had run off the Caribbean or another island.  Southwick, MA is about 117 miles from where Israel disappeared.</p>
