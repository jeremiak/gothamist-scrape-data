<p>Today&apos;s primary vote with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143147/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/14/your_hot_new_electronic_voting_mach.php">new scanner-style voting machines</a> has gotten off on a very bad start.  While some voters had no problems at all (thanks to poll workers who were present and/or knowledgeable about the new system), some other voters had terrible experiences&#x2014;like machines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143147/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/14/your_hot_new_electronic_voting_mach.php#comments">not even set up</a> or the polling places not opening on time.  In fact, Senator Chuck Schumer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143147/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/14/schumer_has_problems_at_polls_screa.php">apparently had a meltdown</a> at his Park Slope polling place and Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143147/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/14/bloomberg_todays_primary_is_a_royal.php">called it a &quot;royal screw-up.&quot;</a></p>

<p>However, Dan Wallach, an associate professor of computer science at Rice University and associate director of the voting-system research group ACCURATE, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143147/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2010/09/452633/new-machines-old-administrators">told Capital New York</a>, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s happening here is just a lot of teething issues.&quot; (Teething is painful!) But Wallach was &quot;most disturbed by is the fact that poll workers are reportedly taking ballots from voters and feeding them into the scanning machines,&quot; explaining, &quot;That is a total violation of voter privacy. That&#x2019;s not supposed to happen... The poll worker shouldn&#x2019;t be helping. The voter should be able to deal with it. The act of shoving the paper into the scanner&#x2014;it&#x2019;s no more difficult than shoving a piece of paper into fax machine. It&#x2019;s the first time for everybody, and there are issues.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Still, some people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143147/http://www.politico.com/blogs/maggiehaberman/0910/I_want_levers_back.html?showall">want the lever machines back</a>.  What about you?</p>
