<p>During the performance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075910/http://www.metoperafamily.org/opera/faust-gounod-tickets.aspx">Faust</a> at the Metropolitan Opera last night, mezzo soprano <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075910/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_White_(mezzo-soprano)">Wendy White</a> fell eight feet off the stage. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075910/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/arts/music/opera-singer-wendy-white-in-stable-condition-after-a-fall-at-the-met.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Members of the audience said that during Act III, as Ms. White, in the role of Marthe, was walking onto a platform from a staircase behind Ren&#xE9; Pape, who was playing M&#xE9;phistoph&#xE9;l&#xE8;s, a clattering sound was heard and she disappeared from view.&quot;</p>

<p>Pape reportedly yelled, &quot;Curtain! Curtain!&quot; and the show stopped.  There was an intermission and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075910/http://parterre.com/2011/12/17/wendy-white-injured/">source to opera blog Parterre Box</a> said the show was delayed 40 minutes, with her &quot;[Theodora] Hanslowe  went on from the &#x2018;Eh quoi, toujours seule,&apos;&quot; and at the second intermission, &quot;Announcement just made that Wendy is ok but sent to ER for a precautionary measure. Show is delayed by 40 minutes so far.&quot;</p>

<p>White is reportedly in stable condition but is undergoing tests. The Times adds, &quot;A hinge on a piece of plywood that connected the platform to the stairway broke, causing the plywood to give way and leading to the fall, a Met spokesman said later.&quot;  </p>
