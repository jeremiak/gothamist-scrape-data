<p>New York City tried to impress Panasonic with a location at either Metrotech or the under-construction Atlantic Yards, noting the talented young professionals in Brooklyn. Crain&apos;s reports, &quot;But it was New Jersey&apos;s fat subsidy package that won the day. The package requires the firm to create 250 jobs over 10 years and was predicated on the notion that the existing jobs were &apos;at risk&apos; of leaving the state.&quot; (Atlanta and Chicago were other possible options.)  Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz said, &quot;I am disappointed that Panasonic passed on the chance to bring its big screens to the big stage of Brooklyn, U.S.A. When the Nets move from Newark to Brooklyn in 2012, it&apos;s going to be a heck of a commute for those Panasonic employees.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325211512/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/panasonic_will_move_headquarte.html">Newark Mayor Cory Booker crowed</a>, &quot;It&apos;s historic. We&apos;ve been seeing so much progress in the last four years. This is heralding to the globe that Newark is one of the most significant players on the Eastern seaboard.&quot; However, Panasonic&apos;s Secaucus landlord, Hartz Mountain Industries, and the town of Secaucus say the subsidy isn&apos;t being used properly.  Secaucus Mayor Michael Gonnelli said, &quot;Our issue is we shouldn&apos;t be using that pool of money attracting a company that&apos;s already in New Jersey. It&apos;s going to hurt one town to help another town, and we just don&apos;t think that&apos;s what the legislation was intended to do.&quot; And Hartz VP, Allen Magrini, said, &quot;We&apos;re in difficult financial times and to give away $102 million for a five-mile move where there&apos;s no new jobs created doesn&apos;t make any sense. We&apos;re cutting social programs, we&apos;re cutting all kinds of programs and they&apos;re spending $102 million to relocate existing jobs within the state.&quot; </p>
