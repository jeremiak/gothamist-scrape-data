<p>Yale University students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231082157/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/apr/14/campus-grieves-rising-star-dufault-11/">held a candlelight vigil last night</a> in memory of senior Michele Dufault, who was killed during a freak accident at a chemistry lab on Tuesday night.  Dufault had been working on her senior project about dark matter and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231082157/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/apr/14/yale-osha-begin-investigations/">according to the Yale Daily News</a>, &quot;As she was working with a wood lathe &#x2014; a large piece of equipment with parts that spin rapidly to mold wood products &#x2014; Dufault&#x2019;s hair became caught in the machine, University President Richard Levin confirmed in an email Wednesday night.&quot; The medical examiner said her death was an accident caused by &quot;asphyxia due to neck compression.&quot;</p>

<p>The Massachusetts was active in the Physics Department, a member in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231082157/http://www.yale.edu/dropteam/team.html">Yale Drop Team</a> (&quot;The Undergraduate Microgravity Research Group&quot;), volunteered in a program to encourage middle school girls to get involved with science and played the saxophone in the Yale Precision Marching Band.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231082157/http://newhavenregister.com/articles/2011/04/14/news/doc4da58c22c4b1f135149346.txt">band played &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot;</a> one of Dufault&apos;s favorite songs, at the vigil. Yale College Dean Mary Miller said, &quot;Yale has lost a shining star,&quot; and said of Dufault&apos;s presentation of her senior project earlier this year, &#x201C;While she was speaking, I suspended disbelief and thought I understood the strange behavior of invisible things. She was vibrant and compelling that evening, as Michele was in all things.&quot; </p>

<p>Yale President Richard Levin, who called Dufault&apos;s death a &quot;true tragedy,&quot; said the school would conduct a &quot;review of the safety policies and practices of laboratories, machine shops, and other facilities with power equipment that is accessed and operated by undergraduates.&quot;  The  Occupational Health and Safety Administration is also investigating.  In the meantime, Yale has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231082157/http://abcnews.go.com/US/yale-university-limits-access-equipment-student-death/story?id=13372558">limited students&apos; access to power equipment</a>.</p>
