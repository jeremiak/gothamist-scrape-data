</div></div>					<p>Last time we checked, the new-and-improved Tavern on the Green&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006213344/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/katy_sparks_to_be_chef_at_new_taver.php">first announced in August 2012</a>&#x2014;was set to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006213344/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/14/tavern_on_the_green_opening_pushed.php">open in late January</a>, delayed from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006213344/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/02/surprise_new_tavern_on_the_green_is.php">a late fall start</a>, but that didn&apos;t happen. Now, restaurateurs Jim Caiola and David Salama, along with chef Katy Sparks and general manager Celso Moreira, say that they&apos;ll be open on April 24.</p>

<p>According to a press release, April 24 is when &quot;a preview dinner menu begins, with brunch service Mother&#x2019;s Day weekend May 10 &amp; 11, and a full grand opening (outdoor seating weather permitting) serving lunch, brunch and dinner Tuesday May 13, 2014.&quot; And reservations are open, either <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006213344/http://www.tavernonthegreen.com/">on their website</a> or at 212-877-TOTG (8684). No menu has been posted, but here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006213344/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/11/tavern_on_the_green_returning_next.php">2012 draft of the menu</a>.</p>

<p>While we&apos;ll only believe that Tavern on the Green is opening when it actually opens, we are excited about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006213344/http://gothamist.com/2004/04/07/katy_sparks_and_female_chefs_in_ny.php">return of Katy Sparks</a>, who had the wonderful Soho restaurant Quilty&apos;s back in the 1990s. Sparks said at the time her involvement was announced, &quot;Tavern on the Green is an offer that one just doesn&#x2019;t refuse. It&#x2019;s the one project I can think of that would lure me into leading a kitchen again.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the full press release:</p><blockquote>LIGHTS&#x2026; CAMERA&#x2026; ACTION&#x2026;TAVERN ON THE GREEN OPENS<br>
Tavern On The Green is open.  That&#x2019;s all one needs to say to gather excitement for the beloved New York restaurant, which re-enters the Central Park and New York dining landscape Thursday April 24, 2014 when a preview dinner menu begins, with brunch service Mother&#x2019;s Day weekend May 10 &amp; 11, and a full grand opening (outdoor seating weather permitting) serving lunch, brunch and dinner Tuesday May 13, 2014. <br>

Restaurateurs Jim Caiola and David Salama of The Emerald Green Group, along with Chef Katy Sparks (whom Jim first met after they graduated from Johnston &amp; Wales University in Providence, RI), and General Manager Celso Moreira, have created a Tavern for this generation of diners.  Jim and David&#x2019;s aim to re-establish Tavern On The Green as a restaurant for all, New Yorkers and visitors alike, restores this renowned dining hub to its Upper West Side neighborhood.  Tavern On The Green will celebrate New York and Central Park in all its glory, embracing the limitless, delicious foods for which this diverse culinary city is known.  The menu is contemporary, dynamic and accessible, allowing the quality of the seasonal ingredients and cooking to take center stage. <p></p>

<p>Magical is a word thrown around a lot when discussing Tavern On The Green and one can&#x2019;t help but feel magic in the air.  Jim and David, with the help of Broadway set designer John Lee Beatty, architect Richard H. Lewis, lighting designer Ken Billington, and landscape architect Robin Key, preserved the Victorian/Gothic elegance of the semi-circular building, one of the most important historical buildings in NY and the USA.  The interior is designed with spectacular precision to be authentic, natural, elegant and sexy.  It is reminiscent of a grand mansion one might find on the property of an Italian villa or a historic Hudson River Valley manor.  The renovation began two years ago when the parks department spearheaded a thorough and authentic, brick-by-brick renovation of the exterior and the entire building&#x2019;s infrastructure.<br>
 <br>
The experience begins the moment one enters Central Park on West 67th Street and comes face-to-face with the grand, red canopy inspired by photographs from the 1940s, and 110-seat garden where guests can enjoy cocktails.  The Entry Garden and Bar Terrace feature a brick-and-granite terrace that reflects the restored circular fa&#xE7;ade of the building.  A curved trellis of espalier fruit trees highlights the restored brick wall and a series of planters surrounds the terrace perimeter.<br>
 <br>
Once in the building, wood-beamed cathedral ceilings and the dark stained Parquet de Versaille flooring give immediate intimacy to the space.  The Bar Room is dominated by a large oval dark mahogany bar with a semi-circular red high-backed banquette and warm casual seating around the perimeter, accommodating 150.  A scagliola fireplace, with carved sheep heads regally staring at eye level from the columns is a focal point in the room (an homage to the sheep that were housed here from the 1880s to the 1930s when in 1934 TOTG first became a restaurant.)  The walls are covered in dark-stained wood with upholstered walls above.  All patrons pass through what is sure to be a lively scene on the way to the bustling atrium-inspired modern Central Park room with off-white leather tables, ivory-stained wood chairs and cheerful banquettes covered in grey and yellow sun-patterned fabric seating 140.  At one end, glass-enclosed, is a view of Central Park and the 300-seat Courtyard with panoramic views of the Central Park West skyline and the vast sheep meadow.  From the sheep meadow and bridal path, the view of Tavern on the Green hasn&#x2019;t been seen in more than 40 years.  With an outdoor bar, new light poles, rich stone paving and newly-planted specimen trees, it is sure to be New York&#x2019;s most spectacular outdoor dining experience.<br>
 <br>
Front and center in the Central Park room is the framed open kitchen where Chef Sparks holds court with her team.  Hearth ovens anchor the kitchen on either side with a long line of planchas and grills, on which the cooks sear fish and meats to perfection.  There&#x2019;s no masking or culinary trickery here, as Chef Sparks&#x2019; motto for food at Tavern is to start with a great product and cook it to the right temperature. Her secret is high heat and high flavor.  And that flavor comes naturally from the well-sourced farm-raised and artisan-produced ingredients that Chef Sparks selected for the menu.<br>
 <br>
The South Wing is a quieter affair with 120 seats, painted mirror panels and upholstered walls with green and brown fabric furniture.  It is a lighter version of the bar room with painted-wood paneled walls. In addition to a la carte, this room will be the main area of Tavern used for private events.  This room leads to the South Terrace, which can be tented, and wraps around to the &#x201C;Green to Go&#x201D; window easily accessible from the Bridle Path and offers simple, organic, and healthy sandwiches, drinks, and snacks. There are 110 seats for the public, bike and stroller racks for easy and safe storage.  <br>
 <br>
This is a thrilling moment in the careers of Jim and David, business and life partners, and parents of two children, all of whom uprooted their life in Philadelphia for Tavern on the Green.  There they were credited with &#x201C;creating a handsome neighborhood place where harmony reigns.&#x201D; They plan to establish that same sense of harmony at their Tavern On The Green.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><em>Tavern on the Green is located at West 67th Street and Central Park West.</em></p>
