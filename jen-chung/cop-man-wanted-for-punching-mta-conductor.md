And the NYPD has also provided a rather vivid sketch of the suspect.</p>

<p>According to the cops, on April, 21, 2012 at around12:45 p.m., a northbound #1 train was stopped at 207th Street when a 47-year-old male conductor was punched in the face.  The conductor suffered a broken nose and was treated at St. Barnabas Hospital.  </p>

<p>The police describe the suspect as a Hispanic male, around 19-22 years old, and 5&apos;7&quot; and 160 pounds. Also, besides last seen wearing blue jeans and a checker shirt, &quot;he has braids on the left side of his face.&quot;  Check out the hairdo in the sketch.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the MTA workers&apos; union suggested that employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120429232434/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/17/should_mta_employees_be_allowed_to.php">should be armed with stun guns</a>.</p>
