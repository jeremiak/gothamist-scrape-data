<p>Soon after news broke that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170220161547/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/26/woman_raped_robbed_while_jogging_in.php">jogger was raped in lower Manhattan</a> on Wednesday, police released surveillance video of the suspect last night. He apparently used the victim&apos;s credit card at a deli.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, a 26-year-old woman was jogging in East River Park, near Cherry Street, &quot;when the suspect, on a bicycle, approached her and motioned for her to be quiet. The victim turned around and started to run in the opposite direction when the suspect grabbed her hair, put his arm around her throat and pulled her into the amphitheater area where he raped her. The suspect fled the scene thereafter.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, where she was treated and released. </p>

<p>The police said this video of the suspect, described as being in his 20s, is from a deli where he used the victim&apos;s credit card. </p>

<p>Two female joggers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170220161547/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/jogger-dragged-raped-robbed-east-river-park-cops-article-1.2447604">spoke to the Daily News</a>, saying, &quot;It&apos;s a very scary thought I definitely have my guard up now that it gets dark earlier,&quot; and &quot;I can&#x2019;t believe it happened here at the park. You would think it would be nice right next to the East River.&quot;</p>

<p>The search for the suspect continues, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170220161547/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/26/east-river-park-rape/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that &quot;police have set up flood lights to keep things bright here after dark.&quot;</p>
