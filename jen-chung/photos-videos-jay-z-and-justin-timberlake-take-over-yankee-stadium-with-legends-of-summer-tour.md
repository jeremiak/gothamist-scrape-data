</div></div>					<p>Last night, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150806/https://twitter.com/RealJoeLevy/status/357687609000083457">hyphen-less Jay Z</a> and Justin Timberlake brought their joint tour to Yankee Stadium. They performed both together&#x2014;on songs like &quot;Just Wanna Love You,&quot; &quot;Rock Your Body,&quot; &quot;99 Problems&quot;&#x2014;and separately. The duo even separately paid homage to the great state they were in, with Timberlake belting out &quot;New York, New York,&quot; which naturally led to Jay Z&apos;s &quot;Empire State of Mind,&quot; with a guest appearance from Alicia Keys.</p>

<p>&quot;99 Problems&quot;: <br>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150806/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/jay-z-justin-timberlake-rock-yankee-stadium-1.5730592">Newsday&apos;s Glenn Gamboa said</a>, &quot;It showed how Timberlake and Jay-Z [sic!] were able to push each other to new heights. And as long as that continues, this odd couple has a future.&quot; And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150806/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/arts/music/street-smarts-meets-old-fashioned-showbiz.html?ref=music">NY Times&apos; Jon Pareles noted</a>, &quot;Jay-Z [sic!!] and Mr. Timberlake make a disparate pairing: the rapper and the singer, the triumphant hustler and the boyish romantic, the ex-drug dealer and the ex-Mouseketeer. On this tour, street smarts met old-fashioned song-and-dance showbiz. Mr. Timberlake could not ask for a better partner than Jay-Z, who lends him gravity and grit. Meanwhile, Mr. Timberlake gives Jay-Z some warmth and longing to go with his braggadocio. It is a calculated partnership, but the calculations pay off for both sides.&quot;</p>

<p>The pair perform tonight as well.</p>
