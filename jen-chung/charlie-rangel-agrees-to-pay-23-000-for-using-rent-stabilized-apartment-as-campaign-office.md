<p>Rep. Charlie Rangel is getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/03/5516921/espaillat-making-preparations-war-against-charlie-rangel">ready for a potential re-election challenge</a> this fall, so getting fined $23,000 for using one of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/11/congressman_charles_rangel_and_his.php">infamous rent-stabilized apartments</a> as a campaign office probably isn&apos;t ideal.  Then again, it&apos;s a cakewalk next to being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/02/house_votes_333-79_to_censure_range.php">censured by his colleagues in the House</a>!</p>

<p>Rangel was paying thousands under market rent for his spread in Harlem&apos;s Lenox Terrace. Three were used for his private residents, while one was an office. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/nyregion/rangel-and-campaign-to-pay-fine-over-misuse-of-rent-law.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">NY Times explains</a>, &quot;Because the fourth apartment was rent-stabilized, Mr. Rangel paid $630 per month, while similar market-rate units in the building rented for $1,700 a month and higher, according to The Times. Shortly after the leasing arrangement became public, Mr. Rangel moved his campaign office out of the apartment.&quot; </p>

<p>News of Rangel&apos;s many rent-stabilized apartments opened up a Pandora&apos;s box of other questionable decisions (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/05/rangels_75000.php">unreported income</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/rangels_taxes_keep_turning_up_mangl.php">no mention of a home&apos;s sale</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/10/rangel_owes_federal_taxes_too.php">using Congressional letterhead to solicit donations</a>!), which led to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120092926/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/rangel_censure_was_embarrassing_pai.php">&quot;embarrassing&quot; public censure</a>.  Anyway, Rangel&apos;s spokeswoman said, &quot;People settle not because they&apos;re guilty but because they don&apos;t want to go through the cumbersome process and expense to show they&apos;re not guilty.&quot;</p>
