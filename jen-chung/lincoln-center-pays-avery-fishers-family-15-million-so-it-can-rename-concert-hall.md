<p>In order to fund a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723183529/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/arts/music/avery-fisher-hall-to-be-renovated.html?pagewanted=all">huge, $500 million renovation</a>, Lincoln Center is getting ready to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723183529/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/arts/music/lincoln-center-to-rename-avery-fisher-hall.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">offer up naming rights to Avery Fisher Hall</a>. In order to do so, however, they first needed to get the okay from Avery Fisher&apos;s family, which came with a hefty pricetag. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723183529/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/arts/music/lincoln-center-to-rename-avery-fisher-hall.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">The NY Times</a>, the family relinquishing the name allows the Philharmonic and Lincoln Center to bring in a large donor, whom the building will be renamed for (remember when Stephen A. Schwarzman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723183529/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/24/stephen_a_schwa.php">gave $100 million to the NYPL</a>?). The paper reports:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The unusual agreement, announced on Thursday, is a significant turnaround from 12 years ago, when the family of Fisher, the music philanthropist who financed a 1973 renovation of the building, threatened legal action if the concert hall was rebuilt or renovated under a new name. Lincoln Center is essentially paying the family $15 million for permission to drop the name and has included several other inducements, like a promise to feature prominent tributes to Avery Fisher in the lobby of the renovated concert hall.</blockquote>Avery Fisher gave $10.5 million to renovate the building (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723183529/http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=10000000&amp;year1=1973&amp;year2=2014">over $53 million in today&apos;s dollars</a>), requiring his name to &quot;appear on tickets, brochures, program announcements, advertisements and the like, and I consent in perpetuity to such use.&quot; 

<p>Lincoln Center has undergone a huge nearly campus-wide renovation recently, and Fisher&apos;s daughter Nancy told the Times, &quot;I watched as the campus started to change. It invited the public in, it didn&#x2019;t look so forbidding and formal anymore,&quot; adding that &quot;the new energy generated by the renovated spaces at Lincoln Center had pointed up Avery Fisher Hall&#x2019;s mustiness.&quot;</p>

<p>Avery Fisher will still be a part of the concert hall, with many tributes, including induction into the new Lincoln Center Hall of Fame:</p>
