<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_wsjnyt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811111233im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_wsjnyt.jpg" width="90" height="112" class="image-right"> </span>Since Rupert Murdoch reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811111233/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/_rupert_murdoch_wants_to.php">has an &quot;Ahab-like obsession&quot; to destroy</a> the NY Times and is rolling out a New York region section in the Wall Street Journal, the Times is apparently leaving nothing to chance.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811111233/http://www.observer.com/2010/media/its-war-kate-taylor-quits-journal-join-times">Observer reports</a> that Journal arts reporter Kate Taylor quit and is joining the Times: &quot;Up until [Thursday], two sources said that Ms. Taylor was in the office making phone calls and sourcing up in anticipation of the New York section&apos;s launch next month. The Times, which has been under a hiring freeze for years, is clearly sending The Journal a signal by poaching one of its earliest hires.&quot; However, Times cultural editor Jon Landman claims the paper was interested in Taylor for &quot;some time... You can&apos;t have too many good reporters.&quot;  But one WSJ source said, &quot;People here are fucking furious. She knows all the plans.&quot;</p>
