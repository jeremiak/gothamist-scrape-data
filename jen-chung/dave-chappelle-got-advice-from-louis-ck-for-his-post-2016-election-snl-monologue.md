<p>Dave Chappelle&apos;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em> monologue was like a salve for the part of the nation that watches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320200505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donald-trump-attacks-snl-again-bad-television-964447">&quot;really bad television&quot;</a> and felt shocked by the presidential election. Now it turns out that the comedian was nervous about it.</p>

<p>The show that Chappelle hosted was on November 12, days after the election. In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320200505/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/arts/television/dave-chappelle-on-trump-cosby-and-his-netflix-deal.html">interview with the Times</a>, Chappelle revealed:</p><blockquote>At a certain point [on election night], we were all in the writers&#x2019; room, and as the night went on, and Trump was picking up these Electoral [College] votes, everyone stopped writing. And then everyone was just staring at the TV. I saw people tear up sketches they were writing. They&#x2019;d assumed Hillary was going to win. Now there was essentially no show on Saturday. It was like the wind got knocked out of the writers&#x2019; room. I was really worried.</blockquote>The Times interviewer, Dan Hyman, notes, &quot;And yet you delivered a humorous, poignant monologue reflecting your equal parts hope and fear for the future,&quot; to which Chappelle replied, &quot;The best advice I got was from Louis C.K. I went to a comedy club Friday night [before the show] and saw him. And Louis told me: &apos;[Forget] the rest of the show. The monologue is all that matters.&apos; I was stressed out all that day. But right before I went onstage, this calm just washed over me. Everything just felt right.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In the monologue, Chappelle touched upon the country&apos;s mood through the lens of race relations, &quot;You know, I didn&apos;t know Donald Trump was going to win the election. I did suspect it. It seemed like Hillary was doing well in the polls, and yet I know the whites, you guys aren&apos;t as full of surprises as you used to be.&quot;</p>

<p>Netflix will release two of Chappelle&apos;s comedy specials next week; the streaming entertainment service paid him $60 million for a total of three. One of them, <em>Deep In the Heart of Texas</em>, was filmed in 2015, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320200505/http://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/dave-chappelle-netflix-comedy-specials-deep-in-the-heart-of-texas-and-the-age-of-spin-review-1202010809/">according to Variety</a>, &quot;One of the opening bits... finds Chappelle riffing on a moment in which a white man threw a banana peel at him. It&#x2019;s a &apos;tough time for the blacks,&apos; he says, which is one reason he thanks Muslim Americans and Mexicans for taking some of the heat off African-Americans.&quot;</p>
