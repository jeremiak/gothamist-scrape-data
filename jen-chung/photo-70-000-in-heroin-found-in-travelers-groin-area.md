<p>While it&apos;s no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142042/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/07/jfk_coke_goat.php#photo-1">cocaine stuffed into frozen goat meat</a>, U. S. Customs and Border Protection announced it arrested a man who was caught smuggling heroin into the country through JFK Airport. What tipped them off? Well, the guy &quot;exhibited numerous signs of nervousness.&quot;</p>

<p>On April 1, Bernard Charles, a Trinidad and Tobago citizen, arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport from Port of Spain, Trinidad. After seeing his anxious behavior while they searched his suitcase, CPB officers took him to a private room where &quot;they discovered two clear packages in the subject&#x2019;s groin area. The two packages contained a brown paste-like substance that tested positive for heroin.&quot;</p>

<p>A total of 1.79 pounds of heroin was found, and it&apos;s reportedly worth more than $70,000.</p>
