</div></div>					<p>The nearly 2,000-mile journey that a little calico cat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303004429/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/wow_missing_colorado_cat_found_in_n.php">made from Colorado to the Big Apple has captured everyone&apos;s imagination</a>&#x2014;even Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s!  During a press conference yesterday, Bloomberg was asked about Willow, the cat found on a Manhattan street who turned out to be a cat who went missing five years ago from her Colorado family&apos;s home.  Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303004429/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/09/15/just-another-cat-trying-to-make-it-in-new-york/?mod=google_news_blog">waxed philosophic</a>, &#x201C;<strong>I think what it does show is that everybody, in the end, wants to come and live in New York.</strong> Now, cats reputedly have nine lives, and [Willow] clearly wanted to spend at least one of them here in New York City. I just don&#x2019;t know what [she] was waiting for.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Willow escaped from the Squires family in Colorado when a door was left open during a renovation project.  The family thought a coyote ate her, so they were shocked when NYC&apos;s Animal Care and Control called to say their cat was in Manhattan (apparently a man found Willow on East 20th Street and brought her to a shelter, where her microchip was found).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303004429/http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2011/09/15/willow_colorado_cat_found_in_new_york_likely_had_human_care_.html">ACC&apos;s Julie Bank says Willow</a> most likely had human care, since the feline wasn&apos;t injured, &#x201C;Instead, she&#x2019;s chunky. She&#x2019;s got weight on her. Her coat looks good. No fleas, no injuries. She&#x2019;s been fed.&#x201D;   <b>Update September 16</b>:  It appears that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303004429/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/16/willow_the_cat_continues_to_charm_b.php#photo-1">Willow left Colorado...by plane (and some human help)</a>.  </p>

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303004429/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/nyregion/theories-on-cats-trip-from-colorado-to-new-york.html">NY Times offers the leading </a>theories: Maybe she walked (but why go somewhere she didn&apos;t know? how did she get across the Mississippi?); maybe she hitched a ride via car or train; or, most likely, maybe someone just scooped her up in Colorado and brought her to New York.</p>

<p>Willow will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303004429/http://www.andersoncooper.com/2011/09/15/colorado-cat-makes-anderson-appearance/">appearing on Anderson Cooper&apos;s new daytime talk show</a>. In a preview of the segment, Cooper virtually reunited Willow with her family:</p>
