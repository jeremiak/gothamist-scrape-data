Victor Cubero, an alleged member of the Latin Kings, was in court yesterday &quot;where he threw a temper tantrum after court officers prevented him from talking with family members,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172628/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/robber_has_short_fuse_PuiYhOTPTx4IDqzzgaXriK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">according to the Post</a>.<p></p>

<p>On December 15, Jin Jin Chen, 22, was sent by his bosses at King Food Chinese on Graham Avenue to deliver three orders of sesame chicken, some roast pork and a bottle of Sprite to an apartment at the Bushwick Houses. Chen dialed the phone number given with the order four times, but no one answered&#x2014;and then he was attacked.  Police believe that Cubero placed the order with the intention of robbing Chen and became angry when Chen ignored him, shooting him five times.</p>

<p>Chen, who survived the shooting but is partially paralyzed, told the Post, &quot;Because the robber is small-framed, I thought he was just a kid&quot;&#x2014;Cubero is just 5 feet tall.  Chen also said, &quot;<strong>When he showed me a gun, I didn&#x2019;t take it seriously. I thought it was a toy, and just walked away</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>After being taken out of the courtroom during his outburst, Cubero &quot;broke down in tears and unleashed a litany of profanities as he was placed in a holding cell,&quot; the Post&apos;s sources say.</p>
