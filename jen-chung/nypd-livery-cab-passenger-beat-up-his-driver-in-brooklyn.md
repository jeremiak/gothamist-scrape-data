Upon reaching the destination of Gates Avenue and Throop Avenue the person of interest exited the cab and approached the driver from the driver&apos;s side front door and demanded money from the driver. The suspect proceeded to open the car door and pulled the driver out and began to assault punching the victim about the face and striking the victim several times with an unknown object.&quot;</p>
