										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="2010_04_stvin3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523204925im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_04_stvin3.jpg" width="250" height="171"> <br> <i>(AP)</i></div> St. Vincent&apos;s Hospital, which is winding down its operations before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523204925/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/07/greenwich_villages_st_vincents_hosp.php">it closes for good</a>, delivered its last baby.  Abigail Jancu was born at 4:58 a.m. yesterday morning, about 18 hours after parents Anastasia and Robert Juncu checked into the hospital.  Their midwife called to let them know they would need to come on Wednesday at 9 a.m. to deliver the baby.  Robert Jancu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523204925/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/before-the-doors-close-delivering-one-last-baby/">told City Room</a>, &quot;They said, if you come here early in the morning, we&#x2019;ll get you in, but we&#x2019;re closing down.&quot;<p></p>

<p>He also said the birthing center was deserted, &quot;The sad thing is the nurses on the floor are all saying goodbye to each other. A lot of them have worked together for decades. Every time I go out of the room, I see people saying, &#x2018;Goodbye, maybe I&#x2019;ll see you, maybe I won&#x2019;t.&#x2019; People don&#x2019;t have jobs. There&#x2019;s a glut in New York hospitals now with St. Vincent&#x2019;s people streaming in.&quot;  And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523204925/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/closing_belle_at_st_vinny_45fY6BLieCDK0tlFRfYNYM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a>, &quot;Someone later gave him two packs of diapers, saying it was better to give them away rather than have them taken by the bankruptcy court.&quot;</p>

<p>The comments section on City Room has people remembering their experience with the hospital&#x2014;one reads, &quot;Thank you St. Vincent&#x2019;s for once helping save my daughter&#x2019;s life. We will miss you.&quot;</p>
