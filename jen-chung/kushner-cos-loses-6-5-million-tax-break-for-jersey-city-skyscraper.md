					<p>One Journal Square, the Jersey City skyscraper that White House adviser Jared Kushner&apos;s family marketed to wealthy Chinese investors as a way to get U.S. visas, will probably need more money: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609175444/https://www.wnyc.org/story/kushner-jersey-city-project-about-lose-65-million-annual-tax-credit/">WNYC reports</a>, &quot;A $6.5 million annual tax credit attached to its erstwhile anchor tenant, WeWork, is about to be revoked.&quot;</p>

<p>WeWork had been planning on bring both their co-working and co-living brands to the $400 million tower. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609175444/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-08/kushner-project-touted-by-sister-in-china-is-in-trouble-at-home">According to Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;Kushner and [partner] KABR were each slated to own one fourth of the WeWork tower, according to the request to the development authority. WeWork would own the remainder. But $59 million in tax breaks were tied to WeWork&#x2019;s occupying and operating the building as a technology incubator&#x2014;not merely owning it. A spokesman for WeWork declined to comment.&quot;</p>

<p>WNYC reported that &quot;WeWork, which had entered into a 50-50 partnership with Kushner Companies for the project, missed a May deadline for extending its state tax credit. &apos;By not submitting the required documents or requesting an extension by the deadline, the company did not meet the terms of its approval,&apos; a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Virginia Pellerin, said in an email... [T]here&#x2019;s no guarantee that any future tenant would get the $6.5 million in tax breaks, further squeezing the building&#x2019;s finances.&quot;</p>

<p>A Kushner Cos. spokesman told WNYC, &quot;We&apos;re fully confident that we will receive all approvals required to build One Journal Square in a neighborhood sorely in need of a revitalizing project like ours, providing nearly 4,000 union construction jobs, a memorial plaza and $180 million in tax revenue for Jersey City over the next 30 years.&quot;</p>

<p>Jared Kushner led Kushner Cos. until he became part of his father-in-law President Donald Trump&apos;s administration. Last month, his sister Nicole Meyer was in Beijing to promote the Journal Square in hopes of raising $150 million in financing, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609175444/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/world/asia/jared-kushner-sister-nicole-meyer-china-investors.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">the NY Times explained</a>, &quot;The money would be provided through a much-criticized government program known as EB-5 that awards foreign investors a path to citizenship in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects.&quot; </p>
