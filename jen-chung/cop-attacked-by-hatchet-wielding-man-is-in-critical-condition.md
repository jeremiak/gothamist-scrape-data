<p>The police officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211085213/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/23/man_with_hatchet_killed_four_cops_w.php">who was struck in the head multiple times</a> by a hatchet-wielding man yesterday is in critical but stable condition. Officer Kenneth Healey, who has been with the NYPD for just four months, is at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211085213/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/10/23/police-officer-injured-suspect-shot-in-queens/">a witness said</a>, &#x201C;The cop was bleeding, like, pretty horribly.&quot;</p>

<p>The attack occurred at the intersection of Jamaica Avenue and 162nd Street in Queens, right around 2 p.m. Police say that a freelance photographer had asked four uniformed police officers from the 103rd Precinct &quot;to pose for a picture. As the officers were standing together, a male, who has not yet been positively identified, charged at the officers with a hatchet in his hand. Unprovoked and not speaking a word, the male then swung at one of the officers with the hatchet, striking his right arm. After striking that officer, the suspect continued swinging the hatchet, striking a second officer [Healey] in his head causing him to fall to the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>The two other officers opened fire on the suspect who fell to the ground and died from his injuries. The cops&apos; shooting hit a 29-year-old female pedestrian in the back, who is now recovering from surgery. The police released video of the suspect, who was identified by the Post and Daily News as 32-year-old Zale Thompson. </p>

A Zale Thompson on Facebook is pictured wearing a keffiyeh and had a recent terrorism-related conversation with one of his Facebook friends, according to a police source... It&#x2019;s not believed that the photographer who asked the cops to pull together was working with Thompson, [Police Commissioner] Bratton said.&quot;</p>

<p>Police also released a photograph of the hatchet, describing it as a metal tool, &quot;approximately 18 and &#xBD; inches in length.&quot;</p>

<p>Healey&apos;s skull was fractured in the attack, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211085213/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/new-york-police-fatally-shoot-man-who-attacked-officer-with-a-hatchet.html?ref=nyregion">the NY Times</a> talked to a witness who said: &quot;&apos;His head was split open from here to here,&apos; said Mick Jones, 52, tracing a finger from his forehead to the back of his head. &apos;His hat probably saved his life.&apos;&quot; </p>
