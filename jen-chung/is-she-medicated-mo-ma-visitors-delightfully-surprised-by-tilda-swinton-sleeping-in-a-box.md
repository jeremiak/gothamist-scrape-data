</div></div>					<p>&quot;I saw her,&quot; Christine McKinney told us, &quot;and I thought, <strong>&apos;You&apos;re an Oscar winner&#x2014;what are you doing in a box</strong>?&quot; </p>

<p>McKinney was standing a few feet from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152402/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/photos_tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_in.php">glass-and-steel box where actress Tilda Swinton was sleeping</a> for her 1995 piece, &quot;The Maybe,&quot; at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152402/http://moma.org/">Museum of Modern Art</a>. Swinton&apos;s performance art was an unexpected treat and conversation piece for the museum&apos;s visitors yesterday. &quot;The Maybe&quot; involves Swinton lying in the glass box on top of a mattress, with just her glasses and a carafe of water, for the MoMA&apos;s operating hours, which were 10:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. on Saturday. (<b>Update</b>: Swinton is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152402/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/25/tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_at_moma_a.php#photo-1">at the MoMA on Monday, March 25, for another performance</a>!)</p>

<p>McKinny was visiting from Ohio&#x2014;she was accompanying a youth choir on a trip to New York&#x2014;and said that their group was at the museum because they had time before seeing a Broadway musical (Cinderella). She recognized Swinton immediately, though she couldn&apos;t remember that <em>Michael Clayton</em> was the film she won an Oscar for&#x2014;but then McKinney&apos;s instincts as a nurse kicked in: &quot;I&apos;m wondering is she medicated... doesn&apos;t she need to go to the bathroom&#x2014;is there a pad?&#x2014;and did she dehydrate herself beforehand... <strong>I&apos;m also thinking about blood clots.</strong>&quot; In spite of all that, she was still very excited to see her.</p>

<p>Concern for Swinton was an overwhelming theme&#x2014;many museum visitors kept wondering how she would go to the bathroom&#x2014;as was admiration for how rigorous it must be staying prone in the box all day. But Michele Keller, of New York, also wondered if she was medicated. She felt &quot;confused&quot; and unsure how she should feel about the work because there was no artist&apos;s statement. But Vincent Martinez, of Queens, thought it was wonderful, noting how it was &quot;so bold&quot; for her to put herself out there like that.</p>

<p>&quot;The Maybe,&quot; part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152402/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/tilda_swintons_moma_performance_art.php">MoMA&apos;s effort to share &quot;historic&quot; performance art</a>, will be staged about six more times this year&#x2014;each time &quot;unannounced and in a different location in the Museum.&quot; Yesterday&apos;s staging was a serendipitous boon to those enjoying other parts of the institution. Pablo Johannsson and Claire Cutting had just seen the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152402/http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1319">Henri Labrouste exhibit</a> when they saw the crowd around the box&#x2014;Johannson thought Swinton was &quot;brilliant&quot; and noted how difficult and physically challenging the performance must be. He added that it made sense for her to do this, since she does edgier films.</p>

<p>New Yorker Helmut, who had taken his family to see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152402/http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1291">Invention Abstraction</a>, thought &quot;The Maybe&quot; was interesting&#x2014;and he knew recognized Tilda Swinton in the box. His 13-year-old son said, &quot;I knew it was her immediately&quot;&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152402/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ghnA3-IqX8">The Chronicles of Narnia</a> fan, we gather!</p>
