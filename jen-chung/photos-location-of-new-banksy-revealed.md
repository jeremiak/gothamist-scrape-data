</div></div>					<p>Street art aficionados, rejoice: Banksy is back in town and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://www.banksyny.com/home/index">according to his website</a>, he&apos;s &quot;attempting to host an entire show on the streets of New York.&quot;</p>

<p>His website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://banksy.co.uk/">banksy.co.uk</a>, redirects to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://www.banksyny.com/home/index">banksyny.com</a>. The show seems to be called &quot;Better Out Than In: An artists residency on the street of New York&quot; and a Paul Cezanne quote is featured, &quot;All pictures painted inside, in the studio, will never be as good as those done outside.&quot; There&apos;s also an 800 number for people to call&#x2014;800-656-4271&#x2014;where they can enter the number next to the pieces for more information (it&apos;s predictably tongue-in-cheek).</p>

<p>This piece, which is referred to as &quot;The street is in play,&quot; is in Chinatown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://www.streetartnews.net/2013/10/banksy-new-street-art-in-chinatown-new.html#more">per Street Art News</a>. Gothamist&apos;s resident street art expert Jake Dobkin said, &quot;This is exciting&#x2014;there hasn&apos;t been any good street art in New York in a while.&quot; Pointing to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://www.grafrank.com/nycindex.html">GrafRank of NYC</a>, Dobkin added, &quot;You can see it&apos;s been pretty quiet. Some Shiro and Hottea, but nothing major.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/28/banksy_loves_new_york_the_completed.php">Banksy completed a huge mural in Soho</a> and had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/09/banksys_village_pet_store.php#photo-1">show in a pet store in the West Village</a>. In 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/banksy_arrives_in_new_york.php#photo-1">he hit New York again</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/banksy_gets_dissed.php#photo-1">was soon dissed</a>!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We checked out the area, and can confirm the piece is on Allen Street between Hester and Canal. Gothamist in-house graffiti expert Jake Dobkin explains, &quot;The goal of this coverage is to blow up Banksy&apos;s spots as quickly as possible so local graffiti artists can go tag them.&quot;</p>

<p><b>UPDATE 2, October 2:</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/photos_banksys_lower_east_side_piec.php#photo-1">Well, it&apos;s been dissed</a>. </p>

<p>The artist/manipulator, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051253/http://laist.com/2013/09/24/banksy_rumored_to_be_back_in_los_an.php">has a new piece in LA</a>, is extremely mysterious. However, this is was one rumored photograph of him from 2010:</p>
