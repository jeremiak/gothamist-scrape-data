</div></div><p>A man was arrested today after the police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308041944/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/03/07/officials-bomb-squad-police-investigating-potentially-explosive-devices-found-in-l-i-home/">discovered a cache of weapons, explosives, and pot</a> in a Woodmere home.  Nassau County  Police Chief Steven Skrynecki said, &quot;The search revealed 15 destructive devices, specifically pipe bombs. Fifteen improvised grenades, approximately 100 handguns, 20 long guns, approximately 50 pounds of ingredients that could be used to make explosives. There was enough explosive material in there to level that house and possible the entire block.&quot; Which is why his neighbors were evacuated while the police searched Marc Ringel&apos;s house.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308041944im_/http://gothamist.com/upload/2012/03/2012_02_lib1.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308041944/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cops-woodmere-home-filled-with-firepower-1.3584766">According to Newsday,</a> &quot;The incident, which began when Fourth Precinct police officers responded to a panic alarm set off by Ringel Tuesday afternoon, turned into an evacuation of the area after those officers found a handgun and two hand grenades inside the residence. Police said that came after officers detected &apos;the strong smell&apos; of marijuana emanating from the house.&quot;</p>

<p>When cops arrived, Ringel was in the driveway.  They asked him for ID: &quot;Ringel gave police a credit card, but an officer said that was not sufficient, Lack said. The man said that was his only ID, but that he had a key to the house. The man and police went to the house and [Deputy Inspector Kenneth] Lack said the man opened the door about halfway -- which was when police spotted the handgun and grenades.&quot;  </p>

<p>Ringel&apos;s parents own the home; Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano described Ringel as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308041944/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Police-Marijuana-Greenhouse-Weapons-Arsenal-Long-Island-Marc-Ringel-141768183.html">&quot;a potential madman.&quot;</a>  He does not have any known ties to terrorism and is a divorced high school graduate.</p>
