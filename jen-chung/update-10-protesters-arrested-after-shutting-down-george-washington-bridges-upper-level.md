<p>The group that is protesting appears to be using the hashtags #SomosVisible and #WeAreVisible. We received an email from a group early this morning saying, &quot;7AM Direct Action near Upperwest TODAY 10/26, several will be arrested,&quot; and explaining, &quot;We are a Grassroots Autonomous Movement campaigning for the right of every member of our communities to be visible, to be able to take part in the decision making process that affect our communities in our &apos;democratic&apos; system, and for the ability to determine our destinies. </p>

<p>&quot;We are one with Mother Earth and with all oppressed people in the shadows. We are getting arrested to make our struggles, our pain and our POWER#Visible. Join us Wednesday October 26 to be seen! #SomosVisible.&quot; (Somos means &quot;we are&quot; in Spanish.)</p>

<p>A group using that hashtag and slogan (Somos Visible) is also staging a rally in Union Square Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324035848/https://m.facebook.com/events/207755879648984">tonight</a> at 6 p.m. That event was organized by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324035848/http://laundryworkerscenter.org/">Laundry Workers Center</a>, a group whose website says it &quot;provides community-based leadership development to improve the living and working conditions of low wage laundry, warehouse, and food service workers in New York City and New Jersey.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Laundry Workers Center co-director Mahoma L&#xF3;pez said in a statement, &quot;The immigrant community is tired of being in the shadows. For many years we are here, we contribute, we pay taxes, we build this country, but in the end, we don&#x2019;t have the right to participate in the decisions at the local and national levels. ... We demand the right to vote and take part in the decisions in our communities.&quot;<br>
