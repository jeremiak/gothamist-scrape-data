<p>The upcoming <em>Shakespeare in the Park</em> season starts in just a few weeks, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020231/https://www.publictheater.org/Tickets/Calendar/PlayDetailsCollection/SITP/Julius-Caesar/"><em>Julius Caesar</em></a> will begin previews on May 23. And then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020231/https://www.publictheater.org/Tickets/Calendar/PlayDetailsCollection/SITP/A-Midsummer-Nights-Dream/?SiteTheme=Shakespeare"><em>A Midnsummer NIght&apos;s Dream</em></a> will start previews on July 11.</p>

<p>The Public Theater&apos;s artistic director Oskar Eustis is directing <em>Julius Caesar</em>,  which runs through June 23. The last time the play was seen in Central Park was 17 years ago, and, in 1987, Al Pacino played Brutus:</p>

<p>The Public Theater describes the play, &quot;Rome&#x2019;s leader, Julius Caesar, is a force unlike any the city has seen. Magnetic, populist, irreverent, he seems bent on absolute power. A small band of patriots, devoted to the country&#x2019;s democratic traditions, must decide how to oppose him. Shakespeare&#x2019;s political masterpiece has never felt more contemporary.&quot;</p>

<p>In this production, Caesar is played by Gregg Henry and Corey Stoll will be Marcus Brutus; other cast members include Elizabeth Marvel as Anthony, John Douglas Thompson as Caius Cassius, and Robert Gilbert as Octavius. </p>
