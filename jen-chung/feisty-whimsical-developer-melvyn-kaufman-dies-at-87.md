</div></div><p>While you may not know the name &quot;Melvyn Kaufman,&quot; if you&apos;ve walked or worked around Midtown or downtown, you probably know some of the buildings he developed&#x2014;because many make sure they give something back to the public.  For instance, at 777 Third Avenue, there&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234329/http://culturenow.org/entry&amp;permalink=01765&amp;seo=Big-Red-Swing_Theodore-Ceraldi">Big Red Swing</a> by Theodore Ceraldi, which is a big red swing for people to sit on. And on 77 Water Street&apos;s roof, there&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234329/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/revisiting_the_77_water_street_runw.php">model of the World War I biplane</a> that sits on a runway to amuse others. These and many others were the brainchild of Kaufman, who died on March 18 at age 87.</p>

<p>The architecture critic Paul Goldberger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234329/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/17/arts/architecture-view-at-17-state-street-high-tech-passes-into-the-vernacular.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">once called Kaufman</a> &quot;the man who has made a virtual mission out of making the New York skyscraper entertaining&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234329/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/nyregion/melvyn-kaufman-developer-who-shaped-manhattans-streetscape-dies-at-87.html">NY Times has an obituary</a> that is riveting to anyone interested in commercial architecture as well as the place that public space occupies in NYC:</p><blockquote>Mr. Kaufman had a lifelong fascination with office buildings as public spaces with which tenants and passers-by could engage. If one was going to erect a leviathan, his design philosophy seemed to go, at least make it leviathan with levity.<p></p>

<p>He deplored lobbies, the sine qua non of office buildings since the dawn of recorded history. &#x201C;Marble and travertine mausoleums are bad for the living and terrific for the dead,&#x201D; Mr. Kaufman told The Times in 1971.</p>

<p>Many of his buildings did away with traditional lobbies, employing set-back entrances from which wide public spaces extended to the street. These spaces were no mere plazas, but fields on which some of the buildings&#x2019; most conspicuous design elements were played out.</p></blockquote>Next to 767 Third Avenue, there&apos;s a huge, three-story-high chessboard: &quot;the board is visible to tenants in the rear, as well as to passers-by on East 48th Street. On it, games &#x2014; often re-creations of historic matches &#x2014; are played out in slow sequence, with pieces moved weekly by a worker in a cherry picker.&quot; As for 77 Water&apos;s biplane, &quot;He put it there, parked on a &apos;runway&apos; that lights up at night, he said, to spare tenants in surrounding office towers from having to look down upon water tanks and air-conditioning systems.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Kaufman was also behind 17 State Street, a curving, reflective glass building near the Staten Island Ferry terminal (Goldberg wrote of it, &quot;The building is a kind of high-tech version of a lighthouse, standing almost at the edge of the sea&quot;).  And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234329/http://www.thecityreview.com/plazas.html">City Review says</a> his &quot;wildest midtown building is 747 Third Avenue, which has undulating sidewalks, shown below, a plastic phone booth, a wooden platform entrance, a statue of a naked woman between the revolving doors and exposed ductwork in the lobby.&quot;  (The undulating sidewalks are scheduled to be replaced with a flat, normal plaza.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234329/http://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/financial-district/200-water-street/45791">The City Review also noted</a>, &quot;Melvyn Kaufman, the feisty, irascible, and delightful philosopher-developer of the two brothers, believed vehemently that buildings should do something for the public.&quot;</p>
