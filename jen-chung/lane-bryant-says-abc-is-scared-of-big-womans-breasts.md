At least that&apos;s what Lane Bryant claims, the model, Ashley Graham, (size 16, 38D) said, &quot;The first thing I thought of was Victoria&#x2019;s Secret commercials, and how they&#x2019;re just as racy, if not more racy, than Lane Bryant.... [The models are] just a lot smaller than what I am. <strong>[ABC] can&#x2019;t handle bigger on TV, bigger boobs on a normal-sized woman on TV.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>ABC fires back, saying that it tried working with the retailer but Lane Bryant is just trying to get more publicity.   Lane Bryant admits that it was offered later time slot&#x2014;but only if the commercial was edited; a spokeswoman said, &quot;We&#x2019;ve never witnessed this level of content censorship.&quot; Well, if this was a ploy for publicity, it&apos;s working&#x2014;check out the ad:</p>
