Koch, the richest man in NYC with a net worth of $17 billion, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116082236/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/arts/10linc.html?ref=arts">donating $100 million</a> towards the renovation of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center.  The City Opera and New York City Ballet perform in the space, and Koch told the NY Times, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been going to the New York State Theater for 40 years. I can assure you, I would not make a gift of this magnitude unless I was absolutely convinced that the quality of the work was world class.&#x201D;  Other parts of Lincoln Center are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116082236/httphttp://www.lincolncenter.org/load_screen.asp?screen=transforming">currently under renovation</a>.</p>
