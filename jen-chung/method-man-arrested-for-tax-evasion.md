										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_methman.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126152033im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_methman.jpg" width="180" height="239" class="image-left"> </span>Method Man, a member of Staten Island&apos;s hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, was arrested yesterday for tax evasion.  He turned himself to the 120th Precinct and when he was taken to his arraignment, he used a copy of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; to cover his face.  Really&#x2014;video below.</p>

<p>Previously, Method Man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126152033/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/method_man_high_crime_a8aneAhSNxIdYCT3j0RJAP">told reporters</a>, &quot;Because I got high, I forgot to pay. It was stupid,&quot; but his lawyer said, &quot;I can assure you that he doesn&apos;t have a pot-smoking problem.&quot; Instead, the lawyer says people handling Method Man&apos;s finances were to blame&#x2014;we guess we&apos;ll have to wait until a &quot;Behind the Music&quot; for the real explanation.</p>
