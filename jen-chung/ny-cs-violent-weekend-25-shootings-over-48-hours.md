<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308182427/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/three_people_were_killed_in_separat.php">three people were reported dead after shootings</a> on Friday night into Saturday, three more were killed yesterday. All told, there were 25 shootings in 48 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308182427/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/25-people-shot-48-hours-article-1.1361388?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News</a>, Sunday&apos;s killings started early in the morning: </p><blockquote>Ivan Martinez, 21...was approached around 3:25 a.m. by a 20-year-old gunman and a woman at E. 139th St. near Brook Ave. in the Bronx, police said. The gunman shot Martinez once in the head and ran off with the woman. <p></p>

<p>In the second fatal attack, a man in his 40s was gunned down during an argument in East Harlem around 1:20 p.m. The victim, who has not been identified by police, was blasted multiple times in the torso on E. 105th St. near First Ave. Less than four hours later, Damien Powell, 25, was killed after he was shot in the chest outside the Albany Houses in Crown Heights, sources and witnesses said. The victim&#x2019;s mother collapsed at the scene, where shell casings littered the street, witnesses said.</p></blockquote>Then there were the just-as-brutal non-fatal shootings, like yesterday&apos;s triple shooting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308182427/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/triple_shooting_in_prospect_leffert.php">in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens</a> and the Friday night shooting of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308182427/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/02/11-yr-old_victim_of_bed-stuy_shooti.php">11-year-old girl who is now paralyzed</a>.

Everyone says that and it sounds trite but...&quot;<p></p>

<p>This past weekend was the first sweltering one this year, leading many to believe that heat and violence are correlated. A study by two Florida State professors found, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308182427/http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/hot-weather-violence/">Wired reported in 2011</a>, &quot;violence rose with temperature, but only to a point.&quot;</p>
