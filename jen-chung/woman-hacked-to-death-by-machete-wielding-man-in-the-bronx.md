<p>A 59-year-old woman died after being found with &quot;numerous lacerations to her body&quot; in the hallway of a Bronx building. Carmen Torres-Gonzalez was apparently talking outside her door at the Mott Haven Houses when a neighbor&apos;s son allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605064954/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-found-stabbed-death-bronx-apartment-complex-article-1.2507970">&quot;hacked her to death&quot; with a machete</a>.</p>

<p>The horrific killing took place around 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, at 383 141st Street, and Angel Feliz, 26, was arrested for murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605064954/http://nypost.com/2016/01/24/psychopath-hacked-off-womans-hand-before-stabbing-her-to-death/">According to the Post</a>, Feliz &quot;hacked off&quot; Torres-Gonzalez&apos;s hand and &quot;then fatally slit her throat with a machete.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed the attack was unprovoked.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605064954/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/nyregion/woman-59-is-killed-in-machete-attack-in-bronx.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">The NY Times reports a police official as saying</a>, &quot;She had lacerations to her neck, cheek, shoulder. She had a partially severed left hand and a completely severed right hand.&quot;</p>

<p>A neighbor told the Post it looked like <em>The Shining. </em>&quot;It looked like somebody just took a couple of buckets of red paint and poured it down the stairs. We have never seen so much blood... I heard her screaming. The screaming was really chilling.&quot;</p>

<p>Feliz, who lives on the same floor, was taken into custody after the killing and the machete was reportedly found in a stairwell. The Post adds that neighbors called him &quot;the mental guy.&quot;</p>
