<p>Since the MTA has officially started to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231074022/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/02/subway_benches.php">remove its wooden subway station benches</a> in favor of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231074022/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/wooden_benches.php">stainless steel ones</a>, the financially-troubled agency is trying to take advantage of nostalgia and ignorance by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231074022/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/a-conversation-piece-mta-sell-wooden-subway-benches-article-1.1024203">offering the wooden benches to the public for $650</a>.  We can see the ad now: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231074022/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/08/bedbugs_found_o.php">Bedbugs come free of charge</a>!&quot;</p>

<p>The MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231074022/http://www.mta.info/nyct/materiel/cursales.htm">sells its surplus items online</a>&#x2014;items currently for sale include &quot;BUS PARTS &amp; MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS, EXCESS&quot; and &quot;OFFICE FURNITURE&quot;&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231074022/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/wood_you_buy_mta_bench_yZHG53M0vcoZewMBnj2veO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said</a>, &quot;There&#x2019;s always a demand for subway memorabilia.&quot; And NYC Transit Assistant COO Mike Zacchea said, &quot;They&#x2019;re sort of iconic. They&#x2019;ve been around a long time. They&#x2019;re massive. I can see them sitting in a back yard being weathered for a couple more years and serving as a conversation piece.&quot; Which is true, but can&apos;t the MTA just sell new wooden benches to us?  Because are you really going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231074022/http://www.ehow.com/how_7552303_remove-cat-stains-smells-wood.html">soak the entire bench in vinegar</a>?</p>
