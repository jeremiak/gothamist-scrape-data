NotifyNYC issued an alert saying, &quot;All service on the Staten Island Ferry has been suspended in both directions due to severe weather conditions and high tides.&quot;  The suspension, ordered by the U.S. Coast Guard and captain of the docks ordered, began at 5:30 p.m., and the Staten Island Advance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172759/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/03/ferry_service_suspended_indefi.html">reports</a> the high winds are &quot;preventing the ferries from docking safely.&quot; Also, NotifyNYC says, &quot;The 911 system is experiencing a large volume of weather related calls. Callers who dial 911 to report an emergency are requested to stay on the line. The public should call 911 for emergencies only, and 311 for non-emergencies.&quot; We&apos;ll do a round of up the wild weather tomorrow morning&#x2014;let us know what you&apos;ve experienced in the comments below!</p>
