                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_08_tariturpin.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014834im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_tariturpin.jpg" width="190" height="259" class="image-right"> </span>The Port Authority Police have arrested someone for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014834/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/25/3_shot_at_jersey_citys_pavonia_path.php">shooting at the Pavonia PATH station</a> in Jersey City yesterday morning: Tari Turpin, 34, charged with aggravated assault, possession of a weapon, making terroristic threats, possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes, eluding, and possession of hollow point bullets in the incident which left three people, including himself, injured.</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that Turpin got into an argument with two people (possibly a brother and sister) on a PATH from Manhattan that was pulling into Newport. Turpin allegedly fired, and then fled. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014834/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/path_shooting_wounds_three_east_orange_man_charged.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Star-Ledger reports</a> that he was &quot;chased down by Port Authority Police Officers David Lennon and Patrick DeNardo, who caught him at a Pep Boys auto repair shop near the Newport Centre Mall, several blocks away... <strong>A law enforcement source said officers were led to Turpin by a trail of blood leading from the station to a nearby spot where he was hiding.</strong> The source said Turpin saw the officers approach and fled in the direction of the repair shop, before being caught.&quot;</p>

<p>The two others victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014834/http://cliffviewpilot.com/ex-con-chase-arrested-in-pavonianewport-path-shooting/">PA spokesman Joe Pentangelo said</a>, &quot;There were many witnesses.&quot;<br>
