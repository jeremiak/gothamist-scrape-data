<p>Have we got some uplifting content for you: A manager at a Long Island Best Buy shared this video of staffers giving a boy a WiiU gaming system because he kept visiting their store to play with the display model. </p>

<p>Rahiem Storr, who uploaded the video to YouTube, wrote, &quot;This video was taken in the Valley Stream Best Buy, this kid came in every single day to play the display WiiU, the employees in this store saw an opportunity to make a child smile and did just that. They chipped in and purchased a WiiU for him with their own money. This is amazing, why shop at Amazon when you have genuine people in this world that you can continue to help keep a job.&quot;</p>

<p>The video shows one Best Buy employee approaching the boy, carrying the console and explaining that it was a gift. The boy seems surprised and maybe even crying, and the employee says, &quot;No for real, this is for you.&quot; Also, there&apos;s a two-year warranty!</p>

<p>Storr added a comment to the YouTube page to face critics and clear up some misconceptions (he also appears to be a proud Best Buy employee):</p><blockquote>I have no idea how to use Reddit, I am actually a manager at Best Buy, update to the story is that he actually has two very loving parents at home. I have not been responding to the comments because some are just so hurtful. After purchasing the WiiU for him they actually drove him home where his parents were beyond welcoming. Thank you to everyone for offering up these donations. Whilst people have some horrible opinions about Best Buy associates I can not begin to express how wrong they actually are. I posted this to show otherwise, can&apos;t tell you how often I give people discounts or children that save money to buy items and come up a few dollars short. We are here to complete people&apos;s lives not take away from it. Been with the company for 10 years now and what our store did is why I continue to stay. The trolls I see on here make it hard sometimes as I deal with them in the store on a daily basis however it is what I signed up for and we all work through it.<p></p>

<p>Thank you again everyone. Continue to shop at Best Buy and keep us all employed so that we can continue to do things like this for people day in and out. Up vote that.</p>

<p>I know the trolls will eat this comment up and probably say some racist things like I saw on my YouTube however let me say this here it does not bother me one bit. I love everyone even the trolls hope that upsets you even more.&#xFEFF;</p></blockquote>God, why is it so dusty in here?<p></p>
