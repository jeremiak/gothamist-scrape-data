<p>The NYPD released video of a person suspected of sexually abusing a woman at 16th Street and 4th Avenue yesterday morning.  And one neighbor claims the cops let the suspect get away.</p>

<p>According to the police, a 22-year-old woman was walking just after 5 a.m. &quot;when the suspect approached her from behind, sexually abused her, and fled the scene. The victim refused medical attention on scene.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a Hispanic male in his 40s, about 5&apos;4&quot; tall and weighing 140 pounds.  He was wearing a red baseball cap, camouflage pants and carrying a shoulder bag. The police ask anyone with information to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS or submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427151126/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>

<p>However, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427151126/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/161815/police-investigating-park-slope-groping-incident">resident who witnessed the incident told NY1</a> that another neighbor &quot;chased the attacker to a nearby intersection but police let him go because the victim was no longer at the scene.&quot; Donald Harrington said, &quot;I was just (beep) off that the cops didn&apos;t do anything about the guy. I told them where the girl was and they just kept on going. They said they had no victim even though we called them back. We took the girl out, we spoke to the police and they said the guy didn&apos;t want to be questioned so they let him go.&quot;  </p>

That assailant is still at large.<br>
