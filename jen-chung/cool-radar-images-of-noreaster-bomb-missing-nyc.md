<p>As for the snow storm, it&apos;s hitting Cape Cod with 66 mph winds! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140328225854/http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/2014/03/ocean_storm_grazes_by_boston_b.html">Boston.com&apos;s David Epstein wrote</a>, &quot;This morning we find the big ocean storm intensifying rapidly as predicted. I think it&#x2019;s good thing this storm is so far offshore, as had it come a hundred miles closer I&#x2019;d likely have no power and be stuck inside all day. The size of this storm is dangerous and while I love a good snowstorm, this one had the potential to do some real damage and bring southern New England to a standstill. But, the storm isn&apos;t close to us so it&apos;s really a non-event for almost everyone.&quot;</p>
