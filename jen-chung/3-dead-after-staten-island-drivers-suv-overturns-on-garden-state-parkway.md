A 2003 Ford Expedition driven by Dimitrios &quot;Jimmy&quot; Iliopoulos, 54, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219062719/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/04/2011-07-04_three_teens_dead_four_wounded_when_staten_island_familys_suv_overturned_on_garde.html">&quot;swerved and then smashed into a right-hand guardrail&quot;</a> and &quot;overturned at least twice.&quot;  Iliopoulos&apos; sons Hlias, 18, and Chrystoph, 13, and their friend Eric Colligan, 15, were thrown from the SUV into the highway and died.  <p></p>

<p>Iliopoulos&apos;s wife Stavroula, 51, and daughter  Fontiny, 20, were also thrown from the vehicle while he and his daughter&apos;s fiance Vincent Whiteaker, 25, remained in the car. A neighbor told the Daily News,  &quot;It&apos;s a tragedy. I can&apos;t believe Jimmy has to bury his two sons.&quot; Whiteaker&apos;s grandfather said that Fontiny had a blood clot in her brain; his grandson was able to speak to her but didn&apos;t tell her that her brothers were killed yet. </p>

<p>Relatives said that Hilas Iliopoulos had just graduated from Fort Hamilton High School and was going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219062719/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/family_highway_horror_p6jnklkHRv4azZR67tEBdO">Apex Tech to learn to become a mechanic</a>. Colligan, who was the family&apos;s neighbor, was remembered as a gifted athlete while Chrystoph Iliopoulos was &quot;joined at the hip&quot; with his mother.  Dimitri Iliopoulos had owned a diner in Brooklyn and was opening one in New Jersey; a neighbor said they rarely took vacations, so the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219062719/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/staten_island_family_suv_flips.html">excursion to Atlantic City was unusual</a>.</p>
