His passenger, a 31-year-old woman, was also injured. </p>

<p>Yama Dastagirzada, the man who called 911, also told the News, that when he looked at the car, he &quot;saw a hand moving. I was going to try and turn off the ignition but the car was crushed from the top. I couldn&apos;t get in. The whole front end of the car was taken off.&quot;</p>
