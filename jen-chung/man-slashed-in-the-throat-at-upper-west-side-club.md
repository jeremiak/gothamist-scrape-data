<p>The incident occurred before 3 a.m. WABC 7 says there was a &quot;popping noise&quot; that prompted clubgoers to scatter while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041815/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Nightclub-Slashing-Upper-West-Side-Manhattan-Columbus-72-199509821.html">NBC New York</a> reports that there was an argument between the victim and the attacker by the door&#x2014;and the attacker used a broken bottle. </p>

<p>The NYPD has no information as this time. For context, here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041815/http://www.yelp.com/biz/columbus72-new-york#hrid:FeruBeDkNPyiLB1PbnsR_g">some Yelp background on the club</a>: &apos;I went to this place on 2 occasions, and to be honest this place is complete doo doo. In my opinion to me it&apos;s just a very fancy basement. Lets&apos; talk staff: First I don&apos;t get what&apos;s the deal with the pat downs by the a***sole bouncers over there. The moment I step inside that sh*thole I felt like a criminal. They don&apos;t even say anything to you they just grab you go through your pockets like you&apos;re entering the White House.&quot;</p>
