<p>Last night, actor, podcaster and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017054149/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/exclusive_alec_baldwin_witness.php">paparazzi target</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017054149/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> debuted his new MSNBC talk show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017054149/http://video.msnbc.msn.com/up-late-with-alec-baldwin/53260184">Up Late With Alec</a>. And his guest for the entire hour was Democratic mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio. Baldwin&#x2014;whose set looked like an upscale diner&#x2014;opened with: &quot;America&apos;s largest city has been run by a billionaire media mogul for the last 12 years. But that&apos;s about to change: My guest for the hour tonight is heavily favored to become the first Democrat in 20 years to serve as New York City&apos;s mayor. On issues such as stop-and-frisk and growing inequality, the entire country is watching to see whether Bill de Blasio will enact the progressive policies he&apos;s running on and whether they will work. He was a dark horse who ran to the left of the Democratic establishment&#x2014;telling a tale of two cities, the haves and have nots. Now facing his first debate with Republican challenger Joe Lhota next week, de Blasio is promising a real break from the Bloomberg era. I was an early supporter of his&quot; (Baldwin was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017054149/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/video_alec_baldwin_says_chrstine_qu.php">outspoken in his disdain for Christine Quinn</a>) &quot;but the question remains what can any mayor do about inequality on Wall Street&apos;s home turf.&quot;</p>

<p>The actor asked questions like whether de Blasio thinks Albany can pass his plan to tax those making more than $500,000/year to fund universal pre-K (de Blasio said yes)&#x2014;and, referring to de Blasio&apos;s courtship of wife Chirlane McCray, &quot;How&apos;d you close that deal?&quot; As for the popular ads showing his mixed-race family, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017054149/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/alec-baldwin-interview-bill-de-blasio-article-1.1483432">de Blasio said they showed a lot of &quot;warmth&quot;</a> and may be an &quot;indicator of a society that may be healing... It would be glorious one day to have a post-racial society.&quot;</p>
