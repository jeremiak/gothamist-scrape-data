<p>A 25-year-old off-duty NYC correction officer was killed while she was sitting in her car last night. Alastasia Bryan, who recently graduated from the correction academy, was found with gunshot wounds to her head and torso near East 73rd Street and Avenue L in Flatlands.</p>

<p>Police responded to a 911 call at 9:17 p.m., and found Bryan unconscious and unresponsive. EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. A &quot;dark colored Honda rolled up and began blasting... Five shots rang out and a single bullet struck the officer in the head, killing her instantly as the shooter sped away,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211151523/http://nypost.com/2016/12/04/off-duty-corrections-officer-fatally-shot-while-sitting-in-car/">according to the Post&apos;s sources</a>. </p>
