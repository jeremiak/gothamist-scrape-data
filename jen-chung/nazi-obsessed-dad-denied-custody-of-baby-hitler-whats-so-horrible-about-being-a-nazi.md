                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_05_babyhitler1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820230801im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_babyhitler1.jpg" width="640" height="438"> <br> <i> Baby Hitler&apos;s dad and another lady (NBC 10)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Heath Campbell, the Nazi-loving NJ man who named his children things like JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell, Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell, and yes, Adolf Hitler Campbell, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820230801/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52455014#.UeFvQz6Qdhp">lost his bid for custody</a> of his two-year-old son. His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820230801/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/heil_no_judge_denies_nazi_dad_visitation_w30i4mvHAkgSozhHgmlc1O?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">argument was</a>, &quot;Prisoners get to see their children, murderers get to see their children. What&#x2019;s so horrible about being a Nazi?&quot;</p>

<p>Campbell had been battling NJ authorities for custody of two-year-old Heinrich Hons Campbell and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820230801/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/photo_baby_hitlers_dad_wears_nazi_u.php">appeared in court in a Nazi uniform</a>. He already lost custody of JoyceLynn Aryan Nation, Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie and Adolf Hitler (they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820230801/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52455014#.UeFvQz6Qdhp">placed in foster care</a>).</p>

<p>This Nazi-superfan came into the public consciousness when he became outraged that a local Shop-Rite supermarket <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820230801/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/17/no_shoprite_cake_for_baby_hitler.php">refused to inscribe a birthday cake</a> for their son, Adolf Hitler Campbell, with &quot;Happy Birthday Adolf Hitler.&quot; Campbell had pointed out, &quot;There&apos;s a new president and he says it&apos;s time for a change. Well, then it&apos;s time for a change. They need to accept a name. A name&apos;s a name. The kid isn&apos;t going to grow up and do what [Hitler] did.&quot;</p>

<p>Campbell claims he&apos;ll appeal the decision. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820230801/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/nazi-obessed-dad-loses-custody-bid-son-article-1.1397222">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Campbell&apos;s fiancee, Bethanie Zito, is pregnant. She told the Daily News last month she was considering naming the child Eva Braun.&quot;</p>
