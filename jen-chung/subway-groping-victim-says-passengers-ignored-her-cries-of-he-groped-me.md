I kicked him in the face. I was just punching him.&quot; But in interviews with local news stations, Shyane DeJesus, revealed that no one paid attention to her when she went after the perv, &quot;I yelled out on the train, &#x2018;He groped me on the train! Watch out for this man,&#x2019;&#x201D; but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005426/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8417859">10 other people on the train</a> &quot;just blocked out the whole situation. They wouldn&apos;t come to help.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The incident occurred at October 23, around 9:30 a.m. DeJesus says at first the man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005426/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/11/03/you-go-girl-quick-thinking-college-student-that-snapped-pic-of-groper-speaks-out/?utm_source=home&amp;utm_medium=dl&amp;utm_campaign=you-go-girl">just rubbing up against but then</a> &#x201C;He just went for it. He grabbed my left shoulder, pushed my head forward, lifted my dress, groped me and from there I went crazy. I punched him in the face.&quot;  </p>

<p>After hitting him, the City College student said that she left at the next station but not before taking a picture: &quot;I held the door and positioned the phone in his face. I was shaking, I&#x2019;m surprised I got it. He smirked when I looked at him. He never said a word, not a word. All I got was that smirk.&quot;</p>

<p>Police are still looking for the suspect, described as Hispanic, and around 5&apos;10, 200 lbs. <br>
