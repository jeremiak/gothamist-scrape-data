<p>Police are investigating the death of a woman who was struck by a bullet last night. The victim may have just gone to a fast food restaurant, because she reportedly was holding a bag of food.</p>

<p>The incident, which is classified as a homicide, occurred around 5:30 p.m. yesterday, near 2012 Boston Road. According to the NYPD, officers responded to a 911 call and found a woman, identified as 48-year-old Cindy Diaz,&quot;on the ground with a gunshot wound to the torso and arm.&quot;</p>

<p>Diaz was taken to Saint Barnabas Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Police add that a male victim with a gunshot wound to his arm went to Jacobi Hospital on his own.</p>

<p>Sources tell NBC New York that the Diaz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184218/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Shot-and-Killed-While-Exiting-Subway-NYPD-409949325.html">had exited the West Farms 2/5 station</a> and &quot;appears to have been an innocent bystander in a shooting.&quot; </p>

A source told the paper, &quot;It looked like she was on her way home with food for her kids.&quot; The News suggests that the unnamed male victim who went to Jacobi was involved in the shooting. </p>

<p>No arrests have been made.</p>
