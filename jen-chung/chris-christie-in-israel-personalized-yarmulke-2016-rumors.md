</div></div><p>NJ Governor Chris Christie is visiting Israel right now and the whole trip has fueled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050318/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/n-gov-chris-christie-trip-israel-fuels-talk-presidential-run-article-1.1054835?localLinksEnabled=false">endless speculation</a> that he&apos;ll run for president in 2016.  But Christie said, &quot;This is something I&#x2019;ve wanted to do for a long time... Anything I do fuels speculation for a future bid. When I wake up in the morning it fuels speculation for a future bid. So I can&#x2019;t worry about that.&quot;  But should he worry when the Post&apos;s headline about his trip is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050318/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/the_whale_at_the_wall_oken1GUqPamnfVeZB6xgHL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=International">&quot;The whale in the wall&quot;</a>?  </p>

Republican lobbyist Steve Some told the Star-Ledger last week, &quot;We have lot of Holocaust survivors in New Jersey. And of course Jewish Federations are very active in the state. Any New Jersey governor who comes to Israel is treated with the utmost respect.&quot;  Christie&apos;s office also pointed out economic links to the country, which would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050318/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/inside_the_epic_park_slope_food_co-.php#photo-1">NEVER fly in Park Slope</a>.<p></p>

<p>Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050318/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/02/christie-arrives-in-israel-for-first-official-trip-overseas/">visited the Wailing Wall</a> and also wore a personalized &quot;Governor Christie&quot; yarmulke yesterday.  Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050318/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/gov_christie_meets_with_israel_1.html">he met with Israeli President Shimon Peres</a>, &quot;New Jersey stands with Israel in all of its endeavors and we wanted to show our friendship and fidelity with a visit here.&quot; Peres discussed Israel&apos;s high-tech workforce, &quot;There is no army in the world that can conquer science. There is no police force that can check the power of science. There is no custom that can block what is happening in the brain of a scientist.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie is also meeting with King Abdullah II in Jordan later this week.</p>
