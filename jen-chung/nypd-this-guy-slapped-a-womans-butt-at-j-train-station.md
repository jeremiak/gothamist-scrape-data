<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred last Friday, May 6th, at 6:30 p.m.: &quot;A 23-year-old female victim was walking up the &apos;J&apos; line escalator inside the Jamaica Center subway station when an unknown male approached her from behind and slapped her buttocks. The victim took a cell phone photo of the male after the incident occurred and exited to the street area.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect, who remained in the station, is described as being in his mid-30s and about 5&apos;9&quot; with brown hair and a goatee. He was last seen wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt and tan pants. <br>
 <br>
