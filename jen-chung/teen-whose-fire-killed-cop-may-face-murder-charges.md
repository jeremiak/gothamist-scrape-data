<p>Yesterday, the NYPD mourned the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/09/cop_may_be_brain_dead_after_injures.php">passing of Police Officer Dennis Guerra</a>, a 38-year-old married father of four, who died from the injuries suffered while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/06/two_cops_trapped_in_smoke-filled_el.php">responding to a fire in Coney Island</a>. Police Commissioner William Bratton said at a flag-lowering ceremony, &quot;We hold in our hearts and our prayers Police Officer Dennis Guerra, who passed away this morning at 6:50 a.m. and has given his life in the performance of his sworn duty to protect the public.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2014_03_dennisguerra.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_03_dennisguerra.jpg" width="257" height="321"> <br> <i style=" width:257px; ;display:block"> Dennis Guerra</i></div> Guerra and his partner, Officer Rosa Rodriguez, had gone to the 13th floor of 2007 Surf Avenue and when they emerged from the elevator, they were overcome by smoke from a burning mattress. It turns out the mattress was set on fire by a 16-year-old resident of the 12th floor, Marcell Dockery, who allegedly told investigators that he started the blaze <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/08/bored_teen_arson.php">because he was &quot;bored.&quot;</a> <p></p>

<p>Guerra went into cardiac arrest and, after being treated at a number of hospitals, died yesterday. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/nyregion/brooklyn-high-rise-fire.html?_r=0">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;For the Police Department, it was a sudden and stunning blow: the first death of an officer from fire in the line of duty in nearly three decades, and the first time one had been killed on the job in more than two years.&quot; </p>

<p>Dockery&apos;s alleged criminal behavior is being examined now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/nycha-firebug-death-record-evicted-article-1.1751647">According to the Daily News</a>, he was arrested in January and again in March, and these &quot;busts...could have made him eligible for eviction from his NYCHA apartment before the tragedy... NYCHA has authority to rid itself of tenants convicted of serious crimes like murder, rape, grand larceny, robbery, burglary and felony drug possession committed on its grounds. It can even evict after a mere arrest.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently the NYC Housing Authority is beginning eviction procedures against Dockery&apos;s mother. Neighbors have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/teen-bored-set-fire-injured-2-cops-article-1.1748337">said she&apos;s blameless</a>, with one telling the News, &quot;She goes to church all the time. Some kids just don&apos;t think, they don&apos;t pay attention to the consequences.&quot;</p>

<p>Dockery was charged with two counts of assault, reckless endangerment and arson, but it&apos;s expected he&apos;ll face murder charges. (The Brooklyn DA&apos;s office hasn&apos;t upgraded charges yet.)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-officer-responded-coney-island-fire-dies-article-1.1750442">Union president Patrick Lynch said</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s not a free ride, he should pay. He murdered a New York City police officer and we won&#x2019;t forget that.&quot;</p>

<p>Guerra, who had been in the NYPD for about eight years, lived in Far Rockaway; neighbor Rabbi Dovid Van Der Velde said, &quot;He was not just an officer. He was part of the community.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411222028/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-officer-responded-coney-island-fire-dies-article-1.1750442">Another neighbor said</a>, &quot;He was very involved with his family. This is horrible, a tragedy. It&#x2019;s very sad.&quot; A viewing is planned for Sunday, 2-9 p.m., at the  James Romanelli-Stephen Funeral Home on Rockaway Boulevard. The funeral mass on Monday at 11 a.m., at St Rose of Lima RC Church, 130 Beach 84th Street, in Rockaway Beach. </p>

<p>Here are Commissioner Bratton&apos;s full remarks; he reminded everyone that Officer Rodriguez is still battling &quot;carbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of severe smoke inhalation.&quot; </p><blockquote>We hold in our hearts and our prayers Police Officer Dennis Guerra, who passed away this morning at 6:50 a.m. and has given his life in the performance of his sworn duty to protect the public. He was 38 years old.<p></p>

<p>Police Officer Guerra leaves behind his wife, Cathy, and four children, Kathleen, 20; Jonathan, 17; Alyssa, 14; and Zachary, 7.</p>

<p>The death of a police officer as a result of an intentional act not only affects an individual, it is indeed a direct assault upon society as a whole. The entire city grieves this terrible loss. But we can take some measure of solace knowing that an arrest has been made in the arson that took Officer Guerra&#x2019;s life and critically injured his partner, Police Officer Rosa Rodriguez, who continues to battle carbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of severe smoke inhalation.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Police Officers Guerra and Rodriguez had just finished transporting a prisoner to Brooklyn Central Booking and were near 2007 Surf Avenue when 911 calls for help were made after a fire broke out on the 13th floor of the Coney Island Housing Development building. Arriving immediately, and before other first responders, the officers took an elevator to the 13th floor, where they intended to warn and evacuate tenants, if necessary. But as they emerged from the elevator the officers were overcome by the acrid smoke quickly filling the hallway.</p>

<p>In the pitch-black, fire personnel were able to rapidly locate both unconscious officers and enable their swift transport to area hospitals, where medical staff performed equally heroically. As a result, Police Officer Rodriguez remains in critical, although stable, condition at Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. Police Officer Guerra, however, succumbed to his injuries. It is a startling reminder that what can appear to be a routine assignment can very quickly become deadly. Police Officer Guerra gave his life trying to save others. And that is the ultimate selfless act.</p>

<p>The actions of Police Officers Guerra and Rodriguez exemplify the courage shown day in and day out by our police officers. On behalf of the New York City Police Department, I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Officer Guerra. It has been said that what we do for ourselves dies with us, but what we do for others and the world is immortal. Though his loss is devastating to us, and especially to his family, we know Dennis will always live on in his countless acts of generosity in the lives that he protected, and in the city he helped make safer. That was the mission to which Dennis devoted his life, and we are forever grateful for him.</p>

<p>William J. Bratton</p>

<p>Police Commissioner</p>
