<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="2012_04_suspuwsba.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120420074425im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_suspuwsba.jpg" width="250" height="289"> <br> <i>Suspect at Chase bank (DCPI)</i></div> Last week, the NYPD said that a woman approached another woman outside the the Chase Bank at Broadway and West 73rd Street, claiming she was a cop.  According to cops, the suspect, described as a black female in her 30s around 5&apos;5&quot; and 125-130 pounds, &quot;then removed the victim&apos;s wallet from her purse and removed the victim&apos;s Chase Bank debit card.&#xA0; The suspect then fled the location to parts unknown.&quot;  Now the police have updated with some new information: It seems the suspect is actually a man.<p></p>

<p>Police say that earlier on March 13 &quot;a man dressed as a woman, entered Harlem Hospital in the confines of the 32 Pct and identified himself as a police officer, displaying a shield and gained access to the administrative offices of the hospital. He did not remove any property before leaving the hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s video from the two incidents:</p>
