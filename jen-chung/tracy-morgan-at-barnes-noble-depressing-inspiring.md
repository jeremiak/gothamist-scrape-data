I wasn&apos;t expecting him to dance like a monkey, but neither was I expecting to leave the bookstore depressed... At one point, while talking about his father and his mother, he broke down crying,&quot; while another says, &quot;I left feeling slightly inspired. He spoke at length about how we need to interact more as a community, that we need to get off the computer and stop listening to our iPods and interact with fellow New Yorkers.&quot;</p>
