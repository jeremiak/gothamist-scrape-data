<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163536im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_05_nordawn.jpg" class="left">Trying to quell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163536/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/14/cruise_claims_m.php">speculation about a missing passenger&apos;s disappearance</a>, the Norwegian Cruise Line says there is surveillance video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163536/http://www.usatoday.com/travel/cruises/item.aspx?type=blog&amp;ak=49901604.blog">showing 46-year-old Mindy Jordan falling from the ship</a>.  Jordan fell overboard the Norwegian Dawn two hours after it left NYC, on its way to Bermuda.</p>

<p>Further, NCL says its surveillance video shows that Jordan, a NJ resident and registered nurse, was alone in her stateroom.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163536/http://www.wnbc.com/news/16267131/detail.html?dl=mainclick">cruise&apos;s timeline indicates</a> she and her boyfriend Jorge Caputo went into their cabin together at 7:28 p.m., with Caputo exiting a few minutes later to &quot;join the another couple in their cabin next door.&quot;  </p>

<p>Then, at 7:53 p.m., &quot;surveillance cameras from the exterior of the ship capture Mindy falling overboard from her balcony, straight into the water.&quot;  A call was made from the friends&apos; cabin, and Caputo is seen exiting their cabin for help.  The cruise has docked in Bermuda, where the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163536/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newjersey/ny-bc-nj--cruisepassengerov0514may14,0,47341.story">FBI is questioning witnesses</a>.</p>

<p>Jordan&apos;s family has been suspicious of her death, suggesting Caputo was an abusive boyfriend and questioning his nonchalance over the disappearance.  Caputo allegedly said Jordan was climbing over the rail--and that he tried to save her but couldn&apos;t. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163536/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/woman.overboard.death.2.724388.html">Cruise passengers said the sea was rough</a>, &quot;You couldn&apos;t even stand up.  The wind was just blowing and blowing and I can&apos;t imagine what they were doing up there, what led her to do something like that.&quot;</p>
