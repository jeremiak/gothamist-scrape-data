<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="2011_07_ospr.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614050157im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_ospr.jpg" width="350" height="268"> <br> <i>Fat American mobsters, by way of HBO</i></div> The best quote of the day is from the Daily News&apos; mob law enforcement source, who discusses the appointment of the new Gambino crime family boss. The ascension of Domenico Cefalu, a 64-year-old convicted drug trafficker who was born in Sicily and lives with his mother, &quot;marks a stunning break with the late John Gotti&apos;s infamous era,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614050157/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/the_mob/2011/07/29/2011-07-29_wiseguy_sicilian_the_capo_of_the_gambinos.html">according to the News</a>. And the source says, &quot;<strong>I think they picked a Sicilian because they&apos;re tired of the old, fat, lazy American Italians who turn into rats.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614050157/http://www.ganglandnews.com/">Gang Land News had reported</a> the news and offers this assessment of Cefalu: He has a &quot;well-earned reputation as a stand-up wiseguy who would never flip&quot; and is an &quot;old Bensonhurst, Brooklyn resident who was inducted into the crime family during John Gotti&#x2019;s reign. He served six years in prison for a 1982 heroin smuggling conviction, and 20 months behind bars for a 2008 extortion rap. He is now gainfully employed as a salesman for a local bakery.&quot;</p>

<p>Cefalu is on supervised release.</p>
