Now police have released a sketch of the suspect.</p>

<p>According to the police, at around 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, a 12-year-old boy (not 14, as the NYPD had previously told us) went into a bathroom at Pier 17 where he was approached by a man who sexually assaulted him. (One report said that the suspect performed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130702045057/http://www.metro.us/newyork/news/local/2013/06/26/boy-12-reports-sex-assault-in-south-street-seaport-bathroom/">oral sex on him for &quot;seconds&quot;</a>.)</p>

<p>The boy had been shopping with his grandmother and waited a while before telling her. When they contacted police, the police asked seaport security for surveillance footage&#x2014;only to be told surveillance cameras had been damaged from Hurricane Sandy. <br>
 <br>
The suspect is described a male, age 30-45, around 5&apos;7&quot;-5&apos;9&quot;, with a medium complexion and brown or grey hair with facial hair. He was last seen wearing a white shirt and grey sweatpants. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
