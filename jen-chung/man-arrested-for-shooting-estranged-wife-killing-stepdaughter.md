Olga Annarumma and her 25-year-old daughter, Valeria Kuzmina Lowery, were shot and police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174525/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/blog_of_blood_family_murder_QZFWYwFvIBbG0vUgw7M2BN">arrested Annarumma&apos;s estranged husband</a> Guerino Annarumma.  Lowery died from her injuries while her mother is in critical condition. The suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174525/http://annarumma.blogspot.com/">wrote on a blog</a> ranting at his wife, &quot;You are going to pay for whatever you did. I dont [sic] play no games. Good Luck, Bye Bye Bye.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The shooting occurred just before 9 a.m., and Guerino Annarumma was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174525/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/estranged-hubby-ranted-blog-god-pay-shot-wife-daughter-cops-article-1.987202">arrested a mile away, but no gun was found</a>. A witness described the handcuffed Annarumma, &quot;He was quiet, but he looked like a psycho. He looked bugged out.&quot;  He and his wife were married five years ago, but separated in 2009.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174525/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-mother-daughter-shot-by-alleged-stalker-father,0,5974645.story">Neighbors told WPIX 11</a> that Olga Annarumma had restraining orders on her husband, but he ignored them, &quot;He always used to hit her... [He] choked her in the middle of the street. It was very public. He was very abusive to her,&quot; while another said, &quot;He&apos;s a psychotic stalker. He comes by every day for the past two years. [The police] should&apos;ve done something two years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Daily News, the latest order of protection expired in March, but neighbors say the blog&apos;s aggressive tone should have been reason for the authorities to extend them.  In one post, the suspect said of his stepdaughter, &quot;You created this problem between me and your mother. I always wanted to do good by you, but you never cared about me. Your mother says that I don&apos;t love you, but I will always love you.&quot;</p>

<p>WPIX says that &quot;Olga Annarumma was shot once in the head, and that the bullet entered her skull near her right temple, and exited near her left temple&quot; while &quot;Valeria Kuzmina was shot four times in various locations above her legs.&quot;</p>
