<p>A 24-year-old man is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223112221/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2015/10/male_stabbed_in_stapleton_life.html#incart_river_home">&quot;fighting for his life&quot;</a> after being stabbed on a SI 74 bus this afternoon.</p>

<p>Police say the attack occurred around 1:45 p.m near Canal and Water Streets in the Stapleton section of Staten Island: The victim had been in a dispute over a seat when the assailant stabbed him multiple times in his hand and torso. The victim was described as being in &quot;likely&quot; to die condition by an NYPD spokeswoman.</p>

<p>A neighborhood resident told the Staten Island Advance, &quot;I can believe it (that it was over a seat on the bus). The 74 is known for this. This is a scary thing to happen in the neighborhood. I have to take more precaution now.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect, apparently in his 20s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223112221/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-stabbed-multiple-times-during-dispute-on-staten-island-bus/1031274/">fled by foot</a>. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
