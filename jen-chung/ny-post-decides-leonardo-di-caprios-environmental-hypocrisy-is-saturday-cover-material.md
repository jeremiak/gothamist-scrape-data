<p>It&apos;s Saturday, and since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/http://nypost.com/2016/04/14/the-post-endorses-donald-trump/">Post endorsed Donald Trump</a>, there was no point in featuring our future Beloved Leader&apos;s NRA meeting on the front page (the Daily News, though, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/733991290245910528">got out its Photoshop Clown app</a>). So, instead, the Post decided Leonardo DiCaprio would be a suitable target:</p>

<p>DiCaprio is a notable environmental activist, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/http://leonardodicaprio.org/">with a foundation</a> that pledges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/http://www.justjared.com/2016/01/19/leonardo-dicaprios-foundation-donates-another-15-million-dollars-to-environmental-projects-video/">millions to various causes</a> and an enviable platform to speak up&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/29/how-leonardo-dicaprio-oscar-climate-change-campaigner">during this Best Actor acceptable speech</a> at the Oscars, he said, &quot;Climate change is real, it is happening right now, it is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.&quot;</p>

<p>He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/http://therealdeal.com/2014/03/17/dicaprio-buys-out-neighbors-expands-at-2-river-terrace/">has an apartment</a> at The Riverhouse in Battery Park City, a LEED gold certified building. </p>

<p>Environmental analyst Robert Rapier argues to Page Six that Leo&apos;s &quot;movie-star lifestyle&quot;&#x2014;which includes the charter planes and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3091601/Leonardo-DiCaprio-cuts-lonesome-figure-mills-aboard-450ft-superyacht-Cannes.html">private yachts</a> (especially ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3380813/Leonardo-DiCaprio-cuts-rugged-unshaven-appearance-white-vest-Robin-Thicke-kick-yacht-St-Barts.html">with Robin Thicke</a>)&#x2014;&quot;&apos;diminishes his moral authority to lecture others on reducing their own carbon emissions.&apos;&quot; </p><blockquote>&#x201C;[He] demonstrates exactly why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow. It&#x2019;s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer. Alternatives usually require sacrifice of one form or another.&#x201D; Rapier added, &#x201C;Everybody says, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got a good reason for consuming what I consume&#x2019; .&#x2009;.&#x2009;. It&#x2019;s the exact same rationalization for billions of people.&#x201D;</blockquote>A DiCaprio inside said that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132124/https://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/2014/01/13/816/n/1922398/a2bad77c4cef4232_Tina-Amy-WENT-Leo.gif.xxxlarge.gif">serial modelizer</a> wasn&apos;t being an environmental monster, claiming he &quot;hitched a ride with someone already flying back [and] to Cannes. Hitching a ride was the only way he could make it in time for both events.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Yeah, taking CitiBike would be too slow, man.</p>
