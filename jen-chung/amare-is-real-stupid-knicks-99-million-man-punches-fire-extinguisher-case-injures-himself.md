<p>Stoudemire left the arena with his arm in a sling. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180506/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-lose-game-2-miami-104-94-lebron-james-heat-2-0-series-lead-carmelo-anthony-30-points-article-1.1070178">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;A Knicks official confirmed that Stoudemire had cut his non-shooting hand when he punched a small glass door that protects a fire extinguisher just outside the Knicks&#x2019; locker room. Stoudemire&#x2019;s hand shattered the pane and he needed an undetermined number of stitches to close the wound.&quot;</p>

<p>Some of the scuttlebutt on sports radio is that Stoudemire was frustrated with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180506/http://www.nba.com/games/20120430/NYKMIA/gameinfo.html">limited action on the court</a>: Yes, he did have 18 points, but only had nine shots (he sank six).  On the other hand, Carmelo Anthony made 26 shots (he ended up with 30 points for the night). </p>

<p>Stoudemire later Tweeted, &quot;I am so mad at myself right now, I want to apologize to the fans and my team, not proud of my actions, headed home for a new start,&quot; and &quot;We all have done thing out of anger that we regret. That makes us human. Bad timing on my part. Sorry guys. This to shall pass.&quot;</p>

In a split second, a decision can alter things. You can&#x2019;t fault anybody. We got to deal with the repercussions.&quot; And, yes, someone has created an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180506/https://twitter.com/#!/AAAExtinguisher/status/197174481079373826">AAA Fire Extinguisher Twitter account</a>, &quot;Where&apos;s my apology?&quot;</p>
