<p>Last night, Mayor Bill de Blasio fired the latest salvo in the debate over homeless shelters in Queens. He shared the video below on Twitter, thanking the Children&apos;s Museum of Manhattan for welcoming children living in a controversial shelter: &quot;Every child is a gift. Thank you @cmomnyc for making this a special day for some exceptional young New Yorkers.&quot;</p>

<p>The video shows a loud crowd of protesters outside the Bellerose Inn, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://www.theislandnow.com/new_hyde_park/news/outcry-in-bellerose-over-hotel-housing-homeless/article_2f5a8416-80e1-11e6-9dbe-1b7db3a49093.html">renting 40 of its 43 rooms</a> to the Department of Homeless Services for homeless families with children. A proposal which would create a 110-bed facility for homeless families with children over 18 at a Holiday Inn Express in Maspeth has been met with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/13/photos_maspeth_residents_protest_pr.php#photo-1">serious anger</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/27/maspeth_shelter_protest.php#photo-1">threats of a lawsuit</a> from the community, who blame de Blasio and Homeless Services Commissioner Steven Banks for allegedly endangering them. Protesters have even marched along Banks&apos;s street in Windsor Terrace, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/16/maspeth_residents.php">yelling</a>, &quot;Banks has gotta go!&quot; and &quot;Liar!&quot;</p>

<p>The video of the children&apos;s museum trip explains, &quot;When over 100 protesters descended on their temporary shelter, these homeless kids got a surprise field trip.&quot; Apparently, the protest was planned after a flyer, allegedly showing homeless children playing in a resident&apos;s driveway, was circulated: &quot;When city officials caught wind of the plan, they called the Manhattan Children&apos;s Museum to arrange a visit.&quot;</p>

<p>Banks says in the video, &quot;How do you explain to children why angry adults are out in front of the place they&apos;re living, and want to throw them into the streets? So today we thought we&apos;d take the children and their families some place nice where they can actually experience a helping hand from adults rather than the back of the hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Protesters also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/09/24/maspeth-residents-march-to-hotel-owner-s-home-to-protest--warehousing--homeless-in-their-neighborhood.html">marched to the home of Harshad Patel</a>, the owner of the two hotels. State Senator Tony Avella, who represents the district, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://pix11.com/2016/09/07/homeless-hotel-owner-questioned-ny-state-senator-calls-for-federal-probe/">asked U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara&apos;s office to investigate</a>, finding it suspicious Patel is doing business with the city after Patel &quot;openly admitted to paying a former state elected official more than $20,000 to get that official to effect a zoning change in his favor&quot; in 2011.</p>

<p>Plans for the Holiday Inn Express shelter in Maspeth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/08/maspeth_shelter_delayed.php">have been delayed</a>. Robert Holden, of the Juniper Park Civic Association, told NY1, &quot;This is not a racial issue because the homeless comes in all different colors and ethnicities. We will accept a small facility; we will accept one and two family homes, affordable houses.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYC Mayor&apos;s office retweeted City Council Member Brad Lander this morning:</p>

<p>Native New Yorker Jake Dobkin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160927085002/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/09/homeless_shelter_fight.php">recommends that NIMBYs paranoid about the homeless</a> rethink their angst: &quot;Rather than pointing at the poor shelter residents, who are mainly the victims of bad luck and stratospherically-priced housing, you&apos;d be better off directing your anger at the people who really have power in our city&apos;s real estate market: the rich developers and the politicians whom they control.&quot;</p>
