<p>Yesterday, Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75069.html">criticized</a> First Lady hopeful Ann Romney, saying Romney &quot;actually never worked a day in her life.&quot;  Romney, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/ann-romney-joins-pinterest/2012/02/21/gIQAWupkRR_blog.html">noted Pinterest Pinner</a>, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://twitter.com/#!/AnnDRomney/status/190262588163100672">joined Twitter to respond</a>, &quot;I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.&quot;  You try raising a family of five on a shoestring because your deadbeat husband <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/mitt_romney_member_of_001_says_3740.php">only brings home $374,000 in speaker&apos;s fees</a>.    </p>

<p>Rosen&apos;s remarks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/welcome-to-the-twitter-election">were quickly disavowed</a> by President Obama&apos;s advisers Jim Messina (&quot;I could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly. Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize.&quot;)  and David Axelrod (&quot;Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen&apos;s comments about Ann Romney. They were inappropriate and offensive.&quot;) Here&apos;s what Rosen, a lesbian mother of two who works at PR firm and is a CNN contributor,  said about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1204/11/acd.01.html">apparent &quot;war on women&quot; from the GOP on AC 360</a>:</p>

<blockquote> What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country saying, well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues. And when I listen to my wife, that&apos;s what I&apos;m hearing.

<p>Guess what, his wife has actually never worked a day in her life. She&apos;s never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school and how do we -- why do we worry about their future?</p>

<p>So I think it&apos;s&#x2014;yes, it&apos;s about these positions and, yes, I think there will be a war of words about the positions, but there&apos;s something much more fundamental about Mitt Romney. He seems so old- fashioned when it comes to women.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Romney spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://jezebel.com/5901295/twitstorm-erupts-after-cnn-pundit-says-ann-romney-has-never-worked-a-day-in-her-life">Eric Fehrnstrom Tweeted</a>, &quot;Obama adviser Hilary Rosen goes on #CNN to debut their new &apos;kill Ann&apos; strategy, and in the process insults hard-working moms,&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://jezebel.com/5901295/twitstorm-erupts-after-cnn-pundit-says-ann-romney-has-never-worked-a-day-in-her-life">prompting Jezebel to write</a>, &quot;First of all, Hilary Rosen does not work for Obama. She&apos;s a CNN pundit and she works in PR, period. Full stop. So don&apos;t pull that shit. And nobody is trying to kill Ann, metaphorically or otherwise, or to suggest that moms don&apos;t work hard. But way to throw a cheap tweet in the mix to distract from the fact that your candidate is so bad on women&apos;s issues that he&apos;s pretty much dead in the water already with women voters.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course Fox News is <em>loving</em> the issue, putting Romney&apos;s family photograph with the words &quot;5 Kids, 16 Grandkids, Dem Adviser Charges Ann Romney Has &quot;Never Worked A Day In Her Life.&quot; and even has a link to details about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/entrepreneurs/2012/04/12/ann-romney-stay-at-home-moms/">how much stay-at-home mothers are worth</a>.  Ann Romney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/04/ann-romney-we-need-to-respect-choices-that-women-make-120328.html">appeared on Fox News, saying</a>, &quot;Look, I know what it&apos;s like to struggle and if maybe I haven&apos;t struggled as much financially as much as some people have, I can tell you and promise you that I&apos;ve had struggles in my life. ... Mitt and I have compassion for people that are struggling and that&apos;s why we&apos;re running. We care about people that are struggling.&quot; Except when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-02-23/mitt-romneys-box-of-kryptonite">they work for Ampad.</a></p>

<p>Ironically, Ann Romney also said, &quot;We need to respect choices that women make,&quot; which is something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/11/29/142827112/mitt-romneys-evolution-on-abortion">her husband doesn&apos;t seem to want to do</a>, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/troll_rush_limbaugh_cant_stop_wont.php">other Republicans</a>.   Rosen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/ann-romney-twitter-cnn-.html">responded on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/12/opinion/ann-romney-hilary-rosen/index.html?hpt=op_t1"> with a post on CNN</a> (&quot;I admire women who can stay home and raise their kids full time. I even envy them sometimes. It is a wonderful luxury to have the choice. But let&#x2019;s stipulate that it is NOT a choice that most women have in America today&quot;) and then with a statement from her firm, &quot;I apologize to Ann Romney and anyone else who was offended. Let&#x2019;s declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/obama-campaign-on-defensive-over-strategists-comments-about-ann-romney/?hp">She also said on CNN</a>, &quot;This is not about Ann Romney. This is about the waitress at a diner someplace in Nevada who has two kids whose day-care funding is being cut off because of the Romney-Ryan budget and she doesn&#x2019;t know what to do.&quot;</p>

<p>First Lady Michelle Obama, who worked as a lawyer and has had positions with the Chicago city government, University of Chicago, and University of Chicago Hospitals, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://twitter.com/#!/MichelleObama/status/190469503161860096">Tweeted today</a>, &quot;Every mother works hard, and every woman deserves to be respected.&quot;</p>

<p>Some things we&apos;ve learned about Ann Romney: Raising five sons was tough, she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://gawker.com/5901344/how-sean-hannity-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-teleprompters">rides Austrian warmbloods</a>, she&apos;s getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://laist.com/2012/03/27/a_painful_peek_at_mitt_romneys_fantasy_home.php">ready for a bigger house in LaJolla</a>, and she and Mitt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321102559/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/24/mitt_romneys_tax_rate_was_139_in_20.php">only paid a 13.9% tax rate in 2010</a>.</p>
