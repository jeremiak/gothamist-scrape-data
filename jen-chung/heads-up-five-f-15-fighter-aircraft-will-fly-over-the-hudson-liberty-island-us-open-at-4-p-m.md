<p>Just in case you were wondering why five military fighter planes are flying overhead this afternoon, it&apos;s a planned military flyover!</p>

<p>The NYPD says, &quot;Today, at approximately 4 p.m., five (5) F-15 E Strike Eagle aircraft from the USAF will be flying over the Hudson River.  They will be traveling north on the Hudson River, passing Liberty Island and the USS Intrepid.  The aircraft will then flyover the US Open, and then proceed directly back to Newark Liberty International Airport.&quot;</p>

<p>So that&apos;s what this noise is:</p>

<p>Last week, the Thunderbirds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130647/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/02/thunderbirds_hudson_flyover.php">flew over the Hudson a few times</a>.</p>
