Edwards, who dropped out of the Democratic hunt for the nomination <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183009/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/30/edwards_will_dr.php">back in January</a>, had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183009/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/edwards-to-endorse-obama/index.html?hp">expected to support Obama</a>, especially after statements referring to him as the likely nominee.</p>

<p>Edwards and Obama appeared to team up to attack Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183009/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/06/video_of_the_da_148.php">during a debate in New Hampshire earlier this year</a>.  When Clinton was claiming Obama was inconsistent with his views, Edwards said:</p><blockquote>Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces of status quo attack...[Obama] believes deeply in change, and I believe deeply in change. And any time you&#x2019;re fighting for that, I mean, I didn&#x2019;t hear these kinds of attacks from Senator Clinton when she was ahead.&#x201D;</blockquote>Former presidential adviser David Gergen had said in January that Obama could pick up 60% of Edwards supporters, which could be very helpful given that even in last night&apos;s West Virginia primary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183009/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10334.html">Edwards got 7% of the vote</a>.  <p></p>

<p>The endorsement will take place shortly--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183009/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/05/edwards-to-endo.html">ABC News says</a> it&apos;s to have it in time for evening newscasts.</p>
