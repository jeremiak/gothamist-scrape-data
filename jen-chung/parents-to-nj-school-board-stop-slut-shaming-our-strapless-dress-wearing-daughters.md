<p>After outcry from parents over a middle school principal&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010833/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/slut-shaming_or_sensible_nj_middle.php">ban on strapless dresses at an upcoming formal,</a> a NJ school board has vowed to take a look at the issue more carefully. Because let&apos;s face it&#x2014;if you can&apos;t wear strapless dresses, aren&apos;t you letting the terrorists win?</p>

<p>Readington middle school principal Sharon Moffat told eighth graders&apos; parents, &#x201C;Young gentlemen are encouraged to wear collared shirts and trousers; many boys wear ties or jackets. Young ladies should wear a skirt, dress with straps, or dressy pants outfit. Jeans or sneakers are not appropriate for this event.&quot; While Moffat wanted to make sure boys weren&apos;t unduly distracted, the mothers of some girls were livid. At a school board meeting last night, there was a sampling of outrage:</p><ul>	<li>&quot;What message are we giving them by telling them it&#x2019;s not appropriate to show your shoulders?&quot;&#x2014;concerned mother (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010833/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/23/girls-banned-from-wearing-strapless-dresses-to-nj-school-dance/">CBS 2</a>)</li><br>
	<li>&quot;Don&#x2019;t look at my daughter like she&#x2019;s a sexual object&quot;&#x2014;another mother (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010833/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130423/NJNEWS/304230068/Readington-school-board-review-strapless-dress-ban-from-middle-school-dance">MyCentralJersey</a>)</li><br>
	<li>&quot;My dress is modest. It is not revealing whatsoever. I don&#x2019;t want to waste my money just because it has no straps&quot;&#x2014;an eighth-grader (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010833/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20130423/NJNEWS/304230068/Readington-school-board-review-strapless-dress-ban-from-middle-school-dance">MyCentralJersey</a>)</li><br>
	<li>&quot;It&#x2019;s ridiculous. Maybe blonde-haired girls distract boys. Should they dye their hair then?&quot;&#x2014;annoyed mother (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010833/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/23/girls-banned-from-wearing-strapless-dresses-to-nj-school-dance/">WCBS 2</a>)</li><br>
	<li>&quot;These days, the majority of dresses (for sale) are strapless&quot;&#x2014;eighth grade student (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010833/http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2013/04/ban_on_strapless_dresses_at_eighth-grade_dinner_dance_under_review_in_readingtoni.html">Star-Ledger</a>)</li><br>
	<li>&quot;As a parent, I make sure my kids are dressed appropriately. There are lots of princess dresses that have no straps and there are lots of others that do have spaghetti straps that are very slinky and revealing&quot;&#x2014;style-conscious mother (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010833/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/23/girls-banned-from-wearing-strapless-dresses-to-nj-school-dance/">WCBS 2</a>)</li><br>
</ul>The dance&#x2014;which parents paid for&#x2014;is in June.<p></p>
