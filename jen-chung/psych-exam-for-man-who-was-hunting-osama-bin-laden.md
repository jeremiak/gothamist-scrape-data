Gary Brooks Faulkner, a 50-year-old Colorado resident, was found armed and a source told the AFP, &quot;They are asking him a lot of things, especially about the sword and dagger that look like ceremonial weapons. He said he wanted to kill Usama but killing Usama with a sword and dagger is not child&apos;s play. Carrying a pistol and such a long sword is definitely a crime but we need a lot more clarifications.&quot;</p>

<p>Faulkner&apos;s sister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310193840/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/06/15/2010-06-15_gary_brooks_faulkner_is_dying_and_likely_wanted_to_kill_osama_bin_laden_for_his_.html">spoke to the Daily News</a> and gave a guess about his intentions, &quot;He only has 9% kidney function, and the only thing that can cure him is a transplant. He needs dialysis three times a week. I&apos;m guessing that he wanted to do one last thing for his country before he died.&quot;  She added that he wasn&apos;t after the $50 million reward from the U.S. authorities, &quot;<strong>My brother is extremely religious since his troubled youth. He&apos;s not crazy</strong>.&quot; And a brother said, &quot;He is highly intelligent and loves his country and he has not forgotten what Osama has done to this country.&quot; </p>

<p>One Pakistani official said, &quot;We initially laughed when he told us he wanted to kill Osama bin Laden.&quot; Another tidbit: Besides his weapons and night vision goggles, Faulkner was reportedly found with hashish (hello, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310193840/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2023/does-assassin-derive-from-hashish">hashish-assassin connection</a>).</p>
