<p>Christmas is coming, which means many families have opted into the North Pole&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154245/http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/12/elf_on_the_shelf_miracle_for_parents_or_tiny_oppressor_.html">surveillance program</a>, also know as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154245/http://www.elfontheshelf.com/">The Elf on the Shelf</a>. Which is why one 7-year-old girl was so worried when she accidentally disturbed the Elf in her home that she called 911.</p>

<p>Isabelle LaPeruta had apparently thrown a ball in her Old Bridge home, and the Elf on the Shelf got knocked down to the floor. (The Elf cannot be touched by the children and must remain at a distance, but moves around the house at night, which can lead to all sorts of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154245/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-pelc/how-the-elf-on-the-shelf-ruined-our-christmas_b_4435749.html">headaches for parents</a>.) Since it was a Christmas emergency, she called 911. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154245/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Girl-Calls-911-Elf-on-Shelf-Santa-Emergency-363303221.html">NBC New York got the recorded call</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;Hello?&quot; the 911 operator says.<p></p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s Isabella,&quot; the girl says.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi. Hi, Isabella. Why are you calling 911?&quot; the operator asks. </p>

<p>Suddenly, the girl panics.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t come to my house!&quot; she shouts. &quot;Don&apos;t!&quot; </p>

<p>She goes on to explain, &quot;I was trying to call my dad&quot; to tell him about the accident. </p>

<p>The operator responds, &quot;You can just say you made a mistake.&quot; </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The police had to investigate the call and an officer &quot;found the girl in tears. The officer calmed Isabella down as her mother woke from a nap and found her daughter trying to shoo away the cop.&quot;</p>

<p>The cop ended up calling headquarters, &quot;Isabella apologized. She touched the Elf on a Shelf. She won&apos;t call 911 again.&quot; Old Bridge Police Lt. Joseph Mandola <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154245/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Girl-Calls-911-Elf-on-Shelf-Santa-Emergency-363303221.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;To her, it was an emergency when she touched the elf, and she&apos;s going to ruin Christmas, so that was her emergency. In her mind, she did right, and it was fine with us.&quot;</p>

<p>Isabella, who was described as hysterically crying during the incident, said, &quot;I didn&apos;t want to get in trouble,&quot; and her mom said she now knows what a real emergency is. </p>
