					<p>Last night, a guy from Queens and a guy from Brooklyn won the 2016 New Hampshire primaries: Real estate mogul and race-baiter Donald Trump proved the polls right, by winning 35% of the Republican vote, while Senator Bernie Sanders killed, seizing 60% of Democratic support. </p>

<p>While it was expected for Sanders to win New Hampshire, in part due to his deep roots in neighboring Vermont (by way of Brooklyn), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost very badly, getting only 38% of the vote. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/new-hampshire-takeaways-off-message-219061">From Politico</a>:</p><blockquote>The Clinton team, hunkered down in a grubby Manchester Radisson saturated in booze and ill-kempt Morning Joe groupies, knew it was going to be a terrible, not-good night by mid-afternoon: The exit polls showed big turnout among young voters and, ominously for her, liberals who think Barack Obama isn&#x2019;t liberal enough. It was a complete and humbling defeat: Sanders beat Clinton among all demographic groups - including all women, a remarkable rebuke eight years after she &#x201C;found her voice&#x201D; by tearing up at New Hampshire diner.</blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.wsj.com/articles/results-in-new-hampshire-point-to-hillary-clintons-weaknesses-1455078937">WSJ offered this factoid</a>: &quot;Young women, who many presumed would be part of the Clinton coalition, are instead turning to Mr. Sanders. He carried women under age 45 by 40 percentage points in New Hampshire, 69% to 29%.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/us/politics/new-hampshire-highlights.html">NY Times noted</a>, &quot;The only age group she won: voters over 65.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Sanders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/new-hampshire-primary.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">told his supporters,</a> &quot;Together we have sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington, from Maine to California. And that is that the government of our great country belongs to all of the people, and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors and their &#x2018;super PACs.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sanders-defeats-clinton-in-decisive-new-hampshire-primary-victory/2016/02/09/cac42588-cf43-11e5-b2bc-988409ee911b_story.html">According to the Washington Post</a>, Clinton&apos;s campaign issued a memo as the polls closed, saying the loss was &quot;long anticipated... Attention will inevitably focus on the next two of the &#x2018;early four&#x2019; states: Nevada and South Carolina. We&#x2019;ve built first-rate organizations in each state and we feel very good about our prospects for success&quot; there and in other primary states.</p>

<p>On the Republican side, things could be summed up in this headline: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/new-hampshire-trump-rubio-abyss-219062">GOP establishment stares into the abyss</a>.&quot; Trump overperformed poll predictions (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/08/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-waterboarding/">dropping the pussy-bomb </a>along the way), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-10/new-hampshire-bucks-the-establishment-to-back-trump-and-sanders">acknowledged his second place showing</a> in Iowa last week: &quot;We learned a lot about ground games in one week, let me tell you that. We&#x2019;re going to make our country so strong again.&quot; <em>*shudder*</em></p>

<p>Ohio Governor John Kasich came in second, with 16% of the Republican vote. Senator Marco &quot;The Robot&quot; Rubio was polling in second place, but dropped to fifth place; Senator Ted Cruz got about 12% and Jeb! Bush had 11.1%. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/rubio-debate-didnt-do-well">Rubio apologized</a> for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdY-t4MRqxw">viral-in-a-bad way</a> debate performance, acknowledging, &quot;I did not do well on Saturday night. So listen to this: that will never happen again,&quot; which dovetailed nicely into this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/the-anxiety-of-marco-rubio">excerpt about Rubio&apos;s &quot;anxiety&quot;</a> from Buzzfeed reporter McKay Coppins&apos; book about the election process.</p>

<p>While the rest of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102102449.html">Real America</a> is very different from New Hampshire, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-10/new-hampshire-bucks-the-establishment-to-back-trump-and-sanders">Bloomberg News explains</a> that the state &quot;historically serves to narrow crowded presidential fields, like this year&#x2019;s Republican contest, but the volatile nature of the race could prolong the nominating fight in both parties, as well as provide a possible path for third party candidates.&quot; Enter the owner of Bloomberg News: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617120640/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/hail_caesar.php">Michael Bloomberg</a>.</p>
