The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131133501/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202008/news/regionalnews/what_an_unholy_stench__145115.htm">Post reports</a> that the Missionary Sisters of Sacred Heart, which owns 201 East 19th Street, accuse Gloria and Michael Lim of &quot;caus[ing] noxious, foul and harmful odors to emanate from the [apartment] into the common areas...as well into other apartments.&quot;  One time, the fire department was called because people were convinced someone had died in the building; the FDNY focused on the Lims&apos; apartment, where Gloria Lim said she was &quot;smoking and drying fish.&quot;  Since the Lims reportedly refused to &quot;<strong>stop the stank or at least open their windows</strong>,&quot; the Missionary Sisters are trying to block Lim from further fishy antics and for $75,000 in damages.  </p>
