Sheherazad Jaafari, also known as &quot;Syria&apos;s Kim Kardashian,&quot; has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151624/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/07/syrias_kim_kardashian_and_barbara_w.php">traded her fancy evening gowns</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151624/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/shame_on_fury_at_baba_aid_5ILnVwbAPFLFkZ9JDZ1DAK">t-shirts like &quot;No Boyfriend, No Problem.&quot;</a>  <em>Life is all right in America!</em></p>

<p>Now some Syrians are objecting to Columbia&apos;s acceptance of the young woman.  Jaafari had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151624/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/06/barbara_walters_couldnt_get_genocid.php">reached out to Barbara Walters</a> for help with getting an internship at CNN and with her admissions to Columbia. Why Baba Wawa? Because Walters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151624/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/06/barbara_walters_couldnt_get_genocid.php">had an exclusive interview</a> with Assad, a sit-down that Jaafari recommended because the &quot;American psyche can be easily manipulated.&quot; Walters did contact former ABC News executive&#x2014;now Columbia Journalism School&#x2014;Richard Wald about the &quot;brilliant, beautiful&quot; and multi-lingual Jaafari.  </p>

<p>Sarab al-Jijakli, a spokesman for the National Alliance for Syria, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151624/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/shame_on_fury_at_baba_aid_5ILnVwbAPFLFkZ9JDZ1DAK">tells the Post</a>, &quot;We are outraged with what is happening at Columbia University. Columbia and Barbara Walters must ensure that they right the wrong and not accept someone from the inner circle of the al-Assad regime into their university.&quot;  The SIPA&apos;s lone Syrian 2012 grad, Haya Dweidary, says the admissions office ignored her warnings, &quot;I told them they should not let the girl in. She is horrible and supporting the regime. I was sure she wasn&#x2019;t going to be admitted because of her strong affiliation with the government and all the human-rights violations. It was completely shocking that she was admitted.&quot;</p>

<p>FYI: Jaafari travels with a NYPD detail, because of her father&apos;s position Syrian ambassador to the United Nations.  And the UN just issued a report that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151624/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18405800">Syrian children are being tortured and used as human shields</a>.</p>
