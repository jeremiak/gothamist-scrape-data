</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, federal, state and city officials broke ground on the Moynihan Station, the long-discussed project to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/22/penn_station_co.php">redevelop Penn Station</a> at the Farley Post Office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/24/map_of_the_day_127.php">on Eighth Avenue</a>.  After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/27/msg_bails_out_o.php">years</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/23/moynihan_statio_4.php">obstacles</a>, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/a-ceremonial-start-for-moynihan-station/">more of a &quot;symbolic gesture,&quot;</a> welcoming federal money being used for the project (the feds are kicking in $83 million for phase one, which has an estimated total of $276 million).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://www.observer.com/2010/real-estate/moynihan-station-track">Observer points out</a>, &quot;There&apos;s [not] much to celebrate just yet: the $1.5 billion reconstruction of the station within the defunct James Farley post office is still years, if not many more decades, away. For now, we get a new concourse, extended platforms, and some glorified subway entrances.&quot; Oh, and officials got to demolish a cinderblock wall that had been specially constructed outside the post office&#x2014;yes, that&apos;s Governor Paterson, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/13/paterson_says_hes_the_new_sheriff_o.php">Sheriff of Moynihan Station</a>, swinging at the wall.</p>

<p>Some more details about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://www.empire.state.ny.us/Subsidiaries_Projects/MSDC/MSDCRenderings.html">Moynihan Station at this state website</a>. Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110205934/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/flashback_madison_square_garden.php">Penn Station&#x2014;the demolished one</a>&#x2014;would have been 100 this year. </p>
