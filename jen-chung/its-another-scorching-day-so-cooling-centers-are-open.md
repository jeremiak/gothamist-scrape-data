<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313130645/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/18/hottest_week_of_the_year.php">heat wave</a> is not letting up, and the city is opening the cooling centers.  The Office of Emergency Management says, &quot;Air-conditioned City cooling centers will be open Wednesday as temperatures remain in the 90s. With the heat index expected to climb above 100 later in the week, OEM reminds New Yorkers to take precautions. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. When in the sun, wear sunscreen and a hat to protect your face and head. Remember to check on family and friends as heat can affect people differently. Seniors, young children, and people taking certain medications have a higher risk of heat-related illnesses.&quot;</p>
