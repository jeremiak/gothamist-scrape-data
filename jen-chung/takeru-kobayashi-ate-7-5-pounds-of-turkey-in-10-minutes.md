<p>Besides chowing down on turkey, Kobayashi is also launching a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525010149/http://UStream.tv/KobiEats">UStream channel</a> and a Facebook fan page&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525010149/http://Facebook.com/KobiEats">KobiEats</a>&#x2014;and he&apos;s planning on spending part of today volunteering at the Bowery Mission&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Banquet. Kobayashi said, &quot;It&apos;s my intent to use my unique talent to help those less-fortunate than I am. &#xA0;I consider myself blessed and never for once take that for granted. That is what this holiday is all about.... If&#xA0;I can have fun with my fans in the process, and get closer than ever both in person and online, everyone wins!&quot;</p>

<p>Kobayashi has been going rogue ever since being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525010149/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/05/chestnut_wins_hot_dog_eating_contes.php">removed from the Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2010</a>, trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525010149/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/14/kobayashi_fails_to_break_guinness_p.php">break other records</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525010149/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/05/video_kobayashi_breaks_world_hot_do.php">suggesting he&apos;s besting Joey Chestnut</a>. </p>
