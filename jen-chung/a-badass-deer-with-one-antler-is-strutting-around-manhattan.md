										<p>A <strike>magical unicorn</strike> unique deer with one antler was spotted in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013853/https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/jackie-robinson-park_manhattan">Harlem park</a> earlier today&#x2014;and it&apos;s believed he swam across the East River.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013853/http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/theres-a-one-antlered-deer-roaming-around-manhattan/">The NY Post reports</a>, &quot;The two-year old buck &#x2014; who could pass for a unicorn with his lone horn &#x2014; was spotted prancing around Jackie Robinson Park in Harlem Friday morning, prompting calls from neighbors, a police source said... Neighbors feared the bold buck would dash into the street after they spotted him frolicking in the brush near 154th Street.&quot; He&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013853/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/14/rip_pedals_the_bear.php">no Pedals</a>, but we&apos;ll take what we can get.</p>

<p>A police source told the tabloid, &quot;It was skittish, moving carefully and trying to hide. Very alert,&quot; adding, &#x201C;If it comes out of the woods and into the street, it could be a problem. Until then, we are treating it as what it is &#x2014; a deer in the woods.&quot; So... <em>don&apos;t </em>panic?</p>

<p>If do you spot the deer crossing 154th Street, resist the urge to pet him&#x2014;a Staten Island man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013853/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/11/staten_island_deer_selfie.html">was nearly impaled</a> recently after taking a selfie with a deer.</p>

<p>Last year, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013853/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/25/wounded_deer_dies_after_being_found.php">deer died on the Upper West Side</a> after after apparently crossing the Henry Hudson Parkway and being hit by a driver.</p>
