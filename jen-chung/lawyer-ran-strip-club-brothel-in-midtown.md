<p>Undercover cops posing as men having a bachelor party were told, per the Daily News, &quot;they could have a private room - with a bed - for $250 an hour, plus whatever they spent on the women.&quot;  The club also had a &quot;house dealer of cocaine&quot; and, if you tipped, alcohol (otherwise it was BYOB).  Also, there were live sex shows and sex toys abound--all for a $50 cover and $20 membership fee, on top of whatever else one would spend.  The money was apparently laundered through lawyer Louis Posner&apos;s Voter March, and money found in Posner&apos;s and his wife&apos;s bank accounts and safe deposit boxes could allegedly be traced back to the club.  </p>

This was the greatest establishment.&quot;   However, some employees were thrilled; one stripper said Posner was a &quot;a sleazy, disgusting and disloyal boss.&quot;  And some neighbors in the building claimed they knew it was a den of sin, while tenant said to the Times, &apos;&#x201C;I always see beautiful ladies coming in and well-dressed guys. But I didn&#x2019;t know what it was. I heard it was for a photography studio.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Besides the Posners, managers and a few women, including porn star Alexia Moore, were arrested.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130417023932/http://www.hotlapdance.com/">website for the club</a> is extremely NSFW.</p>
