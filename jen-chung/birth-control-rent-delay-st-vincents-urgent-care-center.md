<p>Nearly four months after the 160-year-old Greenwich Village hospital <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111025163520/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/30/st_vincents_closes_for_good_3500_la.php">closed its doors</a>, talks to open an urgent care clinic at St. Vincent&apos;s have stalled over rent and...birth control.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111025163520/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/nyregion/20vincents.html">NY Times spoke</a> to officials &quot;close to the negotiations&quot; who said St. Vincent&apos;s officers &quot;were asking for higher-than-market rent and for a huge financial penalty if the urgent-care center failed to move out immediately if a buyer were found for the hospital building&quot; and were &quot;trying to force the clinic to conform to Catholic doctrine by prohibiting it from prescribing birth-control drugs or providing counseling on birth-control methods.&quot;</p>

<p>North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System had been given a $9.4 million grant from the state to open the clinic; its spokesperson said they were still negotiating the lease.  City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, whose district was once served by the hospital, asked State Health Commissioner Richard Daines to intervene, &quot;The absence of these health services will prove to be quite literally a matter of life and death for many who work and live on Manhattan&apos;s West Side and lower Manhattan.&quot; A spokesperson for Daines said, &quot;Christine Quinn doesn&#x2019;t know what she&#x2019;s talking about. The state health department has been in constant contact with all the stakeholders... Anything that has to do with the property of St. Vincent&#x2019;s must be worked out through the bankruptcy court.&quot; </p>
