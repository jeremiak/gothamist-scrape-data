<ul><li>From the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://gothamist.com/labs/map">Gothamist Newsmap</a>: A stolen tanker in the 72nd Precinct area of Brooklyn, an unconscious firefighter on Pitt Street in Manhattan, and an unusual trauma on  Putnam Place in the Bronx.
</li><li>Airlines are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/85084/airlines-to-ground-dozens-of-nonstop-flights/Default.aspx">cutting many non-stop flights</a> because of fuel costs and the economy.
</li><li>It&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08252008/news/regionalnews/whats_up__docs_126003.htm">bonanza of documentaries at movie theaters</a> (the docs need to play at least two times a day for a week in order to be eligible for Oscar consideration).
</li><li>The Observer says even the NY Times is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/monserrates-ambitious-introduction">pooling its few floor passes</a> among its reporters at the DNC.  Also: City Councilman Hiram Monserrate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/monserrates-ambitious-introduction">introduced himself</a> as a future mayor.
</li><li>The NYPD&apos;s Skywatch Tower is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://animalnewyork.com/news/2008/08/cops-look-down-on-ridgewood-sk.php">now in Ridgewood, Queens.</a>
</li><li>Despite their proximity to Nathan&apos;s, the hot dog vending machines off the Coney Island boardwalk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/08/are_you_willing_to_go_this_far.html">sold out of, uh, &quot;food&quot;</a> this weekend.
</li><li>And Goldman Sachs is fine with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063211/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/nyregion/25goldman.html?ref=nyregion">little buzz on their skyscraper construction</a> near Ground Zero. Of course, when there has been buzz, it&apos;s been when debris fell onto a Little League playing field on one occasion and tons of falling steel paralyzed an architect on another.
