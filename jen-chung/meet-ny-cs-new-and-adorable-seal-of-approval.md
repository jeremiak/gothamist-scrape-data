<p>This morning, we heard a report of a grey seal spotted on the rocks behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021524/http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/gracie.html">Gracie Mansion</a>, the city&apos;s official mayoral residence, so we messaged the NYC Mayor&apos;s Office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021524/http://twitter.com/#!/Gothamist/status/137545335819087873">via Twitter</a>, &quot;is there a grey seal on the rocks behind gracie mansion? if yes, can you take a picture?&quot; Ask and ye shall receive, folks&#x2014;the NYC Mayor&apos;s Office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021524/http://twitter.com/#!/NYCMayorsOffice/status/137622144556347392">just Tweeted</a>, &quot;Meet the new City seal! MT @Gothamist is there a grey seal on the rocks behind gracie mansion? http://yfrog.com/gzgp2laaj&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether the seal&#x2014;which happens to be a harbor seal (not a grey seal)&#x2014; is a boy or girl, but obviously, we&apos;d like to nominate the name &quot;Gracie&quot; for a female seal.  And while it&apos;s also unclear if the seal is still there, but maybe the cutie knows the mansion hasn&apos;t had a full-time occupant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021524/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/25/mr_bloomberg_builds_his_dream_townh.php">for 10 years</a>.</p>
