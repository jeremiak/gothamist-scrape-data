<p>Check your privilege: A committee in NJ&apos;s state Assembly has approved a bill that will prohibit the &quot;use of tobacco products on the grounds of any public or private institution of higher education&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202338/http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2000/1978_I1.HTM">PDF</a>). And, yes, that would include e-cigarettes AND chewing tobacco.</p>

<p>College students are already banned from smoking in dorm and other campus buildings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202338/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/05/bill_to_ban_outdoor_tobacco_use_on_all_nj_college_campuses_advances.html#incart_m-rpt-1">According to the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;Advocates said the bill would give New Jersey the strictest college campus smoking ban in the nation... Fines for those caught violating the ban would start at $250 for a first offense, $500 for a second offense and $1,000 each time after.&quot;</p>

<p>And here&apos;s how the vote turned out: &quot;The four Democrats on the committee voted in favor of the bill, while the three Republicans voted against it. Assemblyman Gregory McGuckin (R-Ocean) said he liked the idea, but thought banning e-cigarettes was a &apos;bridge too far.&apos; Assemblyman Tom Giblin (D-Essex) said that even though he supported the bill he would like to see e-cigarettes exempted.&quot; E-cigarettes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202338/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/22/e-cigs_e-cigarettes_njoy_vaping_vap.php">are</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202338/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/24/fdas_new_e-cig_rules_positive_for_i.php">barely regulated</a> and a study says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202338/http://time.com/90756/e-cigs-still-produce-carcinogens-study-shows/">they still contain carcinogens</a>. </p>

<p>Americans for Non-Smokers&apos; Rights has a list of all the schools without smoking on campus (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202338/http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/smokefreecollegesuniversities.pdf">PDF</a>); interestingly, NYU Is one of them, as is Barnard (but not Columbia). As it happens, vapers will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202338/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/08/e-cig_patriots_to_blow_smokeuh_fog.php">protesting the ban on e-cigs in parks this weekend</a>.</p>

<p>Next, the Assembly will take up the bill.</p>
