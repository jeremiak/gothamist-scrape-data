</div></div>					<p>President Obama has arrived at NJ&apos;s Newark Liberty International Airport&#x2014;greeted by NJ Governor Chris Christie and Newark Mayor Cory Booker&#x2014;and he&apos;s taking a helicopter to discuss the economy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170300/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/will_obama_be_eating_a_nj_sub_sandw.php">Tastee Sub Shop in Edison</a>.  And ahead of his arrival, there are fans and protesters. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170300/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/protestors_supporters_gather_o.html">Star-Ledger reports</a> that Tea Party folks held signs like &#x201C;Obama, Got Jobs?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Obama: Liar N Thief,&quot; while others have signs like, &quot;Gaga For Gay Rights.&quot;  Also: &quot;Debates on health care and taxes have also broken out among the protestors and Obama supporters. Some are even yelling at each other from opposite sides of Plainfield Avenue.&quot;</p>

<p>Tastee Sub Shop owners David Thornton and Carl Padavano are excited about the President&apos;s visit.  Padavano said, &quot;How many times you wake up and find you have a chance to host the President of the United States? It&apos;s not often..I don&apos;t even think it would be on a dream list. We just make sandwiches, it&apos;s just unbelievable.&quot;  Also, eat for your heart out with this video of the Tastee Sub Shop in action:</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  Obama ordered the &quot;Super Sub,&quot; which has pressed ham, boiled ham, salami, cappacola and proscuttini, plus cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, spices, oil, and vinegar.  But he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170300/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/president.obama.tastee.2.1829843.html">didn&apos;t get the 12&quot; size</a>, &quot;noting that he is about to turn 49 and needed to go for a sandwich one-half the size.&quot;</p>
