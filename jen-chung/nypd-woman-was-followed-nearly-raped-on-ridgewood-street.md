<p>A woman walking in Queens was grabbed by a man who tried to rape her, police say.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred on May 8, around 3 a.m.: The 26-year-old woman was near Harman Street and Seneca Avenue when she was &quot;approached by a male who threw her to the ground and attempted to rape her. The victim fought the male off, and he fled on foot.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released surveillance video of the suspect, who is described as being in his teens and having a slim build. He was wearing a light-colored hoodie, camouflage shorts, black sneakers, and was carrying a backpack. </p>

He then walks back out to the sidewalk and follows her.&quot;<br>
