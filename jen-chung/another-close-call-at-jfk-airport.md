<p>The FAA is investigating (it hasn&apos;t heard of such an incident yet), and a spokesperson for one of the airlines allegedly involved said the claim from air traffic controllers was &quot;false.&quot;  However, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association says the incident occurred on Saturday, between two passengers planes on runways perpendicular to each other.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075353/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6249696">According to the NATCA&apos;s spokesman</a>, an air traffic controller &quot;ordered the inbound pilot to take a hard left and the outbound a hard right, avoiding a collision.&quot;</p>

<p>Last December, two planes, a small commuter jet and a cargo plane, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075353/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/11/jfk_airport_has.php">reportedly almost collided</a>; they were both on JFK Airport&apos;s perpendicular runways.  Previously, Senator Chuck Schumer has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075353/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/12/lack_of_air_tra.php">criticized the FAA for understaffing air traffic control towers</a>.</p>
