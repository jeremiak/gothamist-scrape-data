Wallace said though many Americans thought it was a joke, the First Lady didn&apos;t, which she confirmed, &quot;Of course I wasn&apos;t amused. It was an assault. And that&apos;s what it is. And it would be an assault to anyone for -- if anybody had been there.  And the president laughed it off. He wasn&apos;t hurt. <strong>He&apos;s very quick. As you know, he&apos;s a natural athlete. And that&apos;s it. But on the other hand, it is an assault</strong>, and I think it should be treated that way.&quot;  She said whatever happens to the Iraqi reporter who threw the shoes is up to the Iraqis, &quot;But I know that if Saddam Hussein had been there, the man wouldn&apos;t have been released. And he probably wouldn&apos;t -- you know, would have been executed. So it is -- <strong>as bad as the incident is, in my view, it is a sign that Iraqis feel a lot freer to express themselves</strong>.&quot;</p>
