<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155327/http://www.prospectparkzoo.com/">Prospect Park Zoo</a> has two female sea lions who were orphaned and stranded off Point Hueneme, CA. According to the WCS, &quot;Upon rescue, the pups were brought to Six Flags Vallejo in Ventura County California for initial care and rehabilitation. They were brought to Prospect Park Zoo on a recommendation from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service after it was determined they were unlikely to survive in the wild.&quot; They are doing well and are learning &quot;basic behaviors&quot; from the zookeepers. They join two other female sea lions there.</p>

<p>Two male California sea lions now at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155327/http://www.queenszoo.com/">Queens Zoo</a> originally hail from the Pacific Northwest: &quot;They came from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife as part of a local wildlife management project in Bonneville, Ore. Animal staff from the Queens Zoo and a veterinarian from the WCS Zoological Health Program went to the Pacific Northwest to examine, care for, and begin basic training of the two bulls at a local holding facility. They worked closely with the animals for nearly a month before transporting them to their new home.&quot; Now there are four bachelor sea lions at the Queens Zoo.<br>
 <br>
Finally, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155327/http://www.bronxzoo.com/">Bronx Zoo</a>&apos;s Indy had a female pup (her dad is Kiani, who is now &quot;the breeding bull at the New York Aquarium&quot;). The pup joins Indy, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155327/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/photos_video_rescued_california_sea.php">2012 rescue sea lion named Halftime</a>, Margaretta, McCabe, and Nav at the Astor Court. Here&apos;s the Bronx Zoo gang:</p>
