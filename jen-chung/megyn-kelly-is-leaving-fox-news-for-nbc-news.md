<p>Fox News&apos; star anchor, Megyn Kelly, is heading to broadcast television: She&apos;s joining NBC News in a big way. A press release from the network says that Kelly will be anchoring a new weekday, hour-long daytime program as well as &quot;anchor a new Sunday evening news magazine show&quot; and become &quot;an important contributor to NBC&#x2019;s breaking news coverage as well as the network&#x2019;s political and special events coverage.&quot;</p>

<p>On her Facebook page, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/https://www.facebook.com/MegynKelly/posts/1796034523992345">Kelly posted this note</a>:</p><blockquote>Over a dozen years ago I started at Fox News in a job that would change my life. Now, I have decided to end my time at FNC, incredibly enriched for the experiences I&apos;ve had. I have agreed to join NBC News, where I will be launching a new daytime show Monday through Friday, along with a Sunday evening news magazine program. I will also participate in NBC&apos;s breaking news coverage and its political and special events coverage.<p></p>

<p>While I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox, I am delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge. I remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch, and especially to all of the FNC viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters. More to come soon.</p>

<p>Happy New Year, and God bless.</p></blockquote>NBC News president Andrew Lack said, &quot;Megyn is an exceptional journalist and news anchor, who has had an extraordinary career. She&#x2019;s demonstrated tremendous skill and poise, and we&#x2019;re lucky to have her.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Kelly, originally a corporate litigator, started her TV news career at the ABC affiliate in Washington D.C., WJLA, and then joined Fox News as a D.C.-based contributor, before becoming one of the network&apos;s top personalities, with her own program, <em>The Kelly File</em>, and high-profile involvement as co-anchor for presidential election coverage and debate moderator.</p>

<p>She is also considered to be instrumental in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/roger_ailes_officially_forced_out_o.php">fall of Fox News founder and CEO Roger Ailes</a> after former Fox News colleague Gretchen Carlson accused Ailes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/11/gretchen_carlsons_ailes.php">torpedoing her career</a> because she turned down his advances. After Carlson&apos;s bombshell lawsuit, Fox News&apos; parent company initiated an internal review, which is when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/19/report_megyn_kelly_told_investigato.php">Kelly described</a> how Ailes allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/03/megyn_kelly_ailes_fox.php">sexually harassed her</a>.</p>

<p>Her profile grew larger when, in 2015, then Republican candidate (now President-elect) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/08/donald_trumps_menstruation_comments.php">Donald Trump implied she was menstruating</a>. </p>

<p>While Kelly has &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/http://crooksandliars.com/2016/10/megyn-kelly-goes-rogue-michael-moore-kelly">gone rogue</a>&quot; and suggested she&apos;s more open-minded than the Fox News persona, she has said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106033449/http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/08/04/gop-debate-moderator-megyn-kelly-has-long-histo/204729">some pretty nutty things</a>:</p>
