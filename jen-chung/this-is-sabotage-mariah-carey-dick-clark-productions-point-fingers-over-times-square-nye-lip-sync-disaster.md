<p>Mariah Carey is fighting back after her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/01/mariah_carey_nye.php#photo-1">trainwreck of a nationally televised New Year&apos;s Eve performance</a>, with the superstar and her team now accusing the producers of ABC&apos;s Times Square NYE show of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7640608/mariah-carey-rep-technical-problems-bungle-new-years-show-dick-clark">set[ting] her up to fail.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Carey was the headliner for <em>Dick Clark&apos;s Rockin&apos; New Year&apos;s Eve</em>, performing right before midnight. Around the 1:10 minute mark, Carey&apos;s song &quot;Emotions&quot; plays, but Carey apparently can&apos;t hear it and just talks over the music:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkTy_vSPkWc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/01/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-performance-sabotage-emotion/">Sources close to Carey tell TMZ</a> &quot;they repeatedly complained to execs at Dick Clark Productions that her &apos;inner ears&apos; -- aka earpieces -- were NOT working.&quot; During an interview with host Ryan Seacrest, Carey apparently had issues hearing over the crowd noise (there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/01/photos_times_square_rings_in_new_ye.php">were 2.5 million people there</a>), and her team claims they were promised Carey would be on &quot;a different frequency when she hit the stage and there would be no problem.&quot; </p>

<p>But the source says the issues with the earpieces continued: &quot;To make matters worse and even more suspicious, Mariah&apos;s people say when she got on stage the prompter wasn&apos;t working.  The prompter has the lyrics when they appear in the song as well as stage cues. Mariah ripped the inner earpiece out -- out of frustration -- and thought she had a fighting chance just listening to the music, but the crowd was so loud in Times Square she could hear nothing.&quot; </p>

<p>Carey&apos;s team believes that Dick Clark Productions created the situation for higher ratings, and allegedly emailed DCP saying, &quot;This is sabotage.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They told her it would be fine once she was on stage,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7640608/mariah-carey-rep-technical-problems-bungle-new-years-show-dick-clark">said Nicole Perna</a>, a publicist for Carey.&quot; However, that was not the case and they were again told that her ear piece was not working. Instead of endeavoring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.&quot;</p>

<p>Dick Clark Productions fired back, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mariah-carey-dick-clark-productions-new-years-rockin-eve-1201950973/">issuing a statement</a>:</p><blockquote>As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists. To suggest that DCP, as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year&#x2019;s Rockin&#x2019; Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. <p></p>

<p>In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, however, an initial investigation has indicated that (Dick Clark Productions) had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve performance. We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the industry.</p></blockquote>Naturally, Mimi&apos;s people are not happy with that statement, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/02/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-earpiece-dick-clark/">TMZ reports</a>, &quot;Our Mariah sources insist after the performance, people from Dick Clark Productions were &apos;screaming&apos; about the malfunction, with one production person saying, &apos;I don&apos;t care that her ears didn&apos;t work. She could&apos;ve just winged it.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>Also, TMZ&apos;s source says that Dick Clark Productions &quot;begged for her to sing, and she did it for free. One Mariah source tells TMZ, &apos;We could be in Aspen right now having the best time instead of being in dog s*** Times Square that smelled like a f****** sewer.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, Mariah was just in Aspen, thanks to Airbnb! </p>

<p>NY Times chief pop music critic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105032740/http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/arts/music/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-live-performance.html">Jon Pareles writes</a> that performing on NYE in Times Square is a &quot;thankless&quot; gig: &quot;It&#x2019;s cold in Times Square; it&#x2019;s loud and crowded. It&#x2019;s an outdoor stage in the middle of a city; it&#x2019;s one segment of a long show, not a concert production controlled by the star.&quot; And, after pointing out how Carey&apos;s voice is no longer the powerhouse it was once was, he says she&apos;s still a star: </p><blockquote>Ms. Carey could have smiled her way through another lip-sync, hitting her marks with her dancers, and it would have been one more forgettable television performance. There would have been a little ripple of complaints that she was lip-syncing, followed by the collective shrug that lip-syncing is now business as usual. Instead, bravely, Ms. Carey was set up to sing that strenuous song live, outdoors, in 45-degree weather. Then, for whatever reasons, she backed out and set off the first pop feeding frenzy of the year. Technical problems, temperament, nerves &#x2014; or could it be some perverse genius calculation? One of a celebrity&#x2019;s main jobs is to draw attention, and this was a spectacle that drew comment worldwide &#x2014; a grand diva moment that was noticed, and will be remembered, the way a perfect performance never would.</blockquote>Exactly: It&apos;s Mariah&apos;s World and we&apos;re just living in it:<p></p>
