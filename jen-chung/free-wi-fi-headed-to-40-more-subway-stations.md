<p>You&apos;ll soon be able to refresh your Gmail and post a photo to Instagram (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223104919/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">email a tip to Gothamist</a>) a little more easily during your subway commute: The MTA and Transit Wireless are announcing that 40 more subway stations will be wired for WiFi service.</p>

<p>Of the 40 stations, 11 will be in Manhattan and 29 will be in Queens, including Jackson Heights/Roosevelt Avenue Station, Jamaica Center Station, Court Square Station, 42 Street Bryant Park Station, 34 Street Herald Square Station and Grand Central 42 Street Station.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223104919/http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/10162014-transitWiFi">press release from Governor Cuomo&apos;s office</a> says this will &quot;[connect] a total 47 million riders monthly,&quot; adding, &quot;The completion of Phases I and II are part of seven phases to wire all 277 underground stations by 2017, and work has already begun to bring another 39 stations online by spring 2015... Phase III of the project will include the Flushing Main Street Station in Queens, as well as stations in Lower Manhattan, West Harlem and Washington Heights. Major stations in Phase III include the Fulton Street Station, 125 Street Station and the new 34 Street 7 Station when it opens next year.&quot; New York City Transit President Carmen Bianco said, &quot;<strong>I look forward to bringing stations in the Bronx and Brooklyn online in the near future.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><br>The MTA has been rolling out WiFi to stations since 2011. Cuomo said, &quot;Adding and improving wireless service at more subway stations provides a much-anticipated boost to riders&#x2019; experience in one of the world&#x2019;s busiest and oldest subway systems, while offering an added level of security.&quot;</p>

<p>And MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast said in a statement, &quot;Bringing wireless service into our subway system is the latest milestone in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x2019;s effort to use technology to improve the service we provide for our customers. Whether you&#x2019;re checking your email, calling your kids or looking for emergency assistance, wireless service will bring the conveniences we&#x2019;re used to above ground into the subway system.&quot;</p>

<p>The press release also notes, &quot;Ridership can select the SSID Transit Wireless Wi-Fi on their mobile devices to connect and have the opportunity to view a short Royal Caribbean International video to access the free Wi-Fi service.&quot; And there&apos;s an explanation about how subway WiFi works:</p><blockquote>Wireless carriers who have contracted with Transit Wireless to provide voice and data service to their customers in underground New York City subway stations co-locate their Base Stations with Transit Wireless&#x2019; Optical distribution equipment at a Transit Wireless Base Station Hotel, which is a resilient, fault-tolerant commercial facility with redundant air-conditioning and power. <p></p>

<p>Base Stations are provided by wireless carriers for each band and technology; 700-LTE, 850-Cellular, 1900-PCS, 2100-AWS and other. These Base Stations connect to Transit Wireless&#x2019; Radio Interface and Optical Distribution System in the Base Station Hotel. Radio signals are combined, converted to optical signals and distributed on Transit Wireless&#x2019; fiber optic cable through ducts under city streets to subway stations where the optical cables connect to multi-band Remote Fiber Nodes.</p>

<p>Remote Fiber Nodes are located on every platform, mezzanine and at various points within public access passageways. Coaxial cable is connected to each Remote Fiber Node and extends signals to strategically located antennas throughout each subway station. Utilizing this approach, low-level radio signals are evenly distributed providing seamless coverage from above ground to underground stations. A Network Management System monitors the service; detects problems and provides alerts so technicians can be dispatched if needed.</p></blockquote><p></p>
