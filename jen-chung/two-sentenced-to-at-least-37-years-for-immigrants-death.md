Prosecutors had said that Keith Phoenix and Hakim Scott <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323184344/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/14/brooklyn_hate_crime_victim.php">brutally beat Jose Sucuzhanay</a> because they thought he was gay (Sucuzhanay was walking arm-in-arm with his brother) and yelled anti-Hispanic and anti-gay epithets during the attack. Phoenix got  37 years to life (25 years for murder as a hate crime, plus 12 years for attempted assault as a hate crime), while Scott received  37 years (25 years for manslaughter and 12 years for attempted assault).<p></p>
