Yesterday, Jacob visited Koch, who was recuperating in the hospital from being shot in the hand; the boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164356/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/boy_visits_shot_cop_who_saved_him_fYr8XLYspNa8bs1dAMjHcO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">says he told the cop</a>, &quot;&apos;Thanks for everything; you saved my life.&apos; He was like, &#x2018;Anytime.&apos;&quot; Jacob added, &quot;He&apos;s a pretty cool guy.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Rodriguez apparently had an order of protection against Bernazard&#x2014;they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164356/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/boy_visits_shot_cop_who_saved_him_fYr8XLYspNa8bs1dAMjHcO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">reportedly dated last year</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164356/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/shot-father-day-continues-recovery-article-1.1374790">a cousin said</a>, &quot;He&#x2019;s been stalking her for three years after renting a room from her for a month.&quot; He entered her home on Sunday and his visit soon became violent, with Bernazard allegedly beating the 34-year-old woman. When little Jacob tried to protect his mother, he was also beaten&#x2014;so he ran out to get help.</p>

<p>Soon after Koch entered, he and Bernazard began <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164356/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/nyregion/boy-praised-for-saving-his-mother-in-an-attack.html?_r=0">struggling for Koch&apos;s gun</a>, which went off. One bullet went through Koch&apos;s left hand and hit Bernazard, who was also hit by two other shots. Rodriguez needed 11 stitches to close a laceration from Bernazard.</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Kelly said that Koch required many surgeries because the bullet shattered bones in his hand. (Koch is right-handed.) Jacob said, &quot;I&#x2019;m thinking about becoming a police officer because of what Joe did. He saved me and my mom. Maybe I can do that for others.&quot; </p>

<p>Bernazard has been charged with assault, criminal contempt, aggravated harassment, burglary, endangering the welfare of a child and resisting arrest. </p>
