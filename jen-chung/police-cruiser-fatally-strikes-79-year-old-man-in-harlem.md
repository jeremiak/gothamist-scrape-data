</div></div>					<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 4:20 p.m., a police cruiser traveling south on Broadway (between 135th and 136th Streets) struck a 79-year-old man who was crossing the street from a median.  The man, Javier Jackson, was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital in critical condition and was pronounced dead two hours later.  </p>

<p>Police say the cruiser&apos;s lights and sirens were on and that the cruiser was on its way to assist another officer.  (The NYPD also says that an investigation is ongoing.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150043/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cop_car_kills_man_VdNJcO67BL7iYZSuTh7y3O">According to the Post</a>, some &quot;witnesses said the car&apos;s lights were off, and some who knew Jackson said he was hard of hearing.&quot; </p>

<p>Another witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150043/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/107057/police-car-strikes--kills-harlem-pedestrian">told NY1</a>, &quot;He was on top of the car. Then the lady, she was driving it, then when they stopped then he fell... She was just hysterical. She was crying, and she&apos;s going through it. It was a mistake, but she should&apos;ve slowed down at the intersection.&quot;  </p>
