					<p>Real estate developer Brookfield Property Partners announced today that it will partner with Park Tower Group to build two high-rise rental properties along the East River in Greenpoint. One building will be 30 stories, and the other will be 40 stories.</p>

<p>The Park Tower Group&apos;s Greenpoint Landing project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918205713/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/27/greenpoint_landing.php#photo-2">was announced over the summer</a>&#x2014;in total, it&apos;s a 10 building complex covering 22 acres with 5,500 housing units. Of the 5,500 units, 1,400 will be &quot;affordable&quot; housing, or 25.45% of the total number of units.</p>

<p>According to Brookfield, &quot;Construction is expected to commence in the first half of 2016 with an estimated completion in 2019. The first tower is 30 stories with 365 units; the second is 40 stories with 415 units. Total project costs are estimated to be $600 million.&quot; The company&apos;s CEO Ric Clark said, &quot;It is compelling to be part of a large development in a vibrant community that will provide housing choices for many New Yorkers.&quot; </p>

<p>As for the other buildings, 21 Commercial Street is expected to be completed in the summer of 2016; 5 Blue Slip is due to be finished in summer of 2017; and 33 Eagle Street as a completion date of December 2016.  At 21 Commercial Street and 5 Blue Slip, the affordable housing units will be open to families earning 30 to 60 percent of the area median income [AMI]; 33 Eagle Street&apos;s affordable housing units will be for families earning 30 to 120 percent of the area median income. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918205713/http://www.nychdc.com/pages/Income-Eligibility.html">The AMI for NYC</a> in 2015 is $86,300 for a family of four.)</p>

Greenpoint Landing developers say the project will bring &quot;four acres of dedicated open space; including a waterfront esplanade, public parks, a Great Lawn and a reconstructed public pier.&quot; </p>
