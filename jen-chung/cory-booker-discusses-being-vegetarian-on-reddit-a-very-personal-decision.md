<p>Newark Mayor Cory Booker, everyone&apos;s favorite hero and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019233831/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/16/video_chris_christie_hates_cory_boo.php#photo-1">Chris Christie&apos;s nemesis</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019233831/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/14/extra_extra_2319.php">sat down</a> for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019233831/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wljxk/i_am_cory_booker_mayor_of_newark_nj_founder_of/">Reddit Ask-Me-Anything session</a> and fielded questions ranging from Facebook&apos;s donation to Newark schools, what he thought when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019233831/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/newark_mayor_cory_booker_rescues_wo.php">running into a burning building to save a woman</a> (&quot;can&apos;t believe I&apos;m so out of shape climbing a flight of stairs&quot;), and <br>
how he feels about comparisons to President Obama (&quot;He went to an elite highfalutin law school: Harvard. I went to a gritty, inner city, law school: Yale&quot;).  And then he discussed his love affair with two dudes... named Ben &amp; Jerry.</p>

<p>A question came up about being vegetarian and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019233831/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wljxk/i_am_cory_booker_mayor_of_newark_nj_founder_of/c5ecz1g">Booker explained</a>:</p><blockquote>As for the vegetarian thing. . . I became a vegi almost exactly 20 years ago. I was a competitive athlete back then and wanted to see what could take my body to the next level, also I was reading everything I could about food, where it came from, what impact it had both on me and my world. So in 1992, I decided to experiment, to try it for 3 to 6 months. And WOW! when I did my athletic performance took off, I felt so much better and it comported with other values and ideas I was exploring at the time, so I decided that this is what is best for me. It was a very personal decision. I tried to be vegan for a while too. But that didn&apos;t last long. There is something about those two guys I love so much, that I lean on, that I so badly just want to hug: Ben &amp; Jerry - I couldn&apos;t leave them. . . I think those guys need me too much. Ben . . . Jerry, I&apos;m here for you. . . Call me. . .</blockquote><p></p>
