<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_ainchok.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005042im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_ainchok.jpg" width="220" height="278" class="image-right"> </span>After Thursday night&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005042/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/yanks_have_more_work_to_do.php">lost chance</a> to clinch the ALCS, the Yankees face off against the Angels tonight.  The Daily News&apos; Mike Lupica is impatient and frustrated and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005042/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2009/10/24/2009-10-24_lupica_yankees_game6.html">tells the Bronx Bombers today</a>:</p><blockquote> You&apos;re the Yankees and you&apos;ve won 109 games already this season, and when you&apos;re that good, when you&apos;re this loaded, you can&apos;t let it all come down to a one-game season, not after you had the Angels down three games to one. You stay away from Game7 the way Brian Fuentes stays away from Alex Rodriguez now. You don&apos;t wait. You bring the World Series back to New York tonight.<p></p>

<p>You&apos;re the Yankees and you shouldn&apos;t even be playing Game6, you should have put the Angels away after six runs in the top of the seventh Thursday night. Only you couldn&apos;t. The Angels were too tough and proud to let you do it.</p></blockquote>Team captain Derek Jeter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005042/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/jeter_co_not_worried_with_alcs_back_FSkSS4QwzdCJvByyOrwWeK">responded to complaints</a> about the Yankees not winning it in Anaheim, &quot;Coming into this series, all the talk was how they&apos;ve dominated us over the years and how they were going to be a big problem for us. And then, we&apos;re up 3-1 and we lose one game and then people say, &apos;Oh, well, we wasted an opportunity&apos; and &apos;What&apos;s wrong with the Yankees?&apos; It&apos;s a long series. Last I checked, I think we&apos;re in pretty good shape.&quot;  But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005042/http://gothamist.com/2004/10/21/the_empire_does_not_strike_back.php">memories of 2004</a> are too much!!! We guess that&apos;s other columnists are telling fans to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005042/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2009/10/24/2009-10-24_smith_yankees.html">back away from the ledge</a>.<p></p>

<p>And Andy Pettitte, who is tonight&apos;s starting pitcher, said, &quot;&quot;This was not going to be an easy series. I know I said all along that it was going to be a battle, and that&apos;s what we&apos;ve got on our hands.&quot;</p>
