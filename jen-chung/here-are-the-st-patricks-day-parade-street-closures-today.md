White House North: &quot;Law enforcement sources tell us police brass has instructed the rank and file to make sure the floats and parade marchers don&apos;t stop in front of Trump Tower in protest of the prez. What&apos;s more ... spectators will be barred from watching the parade on the sidewalk in front of Trump&apos;s building. Cops tell us they&apos;re worried protesters on floats and afoot will try to stop the parade in its tracks with a flash demonstration. They&apos;re also worried about demonstrations getting out of control at the flash point.&quot; <p></p>
