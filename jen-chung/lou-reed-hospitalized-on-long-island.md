<p>Lou Reed is reportedly recovering at a Long Island hospital after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010931/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/lou_reed_rushed_to_li_hosp_GsFgYd2wRIa77Q4Czhd7mJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">&quot;rushed to the emergency room&quot;</a> yesterday morning.</p>

<p>According to the Post, there was &quot;an emergency call for an adult male suffering from dehydration.&quot; On the positive side: &quot;A woman who answered a phone in the [Southampton Hospital] unit where Reed was being treated said, &apos;Everything&#x2019;s fine.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Last month, his wife, artist Laurie Anderson, revealed that Reed had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010931/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/lou_reed_recovering_after_liver_tra.php">undergone a life-saving liver transplant</a>. Reed later told fans via a Facebook message, &quot;I am a triumph of modern medicine, physics and chemistry. I am bigger and stronger than stronger than ever <em>[sic]</em>.&quot; And yesterday, on his Facebook page, he posted a link to Harry&apos;s Circumcision <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010931/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151738143975953&amp;set=a.463645835952.237679.89511870952&amp;type=1">&quot;21 hours ago&quot;</a> (which would make that about noon yesterday). </p>
