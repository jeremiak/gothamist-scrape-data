title: If You Are Currently Stressed Out, Consider Adopting These Cats & Dogs
---

	
										<p>On Election Night, in between trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013559/http://dcist.com/2016/11/election_2016_results.php">keep up with the returns</a> and freaking out, I would run over to the couch where two of my cats were sleeping to pet them so I could just have a few moments of calm. Well, now I&apos;m going to lobby for a whole army of cats because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013559/http://dcist.com/2016/11/trump_i_have_great_respect_for_obam.php">this shit is real</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013559/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/arrival_of_cheeto_fuhrer.php">scary</a> and pets are medically proven to make you feel serene.</p>

<p>Here are just seven cats and dogs available for adoption at the ASPCA&#x2014;you may need a fuzzy companion or two to make it through the next four years. </p>
