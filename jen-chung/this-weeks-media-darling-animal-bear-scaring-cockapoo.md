I thought he was gonna wake up the whole neighborhood.&quot;  WCBS even uses a clip from the movie Anchorman, noting that the Will Ferrell movie was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055210/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20191737,00.html">last time a dog had saved humans</a> from bears.  Pawlee&apos;s dogsitter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055210/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08262008/news/regionalnews/bears_fear_plucky_pup_126150.htm">tells the Post</a>, &quot;<strong>He&apos;s crazy. He has a lot of energy. He&apos;s always barking at things.</strong>&quot;  And let&apos;s flashback to 2006 when Jack the cat scared a bear up the tree <i>twice</i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055210/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/10/picture_of_the_4.php">see the photo</a>). </p>
