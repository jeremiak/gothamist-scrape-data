<p>Well, everyone wanted the 2008 election to begin after the long primary season, so now we get round-the-clock accusations and recriminations!  While Barack Obama&apos;s campaign has been battered over its vice-presidential search team, to the point where one of the three members, James Johnson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054335/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/11/AR2008061103562.html?hpid=topnews">resigned yesterday</a>, John McCain&apos;s campaign has to deal with a Wednesday Today show appearance that could be edited down to a haunting soundbite.</p>

<p>McCain was being questioned by Matt Lauer about when the candidate thought troops could be withdrawn (video above).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054335/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/us/politics/12campaign.html?ref=politics">McCain responded</a>, &quot;No, but that&#x2019;s not too important&quot; before explaining the concern is casualties, &quot;We will be able to withdraw. But the key to it is that we don&#x2019;t want any more Americans in harm&#x2019;s way.&#x201D;  Obama&apos;s campaign and the Democrats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054335/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/11005.html">pounced on the moment</a>, calling McCain out of touch, while McCain&apos;s campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054335/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/06/11/2008-06-11_john_mccains_taking_a_bruisin_on_confusi.html">attacked Obama&apos;s stance on Iraq</a>.</p>

<p>Obama campaign-wise, as for why Johnson, who had helped Walter Mondale and John Kerry search for running mates, stepped down from the campaign, the Wall Street Journal reported as Johnson, as the former head of Fannie Mae, had received a number of favorable home loans from Countrywide Financial (company most associated with subprime mortgage crisis) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054335/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/11/AR2008061103562.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post noted</a> he was perhaps too generously compensated from Fannie Mae.  McCain&apos;s spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054335/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/11022.html">said of the resignation</a>, &quot;The American people have reason to question the judgment of a candidate who has shown he will only make the right call when under pressure from the news media.&quot;</p>
