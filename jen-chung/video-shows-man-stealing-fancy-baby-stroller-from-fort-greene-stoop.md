<p>A high-end baby stroller, plus the bunting and warming muffs, was snatched from a Brooklyn brownstone stoop on Thursday. However, a surveillance camera captured the crime and now the police are hoping the public can identify the suspect who took off with over $1,000 in baby gear.</p>

<p>The grand larceny took place near Carlton Avenue and Willoughby Avenue, around 12:30 p.m. on March 30. The NYPD says, &quot;[A]n unidentified male removed an UPPA-baby Vista stroller without permission or authority. The stroller contained an Enfant Blanket and an Enfant Warmer and had a combined value of $1,030.  The 35-year-old male victim provided surveillance video that shows the unidentified male remove the stroller from the landing in front of the top of the front steps.&quot; </p>

<p>The latest model of the UPPABaby Vista retails <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403190227/https://www.amazon.com/UPPAbaby-2017-VISTA-Stroller-Dennison/dp/B01MY06RYU/ref=dp_ob_title_baby?th=1">for $839.98</a> (it comes with a bassinet), and the 7 a.m. Enfant blanket is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403190227/https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dbaby-products&amp;field-keywords=7+a.m.+enfant+blanket">around $150-210</a> and warmer muffs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403190227/https://www.amazon.com/7AM-Enfant-Stroller-WarMMuffs-Caregivers/dp/B006WOK9IG/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=baby-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1491051981&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=7+a.m.+enfant+muffs">are $30</a>.</p>

<p>The footage shows him checking out the stoop and stroller and driving off&#x2014;and then coming back, with a hood on, to take the stroller. <br>
