<p>A year and a half ago, a photograph of a police officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427014451/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/29/nypd_officer.php">buying boots for a barefoot homeless man went viral</a> after the NYPD posted it on Facebook. Now, a similar warm-hearted photograph posted on their Facebook yesterday is taking off.</p>

<p>The image shows a police officer helping a blind woman cross 8th Avenue on Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427014451/https://www.facebook.com/NYPD/photos/pb.262068223869967.-2207520000.1397305461./615113735232079/?type=3&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-b-iad.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-frc3%2Ft1.0-9%2F1607107_615113735232079_4098220748855024780_n.jpg&amp;size=763%2C620&amp;fbid=615113735232079">The NYPD wrote</a>, &quot;This photo, captured by a passerby and sent to the #NYPD, was taken as the police officer walked the woman two blocks to her destination. The individual who snapped the photo expressed how kind New York City police officers are on a daily basis and was happy to be able to capture one of the many moments.&quot;</p>

<p>The police officer is NYPD Transit Counter-Terror Team Officer Peterson Bastien. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427014451/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/11/new-yorkers-beguiled-by-photo-of-nypd-officer-helping-blind-woman-cross-street/">WCBS 2 reports that</a> he &quot;had just exited the 59th Street-Columbus Circle subway station when someone told him an elderly woman needed help... Officer Bastien introduced himself to the woman - whose name and age have not been released. The woman, who is blind, told Bastien she was trying to find the express bus to Madison Avenue, police said.&quot; He took her to the bus stop, waited with her, helped her board and told the driver her destination. </p>

<p>The photograph has over 24,000 Facebook likes so far. Police Commissioner Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427014451/https://twitter.com/CommissBratton/statuses/454746253289848832">Tweeted</a>, &quot;&apos;Cops count, police matter&apos; One of NYC&apos;s Finest &amp; kindest for sure. Makes me #proud.&quot;</p>
