<p>When someone posted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507111340/http://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/n23ra/i_made_my_own_subjective_map_of_new_jersey/">subjective map of New Jersey to reddit</a>, it went viral, with its depictions of where &quot;Executives living in mansions with Mercedes Benzes,&quot; &quot;Sad black people and corruption,&quot; &quot;The Hill People,&quot; &quot;Ghetto in the woods,&quot; &quot;Pretty Much Alabama&quot; and more were.  Then Rutgers University graduate and current part time research assistant Joe Steinfeld stepped up and claimed credit.  He tells the Star-Ledger, &quot;I meant it as a joke. It&#x2019;s tongue-in-cheek. It&#x2019;s meant to be silly, meant to be fun.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone thinks it&apos;s fun.  Elizabeth Mayor J. Christian Bollwage&#x2014;the town that would be by &quot;Poor Minorities&quot; and &quot;Russians, Polacks And Toxic Fume&quot;&#x2014;said, &quot;I&#x2019;d ask whoever designed the map to actually travel to these areas to see how vibrant some of the neighborhoods are... It&#x2019;s unfortunate that somebody has enough spare time to do something that is just going to inflame some people and point to the worst possible side of things. I don&#x2019;t find humor in it.&quot;  </p>

<p>Steinfeld <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507111340/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20111207/NJNEWS/312070025/New-Brunswick-resident-recent-Rutgers-grad-creates-satirical-NJ-map-goes-viral?odyssey=mod%7Cmostview">spoke to MyCentralJersey</a>, &quot;Thankfully, most of the feedback has been very positive. A lot of comments have been about how accurate the map was, and many people seemed to feel proud of where I placed them, despite how I worded the labels for their areas. I did, however, receive some criticism for being too general in a lot of the more densely populated areas of the state like Northeastern (New Jersey), as well as leaving out some demographics here and there.&quot;  He added, &quot;We&apos;re more than a Turnpike and a TV show; it&#x2019;s not just oil refineries and suburbs. We have mountains, plenty of forests and farmland, beautiful beaches, and our drivers aren&#x2019;t nearly as bad as they&apos;re cracked up to be!&quot;</p>
