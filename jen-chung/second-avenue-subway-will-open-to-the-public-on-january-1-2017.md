					<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917131517/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/27/second_avenue_delayway.php">a lot of waiting</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917131517/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/12/second_avenue_subway_hopin.php">speculation</a>, the long awaited, long delayed Second Avenue Subway will be ready to roll by the end of the year. There will be a ceremonial first ride on December 31, while full service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917131517/http://www.mta.info/news/2016/12/19/governor-cuomo-announces-time-opening-second-avenue-subway">will open to the public at noon</a> on January 1, 2017. <br>
 <br>
On Sunday night, Governor Andrew Cuomo confirmed that the first phase of the subway line&#x2014;which will bring Q train service to 63rd Street, 72nd Street, 86th Street and 96th Street&#x2014;will open on time. Which means these new maps are only a little premature:</p>

By Sunday, the lead engineer said that the 86th Street station had passed the tests. The 72nd Street station, however, was still being tested.&quot;</p>

<p>Last weekend, Cuomo visited the 72nd and 86th Street stations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917131517/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/10/photos_cautiously_optimistic_cuomo.php#photo-1">emphasizing that he was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot;</a> they would open on time, while touting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917131517/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/11/cuomo_even_money_that_2nd_avenue_su.php#photo-1">his &quot;hands on&quot; role</a> in making sure the project was completed on schedule. He invited some media to tour the station, to show off the open design (it&apos;s similar to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917131517/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/13/7_train_hudson_yards.php#photo-1">open feeling at the Hudson Yards station</a>)&#x2014;at 96th Street, he told WABC 7, &quot;When you get to a place like here, the foot of the steps, you look up, have that ceiling, you have that space&#x2014;you feel like you can breathe.&quot; </p>
