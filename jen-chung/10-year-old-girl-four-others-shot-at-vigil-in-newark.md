	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_05_nvigil.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035655im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_nvigil.jpg" width="365" height="275"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Via WCBS 2</i></div> Last night, gunfire interrupted a Newark, NJ vigil, wounding five people including a five-year-old girl. A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035655/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/05/five_shot_in_newark_after_mour.html#incart_m-rpt-1">told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;[Mourners] were out there drinking all day long &#x2014; that&apos;s probably what heated the whole thing up.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The incident occurred at around 10 p.m., at South 16th Street and Avon Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035655/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/03/cops-5-people-shot-in-newark/">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;A man drove up in a dark-colored vehicle, got out, opened fire and drove off.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035655/http://pix11.com/2013/05/03/young-girl-among-5-shot-in-newark-shooting/#axzz2SFS7sgga">girl was shot in the ankle</a>, while a 22-year-old woman was shot in the buttocks, a 46-year-old woman was shot in the arm, a 48-year-old man was shot in the legs, and a 25-year-old was shot in the arm. </p>

<p>The vigil had been for the victim of a car crash blocks away. This morning, a man who lives in a South 16th Street home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035655/http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/05/five_shot_in_newark_after_mour.html#incart_m-rpt-1">yelled at reporters</a>, &quot;It was my family! Get... up out my house. You only come out here when something happens... We&apos;re killing each other out here!&quot;</p>

<p>The victims are in stable condition and the police are investigating. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035655/http://pix11.com/2013/05/03/young-girl-among-5-shot-in-newark-shooting/#axzz2SFS7sgga">neighbor said</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s time to move. It was quiet up until then. This is really close.&quot;</p>
