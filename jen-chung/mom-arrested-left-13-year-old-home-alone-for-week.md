Winnie Chaffee found out the hard way after spending a week in Taiwan&#x2014;and keeping her adolescent daughter solo in their Croton-on-Hudson home without adult supervision&#x2014;when she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105156/http://www.lohud.com/article/2011104070451">charged with misdemeanor child endangerment</a>. Her lawyer calls this an &quot;unfortunate situation&quot; for the single mom.<p></p>

<p>Last month, a friend of Chaffee&apos;s daughter found out she had been living alone for two days and told his family. The friend&apos;s family took in the girl and called the cops, who decided to let Chaffee&apos;s daughter stay with the friend.  A Croton police officer told the Journal News, &quot;When the mother returned, we interviewed her and obviously she admitted to leaving the child alone. She thought it was OK. She left her with pre-made meals, money, credit cards, whatever the child needed,&quot; adding, &quot;I<strong>f you want to leave your 13-year-old home for like an hour or two to go to dinner or shop, that&apos;s acceptable, depending on how mature the kid is. We obviously felt this was not right and made the arrest</strong>.&quot;  Why are they cramping Chaffee&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105156/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/mom_suggests_leaving_kids_in_city_p.php">free-range kid parenting</a> style!</p>

<p>Chaffee&apos;s lawyer Casey Rakob said she was out-of-work and went to Taiwan for a business contract, &quot;This poor lady doesn&#x2019;t deserve exposure for this,&quot; and &quot;She did try to make sure the child was looked in on. This is not a case of a bad mother.&quot; But her neighbors told WCBS 880 that Chaffee&apos;s actions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105156/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/07/police-westchester-county-mom-left-13-year-old-daughter-home-alone-while-she-went-to-taiwan-for-a-week/">were &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;stupid.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Last year, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105156/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/12/mother_leaves_child_home_alone_for.php">NJ mother was arrested</a> after leaving her 12-year-old at home alone while she went to Washington to get married.</p>
