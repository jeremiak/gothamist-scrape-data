<p>A pair of burglary suspects stole a pet rabbit&#x2014;still in its cage&#x2014;from a Bronx apartment last month, police say.</p>

<p>The Leporidae larceny occurred on June 27th, at 6:01 p.m.: According to the NYPD, &quot;two unidentified males entered an apartment through an unlocked front door located in the vicinity of Crotona Park East and 174th Street. Once inside, the males removed a rabbit inside a cage, a metal bracelet and a passport.&quot;</p>
