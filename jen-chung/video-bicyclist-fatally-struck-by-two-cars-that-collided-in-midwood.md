</div></div>					<p>A bicyclist was killed when two cars barreled into him on a Brooklyn street just before 10 p.m. last night. The incident occurred in Midwood, at East 12th Street and Avenue P, and police say that collision was caused by a driver who blew a red light.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD&apos;s investigation so far:</p><blockquote>Vehicle #1, a 2012 Honda Accord was traveling in the left lane of westbound Avenue P and did disobey the steady red light at the intersection of Avenue P and East 12 Street, striking vehicle #2, a 2015 Infiniti Q50, which was traveling southbound on East 12 Street in the favor of the green traffic signal. <p></p>

<p>Vehicle #1 did strike vehicle #2 on the driver&apos;s side, causing both vehicles to veer south west, and strike a bicyclist who was traveling northbound on East 12 Street within the west crosswalk. Both vehicle #1 and vehicle #2 did then strike vehicle #3, a 2010 Chevrolet Equinox, and vehicle #4, a 2014 Lexus ES350, which were both parked and unoccupied along the south east curb line of Avenue P. </p></blockquote>Video from a surveillance camera shows the cyclist crossing the street:<p></p>

<p>When officers responded, they found the cyclist with trauma to the head and body. He was taken to Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>The Accord&apos;s driver, a 26-year-old male, was taken to Lutheran Hospital with chest pains while the 20-year-old male driver of the Infiniti went to Kings County Hospital with minor neck and back pain. </p>

<p>The Accord driver was also taken into custody with charges pending.</p>
