<p>A 15-year-old boy who somehow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175625/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/teen-falls-floor-queens-lirr-substation-building-article-1.3238012">got inside a Queens MTA substation</a> fell about 10 feet. </p>

<p>The building, on Atlantic Avenue between 97th and 98th Streets, was described as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175625/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/teen-falls-floor-queens-lirr-substation-building-article-1.3238012">unmanned</a>&quot; by the Daily News and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175625/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Teen-Falls-Into-hole-in-Queens-FDNY-woodhaven-lirr-station-427697213.html">abandoned</a>&quot; by NBC New York, which noted its &quot;boarded up&quot; windows.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175625/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/teen-falls-floor-queens-lirr-substation-building-article-1.3238012">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;Billy Renderos, 51, an LIRR electrician who was on the scene, said the teen successfully scaled the building to break in a third-floor window but didn&#x2019;t see the holes in the floor inside. &apos;He must&apos;ve missed and fell down from the third floor all the way down to the second floor,&apos; said Renderos. &apos;When they found him he was inside on the ground wailing.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The teenager was apparently conscious when he was removed from the building on a stretcher. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170611175625/http://abc7ny.com/news/teen-recovering-after-fall-inside-queens-mta-power-station-/2082107/">Witnesses told WABC 7</a> that he appeared to be in a lot of pain:</p>

<p>The teenager was taken to Elmhurst Hospital.</p>

<p>WABC 7 added, &quot;[I]nvestigators appeared to retrace a path from the tracks to the building. The LIRR elevated track line has been out of use since the 1960s. Residents have complained for years that the abandoned elevated line is unsafe, because it is so easily accessible.&quot;</p>
