The unions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623152203/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/03/starledger_keeps_hopes_alive.php">agreed to new deals</a> and the Times explains that buyouts will be given to &quot;about 150 news employees who requested them.&quot; A memo said that many employees applied for buyouts and some will be turned down.  Some employees said It&apos;s possible that the paper will hire new employees, too.</p>
