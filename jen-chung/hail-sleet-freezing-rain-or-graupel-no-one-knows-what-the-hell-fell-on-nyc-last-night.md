<p>Last night, hard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927232519/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/nyc_gets_thunderhail_visit.php">naturally occurring objects started falling from the atmosphere</a> (sometimes accompanied by thunder), creating a bit of a mess and making New Yorkers wonder if it was thundersleet or thunderhail.  It&apos;s a meteorological mystery!</p>

<p>Ink Lake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927232519/http://inklake.typepad.com/ink_lake/2011/03/the-white-stuff.html">suggested it was graupel</a> (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927232519/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graupel">&quot;small hail&quot;</a>) but our own Joe Schumacher tells us, &quot;The Weather Service mentioned getting reports of pea sized hail, but they themselves only reported light snow in Central Park.  That it was a thunderstorm also points to hail (though it doesn&apos;t exclude sleet).  Graupel wouldn&apos;t have been so loud, which also makes me think it was hail rather than sleet.&quot; So we suppose Pat Kiernan&apos;s guess that it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927232519/http://twitter.com/patkiernan/status/50702897108877312">freezing rain</a> was wrong. </p>

<p>One day, we&apos;re going to find a chart that clearly oultlines hail vs. sleet vs. freezing rain vs. graupel, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927232519/http://www.liveweatherblogs.com/prometweatherblogs/2/2/4263/WINTER-WEATHER-101:GRAUPEL-,-SLEET-VS-HAIL-,-FREEZING-RAIN">this will have to do for now</a>.</p>
