<p>New York magazine&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020415/http://nymag.com/news/features/andrew-cuomo-2013-4/index3.html#print">big cover story about Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> can be summed up in this sentence: &quot;Cuomo may be this country&#x2019;s best politician&#x2014;in the interest-swapping, nut-&#xAD;cutting, backroom sense&#x2014;since Lyndon Baines Johnson.&quot;</p>

<p>Cuomo&apos;s ego is a big part of the story&#x2014;he yells to the writer Chris Smith, during a phone call, &quot;That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020415/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/cuomo_signs_sweeping_gun_control_bi.php">gun bill will save lives</a>! That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020415/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/24/gay_marriage_legalized_in_new_york.php">marriage-equality bill</a>, millions of people were affected! If I drop dead and they put me in a box tonight, that marriage-equality bill and that gun bill, those will have such a profound impact for generations!&quot;&#x2014;and the article also covers the corruption issues in Albany and the long road to 2016. But here&apos;s more about the nut-cutting. </p><blockquote>Cuomo may be this country&#x2019;s best politician&#x2014;in the interest-swapping, nut-&#xAD;cutting, backroom sense&#x2014;since Lyndon Baines Johnson. He also has some of the triangulating skills of his former boss Bill Clinton&#x2014;and some of Clinton&#x2019;s explosive temper. The governor has learned to keep that side of his personality mostly private, but he still blisters aides and adversaries. The governor&#x2019;s contempt for weaker people, and his paranoia about perceived enemies, suggests a less flattering kinship with a third president, Richard Nixon. The relentless calculating can take a toll on subordinates. &#x201C;Working for Andrew is not a mission, it&#x2019;s not a cause,&#x201D; a former aide says. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no movement component to it. It&#x2019;s businesslike, workmanlike.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Just as with LBJ, though, there&#x2019;s subtlety along with the arm-twisting and browbeating.</p></blockquote>Hillary Clinton is, naturally, a prominent phantom in the story since many Democrats are wondering if she&apos;ll run&#x2014;when she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020415/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/01/doctors_say_hillary_clintons_clot_i.php">suffered her blood clot</a>, jokes like &quot;Do you think Andrew tripped Hillary?&quot; were in the air.<p></p>
