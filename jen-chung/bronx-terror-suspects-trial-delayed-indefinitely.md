Not only did federal Judge Colleen McMahon dismiss the jury, she also said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164714/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/terror_trial_put_on_hold_0PtP724iUVEDWA0oxheJ4M?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">she&apos;d consider dismissing the indictment</a>, &quot;No guarantees, gentlemen. No guarantees. But I will listen to bail applications, given everything that has gone on.&quot;  Why?  Because the prosecution didn&apos;t turn over evidence months ago.</p>

<p> James Cromitie, David Williams, Laguerre Payen  and Onta Williams have been in custody since their arrests in May 2009.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164714/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/06/14/2010-06-14_trial_of_alleged_synagogue_bomb_plot_gang_thrown_into_chaos_over_withheld_eviden.html">According to the Daily News</a>, Judge McMahon said &quot;the defense should have gotten the memo from an FBI agent that told security staff at a National Guard base in upstate Newburgh not to worry if they came across suspect James Cromitie.&quot; McMahon described the memo, &quot;He [the agent] went to the manager of Stewart Air Force Base and he said, &apos;You haven&apos;t got anything to worry about, because it&apos;s extremely unlikely that this guy could do anything without our source.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The men&apos;s defense lawyers have claimed that they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164714/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/18/defense_lawyers_want_synagogue_terr.php">entrapped by a government informant</a>. The judge said the defense lawyers should have received the memo months ago, but they only received it last week. One of the defense lawyers said if it wasn&apos;t &quot;for the insistence and persistence of the government&#x2019;s informant, this case never would have occurred. You never would have heard of our four guys.&quot;</p>
