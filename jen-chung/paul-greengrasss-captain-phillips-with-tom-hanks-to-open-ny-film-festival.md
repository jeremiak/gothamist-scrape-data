<p>A film based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201644/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/12/container_ship_ashore_negotiations.php">2009 hijacking of a U.S. container ship</a> by Somali pirates will have its world premiere at the New York Film Festival this fall. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201644/http://filmlinc.com/">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a> announced that <em>Captain Phillips</em> will be the Opening Night Gala presentation on September 27.</p>

<p>Director Paul Greengrass&apos;s <em>Bloody Sunday</em> was a past NYFF selection in 2002 and since then, he&apos;s become known for gritty direction of action films (like <em>The Bourne Supremacy</em> and <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em>) as well as ones based on true stories (<em>United 93</em>, which earned him an Oscar nomination; his next film is about the Chicago 7). Tom Hanks plays the captain who leads his crew during the hijacking. The Film Society calls the film &quot;simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama&#x2019;s commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips, and his Somali counterpart, Muse (Barkhad Abdi).  Set on an incontrovertible collision course off the coast of Somalia, both men will find themselves paying the human toll for economic forces outside of their control.&quot; </p>

<p>Muse, a teen when he hijacked the ship, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201644/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/somali_pirates_swashbuckling_gets_h.php">serving a nearly 34-year prison sentence</a>.</p>
