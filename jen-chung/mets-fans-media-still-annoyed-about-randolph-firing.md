<p>The Mets&apos; midnight firing of manager Willie Randolph and two other coaches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612020047/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/17/last_nights_action_what_just_happen.php">continues to piss off</a> various parties.  The Post uses a little bit of Photoshop magic to place a knife in new manager Jerry Manuel&apos;s hand--aimed right at Randolph&apos;s back--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612020047/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06192008/sports/mets/inside_jobbed_116236.htm">for today&apos;s back cover</a>.</p>

<p>Some fans in Syosset sent Mets owner Fred Wilpon a box <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612020047/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-limets0619,0,835698.story">containing five raw chickens</a> (not on ice, either) plus their season tickets.  The fans are Georgi Vodka owner Martin Silver and his employees; Silver explained to Newsday, &quot;The chickens portray [the Mets management] are chickens. The more they smell, the better.&quot; And those tickets are no small thing: They are four box seats located three rows up from third base.  </p>

<p>As for Randolph, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612020047/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/2008/06/18/2008-06-18_willie_randolph_i_deserve_better_than_la-2.html">spoke to reporters outside his NJ home yesterday</a>, &quot;My heart is still with this team.<strong> I&apos;m just disappointed I won&apos;t be the one to lead them. It&apos;s a real numbing kind of feeling. </strong>You&apos;ve been in baseball all your life, and now you have to start thinking of the reality that, at least for the near future, you are [just] a regular Joe.&quot; </p>
