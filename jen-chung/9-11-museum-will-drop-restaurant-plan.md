<p>The 9/11 Memorial and Museum&apos;s plan for a restaurant with a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829012159/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/dining/bacchanal-and-batard-open.html?_r=1">subdued, seasonal, mostly vegetarian menu</a>&quot; has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829012159/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/29/911_museum_removes_911_cheese_plate.php">gone the way of the 9/11 cheese plate</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829012159/http://nypost.com/2014/07/10/911-museum-cafe-drops-booze-gourmet-food/">Post&apos;s Steve Cuozzo reports</a>, &quot;The mezzanine-level cafe inside the tears-inducing museum was supposed to open this summer with a seasonal, savory menu including grilled cheese and salmon confit &#x2014; plus liquor. Instead, museum officials said, the cafe operated by Danny Meyer&#x2019;s Union Square Hospitality Group will serve only pastries, tea and coffee when it launches later this month.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829012159/http://nypost.com/2014/05/22/911-museums-planned-comfort-food-cafe-is-inappropriate/">Cuozzo had written in May</a> that the subtext of placing a restaurant in the museum was &quot;Never forget .&#x2009;.&#x2009;. to pig out!&quot;:</p><blockquote>I can go for tomato soup and grilled cheese after staring at Picassos for a few hours. My appetite isn&#x2019;t the same after a tour through hell.<p></p>

<p>Memorial/museum president Joe Daniels argues that such solemn sites as Gettysburg and Israel&#x2019;s Yad Vashem have restaurants, too. But Gettysburg was fought 151 years ago, and Yad Vashem is not at the site where the Holocaust took place. The 9/11 Museum is where the terrorist attack took place a mere 13 years ago &#x2014; and where remains of 1,115 unidentified victims are stored.</p></blockquote>Today, Cuozzo says, &quot;A museum spokesman declined to give a reason for the recent decision to serve only pastries, coffee and tea, at least for now. He said the eatery &#x2014; no longer to be called the Pavilion Cafe, but simply The Cafe &#x2014; will open with about half of the 80 seats originally planned, although the rest would eventually be added.&quot; However, it&apos;s unclear if the museum will continue to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829012159/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/21/should_the_911_museum_allow_alcohol.php">offer private parties with alcohol</a>.<p></p>

<p>Well, folks can always buy some fast food and chow down at the Memorial itself&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829012159/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/30/is_it_appropriate_to_eat_drink_and.php">people do it, even though it&apos;s not allowed</a>!<br>
