<p>A Staten Island church was firebombed with two Molotov cocktails yesterday morning, making it the second apparent attack on a place of worship in four days. The church&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917175121/http://abc7ny.com/news/second-church-on-si-firebombed-in-just-days/1379259/">minister, however, was able to find a bright side</a>, &quot;We&apos;re glad they didn&apos;t play quarterback for the Jets.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the police, the incident happened at 2 a.m. at 117 Wright Street, when someone set the exterior wall of the First Central Baptist Church and its awning on fire with a Molotov cocktail.</p>

<p>A surveillance system near Van Duzer Street and Beach Street captured footage of the suspect, who is described as last wearing a dark colored hooded jacket and dark colored pants.</p>

One of bottles wound up on the front lawn, the other bounced against a small awning on the side of the building. The resulting fire caught the eye of a passing ambulance crew, who called for help before it could spread.&quot;</p>

<p>Minister Dale Smith said, &quot;God&apos;s grace the damage was minimal and we&apos;re blessed no one got hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>On Sunday, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917175121/http://nypost.com/2016/06/06/thug-throws-molotov-cocktail-through-staten-island-church-window/">Molotov cocktail was thrown</a> into another Staten Island church, St. Paul&#x2019;s Memorial Episcopal Church on Saint Paul&#x2019;s Avenue. It landed on a concrete floor, which Rev. Frederick Scraplau said was lucky, &quot;If it had landed on the pews we would have ended up with a massive fire. We don&apos;t have A/C so we leave the windows open to cool off at night.&quot;</p>

That might be possibly what&apos;s going on, that people are targeting churches. That&apos;s very unfortunate, but we still pray for them and we&apos;re faithful.&quot;</p>
