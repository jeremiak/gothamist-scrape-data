The Federal Reserver released a statement saying it waived the usual 30-day waiting period due to &quot;the unusual and exigent circumstances affecting the financial markets.&quot;  AmEx said it&apos;s taking almost twice as long for credit-card holders to repay loans--D.A. Davidson &amp; Co.&apos;s chief market strategist Frederic Dickson told Bloomberg News, &quot;<strong>That business has totally dried up. If I were a shareholder, it wouldn&apos;t send a very warm and fuzzy message to me.</strong>&quot;  AmEx, which recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235735/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/30/downturn_means_layoffs_all_around.php">announced it would cut 10%</a> of its workforce (equaling about 7,000 jobs), joins Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as companies who recently became bank holding companies.  </p>
