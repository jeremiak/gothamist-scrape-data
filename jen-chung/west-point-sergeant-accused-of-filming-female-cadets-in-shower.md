<p>Just ahead of graduation weekend, a sergeant at the United States Military Academy at West Point faces charges for filming female cadets without their knowledge. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131228181507/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/sergeant-accused-of-secretly-filming-female-cadets.html?_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, the filming took place &quot;sometimes when they were in the shower... The Army is contacting a dozen women to alert them that their privacy may have been violated and to offer support or counseling as required, officials said.&quot;</p>

<p>Sgt. First Class Michael McClendon is described as a &quot;tactical noncommissioned officer&quot; who worked as a staff adviser to 125 cadets at West Point. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131228181507/http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20130522/NEWS/305220022/West-Point-sergeant-charged-filming-naked-female-cadets">Military Times reports</a> that he faces 35 specifications &quot;four articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for indecent acts, dereliction in the performance of duty, cruelty and maltreatment, and actions prejudicial to good order and discipline.&quot;</p><blockquote>McClendon is alleged to have been in possession of computer files for images of nude cadets, according to a charge sheet obtained by Army Times. The names of the alleged victims were redacted.<p></p>

<p>Between July 2009 and May 2012, McClendon allegedly made images and videos of a number of women&#x2019;s exposed bodies, though it is unclear where and how each of the images were created. McClendon in at least some cases is alleged to have entered into a women&#x2019;s bathroom without announcing himself to film women as they were coming and going from the shower.</p></blockquote>McClendon joined the Army in 1990 and  was deployed in Iraq twice (2004-2005, 2007-2009).<p></p>

<p>Recently, a Department of Defense report showed that sexual assaults in the military rose from 19,000 in 2011 to 26,000 in 2012. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131228181507/http://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/gillibrand-reacts-to-new-defense-department-report-showing-26000-sexual-assaults-in-the-military-in-fy-12">Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said</a>, &quot;Despite pledges of zero tolerance from the military, and a number of positive steps that were taken last year by the Armed Services Committee, this report provides troubling evidence that we are going in the wrong direction.&quot; </p>

<p>About 15% of West Point&apos;s 4,500 cadets are female.</p>
