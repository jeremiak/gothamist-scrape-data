<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827075401/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/08/john_edwards_admits_affair_denies_l.php">confirming that he had an affair</a> with a former NYC party girl-turned-filmmaker --but denying he fathered her baby-- former Senator, vice-presidential candidate, and presidential contender John Edwards spoke to both ABC News and CBS News about the situation.  And, on the other side, a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827075401/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08092008/news/regionalnews/life_of_party_in_ny_before_she_went_bedw_123676.htm">described mistress</a> Rielle Hunter  as &quot;<strong>an idiot, a fool, a moron, a faux guru, but not mean-spirited.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Edwards issued a statement (the full text after the jump), saying, &quot;In the course of several campaigns, I started to believe that I was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic.&quot;  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827075401/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=5441195&amp;page=1">expanded on his hubris</a> to ABC News&apos; Bob Woodruff, &quot;I went from being a senator, a young senator to being considered for vice president, running for president, being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure. All of which fed a self-focus, an egotism, a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want. You&apos;re invincible. And there will be no consequences.&quot;</p>

It&apos;s completely untrue, ridiculous. <strong>I&apos;ve been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years, and as anybody who&apos;s been around us knows, she&apos;s an extraordinary human being, warm, loving, beautiful, sexy and as good a person as I have ever known</strong>. So the story&apos;s just false.&quot;  As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827075401/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/us/politics/09edwards.html?hp">NY Times put it</a>, his wife Elizabeth&apos;s public struggle with cancer while her husband campaigned made her a &quot;hugely sympathetic character.&quot;  Edwards claims he told his wife about the affair in 2006.</p>

<p>Hunter, had a baby girl on February 27, 2008, but Edwards said their affair ended too early for him to be the father.  Adding to the mix, a former Edwards aide, Andrew Young, says he is  the father and Edwards&apos; national campaign finance chairman Fred Baron admitted giving money to Hunter and Young.</p>
