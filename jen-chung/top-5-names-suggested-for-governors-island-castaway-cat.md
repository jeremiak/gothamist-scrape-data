<p>It&apos;s not Caturday, but every day is an opportunity for some feline news:  Governors Island has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811125750/http://govislandblog.com/2011/05/06/naming-the-newest-island-resident/">announced the five most popular names</a> suggested for the adorable calico cat that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811125750/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/adorable_cat_washes_up_on_governors.php">washed up on its shores last month</a>. They are: &quot;Mary Ann and Ginger (think Gilligans Island); Molly Brown (for the Unsinkable Molly Brown); Salty [because she was salty from being in the water]; Buttermilk (for the Buttermilk Channel which separates the Island from Brooklyn).&quot; </p>

<p>Since announcing that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811125750/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/governors_island_wants_help_in_nami.php">cat needed a name</a>, Governors Island says its received over 3,000 comments and suggestions: &quot;hey were all great - many focused on the Island&#x2019;s history (Lenape, Pagganck, Wouter), famous swimmers (Meow-chel Phelps was a popular suggestion as was Esther Williams) or reflected the cat&#x2019;s characteristics (Sunny, Patches, Callie).&quot;  We&apos;re sad that Nori didn&apos;t make it further (the cat was covered in seaweed), so we&apos;re rooting for &quot;Salty&quot; as her name.</p>

<p>Governors Island adds that it&apos;s still trying to find out if the cat has an owner but the cat was not microchipped&#x2014;the staff is &quot;posting information about her online as well. If we cannot find her owner, she will have a happy home here on the Island with a member of our boat crew.&quot;</p>
