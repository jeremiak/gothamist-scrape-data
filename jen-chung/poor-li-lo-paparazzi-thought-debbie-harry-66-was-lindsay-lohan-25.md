<p>Yes, Lindsay Lohan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308021809/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/29/lets_play_whats_up_with_linsday_loh.php">looks weird</a> with her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308021809/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/04/videos_lindsay_lohan_tries_to_scare.php#photo-1">bad plastic surgery</a>, but does it looks like she aged 41 yeras?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308021809/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/photographers_mistake_year_old_debbie_WAxXYeLPXI222ti9ruzgiM">Page Six claims</a>, &quot;When Debbie Harry of the band Blondie left the Mercer Hotel on Sunday, photographers crowded around the 66-year-old. Several of the snappers report believing that they were shooting photos of 25-year-old Lindsay Lohan, who had hosted &apos;SNL&apos; the night before.&quot;</p>

<p>Page Six does add, &quot;Harry did appear rather Lohan-like, with her platinum blonde, face-framing fringe and aviator sunglasses visible amidst her hooded jacket. The image looks very similar to one snapped of Lohan two days before, as she exited the same hotel wearing similar sunglasses. The two women do share a similar complexion and face structure, despite their 41 year age difference.&quot;   </p>
