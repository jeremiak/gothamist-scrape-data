<p>Helien Williams, 26, worked at CareOne in Livingston, NJ.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316023828/http://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases12/pr20120315b.html">According to the NJ AG&apos;s office</a>, Williams allegedly &quot;took a photograph with her cell phone of an elderly resident&#x2019;s genitalia and sent the photo to&quot; Michele Walker, 21. &quot;Walker allegedly then posted the photograph on her Facebook page. Williams was terminated from her position at CareOne at Livingston as a result of the alleged incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Acting Insurance Fraud Prosecutor Ronald Chillemi said, &quot;The Medicaid Fraud Control Unit is not only committed to investigating and prosecuting Medicaid fraud but also to protecting the dignity of the beneficiaries which the program serves, who are often the most vulnerable members of our population. No one should be made to suffer humiliation, particularly at the hands of someone responsible for his or her care.&quot;  </p>
