<p>Earlier this year, Demi Moore was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145144/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/03/demi_moore_to_play_feminist_gloria.php">slated to play feminist icon Gloria Steinem in a film</a> about <em>Deep Throat</em> porn star Linda Lovelace.  But since Moore is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145144/http://laist.com/2012/01/25/forever_young_demi_moore_does_whip-.php">&quot;suffering from exhaustion&quot;</a> (or from doing whip-its or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145144/http://laist.com/2012/01/26/la_city_attorney_doesnt_want_you_to.php">smoking an incense-like product</a>), she has dropped out of the film.  Now the filmmakers say they have found a new Gloria, and it&apos;s our one and only Carrie Bradshaw.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145144/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/01/27/sarah-jessica-parker-demi-moore-lovelace/">Entertainment Weekly reports</a>, &quot;With production on Lovelace already underway, the filmmakers had no choice but to quickly find a replacement for Moore. The Sex and the City actress will begin shooting on Monday. Earlier today, US Weekly erroneously reported that Weeds star Mary-Louise Parker was taking over the role.&quot; (Burn, US Weekly!)  </p>

<p>Amanda Seyfried is playing Linda Lovelace, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145144/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1426329/">according to IMDB</a>, Peter Sarsgaard is Lovelace&apos;s husband Chuck Traynor,  James Franco is playing Hugh Hefner...and even Chris Noth is in the movie&#x2014;total Big and Carrie reunion, guys!</p>
