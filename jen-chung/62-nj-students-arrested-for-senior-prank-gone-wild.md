<p>High school seniors tend to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504045926/http://www.brainwreck.com/lists/1287/13-Absolutely-Genius-Senior-Pranks">stage elaborate pranks</a> to commemorate their farewell/senioritis. Earlier this morning dozens of Teaneck High School seniors took the tradition to the next level and were ultimately arrested after  &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504045926/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2014/05/at_least_50_teens_arrested_after_teaneck_high_school_prank.html#incart_m-rpt-1">some urinated in hallways, smeared petroleum jelly on doors and flipped over desks</a>.&quot; They also scrawled graffiti on the walls. And there were balloons<em> everywhere.</em></p>

<p>Teaneck police arrived at the school when a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504045926/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Teaneck-High-School-New-Jersey-Senior-Prank-Arrests-Police--257461121.html">burglary alarm was tripped after 2 a.m.</a> today. Police Sgt. John Garland said, &quot;I&apos;ve been a police officer 19 years, and this is the craziest thing I&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504045926/http://www.northjersey.com/news/teaneck-high-school-senior-prank-leads-to-vandalism-arrest-of-more-than-60-students-1.1006861">According to the Bergen Record</a>, &quot;Police cleared each room and found students hiding. Some attempted to flee, but Garland said police found most of them... Some students were scared though others were &apos;laughing and joking among themselves&apos; before they realized the severity of the situation, Garland said.&quot;</p>

<p>One senior <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504045926/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2014/05/at_least_50_teens_arrested_after_teaneck_high_school_prank.html#incart_m-rpt-1">told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;It&apos;s not as bad as everybody&apos;s making it seem right now. They cleaned it up in two hours.&quot;</p>

<p>NBC New York&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504045926/https://twitter.com/Brynn4NY">Brynn Gingras Tweeted</a>, &quot;Teaneck Police confirm 62 teens arrested this AM. 24 adults; 38 juveniles. All HS seniors. Adults head to court; juveniles picked up at PD,&quot; and &quot;Teaneck dad showed up to PD and told us this happens every year. Said, &apos;What&apos;s the big deal?&apos; Kid wasn&apos;t involved.&quot;  </p>
