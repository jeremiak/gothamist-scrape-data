Nunez, an illegal immigrant (previously deported for a drug conviction) caught illegally using a student Metrocard, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506004849/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/22/cops_shot_at_queens_subway_station.php">wounded two cops</a> (pictured) with one of their guns and fired at another police officer, who wounded him.  Nunez said, &quot;I knew they were cops.  They were trying to arrest me. I saw the [officer&apos;s] gun, and I grabbed it and went wild.<strong> I should have kept shooting, but the other cop shot me and broke my leg.</strong>&quot; He added, &quot;I wasn&apos;t thinking of what I&apos;m doing. I was just trying to do for my kids. I&apos;m illegal.&quot;  Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506004849/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/23/subway_shooting_cops_speak_suspect.php">NY Times pointed out</a> that 400 of the 7,000 people arrested for fare beating have arrest warrants on them.</p>
