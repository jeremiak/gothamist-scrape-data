As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619031723/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/06/sexual_predator_targeting_children.php">police increase patrols</a>&#x2014;and try to allay parents&apos; concerns&#x2014;to find a man who has apparently targeted young girls in South Ozone Park, a new video of the suspect has been released.</p>

<p>This video, which is from last Wednesday, May 1st, shows the suspect, wearing a striped shirt with a red backpack, walking down a street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619031723/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/same_pervert_suspected_in_attacks_o.php">On that day</a>, police say he grabbed the buttocks of a seven-year-old girl sitting on her stoop (her 12-year-old sister yelled at him and he ran away) and, hours later, he found a seven-year-old girl in a driveway and &quot;performed a criminal sex act on her.&quot;</p>
