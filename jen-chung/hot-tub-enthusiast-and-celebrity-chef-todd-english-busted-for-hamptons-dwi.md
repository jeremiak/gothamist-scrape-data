<p>Once-acclaimed chef Todd Engish was arrested yesterday for allegedly driving drunk in Southampton Town. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014011/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/todd-english-celebrity-chef-charged-with-dwi-in-southampton-1.9193882">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;English, whose full name is William Todd English, was stopped about 3:33 a.m. for drifting out of his lane on County Road 39, Southampton Town police said. English, 54, of New York City, refused a Breathalyzer test, police said.&quot;</p>

<p>He was charged with driving while intoxicated and posted $1,500 bail. He also took a mugshot which showed bloodshot-looking eyes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014011/http://pagesix.com/2014/08/31/celebrity-chef-todd-english-charged-with-drunk-driving/?_ga=1.97108831.1965030224.1401028033">According to the Post,</a> &quot;English, who was with an Asian girlfriend he recently met in Europe, had been at the Sienna restaurant in East Hampton earlier, sources said. Asked whether he had been drinking, English &#x2014; who turned 54 on Friday &#x2014; allegedly admitted downing two glasses of wine.&quot;</p>

<p>His lawyer said, &quot;We adamantly deny the allegations levied against Mr. English and look forward to addressing this matter in a court of law.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_09_toddht.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_09_toddht.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> The infamous hot tub picture</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Still, the Post says, per a source, that English has &quot;been celebrating his birthday since Thursday.&quot; A waitress at Sienna said, &quot;Todd was having fun. He comes here all the time. He&#x2019;s friendly with everyone. He wasn&#x2019;t acting crazy.&quot; He was later seen at a nightclub. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Page Six reported that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014011/http://pagesix.com/2014/03/05/todd-english-has-threesome-at-provocateur/">wasted English was making out with two women</a> at Provocateur&#x2014;in front of his girlfriend of three years who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014011/http://pagesix.com/2014/03/06/todd-englishs-ex-threw-drink-in-his-face-amid-threesome/?_ga=1.167776289.1856259689.1393617919">threw a drink in his face</a>. (English reportedly left with the other women.) Then a photograph of English in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014011/http://pagesix.com/2014/03/07/todd-english-snapped-partying-in-hot-tub-with-topless-babes/">hot tub with three topless women emerged</a>... which was followed by him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014011/http://pagesix.com/2014/03/18/todd-english-loses-control-of-his-union-square-restaurant/">losing control of his restaurant, Olives</a>. </p>

It&#x2019;s much better that I stay behind a hot stove than in a hot tub, is probably my answer to that.&quot;</p>
