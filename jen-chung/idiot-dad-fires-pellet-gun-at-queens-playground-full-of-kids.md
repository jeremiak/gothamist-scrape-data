The fool who was at the Ditmars Park in Astoria yesterday morning!  <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717093218/http://www.queensmamas.com/queens_mamas/2013/05/gun-wielding-dad-daughter-terrorize-astoria-playground.html">QueensMamas reports</a> that on most morning, the playground is full of &quot;toddlers riding scooters, digging in the dirt, playing ball or blowing bubbles. This morning, however, all that changed, when several 2-year olds had a plastic 38-caliber loaded pellet gun pointed at them. They became the target of a gun wielding 4-year old, whose father sat looking on, smiling while his daughter terrorized the children; in fact, it was the father who loaded the gun and fired shots at the tree before handing it over to his daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>One parent who called the police said that the father was &quot;encouraging his daughter to fire the gun.&quot; (QueensMamas points out that about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717093218/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039773.htm">30,000 people/year are treated</a> for BB-related injuries.) But when the police arrived, the dumb dad was gone. Well, cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717093218/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/07/cop_shoots_15-year-old_in_face_afte.php">may shoot you in the face</a> if you pull a BB gun on them.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717093218/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/father-daughter-shoot-pellet-gun-ditmars-park-article-1.1337810">Daily News got a hold</a> of the man&apos;s wife, who says, &quot;I agree the gun looks real. They shouldn&#x2019;t have brought it to the playground.&quot; Someone&apos;s gonna be grounded! </p>
