<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_diddy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427062838im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_diddy.jpg" width="240" height="194" class="image-left"> </span>Diddy, aka Puff Daddy, P.Diddy and Sean Combs, managed to get $75,000 for hosting his post-Hammerstein Ballroom show party <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427062838/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/diddy-takes-act-to-new-jersey-for-75k-after-nyc-clubs-turn-him-down/story-e6frfn09-1226042617050">at 4Sixty6 in West Orange, NJ</a> last week.  The deal was supposed to have included a helicopter ride from New York to the Garden State, but the pesky FAA didn&apos;t grant him permission in time. So Diddy got the next best thing: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427062838/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cops_escort_grounded_diddy_ggXFjvNCNfvszzMv7XIM1M">A NYPD and NJ cop escort</a>.</p>

<p>Page Six&apos;s sources confirmed the details, &quot;Diddy heard his helicopter had not been cleared for landing, and said he wouldn&apos;t go to Jersey if he couldn&apos;t get there on time. His team spoke to the police, and he was driven -- like a head of state -- in his Bentley with three SUVs in a convoy, with two police cars in front, lights flashing, and another behind.&quot;  And Diddy&apos;s friend, who owns a &quot;high-end couture dry-cleaning service,&quot; said he helped, &quot;This happened last-minute. I organized the police escort through my contacts. There were three squad cars with the lights flashing. I went along also. We were at the club in New Jersey within 15 minutes.&quot; Wow, we bet he can get Diddy&apos;s tickets fixed too.</p>

<p>Also, 466 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110427062838/http://plixi.com/p/93809714">bills itself as &quot;NJ&apos;s Vegas.&quot;</a><br>
