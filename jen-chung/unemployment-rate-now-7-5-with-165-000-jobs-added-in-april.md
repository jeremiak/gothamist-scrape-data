<p>The jobs number was higher than expected&#x2014;the Wall Street Journal says some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032602/http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/05/03/live-from-new-york-its-jobs-friday/">were expecting 148,000</a> while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032602/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/business/economy/us-adds-165000-jobs-in-april.html?hp">NY Times says 140,000</a>. </p>

<p>The Times adds, &quot;Economists have been warning that the economy &#x2014; and job creation &#x2014; will slow in the second-quarter, largely as a result of fiscal tightening in Washington. Payroll taxes increased in January, and across-the-board spending cuts mandated by Congress went into effect in March, and their impact is expected to be felt more broadly in the months ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>One economist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032602/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-03/payrolls-in-u-s-rise-165-000-as-unemployment-drops-to-7-5-.html">told Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;The demise of this recovery is grossly exaggerated. We&#x2019;re still in a soft patch, but the job market is not falling apart. The U.S. labor market is in much better shape than most people feared.&quot;</p>
