					<p>Last night Broadway toasted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/19/hamilton_miranda_review.php">unlikely musical blockbuster</a> about the first Treasury Secretary of the United States, awarding <em>Hamilton</em> with 11 Tonys from its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/03/hamilton_tony_noms.php">record-breaking 16 nominations</a>, including Best Score, Best Book, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best Actor, Best Direction and Best Musical. Producer Jeffrey Seller, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PifD0pU5UPo">when accepting the Tony for Best Musical</a>, paid tribute to the creative, generous spirit in which the show was developed, and quoted one of the songs, &quot;Look around. Look around. How lucky we are to be alive right now.&quot;	</p>

<p>His words had another meaning, as it was also a somber night in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/approximately_20_people_killed_at_g.php">aftermath of the  Orlando massacre</a>. In addition to <em>Hamilton</em> creator Lin-Manuel Miranda&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/tony_awards_address_orlando_mass_sh.php">moving acceptance speech</a> for Best Score (&quot;We rise and fall and light from dying embers / Remembrances that hope and love lasts longer / And love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love), Frank Langella, who won Best Actor in a Play for <em>The Father</em> said, &quot;I found some words that will mean more to you than a list of names. When something bad happens we have three choices: we let it define us, we let it destroy us, or we let it strengthen us. Today in Orlando we had a hideous dose of reality, and I urge you Orlando to remain strong... We will be with you every step of the way.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnkrUoXWPzM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/12/tony-awards-2016-frank-langella-speech">He told reporters later</a>, &quot;I had to say something about it... I react to things much more profoundly than I did when I was 60, 50. This violence, sense of madness that seems to be pervading this country is terrifying me.&quot;</p>

<p>It was also a notable night because all the winners of the musical acting categories are people of color: Leslie Odom Jr. won Best Actor for <em>Hamilton</em>; Cynthia Erivo won Best Actress for <em>The Color Purple</em>; Daveed Diggs won Best Supporting Actor for <em>Hamilton</em>; and Renee Elise Goldsberry won Best Supporting Actress for <em>Hamilton</em>. Host James Corden said, &quot;Think of tonight as the Oscars&#x2014;but with diversity.&quot; After the applause, he continued, &quot;It is so diverse, Donald Trump has threatened to build a wall around this theater.&quot; Corden also explained, &quot;This is like the Super Bowl for people who don&apos;t know what the Super Bowl is.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/CAEHsOzdL10" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/winners.html">Here&apos;s a full list of the winners</a>. Among them should be Corden, who was an excellent host, even if the show felt a bit overstuffed&#x2014;which is to be expected, as the program is a way for Broadway to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015349/http://nypost.com/2016/06/11/tonys-losers-can-still-win-at-the-box-office/">entice people</a> to buy tickets to their shows.  </p>

<p>James Corden&apos;s opening number:</p>
