<p>More bad news <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023050050/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/04/sad_state_of_the_mets_remains_very.php">for the Mets</a>:  Federal Judge Jed Rakoff ruled that the Mets&apos; owners must go to trial over fake profits earned from Bernard Madoff&apos;s huge Ponzi scheme.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023050050/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/sports/baseball/judge-deals-a-financial-blow-to-mets-owners.html">NY Times reports</a> that Rakoff &quot;not only rejected a bid by the team&#x2019;s owners to have the remaining claims of a lawsuit filed by the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff&#x2019;s fraud dismissed, but he also decided that the trustee was entitled to collect up to $83 million in fictitious profits from the men. He said the exact amount would be determined in a &apos;subsequent order.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Further, the jury trial might have the jury finding that the Mets&apos; owners owe <em>even more</em>.  But that would require trustee Irving Picard, in charge of getting ill-gotten gains back to Madoff victims, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023050050/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/judge-refuses-dismiss-ny-mets-case-bernard-madoff-trustee-article-1.1033329">proving &quot;that the Mets&#x2019; owners were &apos;willfully blind&apos;</a> to Madoff&#x2019;s massive Ponzi scheme and ignored warnings that he was operating a fraud.&quot;  Rakoff is &quot;skeptical that the Trustee can ultimately rebut the defendants&apos; showing of good faith, let alone impute bad faith to all the defendants.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Picard initially sued the Mets&apos; owners for $1 billion, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023050050/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/04/trustee_suing_mets_owners_for_300m.php">said they owed $300 million</a>, and recently claimed that Fred Wilpon, Saul Katz et al. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023050050/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/mets_owners_were_hooked_on_madoffs.php">were hooked on Madoff&apos;s returns</a>. The Mets are in the process of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023050050/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/fred_wilpon_plans_to_own_mets_as_lo.php">selling minority shares of the team</a>.</p>
