<p>On Thursday afternoon, at 5 p.m., uniformed police officers headed to Broadway and West 31st, responding to a 911 call about a man removing a boot from his car. Police say that the car&apos;s owner, Akram Joudeh, 32, was furious and wielded the cleaver&#x2014;and started to run. Witnesses say that cops asked him to drop his weapon, but Joudeh refused and kept running.</p>

<p>The officers tried using a Taser, which didn&apos;t work on him, and at West 32nd Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues, NYPD Chief James O&apos;Neill (who is now the Police Commissioner)  explained, &quot;At mid-block the suspect mounted the front grill of the marked police car that was responding to the call. At this point, an off-duty detective in civilian clothes attempted to subdue the suspect. The detective, Brian O&apos;Donnell, was struck in the head by the cleaver causing an approximate 6 inch gash.&quot;</p>

<p>Joudeh, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144339/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-with-meat-cleaver-shot-by-police-near-penn-station-new-video/1513206/">has 15 prior arrests</a>, was shot by officers and taken to Bellevue in critical condition. It&apos;s believed he had been living in his car and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144339/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-sliced-cleaver-boot-car-article-1.2794834">apparently in town to appeal a deportation</a>. Authorities do not think he&apos;s a terrorist but rather emotionally disturbed.</p>

<p>Joudeh was critically injured and remains hospitalized.</p>
