<p>According to cops, last Wednesday (April 18th) afternoon, a 34-year-old woman told cops that a man on a Manhattan-bound L train was staring at her while masturbating.  She said the suspect boarded the Montrose stop in Brooklyn and exited at Union Square Station.  FWIW, this is the same day and the same station and around the same time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427151351/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/nypd_help_us_id_this_subway_upskirt.php">as the 4 train perv</a>! </p>

<p>The L train victim also took a photograph of the suspect, which the NYPD has released.  Cops describe him as a black male, around 20-25 years old, about 6&apos; and 175 pounds and wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt with navy blue jogging pants and a black baseball cap.<br>
