										<p><img alt="2008_06_freedtow.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105058im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_06_freedtow.jpg" width="250" height="324" class="right">The Port Authority says that a Beijing-based real estate developer will lease around 200,000 square feet at Freedom Tower (building on the far left).  The news is notable because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105058/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/06/02/2008-06-02_chinese_biz_becomes_first_privatesector_.html">only two other tenants are government agencies</a> - the U.S. General Services Administration and the state office of General Services.  </p>

<p>Vantone Real Estate Company is planning on taking the 64th to 69th floors to build the China Center, described as a $90 million &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105058/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/nyregion/03tower.html?ref=worldbusiness">combination chamber of commerce and cultural center</a>,&quot; for Chinese business hoping to branch out in the U.S. and for American companies with interest in business in China.  </p>

<p>The Port Authority signaled its interest in landing more foreign tenants (read: the dollar is cheap!), as its chairman Anthony Coscia said, &quot;Serious interest from the China Center is a major milestone in our efforts to secure Freedom Tower tenants from around the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Vantone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105058/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032008/news/worldnews/freedom_lease_113702.htm">signed a letter of intent for a 22-year-lease</a> which starts out at $80/square foot (the Port Authority needs to approve the deal).  However <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105058/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/china-firms-commitment-to-freedom-tower-doubted/79155/">some wonder if the company can commit</a>, as Vantone has walked away from deals before.  (Heck, Vantone even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105058/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/12/silverstein_vs.php">flirted with renting at 7 World Trade Center</a>.)</p>
