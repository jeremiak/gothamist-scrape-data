</div></div>					<p>The All-Star Game just offered a moment of silence in tribute to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.  Since news of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520013218/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/13/report_george_steinbrenner_hospital.php">larger-than-life figure&apos;s death this morning</a>, past and present players, managers, colleagues, and politicians have been offering their condolences to the Steinbrenner family and thoughts on The Boss.  Yogi Berra, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520013218/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/13/rip_the_boss_looking_at_the_george.php">was fired as manager</a> after just 16 games in 1985, said today, &quot;George was &apos;The Boss,&apos; make no mistake. He built the Yankees into champions, and that&apos;s something nobody can ever deny. He was a very generous, caring, passionate man. George and I had our differences, but who didn&apos;t? We became great friends over the last decade and I will miss him very much.&quot;</p>

<p>Berra and Steinbrenner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520013218/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/sports/baseball/14berra.html">were estranged until 1999</a> (Berra refused to go to Yankees games), when The Boss visited Berra&apos;s museum in Montclair, NJ and said, &quot;It&#x2019;s the worst mistake I&#x2019;ve made in my life,&quot; and Berra forgave him.  The NY Times reports that Berra had hoped the see Steinbrenner at this Saturday&apos;s Old Timers&apos; Game.  </p>

<p>Yankees captain Derek Jeter said, during an All-Star press conference, that he found out when he &quot;woke up and had a lot of messages&quot; and was &quot;shocked to say the least. I don&apos;t know if you can really put it into words. It&apos;s sad, but you&apos;re just shocked.&quot;</p><blockquote>I have a great relationship with the boss. I&apos;ve known him since I was 18 years old. You know, obviously there&apos;s a respect factor because he&apos;s the owner and you know, I work for him, but we were more friends than anything. I&apos;d go visit him in the off-season because we both live in Tampa. We would have bets on Ohio State/Michigan football games. I&apos;ve been in trouble a couple times. We&apos;ve filmed commercials with him dancing. It&apos;s tough, because he&apos;s more than just an owner to me. He&apos;s a friend of mine. He will be deeply missed...<p></p>

<p>You can&apos;t say enough good things about him. Most people know him as being this vocal owner, but if you really got an opportunity to know him, you got to realize not only the great things he did with the community but with the past players and current players.</p></blockquote><br>
A former manager who had a lot of success with Steinbrenner and then an ugly parting, Joe Torre, now manager for the Dodgers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520013218/http://laist.com/2010/07/13/dodgers_reaction_to_steinbrenners_d.php">said</a>, &quot;I will always remember George Steinbrenner as a passionate man, a tough boss, a true visionary, a great humanitarian and a dear friend. I will be forever grateful that he trusted me with his Yankees for 12 years. My heart goes out to his entire family. He will be deeply missed in New York, Tampa and throughout the world of baseball. It&#x2019;s only fitting that he went out as a world champ.&quot; <p></p>
