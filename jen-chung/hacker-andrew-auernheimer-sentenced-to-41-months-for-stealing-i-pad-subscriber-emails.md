<p>The hacker who revealed he accessed AT&amp;T;&apos;s servers and got over 100,000 iPad owners&apos; emails was sentenced today in federal court. Andrew &apos;weev&apos; Auernheimer, 27, was ordered to serve 41 months in prison for one count of identity fraud and one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization.</p>

<p>In 2010, Auernheimer, an already well-known Internet troll, managed to breach AT&amp;T;&apos;s servers for the iPad user&apos;s information because, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409052150/http://gawker.com/5962159/the-internets-best-terrible-person-goes-to-jail-can-a-reviled-master-troll-become-a-geek-hero">a Gawker explains</a>, &quot;AT&amp;T; had accidentally made the email addresses of subscribers to its iPad 3G wireless service publicly accessible. Goatse Security collected more than 100,000 email addresses from an AT&amp;T; website using a program called an &apos;account slurper.&apos;&quot; Then Auernheimer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409052150/http://gawker.com/5559346/">contacted Gawker about it</a>, leading to the federal investigation (here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409052150/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nj/Press/files/pdffiles/2011/Spitler,%20Daniel%20et%20al.%20Complaint.pdf">PDF of the original complaint</a>).</p>

<p>Before he was sentenced, Auernheimer told reporters, &quot;In my country, there&#x2019;s a problem, and that problem is the Feds... Attorneys in their sub-humanity lethally lord over people that are trying to contribute something to humanity. And I&#x2019;m going to prison for arithmetic? I added one to a fuckin&#x2019; number on a public web server and I aggregated data and I gave it to a journalist.&quot; He added, &quot;Fuck this country! The rights that we had in this fuckin&#x2019; place are being ruined by wicked tyrants, seditious thugs. Either they&#x2019;re malicious, wicked people that want to destroy Western civilization, or they&#x2019;re God-damned [expletive] morons&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know which it is. Either they&#x2019;re evil or they&#x2019;re retarded.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409052150/http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4118484/andrew-weev-auernheimer-sentenced-att-ipad-hack">Auernheimer told The Verge</a> he was hoping for the maximum sentence so &quot;people will rise up and storm the decks.&quot; During the sentencing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409052150/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-18/at-t-hacker-auernheimer-is-sentenced-to-months-in-prison.html">he told U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton</a>, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t come here today to ask for forgiveness. The Internet is bigger than any law can contain. Many, many governments that have attempted to restrict the freedoms of the Internet have ended up toppled.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Michael Martinez of the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office said, &quot;He blames others. Instead of accepting personal responsibility for his own conduct, he blames AT&amp;T...; When someone has gained access without a user&#x2019;s permission, that&#x2019;s a clear trespass,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;He says that the reason we&#x2019;re here is because we don&#x2019;t like his ideas. The reason that we&#x2019;re here is that he wrote a code and engaged in a clear trespass.&quot;</p>

<p>Wigenton told Auernheimer, &quot;While you consider yourself to be a hero of sorts, without question the evidence that came out at trial reflected criminal conduct. You&#x2019;ve shown absolutely no remorse. You&#x2019;ve taken no responsibility for these criminal acts whatsoever. You&#x2019;ve shown no contrition whatsoever.&quot;</p>
