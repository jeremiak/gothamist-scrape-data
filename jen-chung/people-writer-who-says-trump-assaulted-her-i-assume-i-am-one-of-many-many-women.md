<p>While Donald Trump has urged (forced?) his wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/18/melania_trump_stockholm_syndrome.php">Melania Trump to defend his indefensible behavior</a>, the former People magazine writer who accused the Republican presidential candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/people_trump_assault.php">of kissing her</a> and telling her they would have an affair is speaking out again. Natasha Stoynoff said, &quot;Women are talking about this, and they need to. We cannot be silent anymore. I didn&#x2019;t tell my story for politics, I told it for women.&quot;</p>

<p>Last week, Stoynoff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/">wrote a first-person account</a> of how Trump assaulted her at his Palm Beach estate Mar-a-Lago while she was there to interview him and then-pregnant Melania for a People feature in 2005: &quot;Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.&quot; He also told her, &quot;Have you ever been to Peter Luger&#x2019;s for steaks? I&#x2019;ll take you. We&#x2019;re going to have an affair, I&#x2019;m telling you.&quot; </p>

<p>She admitted that she was too scared to tell her managing editor about the incident, because she was &quot;ashamed and blamed myself for his transgression. I minimized it (&apos;It&#x2019;s not like he raped me...&apos;); I doubted my recollection and my reaction. I was afraid that a famous, powerful, wealthy man could and would discredit and destroy me, especially if I got his coveted PEOPLE feature killed.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump has denied Stoynoff&apos;s accusations, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/more_trump_groping_claims.php">well as the mounting</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/15/trump_finds_self-professed_child_pi.php">allegations from many</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://laist.com/2016/10/14/summer_zervos_trump.php">other women</a>. Regarding Stoynoff specifically, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/donald_trump_i_couldnt_have_attacke.php">he said</a>, &quot;Take a look! You take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think.... I don&apos;t think so. I don&apos;t think so.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was obviously good-looking enough for him at the time to force-kiss me and insist that we were going to have an affair,&quot; Stoynoff told People <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://people.com/politics/people-writer-attack-by-donald-trump-corroborated-six-named-sources/?xid=socialflow_twitter_peoplemag">for a story in this week&apos;s issue</a>. &quot;It&#x2019;s possible he just doesn&#x2019;t remember it. It was over 10 years ago and I assume I am one of many, many women.&quot; Six colleagues and close friends have corroborated Stoynoff&apos;s story in today&apos;s follow-up.</p>

<p>During a CNN interview with Anderson Cooper, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/18/melania_trump_stockholm_syndrome.php">Melania Trump said that Stoynoff was lying</a> about an encounter months after the alleged groping (Stoynoff had written that Melania Trump approached her warmly, &quot;&#x2018;Natasha, how come we don&#x2019;t see you anymore?&quot; because Stoynoff asked to be taken off the Trump beat). People Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle said that this week&apos;s story features &quot;[N]amed sources who can corroborate Natasha Stoynoff&#x2019;s account - including one woman (a friend of Natasha&#x2019;s) who was actually with her when she bumped into Melania Trump on Fifth Ave., as outlined in her story.&quot;</p>

<p>Stoynoff&#x2019;s friend is named Liza Herz, and she says she remembers being there during the chance meeting. &quot;They chatted in a friendly way,&#x201D; Herz recalls. &#x201C;And what struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels.&quot;</p>

<p>Another coworker, Liza Hamm, says, &quot;Natasha has always been a vivacious person who wants to believe in the best of people, and this experience definitely messed with that outlook. But she is also a consummate professional. She told me that she asked to be taken off the Trump beat, but she tried her best to move past the experience and continue to do her job well.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Last week, Larry Hackett, who was Editor-in-Chief of People when Stoynoff worked there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020755/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/14/i-edited-the-people-reporter-who-says-trump-groped-her-heres-why-she-never-came-forward-before/?utm_term=.b11e12b44b4a">wrote in the Washington Post</a> that he wondered what he would have done if Stoynoff had told him:</p><blockquote>For a second there, I imagined a scene of Ben Bradlee-esque outrage, calling out the swine for his behavior and striking a blow for reporters everywhere. But in reality, I would probably have simply killed the story that Stoynoff had gone to Palm Beach to report. I would have then called Trump&#x2019;s public relations operatives, told them about their boss&#x2019;s bad behavior and agreed to a truce of mutual silence. In the end, few people would have learned of the event, we&#x2019;d have had to fill a few more pages in the next issue, and Trump would have avoided any public embarrassment.<p></p>

<p>News organizations are devoted to the idea that unless something truly gruesome happens during the course of reporting, the subjects, not the reporters, are the real story. They instinctively feel pressure to absent themselves from the narrative. It&#x2019;s the right instinct, but in the case of sexual assault, whose violations are not always visible, reporters face a terrible choice. No wonder Stoynoff didn&#x2019;t feel able to confide in me or her other editors in 2005. The ghastly truth is that had Trump punched her, our course of action would have been much clearer. Instead, he exploited power, privilege and media sclerosis to his own sweaty ends.</p></blockquote><p></p>
