But Cake &amp; Shake, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111010131333/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/08/cupcake_vendor_to_take_over_coveted.php">won to right to sell there in return</a> for paying over $100,000/year to the Parks Department, is refusing to pay the rent because of license-less vendors who sell there by using the veteran loophole.<p></p>

<p>A 19th century law <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111010131333/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/15/city_now_cracking_down_on_vietnam_v.php">permits veterans to sell in areas</a> where others are not allowed to, and apparently other hot dog carts are selling outside the museum, with veterans on hand to get around the rules.  Another city-allowed pretzel vendor complained, &quot;We need a lot of help. It&#x2019;s a big problem,&quot; and even the lone veteran approved to sell there, Dan Rossi, who was once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111010131333/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/25/disabled_vietnam_vet_hot_dog_vendor.php">arrested for his operation</a>, isn&apos;t happy, &quot;They won&#x2019;t do anything -- the cops, the city,&quot; and calls the vets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111010131333/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/new-skirmishes-among-metropolitan-museum-vendors/">hired by other vendors &quot;rent-a-vets.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Cake &amp; Shake&apos;s Derek Hunt said his business is down 40%, &quot;If nothing&#x2019;s done, I&#x2019;ll be out of business by the end of October.&quot; The Parks Department tells the Post that they are working with the NYPD to determine whether &quot;additional enforcement measures can be taken.&#x201D;</p>
