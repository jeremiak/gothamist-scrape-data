<p>Days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620204455/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/28/paul_simon_edie_brickell_arrested_f.php">news of their domestic violence-related arrests broke</a>, singer-songwriter couple Paul Simon and Edie Brickell have released a new song. And a police report about their confrontation says Brickell told cops that Simon &quot;broke her heart.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620204455/https://twitter.com/ediebrickell/status/461635125919625216">Brickell Tweeted a link</a> to a song called, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620204455/https://soundcloud.com/ediebrickell/like-to-get-to-know-you">Like To Get To Know You</a>,&quot; and good friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620204455/https://twitter.com/SteveMartinToGo/status/461636326904041473">Steve Martin retweeted it</a> with &quot;My good friends, Paul and Edie, respond to the headlines.&quot; The lyrics include &quot;You share my heart you share my kids and my dog/ But I swear I don&apos;t know you at all/ You see my face every night every day/ But I swear you don&apos;t see me at all,&quot; &quot;I see other couples all time/ Holding hands and laughing&quot; and &quot;I wouldn&apos;t trade places with anyone/ None of them/ &apos;Cause I&apos;d like to get to know you again.&quot;</p>

<p>New Canaan police responded to a hangup 911 call traced to their property on Saturday night and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620204455/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/28/paul_simon_edie_brickell_arrested_f.php">ended up arresting</a> Simon, 72, and Brickell, 47. Their lawyer said, &quot;On a scale of 1 to 10, [the fight] was a 1,&quot; though there was some physical contact between the two. Simon and Brickell told a judge that they didn&apos;t need restraining orders: Simon said, &quot;We had an argument which is atypical of us. Neither of us has any fear or any reason to feel threatened. I don&#x2019;t feel like I need to be protected,&#x201D; while Brickell said, &quot;He&#x2019;s no threat to me at all.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620204455/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Police-report-sheds-light-on-Simon-Brickell-5434960.php">Stamford Advocate obtained the police report</a>:</p><blockquote>Brickell, 47, told officers that the argument started when she confronted Simon, who was in their home&apos;s music studio. She said Simon, 72, cannot &quot;handle being criticized in any manner and became confrontational with her,&quot; according to the document.<p></p>

<p>The report stated that he shoved Brickell and then called 9-1-1 after his wife slapped him in the face.</p>

<p>The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer sustained &quot;a superficial cut to his ear&quot; while his musician wife had &quot;a small bruise on her right wrist,&quot; the report stated... </p>

<p>The couple told police that they were having a verbal argument that escalated, according to the document. Brickell told police Simon &quot;was acting like a spoiled baby by calling 9-1-1 and that he did not care about their children.&quot;</p>

<p>...Police said Brickell had &quot;a strong odor of alcohol on her breath&quot; and became agitated at times. She alluded to there being other physical confrontations in the relationship, but she refused to elaborate or answer any questions, police wrote in the report.</p></blockquote>Brickell also had a cop feel a bump on the back of her head, but cops didn&apos;t find evidence that Simon caused the bump or that the bump happened that night. Simon ended up spending the night at their Manhattan home.<p></p>

<p>The couple&apos;s lawyer Alan Cramer said, &quot;It was a normal husband and wife discussion, and Paul didn&apos;t want to discuss it, and she wanted to discuss it. It&apos;s as simple as that. He kind of tried to leave, and she kind of blocked the door.&quot; He added, &quot;Brickell is from Texas and he&apos;s from Queens. <strong>And you know what ... there are ways of settling things down in Texas and there are ways of settling things down in Queens</strong>.&quot;</p>
