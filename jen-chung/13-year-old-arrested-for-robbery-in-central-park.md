<p>Police announced they arrested one of the two people wanted for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080845/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/25/cops_these_tweens_tried_to_rob_woma.php">attempted robbery in Central Park</a>&#x2014;a 13-year-old girl.</p>

<p>While Central Park crime has decreased significantly over the years (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080845/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs022pct.pdf">PDF</a>), thereby making criminal incidents in the park seem more alarming, the disturbing part about this near-mugging is that the suspects are children. The NYPD said on Monday, at around 8 p.m., a woman walking in the park near Fifth Avenue and 107th Street, when she was approached by a young girl who demanded her cellphone. When the woman refused, a young boy tried to grab her purse. She managed to hold onto her purse as the suspects fled.</p>

<p>The 13-year-old girl was charged with attempted robbery in the second degree. Police are still looking for the second suspect who is described as a black male, 10-11 years old, 4&apos;5&quot; and wearing a beige striped fleece. A third person seen with the pair&#x2014;described as a black female around 14 years old wearing a purple shirt&#x2014;is wanted for questioning.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this attempted robbery is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080845/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
