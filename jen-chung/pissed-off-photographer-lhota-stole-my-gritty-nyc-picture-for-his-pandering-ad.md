<p>Yesterday, Joe Lhota&apos;s mayoral campaign released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064827/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/new_lhota_ad_fear.php">a TV ad intended to scare people</a> into thinking that a Mayor de Blasio will let NYC descend back into 1970s- and 1980s-era violence and riots. One of the images used was by photographer Matt Weber, who never authorized Lhota&apos;s campaign to feature it. Weber tells us, &quot;I am a Democrat, but this is way beyond political as I have now been documenting New York for thirty years, and I&apos;m concerned with people not paying for photos and even worse, stealing them. I am also very upset at having my work help someone I do not intend to vote for, especially since the image was stolen!&quot;</p>

<p>Weber has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064827/http://weber-street-photography.com/">website showing off his street photography</a>, with many of his pictures from his days as a taxi driver in the 1970s and 1980s, but he believes that Lhota&apos;s campaign saw his photographs when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064827/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/22/nyregion/album-bouts.html?_r=2&amp;">NY Times published a series of them</a> last month. In fact, a photo editor at the Times was the one to let Weber know that his photograph was in the Lhota ad and suggested that it had been lifted from the Times&apos; website. Here&apos;s the ad:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150429064827if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/HO6waZDHBqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Aside from being furious that his work was stolen, Weber told us that he&apos;s a &quot;lifelong Democrat, despite being disappointed by them constantly.&quot; He added, &quot;I hate the Republicans for their greed, and lack of concern about the poor and their position on the environment and 1,000 other things. They rarely ever do anything I can agree with and I find them an embarrassment for the human race!&quot; (We&apos;ve contacted Wilson Grand Communications, which produced the ad, for a comment, and we&apos;ll update if we hear back.)</p>

<p>Critics of the ad have asked that Lhota pull it. Letitia James, Council Member, Public Advocate candidate and de Blasio supporter, issued a statement, calling it &quot;dog whistle politics. Joe Lhota&#x2019;s false ad is hateful and divisive&quot; and Lhota&apos;s tactics &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;desperate.&quot;</p>

<p>As for whether crime will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064827/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/ask_a_native_new_yorker_2.php">increase under a Mayor de Blasio</a>, Weber said, &quot;No, but I&apos;m not an expert. I drove a taxi during the &apos;70s and &apos;80s when the city was much worse. I believe that in &apos;88 34 cabbies and livery drivers were killed.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: We just spoke to Steve Grand, co-owner of Wilson Grand. He said the Lhota campaign sent them a website with &quot;cool&quot; pictures of NYC in the 1970s and 1980s and Weber&apos;s must have been there. Grand insisted his team searched for credits but even when they couldn&apos;t find any credit, they used the photos. (FWIW, when we uploaded our version of Weber&apos;s photo in Google Image Search, Weber&apos;s website was among the first three hits.) Grand told us, &quot;No offense was intended,&quot; and that he&apos;d be happy to compensate Weber or take the ad down if he wished. </p>

<p><b>Update 2</b>:  LOLZ x 100000. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064827/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/photographers-joe-lhota-didn-t-get-permission-for-images-in-ad-1.6272614">Newsday has a great story </a>about how MANY photographers were dicked over by the Lhota campaign. </p>

<blockquote>Q. Sakamaki, who photographed rioters at Tompkins Square Park nearly a quarter-century ago and a corpse on a Lower East Side sidewalk in 1990; Richard Sandler, who snapped an elderly woman clutching a pole inside a graffiti-covered subway train in 1985; and Eli Reed, who captured the NYPD rescuing a couple under attack by Crown Heights rioters -- first learned that their photos were included in the spot in a call from Newsday.
&quot;I have not given him permission,&quot; Sandler said Wednesday. &quot;I&apos;m not in favor of Lhota in the first place, and I don&apos;t want that picture used.&quot; He said he&apos;s considering legal action against the Lhota campaign, but added: &quot;Either that or pay me handsomely for it.</blockquote>Intriguing, Newsday reports, &quot;Lhota spokeswoman Jessica Proud said the images came from the photo-sharing site Flickr, and the campaign believed they were tagged as royalty-free.... It was not clear who posted the photos on Flickr, or whether the campaign or the ad agency, Wilson Grand Communications, selected the photos for the spot.&quot; 

<p>Proud added, &quot;We did our best to find everyone we could.&quot; Okay, we&apos;ll just re-print what we published earlier: &quot;FWIW, when we uploaded our version of Weber&apos;s photo in Google Image Search, Weber&apos;s website was among the first three hits.&quot;</p>
