<p>Vlad at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627135848/http://www.glassbeadcollective.org/">Glass Bead Collective</a> let us know about another video taken during Saturday night&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627135848/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/17/police_unhappy_with_pandamonium_in.php">Pandamonium in Williamsburg</a>, where a roving street party (with a panda theme) was deemed too much by police, who tried to clamp down on festivities.  </p>

<p>He writes &quot;the basic story here is that after the panda party was broken up, people started assembling on street corners and chanting,&quot; which is when the clash started to become more aggressive and violent: &quot;They arrested a young man pictured in the video here by just pulling him out of the crowd, and as far as i heard charged him with inciting a riot as well as resisting arrest.&quot;  By the way, inciting a riot can be a felony charge.</p>

<p>Another video, taken by the camerawoman, will be released later.  It&apos;s apparently very shaky, because she was tackled, too. When we called the police to get some more details, there was apparently no &quot;sheet&quot; about the incident.  Mysterious!</p>
