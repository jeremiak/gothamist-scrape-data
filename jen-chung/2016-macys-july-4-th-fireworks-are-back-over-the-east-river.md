</div></div>					<p>For the third year in a row, the Macy&#x2019;s 4th of July Fireworks will be situated over the East River. Sorry, New Jersey!</p>

<p>This year&apos;s display will be the 40th anniversary of the show, and a press release explains, &quot;The show, which begins at approximately 9:25 PM, will be fired from two locations along the shorelines of Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, giving more than three million spectators front row views to the explosive action in the night sky... Set to commemorate the nation&#x2019;s 240th birthday with an unparalleled spectacle of color, light and sound, the 40th Anniversary Macy&#x2019;s 4th of July Fireworks will feature more than 52,000 shells and effects during a 25-minute tightly choreographed spectacle. Designed and executed by Macy&#x2019;s, <strong>the show will be centered in midtown on four barges positioned between 23rd and 37th Streets and from one double-barge positioned below the Brooklyn Bridge in the Seaport district.</strong>&quot;<br>
&#xA0;<br>
Mayor Bill de Blasio brought the fireworks back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134331/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/de_blasios_new_york_fireworks_comin.php">being a NYC-centric affair in 2014</a>, and this year, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney acknowledged his efforts, &quot;There is nothing more beautiful than 4th of July fireworks over the East River where the display can be seen by New Yorkers in three boroughs. I am delighted that the de Blasio administration is once again bringing fireworks to viewers along the East River.&quot;</p>
