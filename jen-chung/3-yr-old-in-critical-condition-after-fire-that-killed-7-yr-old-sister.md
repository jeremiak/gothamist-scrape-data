<p>Authorities continue to investigate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/7-year-old_girl_killed_3-year-old_s.php">the fatal Bronx fire</a> that claimed the life of a seven-year-old girl and seriously injured her three-year-old half-sister. Hazel Martinez, 7, was pronounced dead at Lincoln Hospital, while Haley Martinez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651/http://pix11.com/2013/03/17/child-dies-in-bronx-fire-2/#axzz2NtLyjtS8">remains in critical condition</a> at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center after a 3:15 blaze tore through her family&apos;s apartment on Sunday. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_03_hazelm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_03_hazelm.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> Hazel Martinez</i></div> The girls had the same father, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651/http://pix11.com/2013/03/17/child-dies-in-bronx-fire-2/#axzz2NtLyjtS8">they lived with both their mothers</a>, father, and three brothers in a fourth floor apartment.  One neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130317/concourse-village/7-year-old-girl-dies-bronx-blaze-3-year-old-critical-condition">described the horror to DNAinfo</a>, &quot;I looked out of my window and I saw a man screaming from the apartment building that was on fire. It looked like he was trapped, he was screaming real loud... I ran downstairs and saw a young girl on a stretcher. She wasn&apos;t moving and she was black, real dark, covered in soot. She was burned real bad.&quot; A neighbor who lived directly above the girls&apos; apartment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/nyregion/apartment-fire-in-the-bronx-kills-a-7-year-old-girl.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">said</a>, &quot;It was horrifying. You couldn&#x2019;t see anything &#x2014; everything was black.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Five firefighters also suffered minor injuries. Investigators found a five-gallon gas can and an apparently &quot;compromised&quot; natural gas line at the scene of the Grant Avenue fire. However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/kids_nightmare_7WVNW4A2XrSE1e6MM18qkM">Post&apos;s &quot;sources cautioned</a> that the gas container might have been left over from Hurricane Sandy. And the natural-gas line could have been altered only to save money, law-enforcement sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>One mourning neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526190651/http://pix11.com/2013/03/17/child-dies-in-bronx-fire-2/">said that Hazel was a beautiful girl</a>, &quot;She was in my granddaughter&#x2019;s class last year and she always said, &apos;Hi Mckayla&#x2019;s grandmother!&apos; I hear in my head this morning her saying that.&quot;<br>
