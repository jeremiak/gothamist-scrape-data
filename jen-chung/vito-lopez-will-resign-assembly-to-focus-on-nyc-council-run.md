<p>Only in the seriously twisted world of Albany can a lawmaker who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509141412/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/disgusting_vito_lopez_details_he_ma.php">sexually harassed</a> his staffers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509141412/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/the_corrupt_system_works_no_charges.php">not face criminal charges</a>&#x2014;and then resign claiming he&apos;s focusing on his New York City Council race. Brooklyn Assemblyman and Democratic kingmaker Vito Lopez just announced he&apos;s leaving the Assembly, half a day after Speaker Sheldon Silver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509141412/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/finally_sheldon_silver_wants_to_off.php">said he&apos;d start working on Lopez&apos;s expulsion</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509141412/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/pervy-brooklyn-assemblyman-vito-lopez-announces-resignation-article-1.1347030">Lopez said</a>, &quot;I have made no secret that I intend to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509141412/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/liberal_democrats_want_city_council.php">run for New York City Council</a> in November, which requires me to resign my current term... Nevertheless, because the citizens of my district voted me back into office last November by an overwhelming majority, I feel obligated to serve out this session of the Assembly. I therefore announce that as of June 20, 2013, the last day of the session, I resign my position.&quot; </p>

<p>Governor Cuomo<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509141412/https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/335434695997267968"> just Tweeted</a>, &quot;Vito Lopez should not spend another day in office, let alone a whole month. He should resign effective immediately &amp; if not, be expelled,&quot; and, &quot;There should be a zero tolerance policy when it comes to sexual harassment &amp; must send a clear message that this behavior is not tolerated.&quot;</p>

<p>But remember: Even though numerous women claim he made them touch his tumors or buy low-cut blouses and described various incidents of him groping their inner thighs (and more), Lopez insists he&apos;s innocent and that the women were actually coming on to him. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509141412/http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2013/05/16/view-vito-lopez-23-page-defense-to-jcope/">His lawyer said</a>, &quot;The notion that this 71 year old ailing man&quot;&#x2014;Lopez has cancer&#x2014;&quot;could alarm a 26 year old with his ability to overpower her is not believable. Anyone who has seen Mr. Lopez knows he looks frail.&quot;</p>
