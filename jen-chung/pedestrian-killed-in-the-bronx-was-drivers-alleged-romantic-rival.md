Now it turns out that the victim and driver knew each other&#x2014;because they were involved with the same woman. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140529020510/http://7online.com/news/gunman-killed-by-minivan-in-the-bronx;-romantic-rivalry-suspected/77292/">According to WABC 7</a>, police &quot;say the incident began when 43-year-old Edward Jenkins saw his former girlfriend in the minivan with 25-year-old Jonathan Mejia and began firing a gun. Mejia fled the scene, but later encountered Jenkins and ran him down before fleeing the scene.&quot;</p>

<p>Mejia had been dating Angela Ocasio, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140529020510/http://nypost.com/2014/05/25/gunman-struck-and-killed-by-rival-in-possible-love-triangle/">the Post reports</a>, but they broke up and during that time, she dated Jenkins. &quot;She recently got back together with Mejia but still hung out with her older former flame, who was with her in a Bronx apartment on Sunday, friends said.&quot; A friend told the Post, &quot;The young buck came through [the home], and the argument started, and they left to go get their crews. When they came back, there ended up being a car chase.&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily News, which says that it&apos;s unclear if Jenkins fired at Mejia and Ocasio, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140529020510/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/bronx-gunman-run-new-beau-article-1.1804961">reports that Mejia</a> &quot;told cops he had been drinking, a police source said, and that&#x2019;s why he didn&#x2019;t stop after hitting Jenkins.&quot;</p>

<p>Mejia was charged with murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident and driving while ability impaired.</p>
