<p>Earlier this morning, a man in his 20s died after apparently getting trapped in a Bronx building&apos;s elevator shaft.</p>

<p>According to police, there was a 911 call at 3:55 a.m. at 680 Tinton Avenue, part of the NYC Housing Authority&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015347/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/bronxadamshouse1.shtml">Adams Houses</a>. Officers responded and found a man &quot;unconscious and unresponsive trapped between the elevator shaft wall and elevator car between the 18th and 19th floors.&quot;</p>

<p>The man was removed and pronounced dead at the scene. It&apos;s unclear how the man got into the elevator shaft. The Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death and police are investigating. </p>
