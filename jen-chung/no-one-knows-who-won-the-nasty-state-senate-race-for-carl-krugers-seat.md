<p>Yesterday, there was a special election for the State Senate seat in Brooklyn vacated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/21/crying_carl_kruger_cops_to_corrupti.php">corrupt State Senator Carl Kruger</a>.  And after an election that included ads accusing the Democratic candidate of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://www.politicker.com/2012/03/16/republican-ad-labels-lew-fidler-a-bacon-and-eggs-kind-of-jew/">being a &quot;bacon and eggs kind of Jew&quot;</a> (there are a lot of Orthodox Jews in the district) and accusations that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://www.politicker.com/2012/02/03/fidler-i-never-said-storobin-was-a-neo-nazi/">Republican candidate has ties to neo-Nazi groups</a>, it&apos;s no surprise that both sides are claiming victory.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/03/5520403/fidler-claims-victory-brooklyn-senate-race-which-storobin-moment-ha">Capitol New York reports</a>, &quot;As Republican State Senate candidate David Storobin told a cheering crowd last night that he had won the special election for Carl Kruger&apos;s Senates by 120 votes, his Democratic opponent, Lew Fidler, stood on a stage at his own victory party, claiming he was winning the race by 207 votes.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/nyregion/both-sides-declare-victory-in-bumpy-brooklyn-senate-race.html?ref=nyregion">The NY Times notes</a>, &quot;There were still at least 757 paper ballots outstanding, and those would not be counted until next Tuesday, said Valerie Vazquez, a spokeswoman for the board of elections. The entire legal process, which also will include a random audit and the counting of emergency ballots, could take at least 10 days.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/republicans_itching_to_take_corrupt.php">Fidler is a City Councilman</a> (he was first elected in 2002) whose stance on the issues includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/city_council_expected_to_approve_sm.php">opposing smoking bans on beaches</a> and wanting the Department of Buildings to keep records of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322035911/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/02/nobody_knows_how_many_cell_towers_a.php">how many cell phone towers there are</a>. Storobin was born in the former Soviet Union and is  a lawyer from Brighton Beach and a vice chairman of the Brooklyn Republican Party; he said last night, &quot;It&#x2019;s a Cinderella story. It&#x2019;s an ugly duckling story. I am proud and humbled to be elected to New York State Senate. It&#x2019;s only something that can happen in America.&quot;</p>

<p>But Fidler said, &quot;Among the valid ballots at the Board of Elections, we have a 5-to-1 Democratic-to-Republican advantage, so that&apos;s why we are so confident even with the 200-vote machine advantage.&quot;</p>
