<p>In December 2001, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-New-Yorker-Cover-New-Yorkistan-December-10-2001-Prints_i8481630_.htm">The New Yorker&apos;s cover featured a map</a> of New York City by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz, with neighborhood names &quot;Afghanistanicized.&quot; Central Park was called &quot;Central Parkistan,&quot; there was &quot;Flatbushtuns&quot; in Brooklyn, &quot;Hiphopabad&quot; in Queens, and &quot;Botoxia&quot; on the Upper West Side. One part of the map was designated &quot;Trumpistan,&quot; after the Trump Place development that spanned a sliver of the Upper West Side by the Hudson River. Fifteen years later, three of the buildings have now decided to de-Trumpify. Can planet Earth get in on that?</p>

<p>The rental buildings at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard will go from being known as, for example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/http://www.equityapartments.com/new-york-city/upper-west-side/trump-place-180-riverside-blvd-apartments">Trump Place 140 Riverside Boulevard</a>, to just plain old 140 Riverside Boulevard. </p>

Using the street address for the building name is popular practice in NYC, and our well-known Riverside address makes it easy for visitors to locate the building.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_11_trumpplace.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_11_trumpplace.jpg" width="640" height="352"> <br> <i> 180, 160 and 140 Riverside Boulevard (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/http://www.equityapartments.com/new-york-city/upper-west-side/trump-place-180-riverside-blvd-apartments">Equity Residential</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The trio of buildings are owned and operated by Equity Residential, not the President-elect&apos;s real estate company. The tl;dr version is that Trump gave his name to the project after  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-01-27/donald-trump-s-track-record-on-deals">making a deal with Hong Kong investors</a>, who later sold off some of the buildings and other land to other management companies and developers, like Equity and Extell. (This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-01-27/donald-trump-s-track-record-on-deals">Bloomberg article is a great read</a> on how Trump &quot;bungled the deal of a lifetime.&quot;) </p>

<p>The name remained because it was a useful marketing tool, as the Trump brand used to evoke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/http://www.equityapartments.com/new-york-city/upper-west-side/trump-place-180-riverside-blvd-apartments">luxury amenities</a>, not sexually assaulting women and mass deportations. As a business owner at 140 Riverside Boulevard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/21/rubdown">told the New Yorker last year</a>, &quot;A lot of these apartments are owned by foreign businessmen. Perhaps, in foreign countries, it&#x2019;s believed that the Trump brand is a sign of class. Most New Yorkers would feel otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p>As the ugly rhetoric increased in Donald Trump&apos;s presidential campaign, residents started petitions to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/nyregion/trump-place-buildings-name-change.html?_r=0">demand the the Trump name be removed</a>. Linda Gottlieb, one of the residents at 160 Riverside Boulevard who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/https://www.change.org/p/dump-the-trump-name">started a petition</a> (there are 667 signatures), posted on Change.org, &quot;WE WON! The Trump name is being dumped this week from all three buildings! Congratulations to us all for making our voices heard. And warmest thanks to Equity Residential for listening. A victory for citizen power!&quot; <br>
 <br>
However, Sam Zell, the chairman of Equity Residential, told the Times, &#x201C;The tenants had no role in this.&quot;<br>
 <br>
</p><blockquote>Mr. Zell said he and &#x201C;Don&#x201D; &#x2014; as he called Mr. Trump &#x2014; had talked about it a year ago. &#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t want anything to happen while the election was going on,&#x201D; he said.<p></p>

<p>According to Mr. McKenna, Equity entered a &#x201C;use of name contract&#x201D; with the Trump Organization, which did not require it to pay Mr. Trump to use his name. That contract has now expired.</p>

<p>Amanda Miller, vice president of marketing for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying the change &#x201C;was mutually agreed upon.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>The Trump Organization still manages 200, 220 and 240 Riverside Boulevard. Residents at 220 Riverside Boulevard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925222547/http://www.brickunderground.com/live/trump-place-residents-name-change">are attempting to de-Trumpify</a> as well.<p></p>
