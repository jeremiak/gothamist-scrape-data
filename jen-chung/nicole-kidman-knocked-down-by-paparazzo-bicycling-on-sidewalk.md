<p>Yesterday, Nicole Kidman was heading into the Carlyle Hotel when a photographer riding his bicycle <em>ON THE SIDEWALK</em> crashed into her. You can hear the paparazzo apologizing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517023831/http://www.tmz.com/2013/09/13/nicole-kidman-paparazzo-bicycle-bike-crash-video/">&quot;I&apos;m so sorry! I&apos;m so sorry!&quot; in this video</a>. And, of course, there&apos;s another paparazzo&#x2014;biking on the sidewalk&#x2014;who takes pictures of the incident.</p>

<p>The photographer, Carl Wu, apparently tried to stop before hitting the Oscar-winning actress, but he didn&apos;t break hard enough and Kidman was knocked to the ground. When Kidman was helped up, she says, &quot;I wanna get his name and press charges.&quot; But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517023831/http://www.tmz.com/2013/09/12/nicole-kidman-knocked-to-ground-paparazzi-pressing-charges-new-york-city/">TMZ reports</a>, &quot;Witnesses at the scene tell us ... Nicole has no visible injuries.  Cops are saying they will write Wu a ticket for riding his bike on the sidewalk, but will not arrest him for a criminal offense. One cop said, &apos;An accident&apos;s an accident.&apos; &quot;  Wu didn&apos;t talk to a TMZ videographer at the precinct:</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517023831/http://www.eonline.com/news/458521/nicole-kidman-shaken-up-after-being-hit-by-bicycle-paparazzi-s-behavior-can-be-terrifying">Kidman told E! News</a>, &quot;<strong>It was awful, but I got back up</strong>.&quot; As for pressing charges, she added, &quot;I was shaken up and I&apos;ll deal with it later. I&apos;m here for this [Calvin Klein fashion show after-party] now.&quot; As for paparazzi hounding her, she said, &quot;I&apos;ve lived with it for so long now...[it&apos;s sometimes] terrifying. And luckily I got up but there will be a time when someone does not.&quot;</p>

<p>Wu was also wearing earbuds&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517023831/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/11/heres_the_nypds_bicycle_safety_tips.php">a no-no</a>!</p>
