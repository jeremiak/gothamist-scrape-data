According to authorities, Bernard Madoff (former Nasdaq chairman) told his firm&apos;s employees &quot;that his entire business was...&apos;one big lie.&apos;&quot;  What&apos;s more, the Wall Street Journal reports his two sons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022234017/hhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB122903010173099377.html?mod=article-outset-box">were the ones who turned him in</a> to the feds after Madoff admitted he was running a &quot;<strong>giant Ponzi scheme</strong>.&quot;  <br>
 <br>
The Securities and Exchange Commission&apos;s associate director of enforcement Andrew Calamari (Calamari!) said, &quot;Our complaint alleges a stunning fraud that appears to be of epic proportions.&quot;  The criminal complaint suggests that Madoff &quot;deceived investors by operating a securities business in which he traded and lost investor money, and then <strong>paid certain investors purported returns on investment with the principal received from other, different investors</strong>, which resulted in losses of approximately billions of dollars.&quot;  Yup, that sounds like a Ponzi scheme!  The complaint also says, per employees, Madoff ran the &quot;investment business&quot; on a separate floor and was &quot;cryptic&quot; about it.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022234017/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/business/12scheme.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bernard%20madoff&amp;st=cse">NY Times says</a> this might be the largest fraud in Wall Street history.</p>

<p>Madoff had many prominent clients, who found his firm&apos;s high returns and low fees appealing. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022234017/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/12/12/2008-12-12_mets_owner_fred_wilpon_may_have_been_big.html">Daily News reports</a> that Mets owner Fred Wilpon&apos;s company had invested with Madoff and may have lost up to $300 million.  And some are patting themselves on the back: A hedge fund consulting firm says it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022234017/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=afr_KQndJUUs&amp;refer=home">told its clients not to invest with Madoff</a> &quot;after learning of &apos;red flags&apos; at his company, including that its books were audited by a three-person accounting firm...operating out of a 13-by-18 foot location in an office park in New York City&#x2019;s northern suburbs.&quot;</p>

<p>And those friends and neighbors who invested with him&#x2014;they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022234017/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aaPDG3hOVWy4&amp;refer=home">totally going to sue</a>.</p>
