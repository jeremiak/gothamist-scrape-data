<p>The NYPD is investigating whether former NY Governor Eliot Spitzer choked a woman at the Plaza Hotel on Saturday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Ex-Gov-Spitzer-Accused-of-Choking-Woman-at-Plaza-Hotel-NYPD-Sources-368792801.html">His spokeswoman insists</a>, &quot;There is no truth to the allegation.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://nypost.com/2016/02/14/eliot-spitzer-investigated-over-alleged-choking-incident/">NY Post has the most on the alleged incident</a>, reporting that the police went a $1000/night suite after Svetlana Travis, 25, &quot;used her cellphone to call 911 at about 8 p.m. Saturday to say she was having a breakdown and had cut her wrist.&quot; Spitzer apparently answered the door, telling them, &quot;Everything&#x2019;s fine. There&#x2019;s no problem.&quot; </p>

<p>The cops asked the 911 operator to call Travis back, and Travis allegedly said she didn&apos;t need help anymore. </p><blockquote>The cops went back anyway to check, although by then, she had left the room, the sources said. After Spitzer opened the door a second time, the cops spied broken glass, bloodstains and clothing on the floor and started a search inside.<p></p>

<p>Travis reappeared, and the cops called EMS, which took her to Mount Sinai West Hospital, where she told staffers Spitzer had attacked her, sources said. The former governor showed up at the hospital Sunday wearing a skullcap, sources said.</p></blockquote>A Post source says that in a second interview, Travis &quot;said that she told Spitzer she was going back to Russia, and he got upset and started throwing her around, choked her, threw her to the ground and threatened her. &apos;She then broke a glass, cut herself and called 911.&apos;&quot; <p></p>

<p>Travis, who reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/14/us/nypd-eliot-spitzer-alleged-assault-investigation/index.html">described Spitzer as her boyfriend</a>, then stopped cooperating, according to the Post&apos;s sources. The NYPD said, &quot;The victim has indicated that the subject is Eliot Spitzer. Through an ongoing investigation, we are attempting to further establish the identity of the subject and the nature of the incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Travis has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/14/eliot-spitzer-assault-investigation/">apparently refused to press charges</a> and had already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Ex-Gov-Spitzer-Accused-of-Choking-Woman-at-Plaza-Hotel-NYPD-Sources-368792801.html">left for Russia</a>.</p>

<p>Spitzer, the former crusading &quot;Sheriff of Wall Street&quot;, resigned from the governorship after a year in office when it was revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/governor_spitze_1.php">he frequently hired prostitutes</a> (yes, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/eliot_superman_spitzer_steamrolled.php">frequently</a></em>). A former call girl also claimed that Spitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813170841/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/29/call_girl_claims_eliot_spitzer_like.php">liked to choke her</a>.</p>
