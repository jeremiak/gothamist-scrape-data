                            <p>To promote tourism to the Adirondacks, Governor Cuomo spearheaded a two-day rafting competition, the Adirondack Challenge, between his office and other parts of the state&#x2014;other state agencies (like the tourism office), counties, legislative correspondents, the Senate, the Assembly. The marquee event is today&apos;s showdown between Cuomo and a team from NYC, which is supposed to include Mayor Bloomberg, but Cuomo&apos;s rafting trip yesterday looks like a total blast.</p>

<p>In a press release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822174425/http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/07212013-2013-adirondack-challenge-participants">revealing the teams in the Sunday competition</a>, Cuomo (who was in a team with his daughters Cara and Michaela, Secretary to the Governor Larry Schwartz, and Deputy Secretary for Civil Rights Alphonso David) said yesterday, &quot;The Adirondack Challenge is designed to highlight all of what the Adirondacks region has to offer to New Yorkers and visitors - and it is also a friendly competition on the beautiful Indian River. Today&#x2019;s events illustrate firsthand the natural wonders of the Adirondacks. Now, let the competition begin!&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Schwartz was the only one to fall in the water. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822174425/http://www.timesunion.com/default/article/Governor-makes-a-splash-4678334.php">Times-Union reports</a> that Cuomo was dripping wet at the end of the event. He said, &quot;People think of New York, they think of New York City. And there&apos;s a lot more,&quot; and pointed out that tens of millions visit NYC, &quot;We just need a fraction, a small fraction of them to come north. ... You can&apos;t find this anywhere else on the globe.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, Bloomberg spokesman Marc LaVorgna<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822174425/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/cuomo-jokes-bloomberg-deep-rafting-race-article-1.1404240"> is keeping expectations low</a>, &quot;We are definitely the underdog. They have home-stream advantage... What we learned, shockingly, was that when your entire staff resides in New York City, you don&#x2019;t have many people who raft.&quot;</p>
