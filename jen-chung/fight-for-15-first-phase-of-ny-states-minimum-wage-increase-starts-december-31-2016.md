<p>Earlier this year, Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330123509/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/04/cuomo_officially_signs_15_minimum_w.php">signed a bill that will eventually raise state minimum wage</a> to $15/hour&#x2014;and it goes into effect on December 31st, 2016. His office is making sure everyone knows about it with a public awareness campaign.</p>

<p>There will be television ads (below) as well as a hotline&#x2014;1-888-4-NYSDOL&#x2014; for minimum wage workers who do not receive their pay increase by December 31st, 2016 to report their employers. Here are details of the phase-in:</p><blockquote>- For workers in New York City employed by large businesses (those with at least 11 employees), the minimum wage will rise to $11 at the end of 2016, then another $2 each year after, reaching $15 on 12/31/2018.<br>
- For workers in New York City employed by small businesses (those with 10 employees or fewer), the minimum wage will rise to $10.50 by the end of 2016, then another $1.50 each year after, reaching $15 on 12/31/2019<br>
- For workers in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, the minimum wage will increase to $10 at the end of 2016, then $1 each year after, reaching $15 on 12/31/2021.<br>
- For workers in the rest of the state, the minimum wage will increase to $9.70 at the end of 2016, then another .70 each year after until reaching $12.50 on 12/31/2020 - after which the minimum wage will continue to increase to $15 on an indexed schedule to be set by the Director of the Division of Budget in consultation with the Department of Labor.</blockquote>Cuomo said in a statement, &quot;No one who works full-time should be condemned to a life of poverty and that&apos;s why New York took action to raise the wage and provide the opportunity of a decent life to millions of hard working New Yorkers. As we reach this milestone for a more fair and a more just New York, we are reminding workers they are owed a fair day&apos;s pay for a fair day&apos;s work and this administration will work to ensure they receive the wage increase to which they are entitled.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Of course, in 2015, Cuomo&apos;s reaction to legislators pushing to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour by the end of 2018 was a &quot;sarcastic&quot; &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330123509/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/cuomo-rejects-assembly-dems-plan-15-hour-minimum-wage-article-1.2146491">God bless them &#x2014; shoot for the stars</a>&quot; before later admitting, after multiple protests and outcry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330123509/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/15/fight_15_takes_to_the_streets.php#photo-1">that he learned an &quot;important lesson</a>... You organize people around that dream, and you will see government follow.&quot; </p>
