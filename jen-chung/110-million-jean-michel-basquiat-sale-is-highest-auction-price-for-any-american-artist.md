<p>A 1982 painting by Brooklyn-born Jean-Michel Basquiat sold for a staggering $110.5 million, including buyer&apos;s premium, at Sotheby&apos;s on Thursday night. The auction house said the price was the &quot;highest paid at auction for a work by an American artist and for any artwork created after 1980.&quot;</p>

<p>The painting, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520004145/http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2017/contemporary-art-evening-auction-n09761/lot.24.html">described as</a> &quot;Raw, uncensored, and fiercely magnificent&quot; and an &quot;incomparable masterwork&quot; by Sotheby&apos;s, was acquired by Jerry and Emily Spiegel for $19,000 in 1984, and the couple kept it in their private collection and never exhibited it. The couple died and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520004145/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-19/basquiat-portrait-soars-to-record-110-million-at-sotheby-s?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">&quot;feuding daughters&quot; inherited</a> their parents&apos; substantial art collection. Here&apos;s what the bidding was like:</p>

<p>Maezawa, 41, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520004145/http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/19/technology/yusaku-maezawa-music-fashion-art-basquiat/">has been buying contemporary art</a> for a museum he wants to open in his hometown of Chiba. When he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520004145/http://observer.com/2016/05/57m-basquiat-breaks-auction-record-at-christies/">bought another Basquiat last year</a> for $57 million, he said, &quot;When I encountered the work at the Christie&#x2019;s New York preview, I had an immediate visceral connection it. Generationally, I relate to Basquiat&#x2019;s culture and the essence of his life story. Rather than monetary or investment value, I felt I had a personal responsibility to take care of this masterpiece and preserve it for the next generation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Art dealer Jeffrey Deitch was happily stunned with the results of the auction, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520004145/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-19/basquiat-portrait-soars-to-record-110-million-at-sotheby-s">telling Bloomberg News</a>, &quot;I remember astounding the art world back in 1980s when I set an auction record for Basquiat at $99,000. All of us, Jean-Michel&#x2019;s friends, we totally believed in his genius. I always thought he would be one day in the league of Picasso, Bacon and Van Gogh. The work has that iconic quality. His appeal is real.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#x2019;s mind-blowing,&#x201D; Larry Warsh, a longtime Basquiat collector, told the Times. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not usually impressed by numbers, but this is really out of the boundaries.&quot;</p>
