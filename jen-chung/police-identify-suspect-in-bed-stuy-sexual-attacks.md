<p>According to police, two incidents occurred on the morning of Sunday, August 31st. In the first one, at 7:10 a.m., a 33-year-old woman was walking near Patchen Avenue and Chauncey Street when a man lifted up her skirt. The police say, &quot;As the victim attempted to follow him, he threatened her with physical harm by raising his fists stating he would punch her in the face.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, about 45 minutes later, police say that the suspect followed a 32-year-old woman to a building near Ralph Avenue and Bainbridge Street where he followed her into the vestibule and tried to rape her. The victim was able to fight him off, and he fled with her cellphone. </p>
