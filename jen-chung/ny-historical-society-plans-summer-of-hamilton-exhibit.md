The exhibit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111508/http://www.nyhistory.org/summer-of-hamilton"><em>Summer of Hamilton</em></a>, promises to welcome everyone to the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111508/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWdBOsk8D7A">the room where it happens</a>.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The NYHS acknowledges the &quot;fervent popularity&quot; around Alexander Hamilton Hamilton, thanks to the musical (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111508/https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow-ebook/dp/B000QJLQZI?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=dp-kindle-redirect">Ron Chernow&apos;s biography</a>, which inspired the show) will cover Hamilton&apos;s relationship with New York and his legacy in the U.S. government.  </p>

<p>Dr. Louise Mirrer, President and CEO of New-York Historical Society, marveled at the success of the musical, noting, &quot;Now admirers of the Broadway hit and those interested in learning more about one of New York City&#x2019;s most influential citizens can decide for themselves, as the show says, &#x2018;who lives, who dies, who tells your story&#x2019; as we commemorate the anniversary of Hamilton&#x2019;s death and the achievements of his life.&quot; Here&apos;s more on what to expect from the press release:</p><blockquote>Among the highlights that will be on view during the <em>Summer of Hamilton</em> are life-size bronze statues depicting Hamilton and Burr in the midst of their deadly duel, pistols drawn and aimed at one another. The statues, created by sculptor Kim Crowley, were previously on loan to The Public Theater and were displayed in its lobby during the off-Broadway run of Hamilton. Also featured will be the monumental tall case clock presented to Hamilton in 1796 by the Bank of New York, which will return to the New-York Historical Society after a years-long loan to the Bank. Hamilton&#x2019;s desk, at which the prolific writer penned his correspondence, will be exhibited on loan from the Museum of the City of New York. <p></p>

<p>Displayed with these items, an exhibition by the Gilder Lehrman Institute will  present nine key documents from Hamilton&#x2019;s life, including his famous &#x201C;nut brown maid&#x201D; love letter to his fianc&#xE9;e, Elizabeth Schuyler; the infamous pamphlet admitting to his affair with Maria Reynolds; the plan for the federal government that he proposed during the Constitutional Convention; the first federal budget printed in his Report on Public Credit; and a letter supporting Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr in the Election of 1800, which stated &#x201C;In a choice of Evils let them take the least&#x2015;Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr.&#x201D; Above these documents will hang New-York Historical&#x2019;s portrait of the statesman by John Trumbull, painted shortly after Hamilton&#x2019;s untimely death in 1804. Select video clips from the Broadway show will also be shown, enhancing the connection between Hamilton the musical and these historical items.</p>

<p>On view in the Patricia D. Klingenstein Library, additional documents from New-York Historical&#x2019;s collection will help answer the question posed in the musical&#x2015;&#x201C;who tells your story&#x201D;&#x2015;by focusing on Hamilton&#x2019;s relationships with other Founding Fathers and his widow&#x2019;s attempt to secure his place in history. Later in 2017, the Library will showcase documents highlighting Hamilton&#x2019;s impact on public policy in the early republic.  </p>

<p>Replicas of the dueling pistols used by Hamilton and Burr, on loan from the JPMorgan Chase Historical Collection, continue to be exhibited as part of New York Rising, a permanent installation on a 42-foot wall in the Museum facing Central Park West, which illustrates New York&#x2019;s critical contribution to the founding of the U.S. The installation also features the marble cenotaph marking where Hamilton was wounded; a bust of Hamilton by Giuseppe Ceracchi depicting him in the guise of a Roman Senator; a gold mourning ring set with a lock of Hamilton&#x2019;s hair that Elizabeth Hamilton gave to Nathaniel Pendleton, Hamilton&#x2019;s second in the duel; Pendleton&#x2019;s statements about the regulations of the duel; portraits of Aaron Burr and his gifted daughter Theodosia Burr painted by John Vanderlyn; various correspondence written in the aftermath of the duel; and Burr&#x2019;s death mask.</p></blockquote>Maybe the NYPL can loan them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111508/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/29/old_diary_nyc_hamilton.php">that diary</a> detailing the days after Hamilton&apos;s death.<p></p>

<p>On opening day, July 4th, there will be a living historian dressed as Hamilton, a &quot;dueling history tour,&quot; a Hamilton family trivia contest and more. </p>

<p>In the meantime, you can start reading Chernow&apos;s bio; Lin-Manuel Miranda would approve:</p>
