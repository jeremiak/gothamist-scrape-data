Wyckoff, NJ police say that Arthur Garlick 22, then sold the car for $200 in cash and $150 of heroin.</p>

<p>The authorities say that Garlick&apos;s grandmother was at the Cedar Hill Christian Reformed Church on June 3, working as a poll work for the primary elections. Her 1999 Lincoln Town Car was parked outside, and Garlick took the opportunity to steal the car with an extra set of keys.</p>

<p>The car was recovered in Paterson, NJ, where its owner was arrested for stolen property. The car&apos;s &quot;new owner&quot; then led cops to Garlick, who reportedly admitted selling the vehicle for the money and drugs. </p>

<p>Wyckoff Police Chief Benjamin Fox noted the &quot;growing heroin addiction problem&quot; in Bergen County, &quot;Sadly, persons addicted will let nothing stand in their way to obtain heroin; even thefts from family members.&quot;</p>
