<p>The massive project, which involved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205115/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/07/man_made_waterf.php">constructing the waterfalls</a> and a number of tests to check the system (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205115/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/18/more_waterfall_testing.php">1</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205115/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/19/governors_island_waterfall_tested_r.php">2</a>), runs through October 13.   And here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205115/http://www.nycwaterfalls.org/">official New York City Waterfalls website</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205115/http://www.circlelinedowntown.com/waterfalls.asp">Circle Line</a> is the official tour provider, but the waterfalls can be see from land, by bike and--for the waterfalls near Governors Island and the one between Piers 4 and 5--by Governors Island and Staten Island ferries .</p>
