<p>Yesterday, the federal authorities raided a Chinatown building at 35-37 East Broadway&#x2014;apparently, it was full of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170353/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Chinatown-Building-Raided-Broadway-Illegal-Gambling-NYPD-Homeland-Security-152362255.html">&quot;table games and slot machines,&quot;</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170353/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/raid_on_chinatown_gambling_joint_tMJ6oxMf5eFmbXOsejccOJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">&quot;Chinese mahjong,&quot;</a> and &quot;large cardboard boxes&#x2014;allegedly filled to the brim with cash.&quot;</p>

<p>The illegal gambling takedown raid, nicknamed &quot;Operation Snake Eyes,&quot; led to the arrest of eleven people and seizure of $163,000 in cash.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170353/http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/may12/chinatownbuilding35_37eastbroadwayforfeiture.html">U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara&apos;s complaint</a> is also looking for the forfeiture of the building where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170353/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Chinatown-Building-Raided-Broadway-Illegal-Gambling-NYPD-Homeland-Security-152362255.html">at least four floors were used for gambling</a>:</p><blockquote>Over at least the last two years, the Building has consistently hosted a group of illegal gambling operators offering various gambling options, including pai gow poker and computer-based slot machine games, in nearly half of the Building&#x2019;s suites.  The Building itself has been modified to accommodate these gambling operations, including the creation of a ground floor slots room hosting computers dedicated to slot machine games, and the installation of surveillance cameras throughout areas of the Building dedicated to gambling. </blockquote>Two people were also arrested for practicing medicine without a license in the building as well. <p></p>

<p>But today, those at 35-37 East Broadway told WCBS 2 that while there <em>were</em> slot machines, they were just donated and used for fun: &quot;There&#x2019;s no gambling. They just play for fun.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170353/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">Cue Captain Renault</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, arrests rarely deter illegal gambling den operators: A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170353/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2012/may/22/raid-chinatown/">former Chinatown cop told WNYC</a>, &quot;Once they take everything out, within six, seven or eight hours there&#x2019;s a carpenter down there, two-by-fours, bang bang bang, they&#x2019;re setting up new tables already. And the gambling would be on the next day.&quot;<br>
