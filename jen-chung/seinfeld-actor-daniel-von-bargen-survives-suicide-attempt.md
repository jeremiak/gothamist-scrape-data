Daniel von Bargen called 911 and said, &quot;I&apos;ve shot myself in the head ... and I need help.&quot;</p>

<p>You can listen to the harrowing call here, but after the operator asks if it was an accident, von Bargen replied, &quot;I was supposed to go to the hospital and I didn&apos;t want to,&quot; further explaining he&apos;s diabetic, &quot;They were supposed to amputate at least a few toes.&quot; He also says, &quot;I shot in my temple.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074923/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0901926/">Von Bargen</a>, 61, said of playing Mr. Kruger, the oblivious president of Kruger Industrial Smoothing (he donated to The Human Fund), &quot;When you start becoming a commodity because of your face or your stature or whatever, those opportunities become fewer and fewer. So it&apos;s nice to get on a comedy and have people go, &quot;You&apos;re funny!&apos;&quot; He also played Commandant Spangler on Malcolm in the Middle.  Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074923/http://youtu.be/z6kVBGeQeR4">nice montage of Kruger scenes</a>.</p>
