<p>A NJ state judge ruled that the state must permit gay marriage, or else couples in civil unions would be denied federal benefits. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930164541/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/nyregion/new-jersey-judge-rules-state-must-allow-gay-marriage.html?hp">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Judge Mary C. Jacobson of State Superior Court ruled that the State Constitution must allow marriage in light of the United States Supreme Court&#x2019;s decision in June striking down the Defense of Marriage Act... It is the first time a court has struck down a state ban on same-sex marriage as a direct result of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s ruling.&quot;</p>

<p>Previously, Governor Chris Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930164541/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/17/chris_christie_vetos_gay_marriage_i.php">vetoed gay marriage</a> in NJ, saying it was a federal issue.  After the Supreme Court&apos;s ruling, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930164541/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/chris_christie_bans_gay_conversion.php">banned gay conversion therapy</a>, noting that he believes people are born gay.</p>
