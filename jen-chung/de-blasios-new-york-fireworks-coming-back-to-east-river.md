<p>After years of hoping and complaining, the Macy&apos;s July 4th Fireworks spectacle will be returning to the East River. Mayor Bill de Blasio will be making the official announcement this afternoon in Brooklyn Heights, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132522/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/fourth-july-fireworks-return-east-river-article-1.1755518">he told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m thrilled that, after years of working with Macy&#x2019;s and my colleagues to make this a reality, the fireworks will return to the East River this year! Now even more New Yorkers will get to take part in this extraordinary celebration, against the backdrop of the Brooklyn Bridge, the harbor and our skyline.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s true: de Blasio, as well as State Senator Daniel Squadron and City Council Member Stephen Levin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132522/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/04/de_blasio_squadron_please_bring_201.php">had a press conference last July 4th</a> saying the city should bring back the fireworks to the East River so more New Yorkers would be able to see it. He said then, &quot;The outer-boroughs aren&#x2019;t an afterthought. They should be the main event. We&#x2019;re grateful to Macy&#x2019;s for bringing the show to New York City every Fourth, but it&#x2019;s time the City put the fireworks where the most New Yorkers can actually enjoy them. Let&#x2019;s alternate between the Hudson and East Rivers, beginning with a return to the Brooklyn-Queens waterfront next year. As a Brooklynite, this is a tradition we want back on our doorstep!&quot;</p>

<p>Now that the Brooklynite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132522/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/bill_de_blasio_1.php">is the Mayor</a>, Macy&apos;s Amy Kule, executive producer of the event, said, &quot;Macy&#x2019;s Fourth of July Fireworks are a one-of-a-kind spectacle that will once again inspire audiences nationwide as we illuminate the shores of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn with stunning effects, color and sound.&quot;</p>

<p>The fireworks barges will be set up south of the Manhattan Bridge into New York Harbor&#x2014;and apparently the Brooklyn Bridge will be getting fireworks too!</p>
