title: Schumer, Gillibrand To Endorse Thompson Today
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_nysens.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092158im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_nysens.jpg" width="200" height="197" class="image-left"> </span>Both Senator Charles Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand will formally endorse City Comptroller William Thompson for mayor today in Union Square.  However, City Room <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092158/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/todays-tip-sheet-thompson-expected-to-pick-up-two-senatorial-endorsements/">wonders</a>, &quot;But will Chuck or Kirsten actually say anything bad about Mike?&quot;</p>

<p>That&apos;s because Schumer has previously praised Mayor Bloomberg, who also had Schumer&apos;s wife as DOT Commissioner for a while.  Also, City Room notes, &quot;Mr. Bloomberg also employs a number of former Schumer aides on his campaign, or in City Hall, including Bradley Tusk, his campaign manager; Howard Wolfson, a campaign spokesman; Josh Isay, a political consultant; and Stu Loeser, his chief spokesman in the mayor&#x2019;s office.&quot; So the guess is that Schumer (and Gilly) will praise Thompson while not really blasting Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Bloomberg is currently an Independent, after switching from the Democratic Party to the  Republican Party in 2001 (to win the election) and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092158/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/19/breaking_bloomb.php">dropping his GOP stripes in 2007</a>, when he was considering a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092158/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/19/hmm_bloomberg_m.php">third party run</a> for president.  PolitickerNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092158/http://www.politickerny.com/5537/schumer-and-gillibrand-endorsing-thompson">points out</a>, &quot;Since unenrolling from the Republican Party in 2007 in a public gesture toward an independent presidential run, Bloomberg has sought to highlight his support from Democrats. This weekend, he announced he was endorsed by &apos;two prominent, longtime Democrats,&apos; Peter Vallone Sr., the former Speaker of the City Council, and his son, Peter Vallone Jr., a Councilman in Astoria.&quot; And it&apos;s been rumored that President Obama is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092158/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/28/will_obama_endorse_bill_thompson.php">trying to stay out of the mayoral</a> race because of his relationship with Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Thompson received the endorsements of City Council members Bill de Blasio and John Liu yesterday&#x2014;all three are  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092158/http://www.workingfamiliesparty.org/elections/">also Working Families Party candidates</a>. </p>
