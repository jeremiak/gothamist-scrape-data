<p>Candidates running for New York City office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618085702/http://gothamist.com/tags/election2013">this year</a> have been campaigning for, well, what seems like forever&#x2014;and the primary isn&apos;t until September 10! Things will get interesting at the NYC Campaign Finance Board&apos;s official NYC debates&#x2014;and we&apos;re one of the sponsors.</p>

<p>The Campaign Finance Board is a nonpartisan, independent city agency that administers the Campaign Finance Program that many candidates opt into. The CFB has been holding debates after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618085702/http://www.nyccfb.info/debates/overview.htm">public outrage in 1993</a> that Rudy Giuliani and David Dinkins didn&apos;t meet in a public debate. </p>

<p>The first mayoral debate is on August 21&#x2014;it&apos;ll be the Democratic primary, and Gothamist is one of the sponsors. We&apos;re part of a partner group that includes NY1 News, NY1 Noticias, WNYC, Citizens Committee for New York City, Citizens Union, Hispanic Federation, and Transportation Alternatives, and we&apos;re sponsoring the Democratic primary debates for Public Advocate (August 15) and Comptroller (August 12) as well. </p>

<p>For the general election, our group is sponsoring the Public Advocate (October 10) and Comptroller (October 8) debates. We&apos;ll definitely be calling upon Gothamist readers for questions that should be posed during the debates, and will have special debate night coverage planned&#x2014;stay tuned!</p>

<p>Here are the three partner groups, plus the debate schedule below:</p>
