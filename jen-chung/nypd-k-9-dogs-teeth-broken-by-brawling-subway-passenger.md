										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_07_bear2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081539im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_bear2.jpg" width="280" height="408"> <br> <i style=" width:280px; ;display:block"> Police Officer Vincent Tieniber and Bear (NYPD)</i></div> Yesterday morning, a member of the NYPD Transit Bureau&apos;s K9 team was injured while helping his human partner respond to a subway brawl on a subway platform. Bear was kicked in the mouth by a 22-year-old woman&#x2014;four of the German shepherd&apos;s teeth were damaged and his tongue was lacerated. <p></p>

<p>According to the police, Tieniber, 36, and Bear, 6,  were helping Police Officer Rafael Diaz &quot;break up a fight involving four women, ages 19 to 31&quot; at the 59th Street and Lexington Avenue southbound 4 platform. &quot;One woman, 19, was being choked by another 19-year-old. The two women, ages 31 and 22, pushed Officer Diaz as he attempted to stop the assault on the 19-year-old victim.&quot;</p>

<p>After arriving on scene, Tieniber was handcuffing Ravenia Matos-Davis, 22, and sprained his wrist. Then Matos-Davis allegedly kicked Bear twice in the mouth, &quot;cracking two teeth and chipping two others, cutting his tongue, and leaving scuff marks on his snout.&quot; Tieniber said that in spite of his injuries, &quot;Bear kept the woman&#x2019;s foot in his mouth, and held on until I could handcuff her.&quot; Police say the dog&apos;s teeth didn&apos;t penetrate the woman&apos;s shoes and add his two broken teeth will be capped and his chipped teeth will be shaved later. </p>

<p>Matos-Davis was charged with injuring a police animal, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration. Alexandria James, 19, was charged with strangulation and criminal possession of a controlled substance while Tabricia Moore, 31, was charged with OGA, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct. Police say the 19-year-old victim suffered bruising, scratches, and reported pain to her neck but refused medical attention.</p>

<p>The NYPD also has some history of Bear&apos;s teamwork with Tieniber:</p><blockquote>In 2011, at the Broadway Junction station of the A train in Brooklyn, Officer Tieniber spotted three men wanted for robbery, one armed with a pair of scissors. Officer Tieniber lined all of the suspects against the station wall, and handcuffed them as Bear stood guard, with his big brown eyes fixed intently on the three. The same year, Officer Tieniber came upon an assault in progress by a suspect armed with a razor at the Atlantic Pacific station of the N,Q,R line. There, the suspect froze at Bear&#x2019;s bark, allowing Officer Tieniber to make the arrest without further incident. The duo have also been responsible for tracking wanted suspects and recovering ballistic evidence, employing the combination of Officer Tieniber&#x2019;s handling skills and Bear&#x2019;s olfactory prowess. Bear, age 6, has been on the job for five years; Officer Tieniber for 11.</blockquote><p></p>
