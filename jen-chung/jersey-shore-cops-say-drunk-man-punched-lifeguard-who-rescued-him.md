<p>In Seaside Heights, no good deed goes unpunished. Lifeguards in the Jersey shore town were attacked by the very man they saved, police say. The man, who is from <strike>Philadelphia (<em>of course</em>)</strike> NJ (<em>of course</em>), was allegedly drunk</p>

<p>Beach director Jay Boyd said, &quot;He was clearly under the influence.&quot; Rivera was charged with simple assault, disorderly conduct and underage drinking.</p>
