You get to avoid paying taxes AND get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110330114519/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/partying_with_ray_kelly_has_its_adv.php">VIP service from the NYPD</a>. So, last night on the Daily News, Jon Stewart covered the matter in a segment called, &quot;I Give Up,&quot; noting how GE has cut 20% of its American workforce while moving jobs overseas. </p>

<p>Stewart also complained how President Obama appointed GE head Jeffrey Immelt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110330114519/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/22/president_obama_says_hes_rooting_fo.php">to be an economic adviser</a> and looked at whether GE&apos;s own NBC covered the news:</p>

<p>Here&apos;s more from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110330114519/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html">NY Times story</a>: &quot;Although the top corporate tax rate in the United States is 35 percent, one of the highest in the world, companies have been increasingly using a maze of shelters, tax credits and subsidies to pay far less. In a regulatory filing just a week before the Japanese disaster put a spotlight on the company&#x2019;s nuclear reactor business, G.E. reported that its tax burden was 7.4 percent of its American profits, about a third of the average reported by other American multinationals. Even those figures are overstated, because they include taxes that will be paid only if the company brings its overseas profits back to the United States. With those profits still offshore, G.E. is effectively getting money back.&quot;</p>
