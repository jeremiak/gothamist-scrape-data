<p>If you&apos;ve watched one of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer&apos;s famously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/sean-spicer-press-briefing/">confrontational</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://dcist.com/2017/01/sean_spicer_lying_liar.php">lie-filled press briefings</a> and wondered who on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> would play him, you got an answer last night. Melissa McCarthy, always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/14/videos_melissa_mccarthy_joins_five-.php#photo-1">one of the show&apos;s best hosts</a>, portrayed the beleaguered Trump staffer with gusto&#x2014;and a whole lot of anger. &quot;Before we begin, I know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,&quot; she yells at the press corps. &quot;In the sense when I say &#x2018;rocky start,&#x2019; I mean it in the sense of &#x2018;Rocky&#x2019; the movie, because I came out here to punch you in the face! And also I don&#x2019;t talk so good!&quot;</p>

<p>She adds, &quot;Now I&apos;d like to begin today by apologizing on behalf of you to me for how you have treated me these last two weeks, and that apology is not accepted. Because I&apos;m not here to be your buddy. I&apos;m here to swallow gum and I&apos;m here to take names,&quot; while swallowing a container of gum. </p>

<p>McCarthy, as Spicer, also tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/26/sean-spicer-twitter-his-password/">reporters his email password</a>, used a Super-Soaker on a &quot;lying&quot; reporter, holds a CNN reporter in captivity, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/arts/television/trump-snl-melissa-mccarthy-sean-spicer.html?_r=0">refutes the press&apos; coverage</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://dcist.com/2017/01/trump_gives_the_supreme_court_nomin.php">Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch</a>, &quot;The crowd greeted him with a standing ovation, which lasted a full 15 minutes. And you can check the tape on that! Everyone was smiling. Everyone was happy. The men all had erections, and every single one of the women was ovulating left and right. And no one, no one was sad. Those are the facts forever.&quot; </p>

<p>There was also this interpretation of the ban on refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority nations:</p>

<p>And something we hope to see from future pressers:</p>

<p>McCarthy also yells, &quot;Live from New York, it&apos;s Saturday night!&quot; which was a joke, because this was a cold open sketch that aired around midnight. Alec Baldwin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/23/alec_baldwin_snl_host.php">who will host next weekend</a>, returned to play President Trump during the cold open, and Steve Bannon joined him. Of course, Steve Bannon was the Grim Reaper, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/wtf_is_happening_here.php">totally in line with Bannon&apos;s view of himself</a>. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZOF9q5fzfs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>In the sketch, &quot;Trump&quot;, wearing a Russian flag pin, tells an aide how much he loves daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, &quot;They always keep me so calm and make sure I don&#x2019;t do anything too crazy&quot;&#x2014;so are they around? The aide says no, &quot;They don&apos;t work on Shabbat. &quot;Perfect,&quot; Baldwin says, &quot;when the Jews are away, the goys will play. Send in Steve Bannon.&quot;</p>

<p>Because he&apos;s &quot;had a long day&quot; and &quot;tired and cranky,&quot; Baldwin as Trump announces, &quot;I feel like I could just freak out on somebody,&quot; so he calls Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (&quot;No, no refugees. America first, Australia sucks, your reef is failing, prepare to go to war&quot;); Mexican President Enrique Pe&#xF1;a Nieto; and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who, upon answering, &quot;Hello? Is this my sweet Barack? Barack Obama, I miss you&quot; but when she realizes it&apos;s Trump, she says, &quot;Gross.&quot; </p>

<p>There was also a call to Zimbabwe&apos;s Robert Mugabe, so &quot;Trump&quot; can boss around a little country, but Mugabe scoffs, &quot;You think you are a real dictator? I will rip out your spine and drink from your skull! You <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329123709/http://theweek.com/speedreads/676806/president-trump-reportedly-terrified-stairs">cannot even walk down stairs</a>, you little white b&#x2014;-! Don&#x2019;t you ever call Zimbabwe again!&quot;</p>

<p>And let&apos;s be certain of the real power dynamic in the Oval Office:</p>
