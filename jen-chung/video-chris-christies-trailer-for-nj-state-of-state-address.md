<p>Last week, NJ Governor Chris Christie postponed his State of the State address after a GOP leader and friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/nj_gop_leader_dies_in_statehouse_ba.php">died at the Statehouse</a>. Now, he&apos;s ready to give his speech at 3 p.m. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/http://nj.gov/governor/media/live/">you can see it live here</a>), and he&apos;s been trying to get people (well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/https://twitter.com/#!/GovChristie/status/159302744170172416">political</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/https://twitter.com/#!/GovChristie/status/159303979598229504">reporters</a>) excited by sharing his movie trailer about the &quot;Jersey Comeback&quot; which is less amusing than Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/12/video_bloombergs_gets_his_gaga_on_i.php">State of the City video</a> but possibly as surreal:</p>

<p>In the video, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/01/17/christies-big-speech-gets-trailer-treatment/?mod=WSJBlog">Christie touts</a>, &quot;Leadership is not about fear. Leadership is about commitment. Leadership is about telling the truth and leadership is about getting things done,&quot; and &quot;If we did the really tough things we need to do we are going to be able to start cutting taxes.&quot;  However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/29/chris_christie_i_weigh_too_much_bec.php">some of his honesty did not make</a> the final cut.</p>

<p>More recently, Christie has been talking about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/christ_christie_and_oprah.php">stealing doughnuts and how dangerous Obama is</a> and appearing at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172725/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/video_chris_christie_heckled_by_occ.php">campaign events for his BFF Mitt Romney</a>.</p>
