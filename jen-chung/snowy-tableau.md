<p>In a scene reminiscent of one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160159/http://themeekgroup.com/Snowmen/">Calvin&apos;s snowmen massacres</a>, reader Kelley snapped this photograph at McCarren Park on Friday.  She wrote, &quot;I don&apos;t know who made this scene but I invite anyone to make up their own story,&quot; adding, &quot;About 30 minutes after this photo was taken, around five or six random kids made off with the snowman heads and poof! the scene was gone...&quot;</p>
