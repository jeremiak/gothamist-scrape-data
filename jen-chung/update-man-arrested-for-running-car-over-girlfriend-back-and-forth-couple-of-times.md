Police found a car with NY plates abandoned a mile from the scene.  One of the good Samaritans who tried to help the woman told WCBS 2, &quot;I tried to open the [driver&apos;s] door and the door was locked. He deliberately killed that woman I think.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The incident occurred at 5:20 p.m. at Anderson Avenue and Inwood Terrace.  Another witness said of the driving, &quot;Run back and forth, back and forth, couple of times. It&#x2019;s like at least, more than three times.&quot; A third said, &quot;Then he ran over her again. If you don&#x2019;t believe me, I was almost going to break the window.&quot;</p>

<p>WCBS 2 reports, &quot;Fort Lee police have reportedly notified Port Authority police to be on the lookout for a suspect who may be trying to board a plane at an area airport, according to 1010 WINS&#x2019; Steve Sandberg,&quot; and now NBC New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154650/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Fort-Lee-NJ-Fatal-Hit-Run-Homicide-Investigation-Anderson-Inwood-Terrace-139770713.html">says a suspect is in custody</a>.</p>

<p>Ann, a naturalized citizen with family in Korea, is being held in Queens, awaiting extradition, on $3 million bail.  A bank manager who overheard the accident said, &quot;I heard the start and stop of tires spinning it happened four or five times. I heard the sound of a tire squealing and then stop, tire squealing and then stop. I heard someone crying and screaming.... When I got up from my desk, I heard people screaming I saw the body it was horrific. ... I haven&apos;t seen anything like that since I was overseas in combat in Iraq.&quot;</p>
