</div></div><p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085729/http://www.tenement.org/">Lower East Side Tenement Museum</a> was one of ten museums and libraries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085729/http://www.imls.gov/news/2008/092908_leten.shtm">awarded the 2008 National Medal for Museum and Library Service</a>, the country&apos;s &quot;highest honor for institutions that make significant and exceptional contributions to their communities.&quot;  The Institute of Museum and Library Services honors these institutions for &quot;reach[ing] out to people of all ages and backgrounds and invite them to explore our wonderfully diverse history, culture, and literature.&quot;</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve ever been to the Tenement Museum, which is right on Orchard Street, you&apos;ll know that&apos;s true.  The museum offers a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085729/http://www.tenement.org/tours.html">number of guided tours</a> that show how immigrants of different backgrounds lived and worked during the 19th and 20th centuries through six restored apartments. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085729/http://www.tenement.org/">museum&apos;s website</a> has various virtual tours, and channel Thirteen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085729/http://www.thirteen.org/tenement/logcabin.html">created this website</a> showing the &quot;urban log cabin&quot; of the museum.</p>

<p>Yesterday, First Lady Laura Bush visited the Tenement Museum with daughter Barbara.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085729/http://www.tenement.org/tours.html">museum&apos;s entrance</a> is at 108 Orchard Street, and it&apos;s open 7 days a week, 11a-5p (tickets are $17 for adults, $13 for students and seniors 65 years+).  There are also free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085729/http://www.tenement.org/vizcenter_events.html">&quot;Tenement Talks&quot;</a> held throughout the year.</p>
