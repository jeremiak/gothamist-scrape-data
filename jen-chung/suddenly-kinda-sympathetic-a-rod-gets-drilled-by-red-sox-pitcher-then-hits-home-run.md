<p>Congratulations, Red Sox&#x2014;you&apos;ve done the nearly unthinkable: You&apos;ve made Alex Rodriguez, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824163808/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/06/video_a-rod_booed_at_first_bat_afte.php">much-despised</a> alleged HGH user with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824163808/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/05/211_game_suspension_for_alex_rodrig.php">211-game suspension</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824163808/http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/60-minutes-says-rod-leaked-biogenesis-implicating-ryan-143300690.html">alleged snitch</a> into someone to feel a little sorry for! Rodriguez was drilled by a second inning pitch from the Red Sox&apos; Ryan Dempster yesterday, who seemingly aimed at Rodriguez.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824163808/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/dempster_denies_it_4rXVItuU43PKUZUabTTjSI">Post reports</a>, &quot;Dempster threw one pitch at the ankle of Rodriguez... another near his waist and then plunked him on the left elbow.&quot; Dempster denied aiming at A-Rod and remained in the game, but Yankees manager Joe Girardi was livid and complained to the umpire, who threw him out of the game. Girardi said of his ejection, &quot;He should have thrown [Dempster] out. I don&#x2019;t understand why he&#x2019;s left in the game and then they give us a warning?&quot;</p>

<p>Then, in the sixth inning, Rodriguez hit one of Dempster&apos;s pitches for a home run, which helped the Yankees seal their 9-6 win. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824163808/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/rodiculous-plunked-a-rod-homers-ignite-yankee-win-article-1.1430503">Rodriguez said</a>, &quot;Joe&#x2019;s reaction was amazing. Every single one of my teammates came up to me and said, &#x2018;Hit a bomb and walk it off.&#x2019; They were as pissed as I was. That&#x2019;s just not right.&quot; Dickish Red Sox players, bringing Yankees players together!</p>

<p>Rodriguez trotted around the bases to many, many boos from the crowd. As for whether Dempster should get any punishment, A-Rod joked, &quot;I&#x2019;m the wrong guy to be asking about a suspension,&quot; but added, &quot;I&#x2019;ve got an attorney I can recommend.&quot;</p>
