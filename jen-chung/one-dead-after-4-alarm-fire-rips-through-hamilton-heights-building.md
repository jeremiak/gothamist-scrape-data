<p>The fire started at 512 West 136th Street before 5:45 p.m. The fire went to four alarms as 175 firefighters battled the blaze. After the fire was extinguished, a body was found. According to WCBS 2, &quot;The victim was found on an upper floor staircase landing and was so severely burned that it was not clear whether it was a man or a woman. The victim had been trying to escape, the FDNY said.&quot; Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said last night, &quot;We don&#x2019;t know what apartment the person came from other than they were found on the top floor and they were badly burned.&quot; </p>

<p>At this point, it&apos;s been determined the victim was a female, on the sixth floor landing. Two other civilians were injured, as were 10 firefighters. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014318/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hamilton-Heights-Fire-Apartment-Building-136th-Street-271745031.html">NBC New York reports</a>, &quot;At one point, flames were shooting out of a window with such force that they appeared to overwhelm a firefighter before he was able to jump onto the fire escape one story below.&quot;</p>

<p>Many residents used fire escapes to leave the building. One, Sandra Delacruz said, &quot;I&#x2019;m surprised I&#x2019;m here with my dog. He doesn&#x2019;t have a leash. I just panicked and we just got out of the apartment... I rushed to get out, and I went to the third floor to knock on my uncle&#x2019;s door, tell him that it was smoke or fire coming into the building, and then when we were going to the second floor, I couldn&#x2019;t pass the second floor because it was black and smoke.&quot; She used a second floor fire escape.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014318/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/dead-fire-hamilton-heights-article-1.1908047">Another neighbor on the fourth floor</a>, Rosa Rodriguez, said, &quot;Our entire apartment was filled with smoke. It was too hot; the first floor was completely burning. We had to go up the fire escape to the roof.&quot;</p>

<p>The Red Cross provided support and meals for displaced residents, as well as emergency housing. The FDNY thinks the fire is suspicious &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014318/http://nypost.com/2014/08/18/deadly-apartment-fire-rips-through-hamilton-heights/">because of the large volume of the blaze</a>&quot; and is investigating.</p>
