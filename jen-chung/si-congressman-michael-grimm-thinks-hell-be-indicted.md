<p>Rep. Michael Grimm, the Staten Island&apos;s Republican in D.C. and guy who likes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427022142/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/rep_grimm_to_ny1_reporter_ill_throw.php">threaten throwing reporters off the balcony</a> at the Capitol Building, is waiting for the feds to indict him. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427022142/http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/michael-grimm-new-york-campaign-finance-violations-106037.html">His lawyer tells Politico</a>, &quot;After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm.&quot; May we take a moment to say, ahem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427022142/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7wtNOkuHo">&quot;Ha ha!&quot;</a>?</p>

<p>Grimm&#x2019;s lawyer, William McGinley, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427022142/http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/michael-grimm-new-york-campaign-finance-violations-106037.html">issued this statement to Politico</a>: &quot;We are disappointed by the government&#x2019;s decision, but hardly surprised. From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth. Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing... When the dust settles, he will be vindicated. Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The FBI has been investigating Grimm&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427022142/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/fbi_arrests_houston_friend_of.html">alleged use of straw donors</a> for his 2010 campaign. While Grimm is a former FBI agent, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427022142/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/04/congressman-michael-grimm-at-the-caribbean-tropics.html">classic story from The New Yorker</a> revealed that when he was an agent, he flashed his gun at a nightclub while in a love triangle spat.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&apos;s a big week of reckoning for Grimm: He just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140427022142/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/rep_grimm_endorses_climate_cha.html#incart_m-rpt-1">accepted climate change science as being real</a>.</p>
