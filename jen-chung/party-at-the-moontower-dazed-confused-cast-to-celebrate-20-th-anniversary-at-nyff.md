<p>&quot;<em>All right you little freshman bitches&#x2014;AIR RAID!</em>&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022201720/http://filmlinc.com/">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a> has just announced that its big annual reunion screening, to be held next month, will be Richard Linklater&apos;s 1993 ode to high school in 1976, <em>Dazed and Confused</em>. In previous years, they&apos;ve reunited the <em>Princess Bride</em> cast as well as <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#x2019;s hard to believe that his hair-raisingly perfect autobiographical film about the last day of high school in 1976, extending through the hard-partying night to the next morning, is now 20 years old,&quot; the Film Society harshly reminded us in their announcement. To celebrate the nostalgia film that we&apos;re now nostalgic for, Linklater and cast members will be at the screening&#x2014;though they haven&apos;t announced specifics on who yet, we&apos;d be happy with just Parker Posey and that stoned skirt-chaser Wooderson.</p>

<p>The film, presented by the Film Society&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022201720/http://www.filmlinc.com/support/new-wave-program">New Wave young patron program</a>, will screen on October 10th at 9 p.m. They haven&apos;t announced a ticket sale date yet, but expect members to scoop them all up&#x2014;we&apos;ll update when we find out more on general public ticket sales, which will be through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022201720/http://www.filmlinc.com/nyff2013/pages/ticketinfo">NYFF&apos;s ticketing site</a>. In the meantime, enjoy these moments:</p>
