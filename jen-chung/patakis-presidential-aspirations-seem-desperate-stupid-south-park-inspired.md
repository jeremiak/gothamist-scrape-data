After sources told media outlets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601015037/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/yawn_pataki_might_run_for_president.php">he&apos;s ready to jump into the shark tank</a> a few days, now it turns out Pataki is going to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601015037/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/pataki-visit-stirs-speculation-about-presidential-bid/">at a Republican picnic in Iowa this weekend</a> and there&apos;s some sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601015037/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/08/24/pataki-nods-all-the-more-toward-a-2012-run/">George Pataki 2012 prototype website</a>.  </p>

<p>This was most clearly explained down by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601015037/http://twitter.com/#!/BKpolitics/status/106404386833563648">BKPolitics, who Tweeted</a>, &quot;1) Build website. 2) ???? 3) Voters vote for Pataki in New Hampshire 4) ???? 5) Presidency&quot; because it&apos;s unclear how Pataki&apos;s liberal and Tea Party-repelling moves will appeal to voters.  (New York Republican Assemblyman Thomas Kirwan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601015037/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/08/21/2011-08-21_former_gov_george_pataki_close_to_entering_republican_presidential_race.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;Pataki the first two years was great, then we went on a spending binge. The federal debt runup was rivaled only by what we did in New York under George Pataki.&quot;)  So obviously Pataki&apos;s advisers are familiar with the classic South Park episode, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601015037/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomes_(South_Park)">Gnomes</a>, where Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny find out that gnomes have been stealing underpants to make money, because that is the most plausible reason for a Pataki 2012 run.</p>

<p>Pataki&apos;s spokesman told the NY Times, &#x201C;President Obama&#x2019;s wrong decisions on the economy and his failed leadership on debt, coupled with a lack of real solutions being offered by the current Republican field of candidates, has Governor Pataki seriously considering getting in the race.&quot;  Or maybe he&apos;s seriously considering being a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601015037/http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Aide-Ex-N-Y-Gov-Pataki-seriously-2138347.php">VP or cabinet member for a Republican President</a>?</p>
