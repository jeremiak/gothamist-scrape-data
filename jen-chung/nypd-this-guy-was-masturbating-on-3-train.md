<p>It&apos;s beyond the comprehension of most New Yorkers, but there are some gross people who thinks it&apos;s swell to masturbate on the subway. Luckily, other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708081016/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/15/no_surprise_big_increase_in_reporti.php">straphangers report these incidents</a>&#x2014;and police say one man was caught doing this on the 3 train yesterday morning.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, a man was spotted &quot;put[ting] his hand in his pants and [manipulating] his genitals&quot; on a 3 train near the Clark Street station in Brooklyn Heights around 7:35 a.m. Friday.</p>

<p>Police shared images of the suspect, who is wanted for public lewdness. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708081016/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">the Crime stoppers website</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then entering TIP577.</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on, etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708081016/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. Do not let the perverts win.</p>
