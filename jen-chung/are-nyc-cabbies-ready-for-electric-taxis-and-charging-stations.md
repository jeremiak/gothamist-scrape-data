	<p>Will taxi drivers be willing to charge electric cars instead of filling up at a gas station? That&apos;s what the Taxi and Limousine Commission wants to know, so NYC has put six electric cars&#x2014;the Nissan Leaf&#x2014;on the street. If NYC had an all-electric taxi fleet, carbon dioxide emissions would drop by 90,000 tons annually.</p>

<p>However, the challenge is whether taxi drivers will be down: TLC Commissioner David Yassky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060501/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/nyregion/electric-taxi-experiment-to-begin-in-new-york.html">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s to figure out how a taxi driver can integrate 60 to 90 minutes of charging into a day. Frankly, just as important, it&#x2019;s to show other taxi drivers that it can be done.&quot; It&apos;s believed 30 minutes of charging can give drivers about 80 miles of driving in the city, and drivers say they usually rack up 100 miles a day. </p>

<p>The six drivers who volunteered for the program are allowed to turn away passengers due their destinations (Yassky said, &quot;They&#x2019;re pioneers. We want to give them the leeway.&quot;). Some drivers have charging stations at their homes while some have been put in the Lower East Side, Far West Side and Union Square. FWIW: It costs taxi drivers $17,500 for gas in a year.</p>

<p>While the Taxi Worker Alliance&apos;s Bhairavi Desai is very skeptical of an all-electric fleet, some drivers like the idea, pointing out that charging would force them to take breaks. One even thinks there&apos;s a great business model by putting businesses near the charging stations, &quot;For taxi drivers, washroom is the biggest problem. We go to Starbucks.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, Mayor Bloomberg wants to make one third of the taxi fleet electric by 2020. The mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060501/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130422/new-york-city/mayor-bloomberg-touts-first-electric-taxi-for-cleaner-city">rode in one today</a> and urged other New Yorkers to try them out, &quot;I could actually read. It was smooth and quiet. It was nice.&quot;<br>
