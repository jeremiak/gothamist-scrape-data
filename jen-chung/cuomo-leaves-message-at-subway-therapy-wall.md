</div></div>					<p>The Subway Therapy Wall, where New Yorkers and visitors alike have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721193232/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/subway_therapy_messages.php#photo-1">sharing their feelings about the 2016 election</a>, has attracted thousands of messages. Last night, Governor Andrew Cuomo posted his own missive at the Union Square wall. </p>

<p>The governor&apos;s note:</p><blockquote>&quot;New York State holds the torch high! - Andrew C.<p></p>

<p>&apos;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free &#x2026; I lift my lamp beside the golden door&apos; Emma Lazarus</p>

<p>STATUE OF LIBERTY&quot;</p></blockquote>Cuomo emphasized that the hateful rhetoric stirred up by the Trump campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721193232/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/andrew_cuomo_on_second_thought_trum.php">is unacceptable</a> but last week he also said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721193232/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/oh_sweet_bonus_yay_trump.php">wouldn&apos;t mind working</a> with the President-elect on projects that can move New York&apos;s infrastructure forward.<p></p>

<p>Artist Matthew &quot;Levee&quot; Chavez set up the Subway Therapy wall on the long 14th Street corridor between the 1/2/3 station on 7th Avenue and the F/M/L station on 6th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721193232/http://abc7ny.com/hobbies/have-strong-feelings-about-the-election-try-some-subway-therapy/1598825/">He said last week</a>, &quot;Because of how stressful the last couple of days were, I thought it would be nice to have something that people could do really quickly so that they could maybe get something off their chest.&quot;</p>

<p>Chavez will be at the 14th Street tunnel for the 1/2/3 and F/M/L lines today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721193232/http://www.subwaytherapy.com/office-hours/">from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.</a> </p>
