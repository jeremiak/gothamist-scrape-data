<p>The $4.2 million project (which included a new pathway and restored iron stairway between the bridge and a water tower) is part of a $60 million plan to restore the High Bridge as part of Bloomberg&apos;s PlaNYC initiative.  The Mayor said,  &quot;<strong>I&#x2019;d like to think that the High Bridge will do for uptown and the Bronx what the High Line is going to do to revitalize the neighborhoods along the Hudson River.</strong>&#x201D; </p>

<p>It&apos;s expected the High Bridge restoration will be complete in 2012.  However, some critics worry that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811095616/http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/Upkeep_is_missing_in_park_rehab_plan/13484.html">maintaining the park will be an issue</a>, as city funding to the parks department has decreased.
