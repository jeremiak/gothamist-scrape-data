<p>As diplomats and world leaders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/03/president-elect_trump_has_already_m.php">wonder (and panic) about President-elect Trump</a>, they&apos;re probably not finding any comfort in his hair-trigger Tweets about a sketch comedy show. Last night, Saturday Night Live returned with a cold open about the future leader of the free world and how he loves the social media app. And how he&apos;s going to &quot;Build that swamp!&quot;</p>

<p>In the sketch, Trump transition officials are trying to get the PEOTUS to focus on work&#x2014;but he&apos;s just retweeting random people. Kate McKinnon, as Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, explains, &quot;There is a reason that Donald Tweets so much. He does it to distract the media from his business conflicts and all the very scary people in his cabinet.&quot;</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin, playing slack-jawed Trump, disagrees, &quot;Actually that&apos;s not why I do it. I do it because my brain is bad.&quot;</p>

<p>The cold open referenced actual Twitter users who have been retweeted by Trump, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-retweets-16-year-old-california-boy-tirade-cnn-article-1.2891267">like 16-year-old California boy &quot;Seth&quot;</a>. The sketch also featured Trump&apos;s complaints to the media about using unflattering photos of him, as well as his freewheeling approach to dealing with other nations (he suggests Ivanka send Iran some of her shoes). When McKinnon&apos;s Conway later reminds him he has dinner with Mitt Romney, Baldwin&apos;s Trump asks, &quot;Can we at least have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/trump_catchers_mitt.php">picture together where he looks like a little bitch?</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, SNL revealed its Steve Bannon: He&apos;s actually Death (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/wtf_is_happening_here.php">not Darth Vader</a>). </p>

<p>Not 45 minutes later, the real Trump lashed out:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can&apos;t get any worse. Sad</p>&#x2014; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/805278955150471168">December 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016015238js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Baldwin responded:</p>

<div><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> <br><br>Release your tax returns and I&apos;ll stop.<br>Ha</p>&#x2014; ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/805284113741729792">December 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016015238js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></div>

<p>And in that crucial Radiohead demographic, the cold open was a hit:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">..think you&apos;re on to something here chaps &#x1F44D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/https://twitter.com/nbcsnl">@nbcsnl</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/https://t.co/qXKsp4ioxj">https://t.co/qXKsp4ioxj</a></p>&#x2014; Thom Yorke (@thomyorke) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015238/https://twitter.com/thomyorke/status/805471444322963457">December 4, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016015238js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>As a character in the sketch said, it&apos;s seven weeks until inauguration.</p>
