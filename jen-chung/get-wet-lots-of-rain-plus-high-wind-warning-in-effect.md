										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:291px; "> <img alt="010_09_rainfal.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522033459im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/010_09_rainfal.jpg" width="291" height="243"> <br> <i>Via Accuweather</i></div> September has been pretty dry&#x2014;up until now.  Thanks to Tropical Rainstorm Nicole, torrential rain is headed our way. Last night, the National Weather Service warned there was &quot;the chance for strong to severe rain and wind late this evening through early Friday&quot;&#x2014;translation: there may be flooding&#x2014;and now there&apos;s a &quot;High Wind Warning&quot; in effect until tomorrow morning at 6 a.m.&#x2014;translation: watch out from stuff flying off roofs or scaffolding and if you&apos;re a property owner/manager, tie stuff down!<p></p>

<p>After Nicole has already battered North Carolina, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522033459/http://www.accuweather.com/blogs/news/story/38088/flooding-rain-spreading-north.asp">Accuweather reports</a> that NYC and other New England cities &quot;will get soaked when a second band of torrential rain spreads from the eastern mid-Atlantic to New England late today into Friday... Numerous flash flooding problems are sure to ensue in low-lying and poor drainage areas, as well as along small streams... Some streets and highways will become inundated with flood waters. That includes roads in the cities of Albany, N.Y.; New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Wilmington, Del.; and Richmond, Va... Even if flooding does not occur, the torrential rain will endanger motorists by reducing visibility and heightening the risk of vehicles hydroplaning. Leaves lying on wet roadways will create slippery travel conditions.&quot; </p>

<p>As for the wind, the NWS says, &quot;Southerly winds will develop by late morning and steadily increase throughout the day. Sustained winds of 25 to 35 MPH with gusts up to 60 MPH are expected by late afternoon lasting through this evening.&quot; WABC 7 Meteorologist Bill Evans offers his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522033459/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=weather/forecast&amp;id=6563415">analysis of the weather and says</a>, &quot;The worst effects of this storm, including its torrential rain and the strongest winds, will be occurring later this afternoon and tonight.&quot;</p>
