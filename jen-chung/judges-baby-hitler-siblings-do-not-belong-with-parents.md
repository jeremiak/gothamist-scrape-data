<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="2010_07_babyhitler.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613192256im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_babyhitler.jpg" width="240" height="153"> <br> <i>Heath Campbell and wife Deborah with son Adolf Hitler Campbell</i></div> Back in December of 2008, a NJ family became infamous after complaining that a Shop-Rite supermarket <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613192256/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/17/no_shoprite_cake_for_baby_hitler.php">refused to give them a birthday cake </a>with their son&apos;s name on it.  The son&apos;s name? Adolf Hitler Campbell.  With the spotlight on the family, led by father Heath Campbell, a &quot;Nazi fan&quot; (his other kids are JoyceLynn Aryan Nation and Honszlyn Hinler Jeannie) and Holocaust denier who decorates his home with swastikas, NJ&apos;s Division of Youth and Family Services <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613192256/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/safety_concerns_over_baby_toddler_h.php">removed Adolf and his sisters</a> from their parents custody a month later. Now a panel of judges agrees that DYFS did the right thing.<p></p>

<p>The children weren&apos;t taken away because of their names, but over domestic abuse allegations.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613192256/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/state_judge_rules_dyfs_was_rig.html">Star-Ledger reports</a>, &quot;The trio of appellate judges concluded that &apos;evidence of prior domestic violence committed by defendant-father against his ex-wife and the two children of a prior marriage was admissible in this case to prove the risk of harm to these children,&apos; the judges wrote.&quot;</p>

<p>Heath Campbell had previously claimed his children <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613192256/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/29/toddler_hitlers_dad_speaks_out.php">weren&apos;t being cared for by the state</a>.  As for his son&apos;s unusual name, &quot;There&apos;s a new president and he says it&apos;s time for a change. Well, then it&apos;s time for a change. They need to accept a name. A name&apos;s a name. The kid isn&apos;t going to grow up and do what [Hitler] did.&quot; </p>
