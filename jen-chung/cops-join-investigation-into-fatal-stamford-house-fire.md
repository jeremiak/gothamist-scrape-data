<p>Funeral arrangements have been set for the three young girls killed in a Christmas Day fire&#x2014;and a memorial service, scheduled for 10:30 am. Thursday at at St. Thomas, Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/12/30/funeral-planned-for-christmas-fire-victims/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=WSJ_NY_NY_Blog">will be open to the public</a>.  Dominic Carrella, of the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Services-set-for-Stamford-fire-victims-2433280.php">tells the Stamford Advocate</a>, &quot;It&apos;s going to be a large turnout on Thursday. I know the firefighters from Connecticut will be attending.&quot;</p>

<p>Dozens of firefighters responded to the blaze that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/26/fashion_executives_three_daughters.php">ravaged a three-story Victorian home around 5 a.m.</a> on Christmas Day.  By the time they got there (just minutes after receiving 911 calls), the blaze was too intense and they were unable to rescue anyone inside the home. Lily Badger, 9, and her twin sisters, Grace and Sarah, 7, were killed, as were their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson. Their mother, Madonna Badger, who owned the house, was rescued from scaffolding outside the house (she was trying to climb to her daughters rooms), while her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, also survived and reportedly needed to be restrained from re-entering the house to try to save the others.</p>

<p>Around 3 a.m. on Christmas, Borcina <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/27/yule_logs_embers_eyed_in_fatal_stam.php">emptied the fireplace&apos;s embers</a> into a bag and put them either in the home&apos;s mudroom or a nearby trash enclosure, and investigators believe the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/28/fatal_stamford_house_fire_smolderin.php">embers were the cause of the fire</a>.  Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/12/30/stamford-police-step-up-role-in-deadly-christmas-day-fire-investigation/">CBS 2 reports</a> that the Stamford police are getting more involved with the case: Borcina, a contractor, was also in charge of renovating the home and had applied for permits for a smoke detection system, which did not seem to be activated at the time of the fire (it&apos;s unclear if there were battery-operated detectors). The family also shouldn&apos;t have been technically living on the second floor of the home, because it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/default/article/Officials-doubt-smoke-detectors-were-working-2429989.php">didn&apos;t have final approval for occupancy</a>.</p>

<p>John Jay Professor Robert McCrie told WCBS 2, &quot;Absolutely detectives should be involved, right from the beginning,&quot; and said that the police will likely look at Borcina&apos;s acitions, &quot;Was it laziness?  Carelessness?  An accident?  Difficult as those issues are, they need to be explored.  And those are issues best explored by investigators, detectives, not the fire marshal.&quot;  Borcina had been in the hospital until mid-week, while Badger was reportedly in a psychiatric hospital in Westchester County.  Badger, fashion branding executive, was in the process of getting a divorce from husband Matthew Badger, who lives in New York City.</p>

<p>Lomer and Pauline Johnson will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201723/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/memorial-services-girls-grandparents-killed-christmas-day-blaze-set-week-article-1.999023?localLinksEnabled=false">cremated at Woodlawn Cemetery</a>, but it&apos;s unclear whether the ashes will go to Canada or Kentucky.  Madonna Badger&apos;s brother Wade Johnson posted a message on Facebook, &quot;The Badger family and the Johnson family want to express our thoughts and prayers for all of the people who have been so deeply impacted by the tragedy on Christmas morning. We also want to say thank you for all of the prayers and well wishes that have come in from around the country and the world. We can feel the warmth of your prayers surrounding us as we struggle to cope with the tragic loss of our family members.&quot;  He previously mentioned, in reference to his father Lomer, who retired as a safety director, &quot;Dad would want me to tell you all to please check your smoke detectors.&quot;</p>
