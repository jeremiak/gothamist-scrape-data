<p>Did you miss the supermoon last night? Don&apos;t worry, it will still look super tonight.</p>

<p>The supermoon occurs when the full moon&apos;s elliptical orbit is closest to the earth (this is also called the lunar perigee). This November supermoon emerged last night into this morning, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234821/http://www.space.com/34515-supermoon-guide.html">Space.com assures us</a>, &quot;it will appear full to the casual observer in the day before and after the main event. &quot;</p>

<p>Noah Petro, deputy project scientist for NASA&#x2019;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234821/http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/novembers-spectacular-supermoon">said</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve been telling people to go out at night on either Sunday or Monday night to see the supermoon. The difference in distance from one night to the next will be very subtle, so if it&apos;s cloudy on Sunday, go out on Monday. Any time after sunset should be fine. Since the moon is full, it&apos;ll rise at nearly the same time as sunset, so I&apos;d suggest that you head outside after sunset, or once it&#x2019;s dark and the moon is a bit higher in the sky. You don&#x2019;t have to stay up all night to see it, unless you really want to!&quot;</p>

<p>The November supermoon is also the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234821/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/nov-supermoon-largest-moon-1948-article-1.2871446">brightest one since 1948</a>, and won&apos;t be this bright until 2034. But here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234821/http://www.space.com/34676-closest-supermoon-since-1948-surprising-facts.html">dose of reality</a>: &quot;While the moon will look 15 percent bigger and 16 percent brighter than a typical full moon, the average amateur astronomer won&apos;t see much of a difference. &apos;That&apos;s not enough to notice unless you&apos;re a very careful moon-watcher,&apos; Sky &amp; Telescope magazine senior editor Alan MacRobert said in a statement.&quot;</p>

<p>Today&apos;s supermoon is also known as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234821/http://www.space.com/34662-november-supermoon-full-beaver-moon.html">Beaver Moon</a>, because Algonquin tribes believed November was the best time to set beaver traps. The beaver is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234821/http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/emblems/animal.htm">NY State&apos;s official animal</a> and is even on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234821/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_New_York_City">NYC&apos;s flag</a>.</p>

<p>The next supermoon is December 13th.</p>
