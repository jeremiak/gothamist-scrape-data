<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_08_djam3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_08_djam3.jpg" width="180" height="218" class="image-left"> </span>The NYC Medical Examiner&apos;s Office has completed an autopsy of celebrity DJ Adam Goldstein, known as DJ AM, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/28/breaking_dj_am_found_dead_in_soho.php">body was found in his Soho apartment yesterday afternoon</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://www.tmz.com/2009/08/29/dj-am-autopsy-complete/">According to TMZ</a>, &quot;There has been no determination as to the cause of death -- more tests are needed, including toxicology. That could take several weeks to complete.&quot;  It&apos;s suspected that he may have died of a drug overdose, as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08292009/news/regionalnews/dj_am_in_sohodrug_death_187016.htm">crack pipe and numerous prescription drugs</a> were reportedly found near his body.  Friends had become concerned when he didn&apos;t go to Las Vegas for a gig and called the authorities to Goldstein&apos;s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://www.observer.com/2008/dj-am-spins-his-fine-philly-self-1-9-m-condo-balazs-one-kenmare-square"> $2 million apartment at 210 Lafayette Street</a> (One Kenmare Square).</p>

<p>Goldstein, who previously battled drug addiction, had survived a private plane crash in South Carolina last year; four other people died and Goldstein and Blink-182&apos;s Travis Barker were the only survivors, suffering second- and third-degree burns.  A friend, DJ Scott Schroer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/08/28/2009-08-28_adam_goldstein_aka_dj_am_found_dead_in_his_manhattan_apartment.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>Prescription drugs? If you had been in a plane crash a year ago, I&apos;m sure you&apos;d have prescription drugs, too</strong>... After the accident, he changed. He was more humble. He cared more about people and life.&quot; Another friend told the Post, &quot;He was taking painkillers, and he slowly grew addicted,&quot; while a third told Fox News, &quot;<strong>The need for drugs grew, and now here we are. It&apos;s terrible that no one was able to stop him soon enough, but it just happened so fast</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides DJing&#x2014;he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://www.tmz.com/2009/08/28/palms-casino-well-miss-our-resident-dj?icid=sphere_tmzcom_inline">&quot;resident DJ&quot; at the Palms Casino</a> in Las Vegas and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://www.tmz.com/2009/08/29/dj-ams-final-gig/">just played in Atlantic City</a> last Saturday, telling the crowd, &quot;Are you guys f**ked up tonight? I&apos;m not.&quot;&#x2014; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://www.thestate.com/thebuzz/story/920354.html">working on the video game DJ Hero</a>, Goldstein was also working with MTV on a show about drug addiction and intervention called, Gone Too Far. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160707073919/http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2009/08/dj_ams_eerie_last_sit_down_int.php">He told Extra</a>, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s life or death, some of these people have come so close to dying, just as I did</strong> ... People were there for me when I asked for help, and I had no idea how to stop, so I&apos;m there for them.&quot; Reportedly eight episodes of the show were completed.</p>
