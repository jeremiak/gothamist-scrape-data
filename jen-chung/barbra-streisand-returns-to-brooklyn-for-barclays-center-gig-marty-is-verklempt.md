Babs said in a statement, &quot;Brooklyn to me means the Loew&#x2019;s Kings, Erasmus, the Yeshiva I went to, the Dodgers, Prospect Park, great Chinese food. I&#x2019;m so glad I came from Brooklyn&#x2014;it&#x2019;s down to earth. I guess you CAN come home again.&quot;</p>

<p>The Atlantic Yards&apos; Report Norman Oder had reported that Streisand would perform at the still-under construction Barclays Center earlier this month and, this past Monday, found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083354/http://atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com/2012/05/yes-barbra-streisand-is-coming-to.html">confirmation on Ticketmaster</a>.  Barclays (and Brooklyn Nets) CEO Brett Yormark was mum up until today&apos;s announcement, saying on MyFoxNY, &quot;I think it was Bruce Ratner&apos;s vision, as well as Marty&apos;s, to bring Barbra home.&quot; Marty, of course, being Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, who wore a &quot;Brooklyn Loves Barbra&quot; shirt.  Markowitz said, &quot;We never had a venue. We finally have a facility that shows Brooklyn respect.&quot;</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083354/http://brooklyn.barbrastreisand.com/">full release on Streisand&apos;s site</a>; Bruce Ratner gave a statement, &quot;When I first thought about building an arena in Brooklyn, I always envisioned Barbra Streisand coming home to take center-stage in her native borough. It&#x2019;s humbling and almost surreal to welcome arguably the greatest entertainer of all-time to Barclays Center. Barbra is Brooklyn and there&#x2019;s nowhere more fitting for her to perform. This will be a night to remember.&quot;  Does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083354/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/jay_z_wil_christen_the_brooklyn_net.php">Jay-Z know</a> that Ratner thinks Babs is a bigger than he is?</p>

<p>Streisand, who has stage fright,  most recently performed publicly in New York at the Village Vanguard, in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083354/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/27/like_buttah_barbra_streisand_at_the.php">tiny 2009 engagement called &quot;One Night Only&quot;</a>:</p>

<p>Streisand&apos;s last big shows were in 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083354/http://atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com/2012/05/brooklyn-born-barbra-streisand-said-to.html">at Madison Square Garden</a>.  </p>
