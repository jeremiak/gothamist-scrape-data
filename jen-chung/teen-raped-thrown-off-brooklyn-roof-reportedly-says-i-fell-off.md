<p>While police have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117181141/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/cops_seeks_2nd_suspect_after_16-yea.php">arrested two</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117181141/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/20/2nd_suspect_arrested_for_raping_thr.php">suspects</a> in the rape and attempted murder of a 16-year-old girl in Brooklyn, it&apos;s unclear if the victim is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117181141/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/roof_rape_girl_fell_ktBUxHeT6n3avq35GGQ5XO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">Post reports</a> that the girl &quot;is getting cold feet about fingering her alleged attackers &#x2014; even as she lies in a body cast in a hospital bed.&quot; According to the paper&apos;s sources, she told investigations, &quot;I&apos;m hurt. I fell off.&quot;</p>

<p>Police and prosecutors say the victim was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117181141/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/victim-brooklyn-rape-serious-condition-article-1.1403614?localLinksEnabled=false">contacted by suspect</a> Anwar Desouza through a Backpage.com ad to come his home on Miller Avenue. There, she met Desouza and his friend Antonio Owensford and the pair allegedly attacked her, forcing to her perform oral sex and then throwing her off the roof. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117181141/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_busts_in_roof_toss_rape_dvrmvQKonbxtE3sPDFYWNJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">A neighbor said</a>, &quot;I was sleeping. I heard someone shouting, &#x2018;I need help, I need help!&#x2019; I heard a man&#x2019;s voice asking her, &#x2018;What happened, what happened?&#x2019; She said, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know how I got here.&#x2019; She was on the ground. She told the man, &#x2018;Call the ambulance. My legs are broken.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>Desouza, who is married with children, is being held on $250,000 bail but denies the charges. Owensford&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117181141/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/consensual-claims-man-accused-raping-teen-article-1.1404911?localLinksEnabled=false">told the Daily News</a> that his client says the sex was &quot;consensual.&quot;</p>
