<p>You know how a Russian billionaire<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235040/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/russian_billionaire_supposedly_boug.php"> bought an $88 million full-floor penthouse</a> at 15 Central Park West as a weekend crash pad for his 22-year-old daughter? Well, the deal was closed yesterday, generating &quot;close to $2.5 million in city and state taxes, and produced what brokers said was a record commission on a residential sale of about $3.5 million,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235040/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204792404577225490372772300.html?KEYWORDS=88+Million">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235040/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_apt88.jpg"> <img alt="2011_11_apt88.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235040im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2011/11/2011_11_apt88-thumb-640x283-674133.jpg" width="320" height="141" class="image-right"> </a> </span>Last November, former Citigroup chairman and philanthropist Sandy Weill listed the luxurious condo at $88 million and announced that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235040/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/ex-citi_chair_lists_15_cpw_apartmen.php">proceeds from the sale would go to charity</a>.  (Weill, who paid $43 million for the 6,437-square foot apartment in 2007, said he and his wife would downsize to a smaller apartment they own in the building.) Then, in December,  Russian fertilizer billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev bought the place for his daughter, Ekaterina, who is a university student: Rybolovlev&apos;s spokespeople said, &quot;She plans to stay in the apartment when visiting New York. Ms. Rybolovleva was born in Russia, is a resident of Monaco and has resided in Monaco and Switzerland for the past 15 years.&quot;</p>

<p>The brokers for the deal said that many features customized for the Weills, like an oval bedroom and a rosewood library, would remain.  But it&apos;s unclear whether Rybolovlev purchased a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235040/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/26/russian_billionaire_buys_835_millio.php">$8.35 million in the same building for his daughter&apos;s security detail</a>.  </p>
