                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_09_schoolbusbullet.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926205813im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_schoolbusbullet.jpg" width="370" height="280"> <br> <i style=" width:370px; ;display:block">The bullet is near the top of the bus (Via NBC New York)</i></div> A school bus carrying public school students was struck by a bullet while it was parked outside the Choir Academy of Harlem school yesterday afternoon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926205813/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Gunshots-Fired-Harlem-School-Bus-Kindergarten-Kids-Fragments-Bullet-224931102.html">According to NBC New York</a>, &quot;The bullet, which somehow traveled from more than a block away, was among six to eight shots that were fired during a gun battle in the area.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>Eleven children, ages 5 to 6, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926205813/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/23/gunfire-strikes-school-bus-with-children-onboard-in-harlem/">were on the bus</a> during the 3:30 p.m. shooting. No one was injured, and the children were removed to another bus. A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926205813/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/bullet-hits-school-bus-filled-students-article-1.1465625">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;It was four or five shots. Then a pause and then three or four more. Pop, pop, pop, pop.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926205813/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9258967">police closed</a> down East 127th Street between Park and Madison Avenues for its investigation. No arrests have been made. One neighbor told NBC New York, &quot;This is a neighborhood filled with children. Being a parent and a mother, it&apos;s heartwrenching. And considering what&apos;s been happening in the world today, with these types of catastrophic gunfire situations, it makes you wonder, when will it stop?&quot; </p>
