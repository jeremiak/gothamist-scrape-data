<p>Chaos at JFK Airport!  An individual who had been flagged by the TSA and was asked for a secondary screening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529024416/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/JFK-Airport-Security-Breach-Passenger-TSA-Delay-140282373.html">apparently walked away</a> around 5:20 a.m., causing security to shut down Terminal 7, c<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529024416/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/british_airways_terminal_security_SQjrUJXpz0AO6Jta02DIEL">lear it out, and then re-screen</a> all the passengers. The terminal reopened at around 7:40 a.m.</p>

<p>Later, it was &quot;My son has given up! JFK you win!&quot; and &quot;I gotta be kidding! TSA can find that 6oz bottle of lotion I hid beneath my underwear but let somebody thru w a computer &amp; didn&apos;t screen?&quot;  Finally, &quot;We were finally able 2 board our plane. Inconvenienced but very thankful to #JFK @Security for their diligence &amp; concern for our safety #win&quot; <br>
