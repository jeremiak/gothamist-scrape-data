<p>A reader just sent us this picture&#x2014;showing a truck apparently stuck at an angle&#x2014; at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130427020531/http://www.mta.info/bandt/html/veraz.htm">Verrazano Narrows Bridge</a> toll plaza with the prediction, &quot;The Verrazano is gonna be backed up.&quot; </p>
