<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2010_09_obaun.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811131440im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_09_obaun.jpg" width="640" height="449"> <br> <i>President Obama addresses the United Nations General Assembly (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Today, President Obama addressed the United Nations General Assembly with remarks about a number of issues, but there was particular focus on peace in the Middle East and Iran&apos;s nuclear proliferation.  He said, &quot; Those of us who are friends of Israel must understand that true security for the Jewish state requires an independent Palestine -- one that allows the Palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity.  And those of us who are friends of the Palestinians must understand that the rights of the Palestinian people will be won only through peaceful means -- including genuine reconciliation with a secure Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811131440/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/world/24prexy.html?hp">urged other world leaders to support</a> the peace talks to move the discussion forward:</p><blockquote>The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is as old as this institution.  And we can come back here next year, as we have for the last 60 years, and make long speeches about it.  We can read familiar lists of grievances.  We can table the same resolutions.  We can further empower the forces of rejectionism and hate.  And we can waste more time by carrying forward an argument that will not help a single Israeli or Palestinian child achieve a better life.  We can do that. <p></p>

<p>Or, we can say that this time will be different -- that this time we will not let terror, or turbulence, or posturing, or petty politics stand in the way.  This time, we will think not of ourselves, but of the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams, or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire.<br>
This time, we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religions that see Jerusalem&#x2019;s soil as sacred.  This time we should reach for what&#x2019;s best within ourselves.  If we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations -- an independent, sovereign state of Palestine, living in peace with Israel. </p></blockquote><p></p>
