Kunta Oza was burned over 90% of her body when a gas leak caused an explosion in Sunnyside, Queens.  Though neighbors had called about the gas smell, Con Ed and the FDNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160939/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/23/woman_burned_in.php">couldn&apos;t find the leak</a> and no one was evacuated.  The News reports, &quot;The gas main cracked because of corrosion and wear and tear, state regulators found, even though it was not on Con Ed&apos;s priority list for replacement.&quot;  Apparently cast iron pipes are supposed to be replaced (at least that&apos;s what federal safety experts say), but Con Ed&apos;s rate of replacing its 2,500 miles &quot;of cast-iron pipe&quot; is &quot;just 40 miles a year, said City Councilman Eric Gioia.</p>
