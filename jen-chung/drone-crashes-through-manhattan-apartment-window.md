<p>A GoPro Karma drone crashed into a Kips Bay apartment building&apos;s window over the weekend, startling the 66-year-old woman inside. Now the NYPD is looking for its owner.</p>

<p>Police say that the drone struck the window of a 27th floor apartment at 20 Waterside Plaza around 3:15 p.m. on Saturday. The resident was using her computer at the time, and the drone shattered her window and landed &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613192457/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/drone-crashes-kips-bay-woman-apartment-window-article-1.2982728">four feet away from her</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman was not injured. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613192457/http://nypost.com/2017/02/26/drone-smashes-through-womans-apartment-window/">A neighbor&apos;s girlfriend said</a>, &quot;Poor lady. She&#x2019;s lucky she wasn&#x2019;t killed.&quot; </p>

<p>And a 28th floor resident, Heidrum Pretzel, who lives directly above the affected apartment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613192457/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/26/runaway-drone-crashes-through-kips-bay-apartment-window/">spoke to WCBS 2</a>, &#x201C;I just saw boop, something, then I heard somebody say &#x2018;Oh my God.&apos;&quot; </p><blockquote>Pretzel adds that she immediately looked down and saw nothing, but her neighbor to the right feared the worst.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;She thought somebody jumped out of the window and I said &#x2018;nobody jumped out of the window,&apos;&#x201D; Pretzel said, insisting she knew it was a drone. She says she saw it flying just moments before.</p></blockquote>The drone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613192457/https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Karma-with-HERO5-Black/dp/B01N5V4HKQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1488203358&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=gopro+karma">retails for about $1100</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613192457/http://nypost.com/2017/02/26/drone-smashes-through-womans-apartment-window/">Post reports</a>, &quot;If the owner registered the device with the FAA &#x2014; which is legally required for recreational drones between .55 and 55 pounds &#x2014; it can be traced back to the owner, sources said&quot;&#x2014;the Karma is 2.2 pounds&#x2014;&quot;Police also may be able to use a serial number located on the base and battery of the drone to track down who it belongs to, sources said.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Last year, a NJ man was arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613192457/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/05/nj_idiot_crashes_drone_into_empire.php">crashing his drone into the Empire State Building</a>.
