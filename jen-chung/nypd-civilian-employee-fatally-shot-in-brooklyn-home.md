<p>A 66-year-old man who worked for the NYPD as a steam fitter was found fatally shot in his Bath Beach home last night. His daughter found him &quot;inside of his garage at Bay 8th Street in Brooklyn with a gunshot wound to the chest,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313023218/http://nypost.com/2017/02/09/nypd-civillian-employee-found-shot-to-death-in-his-home/">according to the Post</a>.</p>

<p>Officers responded to 103 Bay 8th Street just after 6:30 p.m. and found Robert D&#x2019;Onofrio. D&apos;Onofrio was taken to Maimonides Hospital where he was pronounced deceased.</p>

<p>One theory is that he was killed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313023218/http://pix11.com/2017/02/08/nypd-employee-fatally-shot-in-bath-beach-home-invasion/">during a home invasion robbery</a>. Police released photos of D&apos;Onfrio&apos;s 2015 blue Ford Mustang, which was missing but later found in Brownsville. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313023218/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/gunman-fatally-shoots-nypd-maintenance-worker-steals-car-article-1.2967949">The Daily News reports</a> that the killer &quot;sped off&quot; in the car.<br>

<p>D&apos;Onofrio worked in the NYPD&apos;s  Management Facilities Division. In 2012, he managed to make nearly $650,000, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313023218/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/civilian-nypd-employee-earns-whopping-647-733-article-1.1203008">thanks to winning six years of back pay</a> after an apparent dispute with a supervisor. He told the Daily News at the time, &quot;My boss didn&#x2019;t like me &#x2014; it&#x2019;s as simple as that. I never stepped on toes, or spoke out of turn, but they had it out for me. I went from mediocre overtime, to no overtime, to being a top earner. Everything is good now!&quot;</p>
