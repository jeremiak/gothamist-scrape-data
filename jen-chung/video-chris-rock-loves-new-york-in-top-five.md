<p>Chris Rock&apos;s latest directorial effort, <em>Top Five</em>, is coming in December, after making a huge splash at the Toronto Film Festival last month. And now a trailer is out, to show us why a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012615/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/official-paramount-buys-chris-rocks-731605">bidding war broke out over it</a>:</p>

<p>Rock, who also wrote the film, plays a comedian, Andre Allen, who became a big Hollywood star, thanks to a trilogy where he played Hammy the police bear. As he gets ready to marry a reality TV star, Andre is interviewed by a New York Times writer (Rosario Dawson) who makes him Realize Things. </p>

<p>And New York is a character as well, whether it&apos;s One World Trade Center, reflecting brightly; Columbia University&apos;s campus; a Greenwich Village street where we see if a black man can get a taxi; a subway station for fare jumping; or the housing projects that Andre returns to, to introduce the writer to his friends and family (including a pre-crash Tracy Morgan).</p>

<p>Rock, Native New Yorker and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012615/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/22/chris_rock_yankees.php">terrible fielder</a>, will be on <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012615/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/14/prince_to_perform_on_saturday_night.php">Saturday Night Live</a></em> on November 1 with musical guest Prince.</p>
