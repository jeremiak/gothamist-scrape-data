<p>It may almost be midnight, but some people are smelling eau de breakfast--<strong>there&apos;s a whiff of maple syrup in the air!</strong>  We just received three smellings:<br>
</p><ul><li>&quot;I think I&apos;ve been getting that nasty maple syrup smell up here at 137th &amp; b&apos;way for the last couple of hours.  Thought it was my neighbor spraying for bugs for a while, then I went outside to dump the garbage and still smelled it outside.  I can smell it out the window now, too (I&apos;m on the sixth floor, not far from the river).  Anyone else?  Is it New Jersey?&quot; - <em>C, Harlem, Manhattan</em><br>
</li><li>&quot;I&apos;m smelling that maple syrup smell tonight and it&apos;s strongest I&apos;ve ever noticed. It&apos;s been a while. What is that smell? It&apos;s getting pretty annoying!&quot; - <em>D, Edgewater, NJ</em><br>
</li><li>&quot;Yes, the maple syrup is back and way out here in College Point, this is the smell&#x2019;s second day. I live on Lax Ave right on the waterfront of College Point. It&#x2019;s near the water treatment plant. WHAT is this smell? I am smelling it right now and it doesn&#x2019;t make me want to eat pancakes.  Could it be drifting from the water, or from the Bronx?&quot; - <em>A, College Point, Queens</em></li></ul>Readers, if you smell the maple syrup smell, let us know (along with where the scent was), in comments or with an email to tips(at)gothamist(dot)com.  We&apos;re curious if it&apos;s all concentrated around a certain area (someone in the Bronx, tell us!).<p></p>
