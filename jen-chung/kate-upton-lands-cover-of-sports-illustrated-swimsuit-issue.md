</div></div>					<p>This year&apos;s Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue features 19-year-old Kate Upton on its cover.  And besides having a billboard of the cover in Times Square, there&apos;s even more of a NYC connection: Upton, who models for Victoria&apos;s Secret, is rumored to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204333/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/sanchez_in_huddle_with_secret_beauty_PwIIiDyYXi937I3drDgnQP">involved with Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez</a>.</p>

<p>David Letterman will reveal the cover during his show tonight, but here&apos;s a preview with Upton and nine other models reading the Top Ten list.  </p>

<p><object width="640" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.cbs.com/e/_wFp2yzX6bortItqapSr_MG0g__lVr_I/cbs/1/"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204333oe_/http://www.cbs.com/e/_wFp2yzX6bortItqapSr_MG0g__lVr_I/cbs/1/" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></object></p>

<p>Upton, a Michigan native, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429204333/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20570075,00.html">told People</a>, &quot;This means so much for me personally. This has always been my dream.&quot; Of the cover photograph, which was shot in Sydney, she said, &quot;In the beginning you&apos;re pretty relaxed, you&apos;re not thinking of new poses and it just feels really natural at that point. At Sports Illustrated everyone&apos;s so nice and it?s like a family, you don&apos;t really think too much into it. I just have a lot of fun and be myself. It just comes so naturally.&quot;  Well, check out this video:</p>
