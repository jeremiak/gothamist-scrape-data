<p>A Russian spy ship that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170217191920/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/02/15/russian-spy-ship-spotted-30-miles-south-connecticut.html">&quot;[c]apable of intercepting communications or signals&quot;</a> and &quot;measur[ing] U.S. Navy sonar capabilities&quot; is currently in the waters off Long Island&apos;s coast. But the ship is in international waters, and Defense Department spokeswoman Lt. Col. Valerie Henderson says, &quot;We are aware of the vessel&apos;s presence. It has not entered U.S. territorial waters. We respect freedom of navigation exercised by all nations beyond the territorial sea of a coastal State consistent with international law.&quot;</p>

<p>But Henderson did acknowledge that the SSV-175 Viktor Leonov is &quot;loitering,&quot; in a statement to Fox News.</p>
