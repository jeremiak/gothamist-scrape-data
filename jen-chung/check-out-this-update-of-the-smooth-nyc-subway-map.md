<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015843/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/08/map_nerds_debate_relative_merits_of.php#photo-3">grand tradition</a> of tweaking and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015843/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/25/fun_map_nyc_subway_map_as_a_circle.php">re-envisioning</a> the MTA&apos;s NYC subway map continues! This time, Paris-based designer Jug Cerovic has refined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015843/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/12/subway_map.php">his earlier map</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015843/http://www.inat.fr/metro/new-york">new touches</a>, like making Brooklyn more geographically accurate.</p>

<p>Cerovic tells us that his 2014 map was met with &quot;great enthusiasm.&quot; So much enthusiasm that he said he &quot;received lots of feedback from people wanting to help me make the map better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The two main criticisms were about topology and line colors,&quot; Cerovic explained. &quot;People actually didn&apos;t bother the absence of accurate geography, they were very pleased with the compact schematic map, but the problem was I had squeezed Brooklyn into the squared layout of the map and hugely distorted its shape with Coney Island ending all the way east at the same &apos;latitude&apos; as Downtown [Manhattan]. I realized this was unacceptable and I therefore enlarged the layout to be able to fit Brooklyn in a topologically accurate way, on a diagonal axis. It works much better. I also added a schematized coast line all the way to Far Rockaway. Now the map is schematic but also feels like true geography, easy for orientation, easy for use, easy to memorize.&quot;</p>

<p>The second issue that he tackled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015843/http://www.inat.fr/metro/new-york">was the subway line colors</a>. &quot;I had made B and D lines magenta to differentiate them from orange F and M lines which share the same route in Manhattan. This was a clearly unacceptable move and so I reverted to portraying all lines with their usual colors,&quot; Cerovic said. &quot;Works well now.&quot;</p>

<p>Cerovic also added Staten Island, ferries and Newark, plus &quot;fine-tuned all of the areas of the map, especially Manhattan, to make the map beautiful and efficient.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to the NYC map, Cerovic has also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015843/http://www.inat.fr/works/one-metro-world">designed mass transit system maps</a> for over three dozen other international cities and is offering a bound version of the maps&#x2014;in a 160 page (high quality kunstdruck matte paper) hardcover book&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015843/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jugcerovic/one-metro-world-follow-up">via Kickstarter</a>.</p>
