Only Lashaun survived.</i></div> The tragic drowning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064317/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/mother_drives_minivan_into_hudson_k.php">murder-suicide of a woman and her three children</a> in the Hudson River grows as it turns out her 10-year-old son managed to open a window and climb out of the sinking minivan. But Lashanda Armstrong, 25, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064317/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/14/2011-04-14_youre_going_to_die_with_me.html">allegedly told little Lashaun and his young siblings</a>, ages 11 months to 5 years old, &quot;If I&apos;m going to die, you&apos;re going to die with me.&quot;  Lashaun Armstrong also told the authorities that she grabbed his pants leg, told him, &quot;I made a mistake,&quot; and let him go. <p></p>

<p>Lashaun swam to the shore and was trying to stop drivers on a Newburgh road and, finally, Meave Ryan stopped for him.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064317/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/nyregion/14newburgh.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">She told the NY Times</a>, &quot;He was screaming for help. He said, &#x2018;My mommy just drove the car in the water.&#x2019;&quot; Ryan, who picked up Lance, drove over to the boat ramp to see if she could see the car, and then took Lashaun to the fire department.  </p><blockquote>Ms. Ryan said that La&#x2019;Shaun had told her why his mother was so upset. &#x201C;There was an argument about cheating, that his stepfather was cheating on his mother,&#x201D; Ms. Ryan said. On the short ride from their apartment in Newburgh to the boat ramp, La&#x2019;Shaun told Ms. Ryan, his mother had called an older relative and said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m going to do something crazy, you have to forgive me.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Ms. Ryan said La&#x2019;Shaun had told her that the call had ended with the older relative saying she was going to dial 911.</p></blockquote>When the authorities found the minivan, Armstrong, 5-year-old Landen Pierre, 2-year-old Lance Pierre, and 11-month-old Lainaina Pierre were all dead.  <p></p>

<p>Armstrong had a tumultuous relationship with the father of the deceased children, Jean Pierre, 26, and apparently the couple just had a vicious fight, which prompted calls to the police, just before Armstrong killed herself and children. The couple didn&apos;t live together, leaving Armstrong to raise her four children mostly on her own. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064317/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110414/NEWS/104140337/-1/NEWS">Times Herald-Record says</a>, &quot;Desiree Watson, owner and director of Young &amp; Unique Christian Childcare in Newburgh, said all four of Armstrong&apos;s children had attended her program. Armstrong had recently told staff that Pierre was no longer allowed to pick up the children, which he rarely did anyway.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Times spoke to a friend of Armstrong&apos;s, &quot;&apos;From the outside, it looked perfect,&apos; said Sharon Ramirez, 22, a neighbor and friend of Ms. Armstrong. &apos;But there were a lot of things going on. They had a rocky relationship.&apos; Ms. Ramirez was certain of that because, she said, she had carried on a three-month relationship with Mr. Pierre last year, when Ms. Armstrong was pregnant with Lainaina.&quot;</p>
