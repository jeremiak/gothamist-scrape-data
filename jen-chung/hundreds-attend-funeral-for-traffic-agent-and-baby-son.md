Donnette Sanz and Sean Michael Justin Sanz were buried together in the same casket; she had died on August while her son was born but only lived a week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053207/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/23/bronx_widow_now_grieves_baby_sons_d.php">until last Friday</a>.  Wdower Rafael Sanz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053207/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/08/25/2008-08-25_funeral_for_pregnant_traffic_agent_donne.html">&quot;broke down&quot;</a> when he was given the flag from the coffin.</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Ray Kelly attended the funeral service.  Bloomberg gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053207/http://nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fnyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2008b%2Fpr329-08.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">moving speech</a>, noting, &quot;<strong>First and foremost, Donnette gave the gift of life, to her husband, Rafael, to whom she donated a kidney and to her son, Sean Michael, who was born into this world against all odds</strong>.&quot; He also referenced how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053207/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/16/bittersweet_aftermath_of_crash_that.php">strangers came together</a> to move a bus that had pinned 7-months pregnant mother-to-be, &quot;Sean Michael tapped into the heroism of dozens of normal, ordinary New Yorkers who, within seconds of a tragic accident, came together to perform an extraordinary rescue.&quot;</p>

<p>Sanz, a Jamaican immigrnat, was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053207/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/nyregion/26funeral.html?ref=nyregion">remembered as a model traffic agent</a>, who never lost her cool. Kelly said, &quot;She would answer their questions, correct their mistakes and help them succeed in a very challenging job,&quot; pointing out traffic agents &quot;interact with individuals who are often rushed, angry and reluctant to cooperate.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The mother and son were buried in Mount Kisco.  The unlicensed driver of the van that struck Sanz was charged with criminally negligent homicide; he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053207/http://wcbstv.com/local/miracle.baby.funeral.2.802621.html">not entered a plea yet</a>.</p>
