title: No Asbestos At Madison Square Garden, But It's Still Closed
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:230px; "> <img alt="2010_10_magicmsg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103162125im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_10_magicmsg.jpg" width="230" height="251"> <br> <i>A sign notes that MSG was closed last night (AP)</i></div> Yesterday, the Knicks canceled their home game against the Orlando Magic and Madison Square Garden was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103162125/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/02/knick_cancel_tonights_game_because.php">closed due to an asbestos scare</a>&#x2014;while cleaning &quot;asbestos-related materials&quot; in the attic, some debris fell into the arena.  Well, the NYC&apos;s Department of Environmental Protection declared it safe, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103162125/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/sports/basketball/03knicks.html">DEP spokesman saying</a>, &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t appear that any asbestos was disturbed.&quot; That must make the tourists who wanted to see <strike>Amare Stoudemire</strike> Dwight Howard so MAD!!<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103162125/http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nba/news/story?id=5758172">ESPN has amusing quotes and sob stories</a> from foreigners who apparently planned their trips around the Knicks-Magic game: &quot;Reinaart Vandenbrock came in from Belgium on Friday for a five-day stay in Manhattan. He thought one of the highlights of his trip would be attending Tuesday night&apos;s Knicks-Magic game at Madison Square Garden, where he could see Dwight Howard, one of his favorite players in the NBA, live and in the flesh.&quot;  His reaction to the postponement? &quot;We&apos;d been planning this trip for three months. I can&apos;t believe this happened today.&quot; </p>

<p>A visitor from London said, &quot;I think they did the right thing but I&apos;m also surprised that in 2010 a stadium like this has an asbestos problem.&quot; And another said, &quot;I&apos;m upset and surprised that something like this would happen here. It&apos;s not like this is a third-world country.&quot; But it is MSG!  On the other hand, Knicks fans were happier: &quot;I was looking forward to seeing Dwight Howard vs. Amare [Stoudemire]. But I&apos;m not that mad because now the Knicks will have a few more days to prepare. <strong>And we know they need it.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The Knicks<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103162125/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/garden_problems_postpone_knicks_z4IJ55cyDFdgBpR05pTnAM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME="> did contact the Prudential Center</a> (Brick City!) about hosting games there.  More details about MSG&apos;s reopening are coming today&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103162125/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/adl_slams_roger_waters_for_star_of.php">Roger Waters</a> is playing there this weekend.</p>
