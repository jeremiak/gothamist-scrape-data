<p>Back in 2006, the city requested proposals for ideas for Governors Island and, in the process, Mayor Bloomberg presented a design by acclaimed architect Santiago Caltrava for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111657/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/16/gondola_dreams.php">tramway linking Governors Island</a> to Battery Park and Brooklyn.  The plan for the fanciful- (and cool-) looking system <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111657/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2007/12/20/calatravas_governors_island_gondola_refuses_to_die.php">never got off the ground</a>, but it still has fans in high places.  </p>

<p>Just yesterday Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111657/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/going_going_gondola_CYcbIo7R04LCW6ZCysnBDL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">said on John Gambling&apos;s WOR radio show</a>, &quot;I have always thought that would be a phenomenal thing for the city, the same way The Eye [a giant Ferris wheel] is in London.&quot; He also says it would be profitable for the city, but the Post questions that, given that &quot;the city&apos;s only tram, to Roosevelt Island, loses money.&quot;  Well, tourists would probably go on a Governors Island gondola.  </p>

<p>For now, folks will have to visit Governors Island, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111657/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/13/governors_island_proposal.php">may be transformed</a> if the city can get another $200 million or so, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111657/http://www.govisland.com/Visit_the_Island/directions.asp">ferries from Manhattan and Brooklyn</a>.</p>
