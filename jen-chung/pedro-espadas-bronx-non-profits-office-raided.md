Eyewitness News is told law enforcement officials descended on the Soundview Health Center on White Plains Road at 7 a.m. Investigators from multiple agencies  including the FBI, IRS, and Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&apos;s office -- immediately began bringing out boxes of evidence.&quot; Investigators are apparently looking for signs of wire and mail fraud. Yesterday,  Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605141728/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/espada_allegedly_looted_millions_fr.php">filed a suit</a> against Espada, accusing him of siphoning $14 million from Soundview for himself and his family.  We expect an outraged comment from Espada shortly.</p>
