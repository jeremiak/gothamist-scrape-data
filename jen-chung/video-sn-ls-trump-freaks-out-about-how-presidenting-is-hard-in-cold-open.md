</div></div>					<p>After last week&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042545/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/kate_mckinnon_hillary_snl_hallelujah.php">mournful post-election cold open</a>, Alec Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042545/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/alec_baldwin_returns_snl_trump.php">returned</a> to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> to bring the Trump. And the SNL take on Trump is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042545/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/tune_into_americas_last_season.php">he&apos;s totally unprepared</a> to lead the country:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042545if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/JUWSLlz0Fdo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Baldwin continued to portray Trump as a basic real estate mogul who utters the mantra &quot;Big beautiful boobs and buildings&quot; when he spirals into the realization that he&apos;s actually made a lot of big promises. When a general looks forward to his plans to defeat ISIS, Baldwin-as-Trump Googles &quot;ISIS&quot; only to reel when seeing there are 59 million results. Then he tries to ask Siri how to beat ISIS, but it turns out he only has a Blackberry. </p>

<p>Kate McKinnon played <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042545/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/09/lin-manuel_miranda_hosts_saturday_n.php#photo-9">campaign manager Kellyanne Conway</a> as shell-shocked and disgusted with her role putting Trump in the White House (when introducing Mike Pence, she starts to gag). Just remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042545/http://theslot.jezebel.com/kellyanne-conway-says-sen-harry-reid-should-be-very-ca-1788949224">the actual Conway</a> doesn&apos;t seem to share those qualms.</p>

<p>Pence (Beck Bennett) tries to discuss business with Trump&#x2014;he mentions getting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042545/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/19/mike_pence_gets_booed_at_hamilton_w.php#photo-1">&quot;free lecture&quot; at <em>Hamilton</em></a>, too&#x2014;but the President-elect decides not to follow through with deporting 11 illegal immigrants, repealing the Affordable Care Act or prosecuting Hillary Clinton (&quot;Scrap it. She didn&#x2019;t do anything.&quot;). </p>

<p>There was also a cameo from Jason Sudeikis&apos;s Mitt Romney. And don&apos;t worry, the actual President-elect really hated it:</p>
