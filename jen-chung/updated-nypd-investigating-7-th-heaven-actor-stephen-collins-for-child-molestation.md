<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012913/http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/07/stephen-collins-child-molestation-7th-heaven-audio-tape-nypd-investigation/">TMZ just published audio</a> of actor Stephen Collins, best known for playing a pastor and father of a large family on <em>7th Heaven</em>, admitting to molesting an underage New York girl. He says, &quot;There was one moment of touching where her hand, I put her hand on my penis.&quot;</p>

<p>The confession came during a therapy session with his wife, Faye Grant. According to TMZ:</p><blockquote>Collins -- who is in the middle of a nasty, prolonged divorce with actress Faye Grant -- revealed to her in 2012 he had molested and/or exposed himself to several underage girls years before. Collins and Grant went to a therapist where she peppered him with questions about the incidents ... and he not only answered, he was specific. <p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s what Collins didn&apos;t know at the time. Grant taped the therapy session. We&apos;re told her lawyer advised her it was legal to secretly record the conversation because in California you&apos;re allowed to secretly record conversations to gather evidence the other person committed a violent felony ... and molesting a child under the age of 14 qualifies.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The NYPD is investigating, and Special Victims Unit detectives apparently went to LA to interview Collins. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012913/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/7th-heaven-dad-stephen-collins-admits-molesting-girl-article-1.1965747">A source tells the Daily News</a>, &quot;We have an active investigation involving Stephen Collins.&quot; And the News adds, &quot;This is not the first time the NYPD has investigated Collins, officials said. The actor had been the subject of a sex abuse investigation several years ago, but the statute of limitations on the case ran out, so no charges were ever filed, the source said.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: TMZ says that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012913/http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/07/stephen-collins-molested-child-molestation-victim-wife/">one of the victims was a relative of Collins&apos; first wife</a> :</p><blockquote>According to sources present during the police interview ... the woman claims when she was 10 she would sometimes stay with Stephen and his wife at their NYC apartment.<p></p>

<p>She told cops ... she would sleep in the guest room and Stephen would come in after showering, wearing only a towel. She claims he would then expose himself and several times put her hand on his penis. She says he would also touch and rub on her.</p>

<p>The woman claims she would often thwart Collins&apos; overtures by pretending to be asleep.</p>

<p>We&apos;re told the woman says in the &apos;90s she was watching TV with her husband and saw Collins on the screen, and then told her husband for the first time Collins had molested her.  </p>

<p>We&apos;re also told in 2000 the woman contacted Collins&apos; current wife, Faye Grant, by sending her an anonymous letter warning her that her husband was a child molester.  </p></blockquote>Grant apparently never responded, until late 2011 after Collins allegedly told her about the incidents, &quot;Grant sent the woman an email -- obtained by TMZ -- in which she says, &apos;Stephen lied when confronted 12 years ago.  He said he had a hole in his holey jeans, as was the style then, and you &apos;must have&apos; seen his genitalia one time.&apos; Grant goes on, &apos;Stephen is not remorseful, shows no guilt, and his shame is demonstrated as extreme self pity. He wails and cries, &apos;I&apos;m in so much paaaaaain!!!&apos;&quot;<p></p>

I had no involvement whatsoever with the release of the tape to the media.&quot;</p>
