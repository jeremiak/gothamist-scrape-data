 <br>
This past Sunday, at 2:30 p.m., a man approached a 12-year-old girl at Lincoln Street and 116 Avenue and started talking to her. He convinced her to go into his SUV and then drove her to a nearby location, where police say &quot;he exposed himself to the victim and committed a criminal sex act.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim got out of the car and ran to a friend&apos;s house. The friend called 911 and the victim was treated at Queens General Hospital. </p>

<p>The police released a sketch of the suspect, described as a being in his 20s, around 6&apos; and 200 pounds, with black hair, brown eyes and a scruffy beard. He was last seen wearing blue jeans, a white undershirt, a red jacket, red sneakers, a red and white baseball cap and a silver chain hanging on his waist. The police also released surveillance video of his car, a silver 4-door SUV when it was approaching 116 Avenue from Lincoln Street.</p>
