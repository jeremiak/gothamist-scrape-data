The preliminary vote suggested 2-4% increases for 1-year leases and 4-6% increases for 2-year leases.  Tenants begged, &quot;I&apos;m a senior citizen. I&apos;m living on a fixed income. Please don&apos;t raise my rent,&#x201D; and &quot;To keep affordable housing for middle class, they need to keep the rents as low as possible,&#x201D; while landlords and building owners argued that their fixed costs have been going up and they need an increase to just break even.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520154351/http://www.housingnyc.com/">RGB will hold meetings</a> leading up to its June final vote.</p>
