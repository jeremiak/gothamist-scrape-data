He was at JFK Airport, for the opening of a restaurant and the Daily News put him on its cover, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110908211909/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/06/2010-03-06_untitled__gov06m.html">noting</a>, &quot;For an already under siege Paterson, the planned photo op couldn&apos;t have gone worse: He stood beneath a mural depicting a belching dog at the event at the Palm Bar and Grille.&quot;</p>

<p>Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110908211909/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/lonely_dave_is_03JL5uucuW2avS5gj2gc5K">told reporters</a>, for the umpteenth time, &quot;I&apos;m not resigning. I am going to get the opportunity to address the issues that are before me and hope to vindicate myself,&quot; while standing in front of what the Post called a &quot;bizarre backdrop of cartoon characters.&quot; Earlier in the day, Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110908211909/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/nyregion/06paterson.html?ref=nyregion">also said</a> after lunch in Manhattan, &quot;I don&#x2019;t have any plans to resign. At a certain point, I will cooperate with the investigations and will be clearing my name.&#x201D; </p>

<p>With scandals over his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110908211909/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/02/paterson_personally_directed.php">possible interference </a>in a staffer&apos;s domestic abuse incident as well as his ethics rules-breaking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110908211909/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/04/paterson_aide_forged_govs_signature.php">solicitation of free Yankees tickets</a>,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110908211909/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/05/paterson_3.php"> less than half of New Yorkers</a> want Paterson to remain in power. (Even his chief of staff convened a meeting with remaining administration staffers to boost their morale!) But Paterson said, &quot;To step down from office over unproved allegations would create a new level of vulnerability for government officials that would be chaotic.&quot;  But now Assembly Speaker SHeldon Silver has joined the fray of wanting answers, &quot;The governor has to respond to the allegations so that the business of governing can move on unimpeded.&quot;</p>
