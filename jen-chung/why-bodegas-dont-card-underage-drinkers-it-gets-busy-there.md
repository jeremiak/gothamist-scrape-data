The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820071453/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/19/2011-08-19_state_nails_dozens_of_city_shops_that_sold_booze_to_kids_indicating_its_no_minor.html">Daily News has details on the three-day sting</a>, &quot;Of the bodegas visited by the SLA, the Bronx had the highest citation rate. Thirty-eight of the 48 stores - about 79% - sold alcohol to underage spies in the borough. Manhattan wasn&apos;t far behind with 75% of the bodegas selling to customers under the age of 21.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The SLA, which observed the underage customers making the illegal purchases, says the operation was part of its attempt to crackdown &quot;in neighborhoods where fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages are popular with kids&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820071453/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/03/kids_get_drunk_off_of_nutcracker.php">like the Nutcracker</a>.  One bodega owner busted by the SLA offered this explanation to the News, &quot;Sometimes we forget to card because it&apos;s busy. But we usually card. But sometimes it just happens.&quot;  </p>

<p>The SLA provided a list of the erring establishments (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820071453/http://www.abc.state.ny.us/system/files/mediaadvisiory081911.pdf">PDF</a>), which reminds us of last year&apos;s Post story where an underage intern <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820071453/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/06/breaking_bars_bodegas_sell_beer_to.php">successfully bought booze at bodegas and bars</a>&#x2014;it was a great guide for underage drinkers to learn where to buy their beverages.</p>
