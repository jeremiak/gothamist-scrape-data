<p>Hey, people&#x2014;we are still working on our <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/photos_this_is_a_banksy_piece.php#photo-1">CSI: Banksy dog-peeing-on-hydrant</a></em> deep-dive&#x2014;but in the meantime, it seems that the most accurate (if anything that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://www.banksyfilm.com/">Banksy does is real</a>) source of information is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://www.banksyny.com/">his website</a> and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://instagram.com/banksyny">Instagram account</a>. Sorry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-banksy-twitter-20131002,0,816363.story">LA Times</a> and the 10,000+ people following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/https://twitter.com/banksyny">fake account</a>!</p>

<p>Someone in the know has emphasized that Banksy&apos;s social media is limited to Instagram&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://instagram.com/banksyny">@banksyny</a>, for the NYC residency. Which makes sense, since his website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://banksy.co.uk/">banksy.co.uk</a>, has always focused on images, usually to take credit for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://laist.com/2013/09/24/banksy_rumored_to_be_back_in_los_an.php">work on the streets</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/video_banksy_does_the_simpsons.php#photo-1">on TV</a>. The fake Banksy Twitter just has a few Tweets, with sayings like, &quot;New York - you&apos;re just my type&quot; and no pictures. </p>

<p><b>Updated</b>: There&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://instagram.com/banksy_co_uk">@banksy_co_uk Instagram account</a> that appeared authentic, but our tipster says the only &quot;official&quot; Instragram is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://instagram.com/banksyny">@banksyny</a>. Oddly, the @banksy_co_uk account took credit for the dog-peeing-on-hydrant stencil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://instagram.com/p/fAW25RqldL/">7 hours before</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151813/http://instagram.com/p/fAawhRK-xY/">official one did</a>.</p>
