<p>A former head of the NY State Pension Fund&apos;s Common Retirement Fund has been charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly accepting numerous bribes&#x2014;ranging from weekend trips with crack cocaine to prostitutes and tickets to see Paul McCartney&#x2014;in exchange for steering billions of pension fund money to two brokers. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called it a &quot;classic, quid-pro-quo bribery scheme.&quot;</p>

<p>This comes ten years after former NY State Comptroller Alan Hevesi resigned, after it was revealed that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/22/hevesi_has_resi.php">used state employees to chauffeur his sick wife</a> around. Then it turned out Hevesi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/ex-state_comptroller_hevesi_sentenc.php">accepted $1 million in bribes</a> to direct pension fund money to specific funds. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_12_nkang.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_12_nkang.jpg" width="300" height="276"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Navnoor Kang</i></div> Navnoor Kang, a Columbia University graduate and former trader at Guggenheim Partners started work at the NY State Pension Fund in 2014. <p></p>

<p>The fund is the third largest in the country, with $184 billion for more than one million retirees and other beneficiaries. The Common Retirement fund is, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-corruption-pensionfund-idUSKBN14A1M3">Reuters reports</a>, &quot;is the investment arm of the New York State and Local Employees&apos; Retirement System and the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office, Kang signed a Code of Conduct&#x2014;implemented after the Hevesi scandal&#x2014;specifically stating he would hold himself to the &quot;highest ethical, professional and conflict of interest standards.&quot; </p>

<p>Instead, he allegedly accepted various bribes&#x2014;&quot;entertainment, travel, lavish meals, prostitutes, nightclub bottle service, narcotics, tickets to sports games and other events, luxury gifts, and cash payments for strippers&quot;&#x2014;from Deborah Kelley, former Sterne Agee Group Inc managing director, and Greg Schonhorn, a broker-dealer at FTN Financial Securities Corp.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_12_bribe1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_12_bribe1.jpg" width="640" height="619" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Kang started to invest at Kelley&apos;s and Schonhorn&apos;s firms. For example, FTN Financial Securities Corp. did no business with the pension fund in the fiscal year ending March 2013; by the end of the next fiscal year, FTN got its foot in the door with $1.5 million and then it went to $858 million in the fiscal year ending March 2015. The most recent fiscal year showed the NY State pension fund doing $2.378 <strong>billion</strong> with FTN.</p>

<p>At one point, the investment firms were making millions in commissions, with Kelley and Schonhorn making 35-40% of that. That&apos;s probably why it was easy for Schonhorn to buy Kang a $17,000 luxury watch:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2016_12_luxurywatch.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_12_luxurywatch.jpg" width="640" height="476" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Kang recommending using Schonhorn and Kelley on deals that didn&apos;t even need brokers. It&apos;s believed the total value of the bribes was $1 million.</p>

<p>Schonhorn has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud; securities fraud; conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud; honest services wire fraud; bank fraud; and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He and Kelley, who is expected to surrender today, used WhatsApp to coordinate the bribes with Kang:</p>

<p>Kang, currently Chief Strategy Officer at media company Fair Observer, was arrested in Portland, Oregon.  U.S. Attorney Bharara said, &quot;The hard-earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment. The intersection of public corruption and securities fraud appears to be a busy one, but it&apos;s one that we are committed to policing.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510/http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/dec16/122116a.htm?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=kang+statement&amp;utm_content=20161221&amp;utm_campaign=pension+fund">NY State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli said</a>, &quot;The New York State Common Retirement Fund has absolutely no tolerance for self-dealing, and we are outraged by Mr. Kang&#x2019;s shocking betrayal of his responsibilities. In February 2016, he was dismissed. As the criminal indictment says, he secretly circumvented our rigorous ethical standards and policies.&quot;</p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo hadn&apos;t seen the indictment when asked about it this morning, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135510/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/270389/2b-pay-to-play-alleged-in-comptrollers-office-for-drugs-prostitutes/">according to the Times Union,</a> &quot;[H]e did malign the fact that the New York comptroller is the pension fund&#x2019;s sole trustee while other states have boards that control their funds. &apos;The temptation for corruption and bribery and bid-rigging is very, very high given the system we have,&apos; Cuomo said, noting that he brought a pay-to-play pension fund case against former Comptroller Alan Hevesi when Cuomo was attorney general. &apos;It is a chronic problem,&apos; he added. &apos;It has been in New York state. It has been in controller&#x2019;s offices across the board, but not as bad as in New York because in New York we have the sole trustee.&apos;&quot;</p>
