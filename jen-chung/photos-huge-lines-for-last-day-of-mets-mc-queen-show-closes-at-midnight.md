</div></div>					<p>As expected, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/06/saturdays_wild_lines_at_metropolita.php#photo-1">like yesterday</a>, today&apos;s lines for the final day of the Metropolitan Museum&apos;s exhibition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/">Alexander McQueen&apos;s work, <em>Savage Beauty</em></a>, are long.  They snake into Central Park, and some people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://www.whosay.com/mrjoezee/photos/53795">are excited when they manage to see</a> the museum&apos;s front entrance, though there are still dozens ahead of them.</p>

<p>While the Metropolitan of Museum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://www.metmuseum.org/member/">stopped allowing members special access to the exhibit</a> on Friday, New Yorker television critic Nancy Franklin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://twitter.com/#!/nancyfranklin/status/100172377865990144">Tweeted this morning</a>, &quot;The McQueen situation: there IS a members&apos; line. They go in at 8. 200ish ppl on that line. Hoi polloi line goes in at 9:30. 400-500 ppl now,&quot; but then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://twitter.com/#!/nancyfranklin/status/100195679523188736">added that</a>, &quot;No members line now--members just stride in at will. The restofus line, was told 1/2 hour ago, is several blocks long.&quot;  More recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://twitter.com/#!/nancyfranklin/status/100201439212736512">she declared</a>, &quot;Heading up Met steps now. So will end tweets re lines, crowds, entry times. / Thnx to@MetMuseum for good job of informing ppl this morning.&quot; </p>

<p>And there is a petition floating around pleading for <em>Savage Beauty</em> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://www.change.org/petitions/please-make-alexander-mcqueens-savage-beauty-a-traveling-exhibition">become a traveling exhibit</a> so more people can see McQueen&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209135900/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/04/skip_the_line_visit_the_mets_mcquee.php">unparalleled tailoring, construction and imagination</a>. </p>

<p><b> Update</b>: Reader zeedub commented with this good advice, if you want to go today, &quot;I got there at 11:30 last night. There was no admission line and they were letting people join the line up until midnight. They said the McQueen line would be 3 hrs but it was really about 1.5 hours. Left show around 2 am. I recommend going late because once you are in show it&apos;s so crowded and hard to see. So when I got to the end I went back to the beginning and by then no new crowds were coming in so you actually had some space to see the objects. You miss so much otherwise.&quot;</p>
