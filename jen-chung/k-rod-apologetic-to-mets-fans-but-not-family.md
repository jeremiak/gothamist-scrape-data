I want to apologize to [owners] Fred Wilpon, Jeff Wilpon and Mr. [Saul] Katz for the incident that happened Wednesday night. I want to apologize also to the Mets fans, to my teammates. I want to apologize, of course, to the front office for the embarrassing moment that I caused. I&apos;m looking forward to being a better person.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>Notably, there were no apologies to girlfriend Daian Pena (the mother of his twin baby boy and girl) or her father, Carlos Pena, who may  have sparked K-Rod&apos;s ire by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050652/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/13/k-rod_got_angry_after_being_told_ma.php">reportely telling him</a> not to be a baby and to &quot;Man up. Play better&quot; after the pitcher was cursing Daian out in the Family Lounge at Citi Field.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050652/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/2010/08/15/2010-08-15_closer_offers_sorry_excuse_for_apology.html">Daily News&apos; Filip Bondy is apoplectic</a> about the &quot;apology,&quot; calling it a &quot;sorry excuse,&quot; and writing, &quot;The conservative Wilpons, who once couldn&apos;t stand the idea of Anna Benson&apos;s low-cut Santa Claus suit, are suddenly the proud owners of a .500 roster peppered with dishonor.&quot;</p>

<p> Rodriguez, who had movers remove his belongings from the Long Island home he shares with his girlfriend (there&apos;s an order of protection for her because she&apos;s worried about his volatile temper), also said yesterday, &quot;Right now the plan is I&apos;m going to be going to [an] anger management program. And I cannot speak no farther about the legal stuff that we&apos;re going through right now. I want to apologize. Sorry.&quot;  Mets manager Jerry Manuel said, &quot;I&apos;m not a psychologist or anybody like that, but from what I know of him, and the experience I&apos;ve had with him, I take it to be a very sincere apology.&quot; Buts fans weren&apos;t as forgiving: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050652/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/15/2010-08-15_embattled_mets_pitcher_francisco_rodriguez_sends_movers_to_pack_up_things_from_l.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">He was booed and heckled</a> (one Mets fan yelled, &quot;Beat &apos;em up, K-Rod!&quot;).  </p>
