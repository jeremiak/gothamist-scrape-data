<p>Tomorrow is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207082630/http://www.macys.com/campaign/parade/parade.jsp">82nd Annual Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>.  The parade begins at 9 a.m., up at West 77th Street and Central Park West and then makes it way down CPW to Broadway, continuing down Broadway until Herald Square.  Macy&apos;s says the best place to view the parade is along CPW between 61st and 72nd Streets and simply says to arrive early for good viewing.</p>

<p>Besides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207082630/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/25/map_of_the_day_macys_thanksgiving_b.php">balloons</a> like SuperCute Hello Kitty and Kermit the Frog, there are many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207082630/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/19/macys_thanksgiving_day_parade_float.php">floats</a> (Care Bears&apos; Winter Wonderland, Meaning of Thanksgiving), marching bands and performers, like Idina Menzel, Miley Cyrus, Darius Rucker, Kristen Chenoweth, pianist Lang Lang, and the Muppets!  More details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207082630/http://www.macys.com/campaign/parade/parade.jsp">here</a>--and yes, Santa will be there.  </p>
