In a separate incident, a 13-year-old girl was threatened into letting a man into her Bronx apartment, where he sexually assaulted her.<p></p>

<p>The Manhattan attack occurred on Thursday, July 7th at around 11:15 p.m. The eight-year-old girl was sleeping in her home near East 108th Street and First Avenue when she woke up to find a man in her room. The man tried to sexually assault her and then fled through her bedroom window and out a rear fire escape.  </p>

<p>A sketch of the suspect, described as a man in his 20s with black shoulder length hair and acne-like skin, was released. </p>

<p>Yesterday, a 13-year-old girl was followed into her building near Jennings Street and Intervale Avenue in the Bronx by an attempted rapist. The man followed her into the elevator and, according to police, &quot;coerced her into letting him inside her apartment. Once inside, the suspect displayed a knife and demanded money. When the victim told him that she didn&apos;t have any he placed some property inside her bookbag. He then forced the victim to perform oral sex on him and tried to rape her.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect, who fled with the bookbag, was described as being 18 years old, 5&apos;8&quot; and 145-150 pounds, last seen wearing black pants, black slippers and white socks, with a red T-shirt or towel on his shoulder. He was also carrying a light colored bookbag. Surveillance footage of him was distributed:</p>
