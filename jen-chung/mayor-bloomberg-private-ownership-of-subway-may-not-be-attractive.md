And with Governor Paterson suggesting that maybe some public properties should be sold <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052426/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/30/paterson_offers_details_on_possible.php">because of NY State&apos;s budget crisis</a>, perhaps that idea is not too far off.  However, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052426/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/mayor-cautions-against-selling-subway-system/82957/">weighed in against the idea of selling the MTA</a>, saying, &quot;It will not save you, necessarily, a lot of money...You could get somebody to do it, but they wouldn&apos;t save you very much money <strong>because the potential for making a lot of money isn&apos;t there</strong>.&quot;  In other words, he&apos;s not interested!</p>
