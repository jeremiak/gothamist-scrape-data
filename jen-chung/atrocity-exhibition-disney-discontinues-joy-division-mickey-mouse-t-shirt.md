<p>After exciting British post-punk fans who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103113/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/23/area_man_buys_disneys_new_joy_divis.php">also love Mickey Mouse and may also be self-hating Jews</a>, Disney has ruined everything by yanking their Mickey t-shirt based on Joy Division&apos;s Unknown Pleasures album art.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103113/http://www.pitchfork.com/news/45229-rip-joy-divison-mickey-mouse-shirt/">A spokesperson said</a>, &quot;As soon as we became aware there could be an issue, we pulled it from our shelves and our online store to review the situation further.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;issue&quot; could be that signer Ian Curtis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103113/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Curtis">killed himself</a> or the fact that Joy Division&apos;s name is a Nazi allusion.  Joy Division bassist Peter Hook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103113/http://read.mtvhive.com/2012/01/24/peter-hook-unknown-pleasures-disney-shirt/">told MTV News</a> he didn&apos;t think other Joy Division-New Order members were involved in the t-shirt&apos;s production, &quot;I have seen a lot of Mickey Mouse t-shirts in my time. But I have to say this is probably the best... I hope that [Disney] will be as understanding when we start doing Donald Duck shirts.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103113/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/23/area_man_buys_disneys_new_joy_divis.php">Area Man who bought the shirt</a> on Monday, he thinks his order was cancelled. Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103113/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/thread-count/disney-pulls-mickey-mouse-joy-division-shirts-20120125">Rolling Stone points out</a> the shirt is available for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103113/http://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Waves-Joy-Division-Unknown-Pleasures-Mickey-Shirt-RARE-Medium-/260941727659?pt=US_Mens_Tshirts&amp;hash=item3cc156c7ab">$202 on eBay</a>. </p>
