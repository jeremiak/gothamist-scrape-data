<p>On the day we learn the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071544/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/22/mta_plans_more_fare_hikes_for_2009.php">wants to raise fares</a> again, there&apos;s finally data to confirm what we all knew: NYC Transit offered up statistics that show on-time subway performance has gotten worse.  </p>

<p>The least on-time line is the 4--for the year ending with May 2008, the 4 was on-time only 79.7% of the time, compared with a systemwide average of 92.0%.  And in May, the 4 was on-time only 70% of the time, compared to 80% in May 2007.  One rider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071544/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/07/21/2008-07-21_no_4_trains_ontime_performance_lowest_of.html">told the News</a>, &quot;Sometimes I have to wait and wait and then I&apos;m late for work.&quot;  Another rider detailed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071544/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/nyregion/22delays.html?ref=nyregion">one memorable delay to the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;One day we stopped at Bowling Green, they told us there was a power outage, we waited 30 minutes and then they said we&#x2019;re not going anywhere...I had to walk to the A-C at Fulton. That&#x2019;s an extreme example, but there are delays all the time.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Apparently NYC Transit can&apos;t quite figure out why delays have increased; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071544/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/nyregion/22delays.html?ref=nyregion">per the Times</a>, &quot;Information about those delays comes mainly from reports by train crews, a method that authority officials acknowledged may not be adequate.&quot;  While NYC Transit suggests that record levels of ridership and other issues are why delays are up (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071544/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/30/why_subway_delays_are_up_this_year.php">in April 2008</a> the #2 for delays was riders holding doors), some MTA board members think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071544/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/subway-delays-increase-as-mta-mulls-fare-hike/82355/">it&apos;s more about management</a>, since the commuter railroads have been dealing with higher ridership just fine.</p>

<p>The Sun reports NYC Transit is considering skipping stops on crowded lines.  After the jump, a list of the on-time performance for all the lines, in descending order of timeliness:</p>
