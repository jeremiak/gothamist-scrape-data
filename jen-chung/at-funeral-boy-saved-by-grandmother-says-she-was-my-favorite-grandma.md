<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_02_brianh.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111940im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_brianh.jpg" width="300" height="339" class="image-left"> </span>Today, the funeral of grandmother Clara Almazo was held at ur Lady of Mount Carmel-Saint Benedicta Church in Staten Island, with Cardinal Timothy Dolan presiding over the service.  Almazo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111940/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/grandmother_killed_by_hit-and-run_d.php">was killed on Thursday night</a> while heading home from Holy Thursday mass when a car fatally struck her as she crossed Cary Avenue.  Almazo, 57, managed to push her 8-year-old grandson, Brian Herrera-Ramirez, out of the way of the SUV.  Dolan said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111940/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/159112/s-i--grandmother-killed-in-hit-and-run-remembered-as-hero">he was moved by her selflessness</a>, &quot;Coming home from Holy Thursday mass, I mean the night that Jesus begins his Passion and giving her life for her little grandson. <strong>If that&apos;s not Christian witness, if that&apos;s not heroic virtue I don&apos;t know what is</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Brian McGurk, 40, turned himself into police three hours after the 9:50 p.m. incident.  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111940/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/07/hit_run_driver_turned_himself_in_3.php">claimed he didn&apos;t realize he hit a person</a>, but a witness said it sounded like two cars had crashed, &quot;it was that loud.&quot;</p>

<p>Grandson Brian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111940/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-boy-save-grandmother-killed-hit-and-run-driver-article-1.1058001">told the Daily News</a> that he tried to yell at McGurk, &quot;I just put my hand out and said, &#x2018;Stop!&#x2019; but the car didn&#x2019;t listen to me. I think (the driver) was talking to somebody.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111940/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/post_303.html">And today at the funeral, the boy who was on crutches said</a>, &quot;She was my favorite grandmother. My sister said she was a hero.&quot;</p>

<p>The police are reportedly investigating whether McGurk had been drinking during the incident.
