<p>Six people died from the storm&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011754/http://wivb.com/2014/11/18/watch-at-10-a-m-press-conference-about-weather-conditions/">WIVB reports</a> that one died when his car slid into a ditch, while a person died while trying to push a car out of the snow when another vehicle pinned the victim to a car. At least three other deaths were &quot;cardiac issues related to shoveling.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011754/http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/stuck-30-hours-on-thruway-he-just-feels-abandoned-20141119">According to the Buffalo News</a>, at least 100 cars and trucks have been stranded on the NY State Thruway &quot;more than 30 hours after blinding lake effect snow brought the traffic to a halt.&quot;</p><blockquote>The morning sun rose on a crystal clear day, but dispositions were anything but sunny. Several said no one has come to check on them.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t eaten for a day and a half,&#x201D; said Samuel Martin, a 49-year-old trucker from Silverton, Ore. &#x201C;This huge pile, this mess, was allowed to be here. They completely abandoned this highway once they decided to close it.&#x201D;...</p>

<p>Shawn Daley of Amherst and Steven Ratcliff of Cheektowaga were headed to work in separate vehicles early Tuesday morning, and didn&#x2019;t know how dire the road had become. Daley, 39, works at Mentholatum in Orchard Park, while Ratcliff, 40, was going to the Ford Stamping Plant in Woodlawn.</p>

<p>They both were stuck on the westbound Thruway just east of the Lackawanna Toll Barrier, about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday. Daley&#x2019;s car was running out of gas, and then his battery gave out. He walked to a few cars, asking if they had room for another passenger. Ratcliff opened his door. After more than 28 hours together, they have become fast friends.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I almost feel like he&#x2019;s my best friend at this point. Letting me in his car, pretty much saved my life,&#x201D; Daley said, adding that several other motorists declined to let him in before he asked Ratcliff.</p></blockquote>And it&apos;s not over:<p></p>
