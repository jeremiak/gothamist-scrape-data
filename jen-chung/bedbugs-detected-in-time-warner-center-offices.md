TVNewser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023155139/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/bed_bugs_at_time_warner_center_in_new_york_170705.asp">reprinted the memo</a>, &quot;The Time Warner Center Facilities Department advises that bed bugs have been detected in Time Warner Center. This determination was made after testing was conducted on several floors of the building.&quot;</p>

<p>A CNN spokesman also said, &quot;The building management is addressing the issue and is taking immediate action.&quot; But the real question is whether the critters have migrated downstairs...to the shops and Whole Foods!!
