<p>Oh, Madge! The 53-year-old superstar won&apos;t be in New York until later this year, so until then, enjoy reports of her concert in Tel Aviv.  Madonna started her MDNA tour at Ramat Gan stadium, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075905/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_MADONNA?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">AP reports</a>, &quot;&apos;The &quot;Material Girl,&apos; a devotee of a form of Jewish mysticism known as Kabbalah, danced, bumped, grinded and vogued in flashy costumes to a raucous crowd...<strong> Madonna emerged on stage in a confessional, breaking through its glass window using a rifle, which she then aimed at the audience</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>But let&apos;s talk about what we care most about: Her clothes.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075905/http://www.wwd.com/eye/fashion/exclusive-first-look-at-madonnas-costumes-5933520?src=rss/recentstories/20120530">According to WWD</a>, her &quot;outfits  [come] from longtime collaborators Jean Paul Gaultier and Jeremy Scott, shoes from Prada and Miu Miu and pieces from Alexander Wang&quot; and &quot;Bras and panties &#x2014; including one heart-shaped style from Madonna&#x2019;s new intimates line Truth or Dare &#x2014; are incorporated into some numbers, as are shoes from the new Truth or Dare footwear line, at retail this fall. A somber, elegiac version of the usually peppy &#x201C;Like a Virgin&#x201D; will be sung by Madonna in an Agent Provocateur bra.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a video of the opening: </p>
