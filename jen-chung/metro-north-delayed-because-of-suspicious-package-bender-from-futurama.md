<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153149/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BNmn8TYdE">Good news, everyone</a>! A suspicious package near a Metro-North station wasn&apos;t a bomb&#x2014;it was just a box painted like Bender from Futurama. Unfortunately, it meant that Metro-North service running through Fairfield, Connecticut was suspended, causing one to two hour delays. Totally worth it for a savvy pop culture reference.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153149/http://blog.ctnews.com/traffic/2014/06/20/suspicous-package-in-fairfield-shuts-down-metro-north/#24461101=0">The Connecticut Post reports</a>, &quot;Police said the box with the painted face was first spotted on the Unquowa Road bridge over the railroad tracks by a Department of Public Works employee on the street-sweeping team about 5:30 a.m. Friday. The DPW worker alerted police, who agreed the box looked &apos;suspicious&apos; and notified MTA and State Police, who dispatched a bomb squad to investigate.&quot;</p>

<p>NBC New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153149/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Metro-North-Suspicious-Package-Train-Delay-Birdhouse-Clock-Station-263961371.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">obtained a photo of the box</a>, &quot;[S]omeone had attached clock hands to it and painted some sort of mask with what looked like small black pupils above it.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407153149/http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Bender_Bending_Rodr%C3%ADguez">AKA, BENDER</a>! The bomb squad cleared the item&#x2014;which was empty&#x2014;and service soon resumed.</p>

<p>Commuters were not amused. While Metro-North was just being cautious, one rider told the CT Post, &quot;I don&#x2019;t defend Metro-North any more. I used to say that Metro-North was better than the Long Island Railroad - not anymore... Commuting isn&#x2019;t cheap - and they never give us a rebate or refund. We&#x2019;re not getting the service for the money we spend.&quot;</p>
