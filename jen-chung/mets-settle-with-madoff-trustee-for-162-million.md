<p>The owners of the New York Mets have decided to avoid going to trial and have settled with the Bernard Madoff trustee by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-19/mets-owners-to-settle-madoff-trustee-case-for-162-million-1-.html">agreeing to pay $162 million</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/judge_overseeing_mets_madoff_profit.php">federal judge Jed Rakoff</a> said that the Mets&apos; owners would have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/met_owners_owe_at_least_83_million.php">pay at least $83 million</a>.  For what it&apos;s worth, the Mets&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120120&amp;content_id=26404568&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb">payroll for the 2012 season is $91 million</a>.  Which means their payroll has been cut by three-and-a- half Oliver Perez&apos;s since 2009 (Perez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090305&amp;content_id=3926224&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym">was paid $12 million/season in 2009</a>!).  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8585680">AP reports</a> that earlier, Rakoff &quot;was skeptical that lawyers could succeed in convincing the nine-person civil jury that the Mets owners believed that Madoff&apos;s business was a fraud but continued their investments anyway because they were making a lot of money.&quot;  Based on court documents submitted by Madoff trustee Picard, the Mets&apos; owners seemed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/mets_owners_were_hooked_on_madoffs.php">hooked on the incredible returns</a> that Madoff was giving them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/sports/baseball/mets-owners-pay-162-million-to-settle-madoff-suit.html?_r=1&amp;hp">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;The $162 million is to be paid out of money Wilpon and Katz expect to recover as a &quot;net loser&quot; of the Madoff scheme. Recovery chances are good, said David J. Sheehan, counsel to Picard. As part of the settlement, the trustee dropped the willful blindness claim against Wilpon and Katz.&quot;</p>

<p>While $162 million is certainly a lot of money, Picard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/19/mets_1.php">had initially sought $1 billion</a>.  In the effort to stem the losses due to the impending settlement and lack of cash from Madoff, the Mets have been paring down their payroll, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/mets_literally_auctioning_off_piece.php">auctioning pieces of their field</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/fred_wilpon_plans_to_own_mets_as_lo.php">selling shares to investors</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like the Wilpons and Saul Katz will be able to keep the team; apparently a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172527/http://www.metsblog.com/2012/03/19/morning-news-wilpon-madoff-jury-trial-begins-today-in-nyc/">settlement of $200 million or more would have been difficult for them</a>.</p>
