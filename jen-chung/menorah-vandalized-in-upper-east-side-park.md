<p>A number of menorahs were lit around NYC yesterday to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah. However, at Carl Schurz Park, community members found the menorah knocked over and vandalized this morning.</p>

<p>The menorah is located at 86th Street near East End Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073835/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/07/upper-east-side-carl-schurz-park-menorah/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;Police believe the menorah at Carl Schurz Park was toppled on purpose both Saturday and Sunday nights.&quot;</p>

<p>The vandalism is under investigation; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073835/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Menorah-Vandalize-Carl-Schurz-Park-Jewish-Hanukkah-Celebration-360815361.html">the mayor&apos;s office said</a>, &quot;Incidents like this have no place here or anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Rabbi Elie Weinstock, of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, said, &quot;Last night we gathered to kindle the menorah, bringing light to the world and this morning we found that we were met by an act of darkness. But light always overcomes darkness, and tonight we plan to light the menorah again.&quot;</p>

<p>There will be another menorah lighting tonight at 8 p.m., organized by Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun and Chabad of the Upper East Side. Last night&apos;s lighting was well-attended and festive: </p>
