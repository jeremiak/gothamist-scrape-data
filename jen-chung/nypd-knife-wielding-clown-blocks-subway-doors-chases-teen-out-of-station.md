<p>Days after telling New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020310/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/creepy_clowns_coming_for_you.php">not to fear clowns</a>, the NYPD says a person wearing a clown mask was menacing subway passengers at a Manhattan train station. And the &quot;clown&quot; was allegedly brandishing a knife.</p>

<p>The incident occurred yesterday afternoon, around 4 p.m., at the 96th Street subway station on the Upper East Side. An NYPD spokesperson said that a 16-year-old boy was trying to exit the train when a person wearing a clown mask stood in the doorway, preventing passengers from exiting. The teen allegedly brushed against the clown, and the clown chased him through the station.</p>

<p>The teen ran through a turnstile and up the stairs to the street, and he told police that when he looked back, the clown was holding a knife. </p>

<p>Reports of clowns threatening communities have attracted media attention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020310/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/28/how_long_until_the_creepy_clown_epi.php">across the country</a>. Some towns in Connecticut and NJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020310/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/05/inane_clown_posse.php">are banning clown costumes</a>&#x2014;or at least recommending against them&#x2014;this Halloween, and police have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020310/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/04/teens_clowning_around.php">arresting teens for stoking killer clown hysteria</a> with fake social media postings. </p>

<p>The NYPD has not distributed images of the alleged clown yet, so for now you&apos;ll just have to use your imagination to visualize a knife-wielding clown chasing you through the subway.</p>
