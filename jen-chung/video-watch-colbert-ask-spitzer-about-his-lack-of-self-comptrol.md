                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_07_spitzercolbert.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_spitzercolbert.jpg" width="640" height="406" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Last night, Eliot Spitzer continued his media blitz (which began with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/video_eliot_spitzer_tells_jay_leno.php">last week&apos;s Tonight Show appearance</a>) by appearing on The Colbert Report. You may recall that Spitzer appeared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/11/videos_of_the_d_5.php">on The Colbert Report the day</a> before his tryst with high-priced hooker Ashley Dupre, and he has returned to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/03/spitzer_on_colbert.php">show in his post-gubernatorial days</a> to offer his thoughts on the world. But this time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/07/stephen-colbert-to-eliot-spitzer-shouldnt-that-job-go-to-someone-with-a-little">Colbert was merciless</a>: &quot;Why do you want this job? Because before you had your fall from grace&#x2014;or whatever her name was&#x2014;you were the governor of the state! You were the governor! Aren&apos;t you at one and the same time both above and below this job?&quot;</p>

<p>He also asked, &quot;Shouldn&apos;t the job of comptroller go to someone who has shown a modicum of self-comptrol?&quot; The Daily Politics has more, pointing out that the candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/07/stephen-colbert-to-eliot-spitzer-shouldnt-that-job-go-to-someone-with-a-little">&quot;got totally clowned&quot;</a>:</p><blockquote> &quot;Do you think that it seems that voters are more forgiving than they used to be?&quot; Colbert asked, or &quot;Do you think that signals progress for our country, or the slow decay of our moral values?&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;Wow. Wow! Tough one,&quot; Spitzer said, grinning.</p>

<p>&quot;This ain&apos;t &apos;Charlie Rose,&apos; motherf-----!&quot; Colbert wrapped up. &quot;Come back and tell me.&quot;</p></blockquote>NY Times political reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/https://twitter.com/grynbaum/status/358071770818949120">Michael Grynbaum Tweeted</a>, &quot;Colbert, brilliant satirist, is also a staunch moralist. Loved watching his sly &amp; sophisticated interview with Spitzer tonight.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Colbert has no patience for dudes who cheat on their wives and lie to the public&#x2014;besides being a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/09/entertainment/la-et-st-stephen-colbert-critics-notebook-20120909">devout Catholic</a> (he teaches Sunday School), his sister also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822071715/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2013/0509/Stephen-Colbert-stung-by-sister-s-loss-to-Mark-Sanford.-Will-he-seek-revenge-video">ran against Mark Sanford</a>. </p>
