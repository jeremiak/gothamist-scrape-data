<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at 3:25 a.m. on January 3rd, in a building near West 12th Street and Greenwich Avenue, where the man knocked on the door of a 23-year-old woman, and claimed he was a neighbor. Police say, &quot;That suspect was also seen following the victim for several blocks before she got home. He asked if something was burning and once inside of her residence, the suspect slapped and choked the victim. He then removed her clothing and forced her to perform oral sex.&quot;</p>
