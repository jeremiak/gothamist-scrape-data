<p>There&apos;s something that many tourists just don&apos;t understand about NYC: You can&apos;t bring your beloved firearm here. Your permit from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/indiana_man_tries_to_enter_empire_s.php">Indiana</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/nc_resident_arrested_for_leaving_lo.php">North Carolina</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/dont_bring_your_gun_to_the_911_memo.php">Tennessee</a> ain&apos;t gonna fly here. And when you tell security at the Empire State Building or 9/11 Memorial that you&apos;ve got a gun, you will totally be arrested. </p>

<p>Yesterday, Evon Allen of Georgia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-gun-atop-empire-state-building-cops-article-1.1407295?localLinksEnabled=false">was arrested after trying to bring in his loaded gun</a> to the Empire State Building. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/half_cocked_southern_tourist_brings_KJGOdZfeZ25auaWKxBOU5M?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">Post says</a>, &quot;He told security he had the .40 caliber Sig Sauer gun on him, the sources said. Police from the Midtown South precinct quickly arrested the man who had a valid concealed carriers permit from Georgia, cops said.&quot;</p>

<p>Allen was reportedly charged with criminal possession of a weapon. An Empire State Building worker told the Daily News, &quot;Trying to get in here with that, he must have been nuts.&quot; But only as nuts at that Marine from Indiana <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/16/should_a_marine_be_charged_for_brin.php">who tried to check his gun</a> in at the ESB in 2011 or that medical student from Tennessee who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/dont_bring_your_gun_to_the_911_memo.php">tried to check her gun at the 9/11 Memorial</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/21/bloomberg_calls_nra_press_conferenc.php">&quot;paranoid&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot;</a> NRA recommends all gun owners to check state and city laws around gun possessions  before traveling. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/articles/2010/guide-to-the-interstate-transportation.aspx">Here&apos;s what it says about NYC</a>:</p><blockquote>A number of localities, including Albany, Buffalo, New York City, Rochester, Suffolk County, and Yonkers, impose their own requirements on the possession, registration, and transport of firearms. Possession of a handgun within New York City requires a New York City handgun license or a special permit from the city police commissioner validating a state license within the city. <p></p>

<p>Even New York state licenses are generally not valid within New York City unless a specific exemption applies, such as when the New York City police commissioner has issued a special permit to the licensee or &#x201C;the firearms covered by such license are being transported by the licensee in a locked container and the trip through the city of New York is continuous and uninterrupted.&#x201D; Possession of a shotgun or rifle within New York City requires a permit, which is available to non-residents, and a certificate of registration. </p>

<p>No person may possess a loaded rifle or shotgun anywhere in public within New York City limits. A non-resident without a permit may possess an unregistered long gun for up to 24 hours in New York City if in transit to a destination outside the city, provided that the firearm is at all times unloaded and in a locked case or locked automobile trunk and the person is &#x201C;lawfully in possession of said rifle or shotgun according to the laws of his or her place of residence.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>In other words, your gun in NYC is probably not a great idea&#x2014;and stashing it away in hotel chair while you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145428/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/nc_resident_arrested_for_leaving_lo.php">visiting the 9/11 Memorial is really stupid</a>. <p></p>
