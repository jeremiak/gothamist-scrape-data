In the other, middle-class parents who have been told their children have been placed on wait lists for kindergarten placement.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142800/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/nyregion/01kindergarten.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times describes</a> it as a &quot;mounting...middle-class vitriol against the school system.&quot;  One parent shared a letter to the Dept. of Education&#x2014;&quot;You have unleashed the fury of parents throughout this city with your complete lack of preparedness&quot;&#x2014;while another recounted, &quot;I got a call from Mayor Bloomberg&#x2019;s campaign about yadda yadda yadda was I going to vote for him. As a parent who has a child with no place to go next year, no indication of where he&#x2019;s going to go next year as a result of the mayor taking control of education, I said absolutely not... You would think that Bloomberg, who is a businessman, knows how to manage inventory like this. <strong>My kid isn&#x2019;t just a bottle of vodka, but this is about inventory</strong>.&#x201D; The Dept. of Education believes their approach to wait lists is fair and &quot;will ensure that children have a placement offer by the end of June.&quot;</p>
