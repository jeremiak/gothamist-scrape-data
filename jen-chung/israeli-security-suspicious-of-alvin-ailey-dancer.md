Jackson said he would not formally complain, &quot;<strong>We&apos;re only here to bring positive light to our lives and the people here.</strong>&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811101855/http://www.alvinailey.org/">Alvin Ailey Dance Theater</a> is celebrating its 50th anniversary with an international tour and many other events.</p>
