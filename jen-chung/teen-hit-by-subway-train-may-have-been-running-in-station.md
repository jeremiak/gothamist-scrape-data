Adrian Rodriguez, who suffered a serious head injury and is currently at Bellevue, was apparently on his way to Marta Valle High School, where a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194642/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/culinary_student_tragic_train_trip_hWFxOemJ5kHh2FsDEYqS4L">school staffer said</a>, &quot;He&apos;s never late, and I know he was just trying to get to school on time. He was always on time&#x2014;100 percent.&quot;  And according to one report, he may have been running in the station.<p></p>

<p>Officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194642/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/04/01/running-teen-injured-by-subway-train/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=WSJ_NY_NY_Blog">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that Rodriguez was &quot;apparently running to catch a subway...when he tripped and fell headlong into the train, suffering a serious head injury... [H]e stumbled and crashed head first into the subway train just before 8 a.m. An MTA official said that the train was either slowing to a stop or had just come to a stop when the teen fell into it.&quot;  However the Daily News suggests he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194642/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/01/2011-04-01_commuter_struck_in_head_by_express_train_on_4_and_5_line_while_entering_union_st.html">collapsed in the station</a>. </p>

He lost his footing and stumbled in front of the train, horrifying scores of rush-hour straphangers.&quot;</p>

<p>Rodriguez is described as &quot;a popular student with a real talent for cooking,&quot; according to the News, which adds, &quot;He won the Careers through Culinary Arts Program junior competition last year and was prepping for a shot at a scholarship to the prestigious Culinary Institute of America.&quot; </p>
