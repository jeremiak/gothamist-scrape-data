<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210061749/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Lamont-Pride-Confession-Video-Peter-Figoski-East-New-York-Brooklyn-138981884.html">NBC New York aired an interview</a> that alleged cop killer Lamont Pride gave to police about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210061749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/12/nypd_officer_fatally_shot_in_face_d.php">fatal shooting of police officer Peter Figoski</a>.  Pride says, &quot;The reason I decided to come forward with everything is I need to help myself out of this situation. I&#x2019;m not gonna get out of it. I know I&#x2019;m gonna do some type of crime. I&#x2019;m not trying to do the max.&quot;</p>

<p>Pride and four other men are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210061749/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/14/cops_cheer_as_alleged_cop_killer_an.php#photo-1">accused in the home invasion gone wrong</a>: While some of the men were trying to rob a pot dealer, the police interrupted.  In the interviews, Pride&apos;s story did change, but he ultimately admitted to bringing a gun to the East New York apartment, &quot;We went over there &#x2026; but not everything went according to plan.&quot; Pride said, &quot;I look up to clutch my hands to run &#x2026; he is coming and I&#x2019;m going &#x2026; so it was like &apos;Boom.&apos;&quot;... The gun goes off as I clutch my hands to run &#x2026; I&#x2019;m like this running. As I&#x2019;m running, I&#x2019;m clutching my hands. I never took my hand off the trigger. That was my mistake. I was so nervous and I panicked. I didn&apos;t even think.&quot;</p>
