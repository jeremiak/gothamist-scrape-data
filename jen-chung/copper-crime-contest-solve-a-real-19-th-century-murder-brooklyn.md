<p><em>One day, a man went to check on his brother, John Smith, at his Brooklyn home and found him shot in the head.  Initially, the police suspected suicide but the placement of the bullet wounds made that theory ridiculous.  They also realized that Smith&apos;s watch and cash were missing&#x2014;leading them to suspect burglars.<br>
<em><br>
However, his face was washed of blood, his hair was combed and his shirt clean.  Additionally, police found some blood-stained towels. Previously, Smith had been seen in the company of an attractive young woman who neighbors would see leaving his home early in the morning.  Smith later became engaged to a different woman, Maggie Davis, and a letter&#x2014;sent to Smith&apos;s father&#x2014;was found in Smith&apos;s home, revealing that a writer, Lucy B., claimed to be married to Smith and the mother of his child, but complained that she was being dumped.  Smith&apos;s family then found that the letter writer was actually known as Amy Jones and soon offered a reward for her.<br>
</em><br>
Then another woman emerged: Mrs. Grace Parker, another lover of Smith&apos;s, claimed that she had been with Smith the evening of his death and suspected <em>her</em> lover had killed him out of jealousy. </em></p>
