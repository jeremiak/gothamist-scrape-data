<p>As furor mounts over the NYPD&apos;s seeming inability to curb the hoards of illegal dirt bike riders who regularly terrorize the city, the department fired off a press release touting its motorcycle-confiscation efforts so far this year. The p.r. push comes days after a shocking video showed an SUV driver mowing down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071240/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/what_should_you_do_when_a_violent_m.php">a group of motorcyclists</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071240/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/what_should_you_do_when_a_violent_m.php">severely injuring one</a>, and a high speed chase that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071240/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/severely_injured_dirt_bike_rider_re.php">ended with a brutal assault</a> in Washington Heights. </p>

<p>The NYPD says:</p><blockquote>Year to date (through Oct. 3), the NYPD has issued 5,498 summonses to motorcycle operators and seized 1,440 motorcycles, quad and dirt bikes - including 57 vehicles on Sunday, Sept. 29 - citywide.<br>
 <br>
Patrol personnel have made 437 arrests, including 187 for reckless endangerment or reckless driving. Other offenses include motorcyclists operating without a license or with a suspended license, without registration or insurance, or with altered VINs or license plate violations.<br>
 <br>
Across the city police have conducted 25 motorcycle-enforcement initiatives to deter and cite dangerous or illegal motorcycle and other motorized bike operation. This includes deployment of police helicopters which help to inform ground units of problematic areas.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. had a novel suggestion to stop illegal bike riders&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071240/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/biker_gang.php">gas stations should stop selling them gas</a>.</p>
