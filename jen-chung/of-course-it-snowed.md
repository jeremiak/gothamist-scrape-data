<p>We knew that the weekend&apos;s wonderful weather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419030234/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/heavy_rain_tomorrow_will_end_warm_s.php">was going to end with a cold spell</a>, but SNOW? We guess the cold wet stuff couldn&apos;t quit us&#x2014;call the salt spreaders &apos;cause it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419030234/http://gothamist.com/tags/polarvortex">eternal winter</a> forever, guys!</p>

<p>No one is complaining about a lack of a snow day, because it&apos;s NYC public schools&apos; spring break. And we only got a light dusting. Anyway, hope those kids are resting up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419030234/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/15/summer_hot.php">for the forthcoming miserable solar vortex</a>.</p>
