<p>Yesterday, a judge allowed the Russian tourist who embarrassed the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012820/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/24/video_man_arrested_for_mid-day_stro.php">by scaling the Brooklyn Bridge in August</a> to return back home. Yaroslav Kolchin, who managed to climb up the bridge weeks after two German artists scaled the bridge towers for an art project, says he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012820/http://nypost.com/2014/10/09/tourist-who-scaled-brooklyn-bridge-allowed-to-return-home/">was confused about why he&apos;d been in trouble in the first place</a>, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t know that it would make a reaction like that,&quot; adding, &quot;In Russia it is normal. In Moscow police don&#x2019;t touch people who climb on bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>The 24-year-old was sentenced to community service (though not cleaning the bridge, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012820/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/30/judge_wants_russian_tourist_who_sca.php">as the judge originally wanted</a>), which he completed. And why was he climbing the bridge? To <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012820/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/tourist_scaled_brooklyn_bridge_for.php">take a selfie, of course</a>.</p>

<p>According to the Post, Kolchin said, &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be that high when you&#x2019;re downstairs [but at the top] it was beautiful. It was the best part of the bridge.&quot; But, he admitted, &quot;I do not recommend other people repeat me.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to Kolchin and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012820/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/surrender_brooklyn_mysterious_white.php">flag-swapping German artists</a>, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012820/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/02/new_brooklyn_bridge_barrier.php">new barriers to walking up the bridge cables</a>.</p>
