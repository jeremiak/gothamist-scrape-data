A source said, &quot;<strong>The FBI is seriously spooked about these guys planning another 9/11. This is not some ... FBI informant-driven case. This is the real thing.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191540/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/bomb_raid_at_home_visited_by_associate_8BSSuO280oy7oBlXoUCIpI">According to the Post,</a> the main suspect is &quot;a Queens-born man in his late 20s who has an Afghani father&quot; who lives in Denver, &quot;But the investigation quickly turned to New York as intelligence indicated he was heading here to obtain bomb-making materials.&quot; After driving to New York in a rental car, &quot;The man had been in New York for about a week when the raids were unleashed -- and he suddenly hot-footed it back to Denver by plane out of La Guardia, sources said.&quot;  </p>

<p>A friend of the suspect said that he had operated a coffee cart in NYC before moving to Denver&#x2014;and that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191540/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/nyregion/15terror.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">he had returned to deal with a permit issue</a>.  The friend told the Times, &quot;I couldn&#x2019;t imagine some of the kinds of questions [the authorities] asked... I told them everything I know,&quot; adding, &quot;This is our country. We&#x2019;re going to be citizens soon. We work here, we live here, we love this country as much as you.&quot; Another man in one of the raided homes said everyone worked too hard to be involved with terrorism. No materials were found in any of the homes.</p>

<p>Now the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have issued an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191540/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/queens-raids-prompt-alert-on-homemade-explosives/">alert to law enforcement agencies about bomb-making materials</a>.</p>
