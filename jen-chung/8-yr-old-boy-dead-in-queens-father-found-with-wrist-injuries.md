The boy&apos;s father was also found, police say, with &quot;injuries to both wrists.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 10:10 p.m., officers responded to a 911 call about an emotionally disturbed person at 169-17 Underhill Avenue in Queens. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706124130/http://nypost.com/2014/06/29/troubled-father-kills-son-attempts-to-commit-suicide/">Post reports</a> that first responders found a grisly scene: &quot;A two-gallon bucket filled with blood was in the bathroom, along with the child&#x2019;s bloody clothes, the sources said. Cops believe the blood in the bucket and on the clothing came from the man&#x2019;s self-inflicted wounds.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy was apparently found with &quot;signs of trauma on his neck&quot; on a bed, and he was pronounced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706124130/http://7online.com/news/queens-father-accused-of-killing-son-then-attempting-to-kill-himself/147862/">dead at the scene</a>. The Post&apos;s sources claim that the dad told EMS medics that &quot;he had strangled his son that morning.&quot;</p>

<p>The father is at Queens General Hospital. The man&apos;s neighbors described him as a &quot;good guy&quot; but also said he and his wife had loud arguments.</p>
