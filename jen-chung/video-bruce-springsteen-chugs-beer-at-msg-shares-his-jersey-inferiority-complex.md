<p>Apparently chugging beer during the Apollo Medley portion of his concert is Bruce Springsteen&apos;s new thing&#x2014;The Boss was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014434/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/video_bruce_springsteen_chugs_fans.php">spotted doing it in Philadelphia last month</a>, and again during his Madison Square Garden shows last week and last night. And he&apos;s been drinking beers right out of his loyal fans&apos; hands... that&apos;s about a $10 loss at MSG!</p>

<p>During Friday&apos;s and last night&apos;s shows, he took his beer breaks during the medley.  The buzz even gave him some extra hometown pride, and the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014434/http://www.nj.com/springsteen/index.ssf/2012/04/bruce_springsteen_rocks_an_inc.html">Star-Ledger notes</a> that the Boss had a lot of NJ love during &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; on Friday:</p><blockquote>     Bruce talked about there being so many wonderful things across the bridge and tunnels. <br>
 Then he started to do the same schtick that he did at the 2000 Garden shows during the Reunion Tour. <br>
   &quot;There&apos;s so many things to appreciate about New York,&quot; he said.  &quot;There&apos;s the Statue of Liberty which we learn is actually in New Jersey.<br>
   &quot;There&apos;s the greatest theme song ever written about a city, which is sung by a man from New Jersey.<br>
   &quot;And there&apos;s a world championship football team who come to think of it, they play in New Jersey!&quot;</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014434/http://www.nj.com/springsteen/index.ssf/2012/04/bruce_springsteen_hits_the_bac.html">Last night, he said</a>, &quot;There&apos;s the World Champion New York Giants who happen to play in a stadium that&apos;s in New Jersey... <strong>It&apos;s like having the Empire State Building be called the Garden State Building and leaving it in New York.</strong>&quot;<p></p>
