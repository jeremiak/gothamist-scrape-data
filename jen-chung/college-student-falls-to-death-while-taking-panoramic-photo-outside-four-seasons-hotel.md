<p>A 20-year-old college student from NJ was found dead on a roof of the Four Seasons Hotel last night. It&apos;s believed that Connor Cummings, 20, and a friend were scaling the midtown Manhattan hotel&apos;s facade to take a photograph when Cummings slipped and fell.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2015_12_ccummings1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161602im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_12_ccummings1.jpg" width="300" height="369"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Connor Cummings (Facebook)</i></div> Police say that they responded to the hotel, located at 57 East 57th Street, at 11:15 p.m. A spokesman says that Cummings, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was found on a sub-roof (the Four Season has setbacks for different floors).<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161602/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/man-falls-death-climbing-seasons-hotel-article-1.2481559">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;As [Cummings and his friend] climbed in the pouring rain, one of the pair either jumped or fell, plunging nine stories until he landed on one of the lower rooftops of the luxury hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>The pair had used the scaffolding outside the hotel to climb up. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161602/http://nypost.com/2015/12/31/man-dies-after-falling-from-four-seasons-trying-to-take-photo/">According to the Post</a>, Cummings was &quot;attempt[ing] to take a &apos;panoramic&apos; photograph.&quot;</p>

<p>Cummings, who lived in Rockaway, NJ, graduated from Morris Knoll High School last year and was a student at University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His family told WABC 7 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161602/http://abc7ny.com/news/college-student-falls-to-death-while-apparently-attempting-to-take-photos-at-midtown-hotel/1141801/">that he was a photography buff</a>.</p>

<p>His aunt told the news station, &quot;We&apos;re trying to get answers. They say that he went up the elevator, and then went up a stairway, and then went out on a balcony, but the cops aren&apos;t saying exactly what happened. And, I know the medical examiner was up there. I mean, he&apos;s a young kid, he&apos;s a good kid, they weren&apos;t drinking or anything, they were taking a picture.&quot;</p>
