<p>The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is looking into a possible bias crime on Staten Island: A number of cars were vandalized with graffiti, and one apparently had a racial epithet on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014208/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/graffiti_found_on_several_cars.html#incart_m-rpt-1">The Staten Island Advance reports</a>, &quot;An NYPD spokeswoman confirmed that at least three cars, possibly more, were discovered vandalized on Westervelt Avenue near Crescent Avenue, early Sunday morning.

One victim says he is concerned about the ugly nature of the crime. He says that in the middle of the night he found out that there was graffiti on his brother-in-law&apos;s window with a bad word on it, so he came outside to clean it up.&quot; <br>
