<p>A Brooklyn returned to their Brighton Beach home to find that someone broke in and stole jewelry, money and a computer. And it turns out their nanny cam, which was on, captured footage of the crook:</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, it happened last Saturday at 9 p.m.: &quot;The suspect entered a home in the Brighton Beach Section of Brooklyn through a rear window and removed cash, computer equipment and jewelry. The suspect then exited the apartment through the same rear window he entered. There was no one home at the time and there were no reported injuries.&quot; You can see the suspect by the crib!</p>

<p>The father, Alexey Chizhov, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325141708/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Nanny-Cam-Burglar-Brooklyn-Computer-Brighton-Beach-206962901.html">spoke to NBC New York</a>, &quot;That day when we were leaving to Washington, I decided to put it on. The cameras were not obtained for security purposes, because we&apos;ve never had any burglars in our household, but I was like, &apos;Why not?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
