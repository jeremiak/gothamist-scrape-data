Only Garvey happens to be living in a homeless shelter.  She told the paper, &quot;I want better, so that&apos;s why I do well in school.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Garvey, whose project is a 2 1/2 marine-life study, and her father said that they were first homeless when she was little: &quot;She switched elementary schools three times in a single year. The Garveys&apos; circumstances eventually improved enough for them to live in the same home for several years. But her parents, Leo and Olga, missed work and lost income after a car accident last February. On New Year&apos;s Day, behind on their rent, they were forced out of their house and spent a week in a hotel before going to the shelter.&quot;</p>

<p>The teen, who has a 3.9 average, also studies violin, and hopes to go to Yale or Brown, says, &quot;The house we were living in had a dog, a cat, turtles. Then one day someone turns around and says, &apos;You have to leave.&apos; What are you going to do with your animals? Yourself?&quot;  The dog is at a pound and she believes it will probably be euthanized (the cat and turtles are with family and friends).  Check out this video of Garvey:</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706213251/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/01/12/homeless-long-island-teenager-is-intel-competition-semifinalist/">interview with WCBS 880</a>, Garvey added that the contest&apos;s recognition &quot;motivates me to do better. I do well and I pursue my passion because it&#x2019;s what I have and it&#x2019;s a way out, you know, and it&#x2019;ll lead to better things.&quot; And her dad told Newsday, &quot;I&apos;m always bragging about her. She sets her mind to something and she goes for it. She amazes me all of the time.&quot;<br>
