</div></div>					<p>Are you still sad you missed the chance to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144614/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/video_aphex_twin_flash_mob_at_the_m.php#photo-1">Alarm Will Sound performing</a> at the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Well, get your calendar ready: The institution just announced highlights for its new <em>Met Museum Presents</em> season, and there are exciting events&#x2014;like a talk with the Met&apos;s curator of Arms and Armors with the costume designer for <em>Game of Thrones</em>!</p>

<p>Limor Tomer, the Met&apos;s General Manager of Concerts &amp; Lectures, said, &quot;Whether through theater, talk, or music, we want to make visible the narratives that lie within the objects and galleries, giving our audience a depth of experience with works of art.&quot; And the Met&apos;s Director and CEO Thomas Campbell praised the program&apos;s &quot;bold approach,&quot; while confessing that he was enraptured by former artist in residence&apos;s Alarm Will Sound&apos;s dance for far longer than he planned to be!</p>

<p>You can take a look at the season in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144614/http://issuu.com/metmuseum/docs/met_museum_presents_brochure_2014-1?e=7048681/7652808">this brochure</a>, but here are some highlights:</p>

<p>The 2014-2015 season&apos;s Artist In Residence is <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144614/http://www.thecivilians.org/">The Civilians</a></strong>, a New York-based theater group known for investigative theater (their show, The Great Immensity, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144614/http://www.publictheater.org/Tickets/Calendar/PlayDetailsCollection/13-14-Season/The-Great-Immensity/">is at the Public Theater</a> now). They will be performing three pieces specially created and reflecting the museum&apos;s galleries and art (September, March and May).</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144614/http://attaccaquartet.com/">Attaca Quartet</a></strong> is the Quartet In Residence; they&apos;ll be performing music from John Adams (collaborating with choreographer Franceca Harper), all 68 Hayden string quartets and other works throughout the season. Here&apos;s a taste of that:</p>
