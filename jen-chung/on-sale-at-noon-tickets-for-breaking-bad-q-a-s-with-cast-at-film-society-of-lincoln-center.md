<p>Here&apos;s a reminder about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822064912/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/02/epic_breaking_bad_marathon_726-730.php"><em>Breaking Bad</em> extravaganza</a> at the Film Society of Lincoln Center&#x2014;tickets for the two discussions, &quot;The Perfect Batch: Breaking Bad Cast Favorites,&quot; go on sale at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822064912/http://filmlinc.com/">filmlinc.com</a> today, July 19th, at noon.</p>

<p>There are four discussions, which will include creator Vince Gilligan and stars Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Dean Norris and Bob Odenkirk. From FilmLinc:</p><blockquote>Thursday&apos;s first panel at 6:15pm will feature Anna Gunn, RJ Mitte, and Bob Odenkirk. The three, who play Walter White&apos;s wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., and the morally uncentered criminal lawyer Saul Goodman, respectively, will show two of their favorite episodes followed by a Q&amp;A; moderated by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York Magazine.<p></p>

<p>The second panel on Thursday will take place at 9:00pm with multiple Emmy-winning star Bryan Cranston, who will also screen two episodes and engage in a Q&amp;A; with Seitz. </p>

<p>Panel 3, which will take place Friday at 6:15pm, will bring actors Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris, who play Marie and Hank Schrader, to the Film Society. Following their two chosen episodes, there will be a Q&amp;A; moderated by The New Yorker&apos;s Emily Nussbaum.</p>

<p>Our fourth and final panel on Friday at 9:00pm will feature series mastermind and multiple WGA Award winner Vince Gilligan (creator, executive producer, writer, and director), whose previous credits include The X-Files. The Q&amp;A; following his two favorite episodes will also be moderated by Nussbaum.</p></blockquote>All discussions will be streamed on Filmlinc.com and the entire discussions will be online on AMC&apos;s website afterwards. Tickets are $15 per panel, but there&apos;s a special $50 package for all four.<p></p>
