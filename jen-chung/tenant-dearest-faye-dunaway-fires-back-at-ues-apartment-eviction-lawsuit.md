										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_07_tenantdeart.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905200225im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_tenantdeart.jpg" width="365" height="258" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905200225/http://nyti.ms/ompK9m">NY Times reported</a> that an Upper East Side landlord was suing to evict Faye Dunaway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905200225/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/03/faye_dunaway_sued_for_not_living_in.php">claiming that the Oscar-winning actress was not living</a> in her rent-stabilized, one-bedroom walkup.  Now, Dunaway has left three voicemail messages with the NY Times, explaining that her landlord can&apos;t sue to evict her...&apos;cause she&apos;s not even living there anymore.  </p>

<p>Dunaway, who says she got the apartment from her mentor, playwright William Alfred, and kept &quot;out of my deep, deep affection&quot; for him, said, &quot;I have chosen to leave because of the state of the apartment, and also because I am spending less and less time in New York.&quot;  The state of the apartment?  Dunaway elaborated that her landlord, Henry Moses Jr., &quot;refused to paint the house, and bugs were everywhere.&quot;  She added, &quot;He is a slum landlord. He has no class.&quot;</p>

<p>Dunaway pays just over $1,000 for the apartment; market rate for other one-bedrooms in the neighborhood is around $2,300. The actress claimed she moved in May, but then a lawyer for Moses played some voicemail messages that Dunaway left yesterday for the NY Times: In them, Dunaway &quot;offered to hand back the apartment keys, told the landlord that she had moved out in May and informed Mr. Moses that she was arranging for a moving company to pick up some papers.&quot; </p>

<p>Moses&apos; lawyer says her items are still in the apartment, &quot;As of now, I don&#x2019;t have legal possession; she hasn&#x2019;t put a thing in writing. What if she goes in there and later claims, &#x2018;I had the Hope Diamond there and my Oscar in there and you took it&#x2019;?&quot;  He also played a message she left for Moses, &quot;I hope you need that money like crazy and you&#x2019;ll give it to poor people. I hope you have a terrible life.&quot;</p>
