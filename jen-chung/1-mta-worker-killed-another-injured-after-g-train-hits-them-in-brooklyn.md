<p>Two MTA workers preparing for overnight maintenance work to the F and G tracks in Brooklyn were struck by a G train last night, killing one and injuring the other. The southbound train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013533/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/03/brooklyn-mta-workers-hit-by-train/">&quot;rounded a curve&quot;</a> between the Fort Hamilton Parkway and Church Avenue stations, &quot;pinning both men.&quot;</p>

<p>The tragic collision occurred just after midnight. The men were &quot;&apos;flaggers&apos;... [who] go into the subway with lanterns to light the way before repairs begin,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013533/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-G-Train-Hits-Kills-MTA-Worker-Church-Avenue-Overnight-Repairs-399781951.html">according to NBC New York</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013533/http://pix11.com/2016/11/03/1-mta-worker-dead-another-hurt-after-being-struck-by-subway-train-inside-brooklyn-tunnel-nypd/">third rail had to be turned</a> off before rescue crews could reach them, and then the emergency workers had to use a subway hatch near East 3rd Street and Canton Avenue to reach the workers. </p>

<p>One worker, a 53-year-old man, died from his injuries while another, a 49-year-old, suffered injuries. The G train conductor is also being observed for trauma.</p>

<p>Thirteen transit workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013533/https://twitter.com/ADiLorenzoTV/status/794128320996773888">have been killed</a> in the past 15 years. In 2007, a transit worker who was setting up lights for track work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013533/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/25/transit_worker.php">was killed by a train</a> near the Columbus Circle station. A few days later, another worker, who was repairing tracks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013533/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/30/subway_repair_w.php">was fatally struck by a G train</a> at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station.</p>

<p>The Transit Workers Union Local 100 President John Samuelsen said, &quot;This tragedy highlights the extreme danger transit workers are in every time they step on the tracks. Here we have two transit workers run down by a train while performing routine maintenance. The NYC Transit Authority can&apos;t protect us so they damn well better pay us.&quot;</p>
