</div></div>					<p>The NY Times got an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155141/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/nyregion/28map.html?ref=nyregion">advance look at the MTA&apos;s latest overhaul</a> of the NYC subway map, which was last refreshed in 1998.  The Times, which says the new version is &quot;resized, recolored and simplified,&quot; reports, &quot;Manhattan will become taller, bulkier and 30 percent wider, to better display its spaghetti of subway lines. Staten Island, meanwhile, will shrink by half. The spreadsheetlike &apos;service guide,&apos; along the map&#x2019;s bottom border, will be eliminated, and the other three boroughs will grow to fill the space.&quot;  </p>

<p>Also: &quot;A separate, stripped-down map will also be produced, to be displayed only inside subway cars. Neighborhood names, parks, ferries and bus connections will not appear on this version, making for a less cluttered composition that may be easier to read over a fellow rider&#x2019;s shoulders.&quot;  The Times also has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155141/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/27/nyregion/new-ny-subway-map.html?ref=nyregion">nifty interactive feature</a> that compares the latest version with the 1998 version, the 1979 version that first showed a street grid, Massimo Vignelli&apos;s classic 1972 design and the 1968 version, plus the fattening of Manhattan.</p>

<p>Of course, this means there&apos;s some subway map trash-talking.  Eddie Jabbour, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155141/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/23/kick_map_finds.php">believes his Kick Map</a>  (see it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155141/http://kickmap.com/">here</a>) is the best way to understand the system, calls it complicated&#x2014;&quot;You have to read the map rather than scan the map&quot;&#x2014;and says it&apos;s an &quot;artifact of its time, and its time was 1979.&quot; But Michael Hertz (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155141/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/03/michael_hertz_d.php">our interview with him</a>), whose firm has been designing the subway map since 1979, tells the Times, &quot;It continues to be the right balance between information and graphic clarity. We have given the public a good tool to get around the city.&quot;  What about this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155141/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/24/map_of_the_day_145.php">2008 update to Vignelli&apos;s design</a>?</p>

<p>The MTA tells us that the expected &quot;launch&quot; of the new maps will be June 27&#x2014;to coincide with service changes.</p>
