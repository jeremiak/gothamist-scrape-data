It sounds like a deal, since he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529002326/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/04/plaxs_lawyer_blames_bloomberg_morge.php">facing 3 1/2 to 15 years</a> on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529002326/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/08/03/2009-08-03_exnew_york_giants_star_plaxico_burress_indicted_on_three_charges_antonio_pierce_.html">three charges he was indicted on</a>&#x2014;&quot;two counts of criminal possession of a weapon and one count of reckless endangerment.&quot; </p>

<p>The Post says Burress&apos;s sentence is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529002326/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08202009/news/regionalnews/manhattan/plaxico_burress_pleads_guilty_185509.htm">20 months</a>, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529002326/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/2009/08/20/2009-08-20_former_giants_star_plaxico_burress.html">Daily News explains </a>that Burress&apos;s lawyer Benjamin Brafman believes his client will serve 20 months if he behaves behind bars.   He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529002326/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08202009/news/regionalnews/manhattan/plaxico_burress_pleads_guilty_185509.htm">will turn himself in on September 22</a>.

<p>Brafman said of the sentence, &quot;<strong>This was not an intentional criminal act.  prison sentence is a very severe punishment</strong>.&quot; To keep track, former Atlanta Falcon (now Philadelphia Eagle) Michael Vick served 18 months (of a 23 month sentence) in a federal prison for dogfighting while Cleveland Brown player Donte Stallworth served 24 days (of a 30 day sentence) for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529002326/http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/football/story/1099010.html?storylink=pd">DUI manslaughter charges in Miami</a>.  </p>
