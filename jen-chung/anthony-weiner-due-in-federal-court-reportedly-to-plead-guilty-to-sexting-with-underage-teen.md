<p>Anthony Weiner, the once promising Democratic Congressman whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">career has been torpedoed</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/anthony_weiner_carlos_danger.php">by a series of sexting scandals</a>, will appear in federal court this morning.</p>

<p>His appearance apparently involves his alleged relationship with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/21/anthony_t_dog_weiner_sext.php">15-year-old girl who says Weiner sent her sexually explicit texts</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/nyregion/anthony-weiner-guilty-plea-sexting.html">The NY Times reports</a> Weiner will plead guilty: &quot;The information has not been made public but was related by two people who have been briefed on the matter and asked not to be identified. Mr. Weiner will plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor, pursuant to a plea agreement with the United States attorney&#x2019;s office in Manhattan, one of the people said. Mr. Weiner surrendered to the F.B.I. early Friday morning.&quot; </p>

<p>The feds had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/19/anthony_weiner_reportedly_faces_fed.php">investigating Weiner since last year</a>, and this sexting incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/29/anthony_weiner_returns_to_wreak_som.php">put Weiner in the middle</a> of the FBI&apos;s investigation of Hillary Clinton during the presidential election.</p>

<p>The revelation of Weiner&apos;s underage sexting scandal surfaced in September, weeks Weiner&apos;s wife Huma Abedin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/huma_abedin_weiner_separation.php">announced she was separating</a> from him after learning about a <em>different</em> sexting scandal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/anthony_weiner_sexting_saga.php">with a 40-something woman</a>, this time involving photos of their son.</p>

<p>Weiner was reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519145022/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/02/weiner_gets_help.php">spotted at a sex addiction rehab center last fall</a>. The NY Post spotted him on crutches in March; the nature and cause of his injuries is unclear.</p>
