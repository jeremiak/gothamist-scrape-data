<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_08_bodwlaj.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131307im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_08_bodwlaj.jpg" width="230" height="179" class="image-left"> </span>Police descended on Walworth Street (between Flushing and Park) in Brooklyn, after two suitcases full of body parts was discovered on the sidewalk.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131307/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/08/31/2009-08-31_body_parts_in_bags_found_in_bklyn.html">According to the Daily News</a>, a homeless man found the suitcases in plastic bags but then screamed, &quot;Call the cops! There&apos;s a chopped-up person in the bags!&quot;</p>

<p>However, the Post says a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131307/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08312009/news/regionalnews/body_parts_in_two_suitcases_187322.htm">milk warehouse worker made the find</a>&#x2014;Upstate Dairy Farm is across the street.  One worker told WABC 7, &quot;I see a lot of police, and when I went close to the place, I saw two suitcases on the floor and I see a foot, cut of. That was horrible, a chopped up body.&quot;</p>

<p>Another witness told the News, &quot;It was a foot with a Timberland shoe and sock. I couldn&apos;t see much skin. It was just bone.&quot;  And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131307/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6990542">WABC 7 adds</a>, &quot;Workers say the suitcases must have been placed there over the weekend, because they were not seen last Friday when the workers went home.&quot;  </p>

<p>NY1 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131307/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/104956/investigators-examine-bones-found-on-brooklyn-sidewalk/Default.aspx">spoke to one shocked worker</a>, &quot;It&apos;s terrible. Especially right here, why would it happen right here? This is unbelievable. I mean when I saw this I was shocked myself, especially right here on a quiet block, especially a Jewish neighborhood and all that. Why did it have to happen right here?&quot; The ME&apos;s office is examining the bones and may have more details at the end of the day.  </p>
