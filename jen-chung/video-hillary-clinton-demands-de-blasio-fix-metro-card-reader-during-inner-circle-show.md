<p>Last night was the one night of the year where Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/29/video_louis_ck_helps_roast_mayor_de.php">knowingly makes a fool</a> of himself: it was the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://innercircleshow.org/">Inner Circle Show</a>, where the city&apos;s political writers put on a revue mocking NYC and Albany, many of their subjects and themselves in the name of charity. And de Blasio went big&#x2014;he brought Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The theme of the show this year was <em>Shamilton</em>, based on <em>Hamilton</em>. While <em>Hamilton</em> has incredibly talented musical performers, <em>Shamilton</em> featured a more <em>Waiting for Guffman</em>-esque ragtag crew of game participants. So before you watch de Blasio proceed with a terrifying bad rap (6:45 mark) alongside the immensely charismatic Leslie Odom Jr. (who plays Aaron Burr in <em>Hamilton</em>), just remember: &quot;I make Bernie Sanders look like Trump. I&#x2019;m down with Sandinistas and The Donald&#x2019;s a chump&quot; is just for charity. </p>

<p>Around 7:30, he introduces &quot;my home girl, Hillary&quot; and Clinton arrived to rousing applause. She joked, &quot;Well, I heard my name&quot; and told de Blasio, &quot;Thanks for the endorsement, Bill...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/30/dance_monkey_dance.php">took you long enough</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>She continued, &quot;There are a lot of things I could ask you of international, national, state and city importance. <strong>But would you just fix these MetroCard slots in the subway? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/hillary_subwayghazi.php">It took me like five swipes</a>.</strong> The little terminal thing kept saying &apos;Please swipe again.&apos; You&apos;ve got to fix that! You don&apos;t have to worry about horses anymore&#x2014;fix the turnstile and the MetroCard.&quot; </p>

<p>That&apos;s a good LOL, but time to factcheck: The MetroCard reader is the realm of the MTA, so Hillary should just tell her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://www.nysenate.gov/">state</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/">representatives</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://www.governor.ny.gov/contact">Governor Cuomo</a> to stop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200643/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/22/mta_so_popular_so_broke.php">robbing the MTA of badly needed funding</a> and figure out a way to come up with more cash for a 21st Century transit system.</p>
