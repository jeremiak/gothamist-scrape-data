<p>A pair of sophomores at a Connecticut High School were arrested for allegedly dressing like the Columbine High School massacre killers and threatening students on Halloween. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115043227/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/nyregion/connecticut-school-seeking-to-expel-2-students-over-columbine-costumes.html">The NY Times reports</a> that two boys, who were suspended and are currently in juvenile detention, may be expelled.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115043227/http://www.ct.gov/despp/cwp/view.asp?Q=573152&amp;A=4226">Connecticut State Police said</a> that over the weekend they were &quot;were notified by Litchfield High School faculty of the threat of a possible hostile event occurring at the Litchfield High School on November 2, 2015. The information was passed on to faculty by people concerned about safety.&quot;</p><blockquote>   Through the course of their investigation, Troopers determined that two juveniles were responsible for the potential threat.  Troopers interviewed the two juveniles, as well as other witnesses.  As Troopers continued the investigation, they developed information that threats of bodily harm to other students at Litchfield High School had been made by the juveniles.</blockquote>Litchfield Public Schools Superintendent Lynn McMullin said the students were &quot;wearing trench coats, sunglasses, and baseball hats.&quot; They were charged with inciting injury to persons or property and breach of peace.<p></p>

<p>A lawyer for one of the students, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115043227/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/nyregion/connecticut-school-seeking-to-expel-2-students-over-columbine-costumes.html">David Moraghan, told the Times</a> that the pair had gone to a Halloween party on Saturday: &quot;He acknowledged they were dressed in distasteful costumes but said they did not have &apos;any object that can be used or perceived as a weapon.&apos;&quot;</p><blockquote>A group walked up to them, according to Mr. Moraghan&#x2019;s account, and after commenting that they looked like the Columbine High School killers, someone added, &#x201C;I bet you&#x2019;re going to shoot up the school.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Mr. Moraghan said, &#x201C;There was a sarcastic response to that, and that was basically the end of it.&#x201D; He said one girl told her parents, who then called the police. Investigators, in turn, searched the students&#x2019; cellphones and their homes, he said.</p>

<p>The State Police confirmed the home search, but declined to answer questions about what they found. Mr. Moraghan said, &#x201C;Nothing was found in either boy&#x2019;s home that could in any way give credence to what they claim the boys were going to do.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Superintendent McMullin wrote in a letter to families, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115043227/http://www.litchfieldschools.org/">posted on the Litchfield Public Schools website</a>, &quot;I am asking that you trust the information I shared with you in my letter and in a statement to the press. Please disregard the various timelines and inaccurate confusing details presented by various media outlets. My responsibility is to remain open and transparent in my communication with you, as I will continue to do.   Please trust me when I tell you that the State Police and the District have been working together in earnest with one goal: student safety.&quot; She added:<blockquote>With that said, we had an unfortunate and unexpected incident on the Intermediate School campus early this morning in which a New York Times reporter and a photographer unlawfully and unannounced came onto private school property and randomly began speaking to our students.  The moment we became aware of their presence, we asked both to leave school property immediately.   We are upset by this behavior by the press during what is a very unfortunate time for our school community.   </blockquote>Moraghan reiterated to the Times, &quot;There was no risk of anyone being injured, assaulted or harmed. I think it was a very bad Halloween costume two kids thought of that they never thought of the consequences... Both boys are so remorseful for their stupidity.&quot;<p></p>
