</div></div>					<p>Today, tens of thousands of NYC Marathon entrants are probably enjoying the natural high of running through all five boroughs.  Here are some great pictures contributed to us via Flickr (tagged &quot;gothamist&quot; on Flickr or added to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126084245/http://www.flickr.com/groups/gothamist/pool">Gothamist Flickr Photo Pool</a>), and we&apos;ve also included some interesting facts below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Geoffrey Mutai, the men&apos;s champion who set a course record in 2:05:06, had set a marathon world record earlier this year by running the Boston Marathon in 2:03:02, but since Boston&apos;s course is downhill, the record wouldn&apos;t stand.  Also, the NY Times reports, &quot;For 10 years, Mutai has been his own coach. In 2004, he made a painful decision when he was not winning enough to afford treatment for a leg injury. He went to work cutting trees for Kenya Power, the nation&#x2019;s utility company.&quot;
</li><li>Runner&apos;s World calls women&apos;s champ Firewihot Dado &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126084245/http://newyorkmarathon.runnersworld.com/2011/11/dado-sneaks-under-the-radar%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8.html">the overlooked, the uncelebrated, the almost invisible</a>.&quot;  Not much is known about her, except she did win the Rome Marathon in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
</li><li>This year, the Marathon added 74th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues, in Bay Ridge  to its route.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126084245/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/sports/marathon-thrills-take-detour-through-a-sleepy-block-in-bay-ridge.html?_r=1">According to the Times,</a> &quot;To make sure every racer completes a full 26 miles 385 yards, organizers added a loop through 74th Street.&quot;
</li><li>A 26-year-old man was in critical condition after collapsing at the 22 Mile marker in Harlem. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126084245/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/marathon_runner_suffers_heart_attack_cDtZB34B1B7MswXsMR3mBK">According to the Post</a>, a witness said, &quot;He fell on his face on Fifth Avenue [near 117th], he just dropped like he was was shot. [Emergency crews] worked on him on Fifth [Avenue] while hundreds of runners passed him.&quot; Another witness said, &#x201C;When the runner was on the ground, he looked bad. He was blue in the face. He did not look good.&quot; 
</li><li>Rangers legend Mark Messier was running in the marathon to raise money for his charities, but after completing the race in 4:14:21, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126084245/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/harder-hockey-rangers-great-mark-messier-seeks-med-aid-york-city-marathon-sunday-article-1.973050?localLinksEnabled=false&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29">he needed to be taken away in a wheelchair</a>. He&apos;s okay though! Other celebrities who ran were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126084245/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/christy_hits_the_runway_GWFvwIgrwrqN7rhhrClTTO">Christy Turlington</a>, Apolo Anton Ohno, and Jennie Finch.
</li><li>Health Commissioner Tom Farley ran the marathon in 3:25:43.</li></ul>
