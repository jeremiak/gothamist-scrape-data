<p>Sharing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011257/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/photos_videos_protesters_block_traf.php">same outrage that many felt</a> after an NYPD officer was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011257/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/eric_garner_grand_jury.php">not indicted for choking Eric Garner</a> to death, a disgusted Jon Stewart appeared on The Daily Show last night. He said, &quot;I honestly don&apos;t know what to say. If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more fucking time.  But I would really settle for less fucking tragedy to be honest with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart continued, &quot;We are definitely not living in a post-racial society, and I can imagine there are a lot of people out there wondering how much of a society we&apos;re living in at all. I don&apos;t know what to say. It just happened, so I have not had a chance to digest it.&quot;</p>

<p>He also pointed out there&apos;s video with Garner&apos;s death, whereas with Michael Brown&apos;s death in Ferguson, Missouri, there were conflicting witness accounts and forensics, &quot;None of the ambiguities of the Ferguson case exist here in the Staten Island case... the guy&apos;s not acting threatening, and we know that not through witness testimony, unreliable bystanders, but because <strong>we are fucking watching it</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011257/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">Eric Garner was killed</a> in July when police officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold on Staten Island. A group of police officers had approached Garner, who was unarmed, because he was suspected of selling loose cigarettes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011257/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486">A video showed Garner arguing</a> with the police, swatting their hands away and saying, &quot;Don&#x2019;t touch me, please.&quot; </p>

<p>Pantaleo put him in a chokehold while other officers struggled to pull him to the ground and get his arms behind his back. Garner, an asthmatic, can be heard repeatedly saying, &quot;I can&apos;t breathe.&quot; The Medical Examiner&apos;s office later determined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011257/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/eric_garners_death_ruled_a_homicide.php">Garner&apos;s death was a homicide</a>.</p>

<p>Stewart ended the segment with a loud, &quot;FUCKKKKKK!&quot;</p>
