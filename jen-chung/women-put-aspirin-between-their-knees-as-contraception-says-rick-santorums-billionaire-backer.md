<p>There&apos;s not much more to say about this than &quot;WOW.&quot; And &quot;WTF.&quot;  Rick Santorum&apos;s billionaire backer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210347/http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2012/02/15/what-is-foster-friess-worth/">Foster Friess</a> was on Andrea Mitchell&apos;s MSNBC program complained about the focus on the birth control mandate, &quot;Here we have millions of our fellow Americans unemployed. We have jihadist camps being set up in Latin America, which Rick has been warning about, and people seem to be so preoccupied with sex. I think it says something about our culture. We maybe need a massive therapy session so we can concentrate on what the real issues are... On this contraceptive thing, my Gosh it&#x2019;s such [sic] inexpensive. <strong>You know, back in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraception. The gals put it between their knees, and it wasn&#x2019;t that costly.</strong>&quot; (<b>UPDATE, 2/17</b>: Wait, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210347/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/17/aspirin_contraception_billionaire_e.php">he&apos;s joking</a>?)</p>

<p>Mitchell was a little startled: According to Politico, she paused for a while and then said, &quot;Excuse me, I&#x2019;m just trying to catch my breath from that, Mr. Friess, frankly... Let&#x2019;s change the subject.&#x201D; (She later asked her Twitter followers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210347/https://twitter.com/#!/mitchellreports/status/170223300239306752">how she should have handled it!</a>)</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: Hours later, Friess <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217210347/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/17/aspirin_contraception_billionaire_e.php">tried to explain that it was all a joke</a>! Hardy har har? <br>
