Apparently the opening of Saw V at the AMC Empire 25 on 42nd Street had something to do with it: &quot;Tension built after swarms of teens and young adults were trying to exit and enter theaters, including disappointed groups who couldn&apos;t get into sold-out shows.&quot;  A police source called it &quot;a tinderbox&quot; and a witness described, <strong>&quot;It seemed like hundreds of kids, roaming around in packs, screaming, yelling, running through the streets like wild animals.</strong>&quot; One of the victims, stabbed in the neck, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135932/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10262008/news/regionalnews/tragic_stab_guy_135391.htm">left partially paralyzed</a>.
