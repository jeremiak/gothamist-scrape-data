But Nikolai Rakossi&apos;s sister claims he&apos;s remorseful&#x2014;and even thinks he&apos;s dead&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091832/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/chilling_call_by_russian_killer_zFPYDAZLo74H3z6HJ2X96J">telling the Post</a>, &quot;He was in tears. He told me: &apos;Please don&apos;t keep any offense in your heart about me. Forgive me. You will never see me again.&apos;<p></p>

<p>Tatyana Prikhodko, 56, and her daughter Larisa Prikhodko, 28, were both stabbed repeatedly in the face and torso in Tatyana and Nikolai&apos;s Sheepshead Bay apartment.  Larisa lived in another apartment three floors below and it&apos;s believed that the daughter may have walked in on her mother&apos;s murder because her body was found near the front door. Surveillance video showed Rakossi leaving the apartment building with two suitcases, and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091832/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/international_manhunt_for_russian_m.php">left JFK Airport on a one-way ticket to Moscow</a>.  The NYPD, incidentally, hasn&apos;t formally named him as a suspect.</p>

<p>Rakossi&apos;s sister Lydia says, &quot;I don&apos;t think he is alive now, after what he told me.  Knowing him, I don&apos;t think he would be able to live with himself and carry the burden of having killed the person he loved more than himself, and her daughter. I think he would follow them to death very soon.&quot; But if he&apos;s not dead, she told the Post, &quot;If he is still alive and I see him, I will say to him: &apos;What have you done? What HAVE you done?&apos; No one can get away with this. I am going through pictures of him, looking at them, and I am crying, crying, crying.&quot;</p>

<p>As of last Thursday, when his mother and grandmother were buried, Larisa Prikhodko&apos;s son <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091832/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/21/2011-04-21_larisa_and_svetlana_prikhodko_motherdaughter_killed_in_double_homicide_laid_to_r.html">hadn&apos;t been told his mother is dead</a>.  His father (Larisa&apos;s former fiance who first reported her missing, leading to the cops&apos; discovery) told the Daily News at the time, &quot;He started asking a couple of days ago, but we&apos;re trying to avoid the subject as much as possible. I&apos;m still in shock. It&apos;s still not real to me. My only concern is to give my son the best I can give him under the circumstances.&quot;</p>
