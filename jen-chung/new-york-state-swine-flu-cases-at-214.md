If you&apos;re really curious about where the cases are by county, here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508004544/http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/communicable/influenza/h1n1/docs/state_h1n1_cases_by_county.pdf">PDF</a>.  The NYC Health Department emphasizes, &quot;<strong>To date, nearly all confirmed and probable cases have been mild, and all of the affected people have recovered or are recovering. No deaths have been associated with the illness in New York City</strong>,&quot; and adds that everyone should practice good hygiene (cover your sneezes! wash your hands!).  Globally, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508004544/http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_05_14/en/index.html">WHO says</a> &quot;33 countries have officially reported 6497 cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection,&quot; with a total of 65 deaths (60 in Mexico, three in the U.S., one in Canada and one in Costa Rica).  </p>
