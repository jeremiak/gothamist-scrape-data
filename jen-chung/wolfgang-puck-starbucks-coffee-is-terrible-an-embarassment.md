										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2011_11_wolfgang.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025033633im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_wolfgang.jpg" width="300" height="232"> <br> <i>Would Wolfgang serve something from Wolfgang Puck Express to Padma Lakshmi?</i></div> Celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck may have numerous restaurants steps away from Starbucks locations at airports, but don&apos;t think he likes the java joint&apos;s offerings. <p></p>

<p>Puck, who has his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025033633/http://www.wpcoffee.com/">line of coffee</a> and is launching an iced coffee drink, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025033633/http://houston.culturemap.com/newsdetail/11-27-11-wolfgang-puck-explains-why-starbucks-sucks-tells-a-what-she-said-joke-and-remembers-his-houston-days/">told Culturemap</a>,  &quot;Starbucks, what they make, if you open a bottle and smell it, what did they do to the coffee? They created a taste in the memory for people, which is interesting, so that people really think it&apos;s good coffee. But it&apos;s terrible coffee!&quot;</p>

<p>He continued, &quot;Like when I fly on United Airlines they say, &apos;We proudly serve Starbucks coffee.&apos; I said they should say, &apos;We are embarrassed to serve Starbucks coffee.&apos;&quot;  But is he embarrassed<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025033633/http://www.yelp.com/biz/wolfgang-puck-express-chicago#hrid:kV66-dj0p1AIH39O_5rdkA"> about this review of the Wolfgang Puck Express at O&apos;Hare Airport</a>: &quot;Sure, we all love that little Austrian dynamo with his charming accent but it&apos;s not like he&apos;s personally preparing your turkey club sandwich that&apos;s wrapped in cellophane and forlornly awaiting your reach on a refrigerated shelf in Chicago&apos;s O&apos;Hare International Airport. But for 10$, he probably should be. I&apos;ve had better sandwiches from a bodega policed by a fat, flea ridden cat napping on top of a stack of plantains for one fifth the price.&quot;</p>

<p>Starbucks is launching a &quot;blonde roast&quot; in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025033633/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/starbucks_tries_desperately_to_make.php">apparent attempt to rid itself of the &quot;Charbucks&quot; nickname</a>.</p>
