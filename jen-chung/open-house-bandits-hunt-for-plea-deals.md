<p>Previously, one of their lawyers had said they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307101613/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/27/real.php">would be pleading not guilty</a>, but half of the &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; pair (they would both go to open houses, and one would distract the agent while the other stole items) Jennifer Jones is &quot;going to plead guilty to a felony and misdemeanor in a no-jail deal,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307101613/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/06/16/2008-06-16_2_seek_plea_in_apartment_hunt_scam.html">per the Daily News</a>.  The other half, Jessica Joyner, is expected to work out a plea deal as well. </p>

<p>Jones&apos; lawyer Jeremy Saland added that the misdemeanor can be dropped from her record &quot;if she stays out of trouble for a year.&quot;  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307101613/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06172008/news/regionalnews/thelma_thiefs_therapy_115885.htm">told the Post</a>, &quot;We provided very compelling reasons, and we worked tirelessly so the prosecution could see that this is not a black-and-white case.&quot;  And the pair are also working on restitution.</p>

<p>The pair have been described as being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307101613/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/29/open_house_band_1.php">belligerent, polite and hard-edged</a>.  They are also accused of stealing $75,000 worth of goods from an open house in NJ.  </p>
