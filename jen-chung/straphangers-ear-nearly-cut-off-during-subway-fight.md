<p>A 35-year-old man needed surgery to reattach part of his ear after he was slashed during an altercation at a Manhattan subway station last night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205125845/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/12/01/6-train-slashing/">A witness said he saw</a> &quot;[b]lood all over... I knew his ear was like leaking, halfway off.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the 110th Street and Lexington Avenue 6 train station just before 8:40 p.m. The 35-year-old victim and another man, 59, were on a northbound train when the older man got into an argument with a male stranger, who was angry the older man &quot;made contact&quot; with his leg, an NYPD spokesperson said.</p>

Then they bumped into each other.&quot;</p>

<p>After the verbal argument, the 35-year-old and 59-year-old exited the train, followed by the angry passenger and another male. Both victims were reportedly pepper-sprayed, while the 59-year-old was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205125845/http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/man-loses-part-of-ear-in-bloody-subway-attack/">&quot;repeatedly punched&quot;</a> and the 35-year-old was slashed in the face. </p>

<p>&quot;The earlobe was kind of hanging off, it was bleeding a lot, he looked dazed to me,&quot; another witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205125845/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/east-harlem-assailant-slices-subway-rider-ear-mta-platform-article-1.2895300">told the Daily News.</a> &quot;It was pretty disgusting &#x2014; I never seen an earlobe hang off like that. It looked like he needed to go to the hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>The two victims were taken to Metropolitan Hospital and police say they have been released. Other straphangers reportedly tried to prevent the suspects from leaving the station after the fight, but they fled and remain at large.</p>
