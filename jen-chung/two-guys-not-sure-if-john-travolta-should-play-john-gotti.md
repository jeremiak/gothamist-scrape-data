                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_04_johnnyt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_johnnyt.jpg" width="640" height="426" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Various <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://laist.com/tags/johntravolta">allegations of misbehavior with masseurs</a> are swirling around John Travolta.  So the Daily News decided to ask Victoria Gotti, John Gotti&apos;s widow, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/atlanta-masseur-suing-john-travolta-weighs-arbitration-public-trial-article-1.1077956">what she thinks</a>, since Travolta may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/john_travolta_to_play_teflon_don_go.php">playing the Teflon Don</a>. To which she said, &quot;What difference does it make if he were gay?  Who the f--k really cares? Does it make him less of a beautiful human being? No.... Leave him the f--k alone. Whatever the true story is, leave him with his dignity.  In the grand scheme of things, it really does not matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Travolta does, apparently, have a personal connection with Victoria Gotti, since he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/23/john_travolta_kisses_victoria_gotti.php">visited her to get her blessing</a> on the on-off film project. However, some resident in Ozone Park&#x2014;where Gotti ran his empire&#x2014;were not so gracious.  Frank Gallano told the News, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think he should have been cast to play Gotti. And with this sexual scandal, it&#x2019;s not helping. He&#x2019;s not right for the part,&quot; while John Sendeny said, &quot;John Gotti is a tough guy. Everybody who grew up here knows that.&quot; Come on, didn&apos;t they see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113161/">Get Shorty</a>?  Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/">Pulp Fiction</a>? Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427327/">Hairspray</a>? Oh.</p>

<p>Concerns about Travolta playing the outsized mob figure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/gotti_associate_doesnt_think_john_t.php">are nothing new</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/13/john_gotti_jr_wont_face_a_fifth_tri.php">John Gotti Jr.</a>, though, believes in Travolta and his lawyer said, &quot;If there&#x2019;s anybody in this world who knows that people make false accusations against someone for their own benefit, it&#x2019;s John [Gotti Jr.].&quot;  Indeed&#x2014;the first masseur who accused Travolta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115082750/http://www.eonline.com/news/john_travoltas_original_masseur_accuser/316386">just dropped the charges</a>.  Remember the words of the Bee Gee&apos;s: &quot;Well you can tell by the way I use my walk / I&apos;m a woman&apos;s man; no time to talk.&quot;</p>
