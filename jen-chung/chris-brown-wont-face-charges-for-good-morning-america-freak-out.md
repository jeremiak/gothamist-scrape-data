<p>Brown was appearing Good Morning America to promote his new album F.A.M.E., was upset that host Robin Roberts asked about his ex-girlfriend, Rihanna, whom he beat (he pleaded to felony assault) in 2009.  After the interview, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145020/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/chris_brown_has_meltdown_at_good_mo.php">stormed off the set</a>, repeatedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145020/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/raging_chris_buster_brown_x81W47sgSNW7XWJJouORfK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">said &quot;it wasn&apos;t cool,&quot;</a> allegedly smashed a window&lt;, left the studio shirtless and angrily Tweeted, &quot;I&apos;m so over people bringing this past s--t up!!!

<p>Roberts brought up the incident this morning, &quot;We wish him the absolute best... We&apos;ve extended the invitation to him and I sure hope that he takes us up on it, because we&apos;d love to have another chat with him.&quot; (ABC News says that Brown is &quot;seriously considering&quot; the offer.)  Roberts also emphasized that she didn&apos;t surprise Brown with the Rihanna-related questions, &quot;Anytime we have a guest here on the program, we let them know ahead of time the subject matter, the topics that we&apos;re going to discuss and we, even right before the interview, I said that to Chris and I was shocked like everybody else was.&quot;</p>

<p>Brown seems to have shaken off the incident&#x2014;he was playing pickup basketball at the West 4th courts and apparently had a great album release party at Webster Hall with Lloyd Banks, Bow Wow and Waka Flocka! Oh, and he was paid $40,000 to show up.</p>
