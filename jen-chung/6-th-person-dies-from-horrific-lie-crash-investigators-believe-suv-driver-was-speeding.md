Suffolk police chief of detectives<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015817/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/fatal-lie-crash-claims-6th-victim-officials-say-1.12209385?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed"> Gerard Gigante said</a>, &quot;All indications are that he was going above the speed limit; he was speeding.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The crash occurred around 9:35 a.m. on Sunday, near Exit 68 on the LIE. Carmelo Pinales, 26, was driving east in the Subaru Outback. There was some construction work being done on the road, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015817/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/fatal-lie-crash-claims-6th-victim-officials-say-1.12209385?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed">Gigante told reporters</a>, &quot;It looks like traffic may have slowed.... It appears he came up fast on a vehicle in the left lane and he moved to the left in an effort to avoid that vehicle, and when he did that, he ran up on the shoulder and continued going across the grassy median and lost control of the car.&quot;</p>

<p>The Subaru hit two other cars, a Honda and a BMW in the westbound lanes. Pinales was killed, as was his sister Patricia Pinales, 27, and son Christopher, 10. Patricia Pinales&apos;s three-year-old daughter and another passenger, Winnifer Garcia, 21, were injured. They were headed to a water park in Riverhead to celebrate Christopher&apos;s birthday.</p>

<p>The Honda&apos;s driver, Scott Martella, 29, was killed while his fiancee, Shelbi Thurau, 29, was injured. Two passengers in the BMW died: Isidore Adelson, 81, died on Sunday night and his wife, Helen Adelson, 71, died yesterday. The BMW&apos;s driver, Marvin Tenzer, 73, and passenger Sandra Tenzer, 69,were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries. The two couples were headed to NJ for a wedding.</p>

<p>Gigante described the part of the LIE where the crash occurred: &quot;There are two strips of that road that have been torn up and replaced in the section with metal plates, and bound up on the edges with blacktop. There&#x2019;s a slight rise in the road, over the bridge, to smooth out the plate. If you&#x2019;re going on it at a high rate of speed, it could be a contributing factor.&quot;</p>

<p>A source told WCBS 2 that Pinales <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015817/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/22/police-investigating-whether-speed-was-factor-in-deadly-lie-crash/">may have been going 100 mph</a>. However, Pinales&apos;s family says that an oil spill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015817/http://abc7ny.com/traffic/6th-person-dies-in-multi-vehicle-crash-on-lie/1479034/">may have contributed to collision</a>.</p>

<p>The Suffolk County police said the oil spill didn&apos;t play a part, and a local fire department chief said the oil spill was in a different area, and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015817/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/fatal-lie-crash-claims-6th-victim-officials-say-1.12209385">&quot;cleaned up with a &apos;speed dry&apos; agent.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Other relatives say that it was raining&#x2014;sharing a Snapchat video showing the windshield wipers being used before the crash. But police say witnesses saw the Subaru speeding. Motorist Nicole Levasseur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015817/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/nyregion/ex-cuomo-aide-is-among-dead-in-long-island-car-crash.html">told the NY Times she let the Outback pass</a> her after seeing it was right behind her, and when her passenger, Cody Webster, &quot;looked up, the vehicle was far ahead.&quot; Webster said, &quot;They were like two football fields ahead of us in, like, a matter of seconds. They were flying.&quot;</p>

<p>When they next saw the Subaru, the collision had already happened; police said, &quot;The engine of the Outback was thrown several hundred feet into the woods. The car is pretty much destroyed. It&#x2019;s broken up into numerous pieces.&quot;</p>

<p>The Pinales family is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015817/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sixth-victim-dies-crash-ong-island-expressway-article-1.2761511">asking for help with funeral expenses</a>. </p>
