Now it&apos;s unclear whether that was the case.<p></p>

<p>Police suspect the victim, described as being in her 30s and wearing &quot;leather pants&quot; and high-heeled boots, was clubbing. While it was initially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104620/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-fatally-struck-1-subway-train-article-1.1310106?localLinksEnabled=false">suggested she had been struck hours before</a> she was discovered at 1 p.m., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104620/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/high_heel_corpse_on_the_tracks_K2Cw7T0q8jMftTB2sXlx3H?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">the Post reports</a>, &quot;Cops said she might have accidentally tumbled onto the tracks. It wasn&#x2019;t clear whether she was struck by a train. She had a head wound, but her body did not show obvious signs of trauma from being hit by a train, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Post, the woman &quot;had last been seen at McKenna&#x2019;s Pub on West 14th Street hours earlier... After leaving the bar, the woman used her MetroCard to hop on a No. 1 train at 14th Street and Seventh Avenue at around 1:40 a.m., sources said.&quot; Additionally, cops didn&apos;t find any ID or a cellphone on the woman and her body was supposedly &quot;covered in soot&quot;.</p>
