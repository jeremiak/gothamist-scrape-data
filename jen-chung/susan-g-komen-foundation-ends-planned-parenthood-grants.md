<p>The Susan G. Komen Foundation, the breast cancer charity that attracts hundreds of thousands through its Race for the Cure events, has halted its grants to Planned Parenthood.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318050209/http://www.npr.org/2012/01/31/146160911/susan-g-komen-halts-grants-to-planned-parenthood">AP reports</a>, &quot;<strong>The change will mean a cutoff of hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants, mainly for breast exams</strong>. Planned Parenthood says the move results from Komen bowing to pressure from anti-abortion activists.&quot;</p>

<p>The AP further explains, &quot;Komen spokeswoman Leslie Aun said the cutoff results from the charity&apos;s newly adopted criteria barring grants to organizations that are under investigation by local, state or federal authorities. According to Komen, this applies to Planned Parenthood because it&apos;s the focus of an inquiry launched by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., seeking to determine whether public money was improperly spent on abortions.&quot;  Of course, that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318050209/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/27/planned-parenthood-investigation-government-resources_n_984002.html">inquiry is politically motivated</a>, after the House unsuccessfully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318050209/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/19/house_passes_budget_cuts_including.php">tried to get Planned Parenthood defunded</a>.</p>

<p>According to Planned Parenthood, the grants were $680,000 in 2011 and $580,000 in 2010, &quot;going to at least 19 of its affiliates for breast-cancer screening and other breast-health services.&quot; The group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318050209/http://twitter.com/#!/PPact/status/164464872418050048">also Tweeted</a>, &quot;In 5 years, support from Susan G. Komen allowed PP health centers to provide nearly 170,000 breast exams &amp; 6,400 mammogram referrals.&quot;  Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said, &quot;It&apos;s hard to understand how an organization with whom we share a mission of saving women&apos;s lives could have bowed to this kind of bullying. It&apos;s really hurtful.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318050209/http://web.archive.org/web/20100921093610/http:/blog.karenhandel.com/2010/07/karen-handel-on-life-and-planned-parenthood/">Washington Post&apos;s Sarah Kliff writes</a>, &quot;In some ways, the Komen decision isn&#x2019;t particularly surprising. The group has been under pressure from anti-abortion rights groups not to fund Planned Parenthood. It also hired a vice president last year who had previously advocated for the group&#x2019;s defunding in her run for Georgia governor. With a congressional investigation underway, Komen pulled its support. And when private institutions move to cut off Planned Parenthood&#x2019;s funding there&#x2019;s not much Democrats can do.The only possible backstop here might be pressure from Planned Parenthood supporters pushing back in the opposite direction.&quot;  As Salon&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318050209/https://twitter.com/#!/joanwalsh/status/164470604383260672">Joan Walsh Tweeted</a>, &quot;The Komen Foundation just destroyed its brand, and it&apos;s going to be very, very sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Planned Parenthood has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318050209/http://twitter.com/#!/PPact/status/164476696605638656">appealed for donations via Twitter</a>, &quot;We&apos;re taking steps to offset these funds so PP breast health programs stay strong &amp; accessible.
