<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_02_fedez20.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602131122im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_fedez20.jpg" width="426" height="453" class="image-right"> </span>The police are asking the public for help in finding the man who they say committed a home invasion on Staten Island and shot the home owner&apos;s dog in the process.  And that dog happens to be Kilo, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602131122/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/hero_hound_takes_bullet_in_the_head.php">12-year-old pit bull who survived his injuries</a>!</p>

<p>As we know, Justin Becker was at home at 20 Lambert Street when a man dressed as a FedEx deliveryman forced his way into his apartment.  Becker was able to throw the attacker to the ground, and the assailant was trapped halfway inside the apartment when Kilo came at him: &#x201C;My dog stuck his head out the door, and then [the thug] shot him in the head,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602131122/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/it_super_dog_xOTUdSg88IDfYBmzrD5N3H">Becker told the Post</a>. The robber ran for it while Kilo, a 12-year-old pit bull, lay bleeding.  Luckily, the bullet had ricocheted off of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602131122/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/hero_hound_takes_bullet_in_the_head.php">adorable Kilo</a>&apos;s skull, and exited through his neck. And doctors don&apos;t think he even suffered any injuries to the brain.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a black male around 40-45 years old with a scruffy beard. <br>
