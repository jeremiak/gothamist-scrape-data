Apparently a letter contained a white granular substance, and the lobby was closed as a precaution.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001432/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/police-investigation-closes-times-lobby/">CityRoom explains</a> that a letter had been sent to Andrew Rosenthal, the Times&apos; editorial page editor: &quot;The 13th floor, where the envelope was opened, was evacuated for several hours, but around 2:15 p.m. employees on that floor were permitted to return to their offices... Mr. Rosenthal&#x2019;s executive secretary opened the envelope, and she and two other Times employees, including a mailroom worker, were being decontaminated as a precaution.  <span class="photo_caption">Photo: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508001432/http://flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2259318046/">wallyg</a></span></p>
