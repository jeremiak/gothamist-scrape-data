The former ESPN anchor-turned-vocal libtard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/21/keith_olbermann_announces_today_is.php">left MSNBC in January</a> and announced his move to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/26/keith_olbermann_announces_new_show.php">Al Gore&apos;s network in April</a>.  His show is pretty<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://www.thr.com/"> much the same as before</a>, if only on a different channel, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/arts/television/keith-olbermann-is-back-and-still-mad-as-hell-the-tv-watch.html">he&apos;s still &quot;madder than hell.&quot;</a> His first &quot;Worst Persons In The World&quot; segment featured everyone&apos;s favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/video_very_well_educated_person_mak.php">&quot;very well-educated&quot; Metro-North rider, Hermon Raju</a> (see video below), but to some MSNBC viewers, Olbermann is a Worst Person for running four minutes in the 9 p.m. Rachel Maddow hour!</p>

<p>Olbermann <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://twitter.com/#!/KeithOlbermann">has been furiously Tweeting</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/keith-olbermanns-current-tv-debut-203570">other Twitterers who complained</a> about Olbermann&apos;s show going over. He noted MSNBC&apos;s own tactics to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://twitter.com/#!/KeithOlbermann/status/83030384211787778">ensure its audience was tuning in</a> and pointed out that he doesn&apos;t hate Maddow and reminds everyone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140706/http://twitter.com/#!/KeithOlbermann/status/83032200806797312">that he was her champion</a>, &quot;By your logic, I should never have pushed for her to get that show just in case she did well or I went elsewhere!&quot;</p>
