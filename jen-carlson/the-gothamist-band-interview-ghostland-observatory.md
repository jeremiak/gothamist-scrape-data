It took us a while to actually listen to it, but once we did we were equally enchanted and amazed by this duo. Undoubtedly influenced by the likes of Daft Punk, Bowie and LCD, Ghostland offers up their own brand of electro-dance soul rock. It&apos;s as if a piece of every musical genre of the past and present were blended together to create a keyboard. A keyboard that could only be used by this one band. We dare you to listen and <em>not</em> dance. <br>
<strong>Ghostland Observatory</strong> are <strong>Aaron Behrens</strong> and <strong>Thomas Turner</strong>, and you aren&apos;t going to believe how much noise two people can make until you see them tonight at Movable Hype. Details after the interview. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate? </strong><br>
Aaron&apos;s brain is filled with ghostly sonatas and astral observations, so through thought they mixed and mingled in the strangest of fashions.  </p>

<p><strong>Have you ever been to NYC? If so, any favorite/least favorite memories? If not, what are your thoughts and expectations?</strong><br>
BOTH IN UNISON - Never been. No expectations, just excited &quot;laid back entertainer vibe&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any New York-centric books, movies, song lyrics that you associate strongly with your idea of this city? </strong><br>
BOTH IN UNISON -&quot;I&apos;m going back to New York City I do believe I&apos;ve had enough&quot; Bob Dylan</p>

<p><strong>Describe the music scene in Austin? </strong><br>
Aaron - Like a mother giving birth, Beautiful yet still a struggle (cheesy grin)<br>
Thomas - The clowns are after us!</p>
