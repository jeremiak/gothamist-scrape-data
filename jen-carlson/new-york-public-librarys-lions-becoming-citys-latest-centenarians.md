<p>Patience and Fortitude, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140323110316/http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/library-lions">the two lions</a> guarding the New York Public Library (you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140323110316/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYjFKsJjCP0">from ghosts</a>), are turning 100 years old soon, and they&apos;ll be celebrating with a gala. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140323110316/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/in-honor-of-a-century-of-patience-and-fortitude/?smid=tw-nytimesmetro&amp;seid=auto">the NY Times</a>&#x2014;who note they are 99 years 11 months and 2 days old today&#x2014;the lions were not well received when they first arrived on 5th Avenue, so they&apos;re lucky they made it this long. New Yorkers originally hated the now iconic duo, calling them &quot;squash-faced, mealy-mouthed and complacent,&quot; and one man wrote a letter declaring: &quot;We do not want square-jawed lions.&quot; </p>

<p>Today&apos;s NIMBYs are certainly saluting the curmudgeons of the past for calling the lions &quot;monstrosities,&quot; and eventually getting their &quot;too hairy&quot; manes trimmed. But despite the outcries, the lions got to stay... after all, they cost a whopping $13,000 a piece (that&apos;s about $300,000 today). </p>

<p>If you stop by to say &quot;Happy Birthday,&quot; leave the party hats at home&#x2014;decorating the lions had to stop as it was damaging. And remember that Patience is on the south side (the left as you face the main entrance) and Fortitude on the north. You can learn more about the &quot;Top Cats&quot; history in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140323110316/http://www.nypl.org/node/29523">this book</a>.</p>
