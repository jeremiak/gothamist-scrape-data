<span class="photo_caption">The statue: then and now</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150803/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/31/is_this_statue_an_eyesore.php">banished-to-Queens statue</a> that&apos;s been dubbed an eyesore <em>and</em> sexist is back in the news today. Apparently Rep. Anthony Weiner wants the city to sell the statue on Craigslist! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150803/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_pols_say_selling_sexist_statue_on_craigslist_would_be_a_civic_virtue.html#ixzz1EzJyFQFr">the Daily News</a>, the decaying statue, which depicts a naked man stepping on two women (sirens!), could better serve the community by earning it some cash.</p>

<p>While Weiner has City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras on his side (she wants to sell it to raise funds), not all locals want to see the over 100-year-old statue&#x2014;called Triumph of Civic Virtue&#x2014;get evicted. A member of the Community Board 9 in Queens says, &quot;It&apos;s been one of the board&apos;s top priorities for years to have that statue restored. We&apos;re not looking to destroy art.&quot;</p>

<p>The statue was originally outside of City Hall, but allegedly moved to Queens after Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia complained about being &quot;mooned&quot; every time he walked out of the building. It now overlooks Union Turnpike and Queens Boulevard in Kew Gardens, Queens. More on the history of the statue can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150803/http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2011/02/fate-of-frederick-macmonniess-civic.html">here</a>.</p>
