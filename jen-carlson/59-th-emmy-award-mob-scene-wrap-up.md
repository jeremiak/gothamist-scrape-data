<p>Last night the 59th Annual Emmy Awards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175715/http://emmys.org/awards/2007pt/primetime_wrap.php">took place on the left coast</a>, but New Yorkers made out very well. New York productions/creative types that took home the gold: <em>Late Night with Conan O&apos;Brien</em> (writing), <em>The Daily Show</em> (variety-comedy show series), <em>30 Rock</em> (best comedy), and Dick Wolf (for producing <em>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</em>).  In the would-have-been arena, America Ferrera won best actress in a comedy, <em>Ugly Betty</em>, which was originally supposed to shoot in the Big Apple but shoots in L.A. because it&apos;s cheaper.  We&apos;ll also count Rob Marshall, who won for directing the Best Variety-Musical Special, <em>Tony Bennett: An American Classic</em>, since he has Broadway roots.</p>

<p>And of course, <em>The Sopranos</em> (who since its first season in 1999 has racked up 111 nominations and 21 Emmys) won for writing (for the season finale), directing and best TV drama.  There were a number of references to the show during the evening, from the monologue to the long, drawn-out &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; medley with Sopranos clips, which made the mob drama&apos;s win at the end of the night feel anti-climactic.  Creator David Chase ended his Best Drama speech with, &#x201C;In essence, this is a story about a gangster, and gangsters are out there taking their kids to college and taking their kids to school and outing food on the table, and, hell, let&#x2019;s face it, if this world and this nation were run by gangsters &#x2014; maybe it is.&#x201D;  Uh, maybe, maybe not.</p>

Actually, that was at least the third time that there was a cutaway to a bizarre overhead shot during the show, which touted its special &quot;theater-in-the-round&quot; set-up that left some stars grousing.  Host Ryan Seacrest&apos;s minimal monologue and audience interactions were painful - we really wanted Simon Cowell to appear and take control of the show.  </p>

<p>The other highlights:  Lewis Black&apos;s rant against TV executives; Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Steve Carell had a Daily Show reunion when Stewart and Colbert decided to give the Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series to Steve Carrell when actual winner Ricky Gervais was not present; numerous references to Charlie Sheen&apos;s bad boy persona; Rainn Wilson asking Kanye West to stand closer; the cast of <em>Roots</em> appearing; and Tina Fey&apos;s Best Comedy acceptance speech.</p>

<p>The other lowlights:   The Emmys producers stacking the most famous deaths towards the end of the Reaper Reel; Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert&apos;s bit before making Steve Carell coming onstage; making Masi Oka use a laptop to chat with MySpace&apos;s Tom Anderson, who presented the interactive Emmy; and lots of other moments.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175715/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/17/arts/television/17emmys-list.html">list of all the winners</a>.<br>
