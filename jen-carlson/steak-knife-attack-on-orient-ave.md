										<p>Are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044009/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/29/eternal_sunshine_house_evicts_squat.php">evicted squatters</a> of Orient Avenue lashing out? One local wrote in to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044009/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2008/10/steak_knived_on.html">FreeWilliamsburg</a> to describe their terrifying experience on the street (where parts of <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> were filmed, and where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044009/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/14/gondry.php">Michel Gondry</a> himself just moved). She reports back: &quot;On Thursday evening at 7:30 pm I was walking home along Orient Ave., listening to my iPod, when I was approached by a guy with a steak knife in his hand. He demanded my bag, yanked it from me, and started to leave. <strong>When he was a few steps away I panicked and began screaming...He turned back around and proceeded to stab me</strong> once in the chest - perforating a lung - and once in the arm. Luckily for me the blade broke and was left hanging out of my arm. I think that he would have continued attacking me if this had not happened.&quot; Luckily, her neighbors came out and helped her stay awake until the ambulance arrived, but her attacker is still out there. She described the man as &quot;age 20-22, biracial, approx 6ft and 170lbs, wearing a Mets hat.&quot;</p>
