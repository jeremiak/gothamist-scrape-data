<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164520/http://gothamist.com/tags/sesamestreet"><em>Sesame Street</em></a> has relocated to HBO land, which means it&apos;s now under the same umbrella as the much more adult television program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164520/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a>. Thanks to Jimmy Kimmel, the two have not briefly become one, as he presented the below mashup last night. Click play and listen to the words of Hannah Horvath and Elijah Krantz come out of the mouths of Abby Cadabby and Elmo, where they soooo do not belong. </p>

<p>May this never happen again.</p>
