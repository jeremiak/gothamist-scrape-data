<p>Sister Hazel was founded in Florida in 1993, spending years in waiting and training until they would eventually swoop in with the rest of the pop acts whose saccharine, empty, movie soundtrack hits took over the radio dials in the latter half of the &apos;90s. It was the death of grunge, and the rebirth of mediocrity in mainstream music. </p>

<p>It was in 1997 that Sister Hazel found success with their solid gold hit &quot;All For You&quot;&#x2014;at the time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093907/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_for_You_(Sister_Hazel_song)">it charted #11</a> on the Billboard Hot 100, and next year marks the 20th anniversary of the most successful thing this band will ever do. While you&apos;ve been going on with your life, experiencing new things and looking to the future while living in the present, Sister Hazel has been performing this song live, multiple times a year, for almost twenty years, because this is what we demand of Sister Hazel.</p>

<p>And they&apos;ll do it again, as this is their destiny, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093907/http://90sfest.com/#line-up__scroll">at &apos;90s Fest</a> this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093907/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/90sfest-september-10th-2016-tickets-25182007061">September 10th</a> on Governors Island (with your host Pauly Shore, and performances by Sugar Ray, Bone Thugs N Harmony, C&amp;C; Music Factory, and DJ Jazzy Jeff).</p>
