                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="OHNYBROCHURE.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002185951im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/OHNYBROCHURE.jpg" width="300" height="282" class="image-right"> </span>The 11th Annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002185951/http://ohny.org/">Open House New York</a> is officially taking reservations as of today&#x2014;the weekend-long event will be taking place October 12th and 13th. They&apos;ve provided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002185951/http://origin.library.constantcontact.com/download/get/file/1101367149143-949/2013_OHNY_EventGuide_Oct2.pdf">a PDF guide</a> of their offerings this year, which will also be available at distribution sites in all the boroughs (sites can be found here). The guide starts out with a note about the federally-operated sites that were scheduled to be a part of the weekend, before the shutdown occurred. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;For OHNY, the most significant  impact of the shutdown is that the Weekend Information Hub is scheduled to be located at the Alexander Hamilton US Custom House/Smithsonian&#x2019;s National  Museum of the American Indian at Bowling Green, a federal museum  that will be closed until the federal government reopens. If the shutdown continues into next week, an announcement will be made about  a relocated Information Hub.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The spots this year include the Citi Bike Warehouse, Graham Hill&apos;s LifeEdited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002185951/http://www.treehugger.com/interior-design/touring-graham-hills-lifeedited-apartment.html">micro apartment</a> (seen below), and a canoe trip ... down the Gowanus Canal. Make your reservations before you get locked out!</p>
