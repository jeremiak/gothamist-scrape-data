<p>Every time I&apos;ve defended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103215/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/21/its_showtime_the_movie.php">the showtime dancers</a> here, I&apos;ve been countered with hundreds of negative comments about these kids who perform on the city&apos;s subway cars. There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103215/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/07/its_showtime_in_forest.php">a few</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103215/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/21/its_showtime_the_movie.php">videos</a> (and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103215/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/29/two_showtime_dancers_give_us_the_lo.php">documentaries</a>) that have scratched the surface of who these performers are, but this short documentary&#x2014;called <em>We Live This</em>&#x2014;is hands down the most humanizing portrait yet. </p>

<p>Focusing on four young men, the film&#x2014;which has won a number of awards on the festival circuit&#x2014;lets them tell their own stories regarding why they are underground. One, who explains he is homeless, says: &quot;As I dance on the train, I think about where I&apos;m sleeping that night. Who should I call? Who&apos;s going to pick up? People have their own problems... their own lives.&quot; Another describes what they are doing as &quot;panhandling,&quot; noting, &quot;I&apos;m begging without words... I&apos;m begging with a smile, not begging with a frown.&quot;</p>

<p>The film&apos;s director, James Burns, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103215/http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/06/we-live-this-showtime-subway-dancing-documentary/485774/">said</a> that he hopes people &quot;will watch this and look at these young men as human beings... And see the last vestiges of a culture that may be dying out.&#x201D; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103215/http://www.hayden5.com/project/we-live-this/">Hayden5</a>]</p>
