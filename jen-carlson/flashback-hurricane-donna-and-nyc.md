</div></div><p>While we may have dodged Hurricane Earl (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051423/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/03/hurricane_earl_weakens_downgraded_t.php">has now been</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051423/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/03/earl_to_the_east_sun_to_the_west.php">downgraded</a> to a Category 1), here&apos;s a look at what could have been! These photos are all from LIFE magazine, taken during 1960&apos;s Hurricane Donna (which was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051423/http://www.weather2000.com/NY_Hurricanes.html">Category 3</a>).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051423/http://www.livescience.com/environment/050601_hurricane_1938.html">Live Science</a>, Donna created an 11-foot storm tide in the New York Harbor that caused extensive pier damage and forced 300 families to evacuate Long Island. Still, not as bad as in 1893 when a category 1 hurricane destroyed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051423/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/hog_island.php">Hog Island</a> off the Rockaways!</p>
