</div></div>					<p>Even though it was gray and gloomy yesterday, Marty Markowitz was on the scene at the ceremonial opening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150411081654/http://history.amusement-parks.com/cyclonepage.htm">the Cyclone</a> and the annual &#x201C;Blessing of the Rides&#x201D; at Deno&#x2019;s Wonder Wheel Park. The Brooklyn Borough President, who broke a bottle of egg cream on the first Cyclone car to inaugurate the season, wasn&apos;t the only celebratory one on hand. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150411081654/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/29/2010-03-29_feels_like_first_time_cyclone_riders_cheer_opening_day.html">The Daily News</a> talked to two brothers who started camping out at 5 a.m. to get the first ride! </p>

<p>Did you know this is <em>a thing</em>? Apparently for the past four years, 44-year-old Erik Knapp has been the recipient of the first ride; he told the paper, &quot;This year, I was like, &apos;Let them have it.&apos; They are hungry for it.&quot; As for Markowitz, he says he&apos;ll never ride the Cyclone (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150411081654/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/09/coney_island_cy.php">smart guy</a>), and that he prefers the Wonder Wheel. The anti-rollercoaster set will be able to get their thrills in new ways this summer&#x2014;Luna Park will open with 19 rides this Memorial Day weekend.</p>
