</div></div><p>One of the (many) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120124/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/16/gowanus_gets_ready_to_rock.php">new venues</a> taking root in Gowanus will be opening its doors this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120124/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/26/new_venue_alert_the_bell_house.php">Back in June</a> we checked in on the progress of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120124/http://www.thebellhouseny.com/">The Bell House</a> (run by Union Hall and Floyd owners Jim Carden and Andy Templar, along with Union Hall booker Jack McFadden). To recap, there will be a huge bar in the performance space as well as a front lounge bar, and an entrance to each will be located in a foyer that connects the two. Located at 149 7th Street between 2nd &amp; 3rd Avenues, the venue was was crafted out of an old 1920&#x2019;s warehouse once used as a printing press.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120124/http://earfarm.com/features/daily-feature/monday/1240">Ear Farm</a> recently checked in and has some shots of the space still a little in the rough, but closer to completion. Check it out for yourself this Thursday at the grand (public) opening, with Lilys, Matt Pond PA and Robbers on High Street performing. In the future you can look forward to the venue possibly serving up snacks from favorite local eateries like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120124/http://www.dubpies.com/">Dub Pies</a>. There will also be lots of Eugene Mirman goodness, as the comedian will be hosting Eugene Mirman&apos;s Comedy Festival at the space (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120124/http://www.ticketweb.com/snl/VenueListings.action?venueId=31254">tickets</a>).</p>
