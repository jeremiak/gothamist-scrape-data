<p>A reader sent in these photos of the Cherry Blossom trees blooming in Central Park, and the photos were just taken yesterday&#x2014;<em>in January.</em> While we&apos;re used to seeing cherry blossom trees blooming in April or May, it seems winter blooms are becoming more and more normal. This happened last year, too, and even earlier, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151215023636/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/03/cherry_blossom_trees_in_bloom_in_de.php">in December</a>. </p>

<p>At the time, Brooklyn Botanic Garden curator Brian Funke told us that &quot;while <strong>it&apos;s common for the everblooming cherry and the autumn-flowering cherry to be blooming in December</strong>, it is a bit irregular for Prunus to have so many blossoms.&quot; These trees tend to bloom in December if a cold spell is followed by warm weather, and weather permitting, usually the blossoming will continue throughout the week, at least. The trees there have been experiencing a winter bloom this year, too&#x2014;the BBG uploaded photos to their Flickr <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151215023636/http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklynbotanicgarden/6555026613/">on December 22nd</a>, noting, &quot;Prunus &apos;Fudan-Zakura&apos; offers December blossoms in BBG&apos;s Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden.&quot;</p>
