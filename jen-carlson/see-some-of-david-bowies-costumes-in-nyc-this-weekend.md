					<p>A few times a year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809230638/http://manhattanvintage.com/">the Manhattan Vintage Clothing Show &amp; Sale</a> takes place at the Metropolitan Pavilion, and this coming weekend their event will feature a tribute to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809230638/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidbowie">David Bowie</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809230638/http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/vintage-bowie-looks-manhattan-vintage-clothing-show.html">The Cut</a>, Bowie celebrated designers like Kansai Yamamoto and Alexander McQueen, and at this weekend&apos;s show &quot;some of his past looks will be on view&#x2014;including Yamamoto&apos;s amphibious bodysuit, a sky-high pair of platforms from the singer&apos;s Ziggy Stardust era, and a feather-bedecked third-eye headpiece.&quot; Click through for a look. A couple of years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809230638/http://www.vice.com/read/some-cat-from-japan-0000228-v21n2">Vice</a> published an interview with Yamamoto, who discussed his introduction to Bowie:</p><blockquote>I actually had no idea who David Bowie was until I saw him wearing my clothes onstage at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Yasuko Hayashi, my stylist, was doing work for David Bowie and gave him some of my clothes. This was the first time I had ever met an artist who was wearing my designs. Before then, I didn&#x2019;t know how immensely talented he was. At the time, David Bowie was all about transcending gender. I didn&#x2019;t know anything about concepts like that, so I remember thinking whoa when I saw him wearing clothes I had designed for women. The clothes were influenced by hikinuki, the method of changing costumes quickly in kabuki. The audience in New York saw the costumes transform a few times during the show. I realized I had done something really cool when everyone in the audience got on their feet and clapped. I met a lot of famous people in the Western music world through David, and the one thing I can say for sure is that the best people in the world have distinctive personalities that are completely out of the ordinary.</blockquote>This weekend&apos;s clothing show will also include a collection <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809230638/http://www.papermothballvintage.com/2016/01/the-manhattan-vintage-show-february-2016.html">inspired by the TV show <em>Fargo</em></a>, called &quot;Fargo, New York 1979.&quot; (While Bowie&apos;s items are only on view, the Fargo pieces are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809230638/http://manhattanvintage.com/shop/current-collection/">already for sale</a>.)<p></p>
