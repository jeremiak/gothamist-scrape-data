<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184914/http://www.themodernage.org/2006/03/02/nick-sylvester-suspended-and-fired-for-fabricated-story-in-the-village-voice/">the Modern Age</a>, Pitchfork has even taken his name off the masthead already. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184914/http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:MBd60QIPOpkJ:www.pitchforkmedia.com/staff/+nick+sylvester+pitchfork&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a">Old Masthead</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184914/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/staff/">New Masthead</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184914/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/02/weird_but_true_1.html">Last month Sylvester was a presenter at the Plug Awards</a>, but ended up getting pulled off the stage after spending over 5 minutes reading an article out of the New Yorker.

<p>We wonder how long it will take before someone makes &quot;Save Sylvester!&quot; t-shirts.</p>
