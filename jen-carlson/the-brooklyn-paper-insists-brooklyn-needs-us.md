The Brooklyn Paper, which just won &apos;Newspaper of the Year&apos; from a major national trade group, is certainly not going out of business. Brooklyn needs us too much right now, what with local papers being snapped up by billionaire moguls who have no interest in local news except maximizing classified ad sales. Has Rupert Murdoch even BEEN to Brooklyn? His reporters don&apos;t know the territory, either.&quot;</blockquote>We bet Marty Markowitz would totally sign Rupert Murdoch&apos;s cast, though. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324184953/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/05/extra_extra_781.php">we noted</a> last week, Kuntzman recently put up his used, signed cast on eBay -- and more recently he requested a last minute plug to generate buzz (and drive up the bid!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324184953/http://gawker.com/5002977/brooklyn-paper-editor-yells-requests-publicity-for-his-creepy-ebay-item">from Gawker</a>. He described the cast, which sold for $102.50, as &quot;a piece of journalistic, medical and political history.&quot; Priceless.<p></p>
