<p>Prior to the U.S. entering WWII, there was a fairly strong Nazi presence in certain pockets of New York, and the most Nazi of them all was Yaphank, a &quot;pro-Hitler community&quot; located in the middle of Long Island. The streets there were named after Hitler, Goering, and Goebbels. There were Nazi parades marching through quaint suburbia. And it was home to &quot;Camp Siegfried,&quot; where children imitated the Hitler Youth. </p>

<p>A 1980s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020134613/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/25/nyregion/where-li-nazis-camped.html">NY Times article</a> explained that from 1935 until it closed, the camp &quot;was a favorite recreation center for German-American families living in the New York City area,&quot; there was even a Camp Siegfried Special train courtesy of the LIRR. The camp was a focal point of the Nazi movement  here (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020134613/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/14/grand_central_hilter_nazis.php">all those saboteurs</a>), and while the American flag was present on the grounds, it was greeted with a Nazi Salute&#x2014;after all, one attendee said, it would eventually be the American salute. In the late 1930s, &quot;Camp Siegfried officials were indicted on charges of violating the New York State Civil Rights Act.&quot; </p>

<p>While street names <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020134613/http://untappedcities.com/2015/04/02/this-former-nazi-town-on-long-island-with-adolf-hitler-street-still-exists/">were eventually changed</a>, today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020134613/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/nyregion/query-for-home-buyers-in-a-long-island-hamlet-are-you-german.html">the NY Times</a> reported that at least one bylaw has not. Philip Kneer and Patricia Flynn-Kneer, who are currently unable to sell their home there, have just filed suit, challenging a bylaw that demands homeowners in the area be of &quot;German extraction.&quot;</p><blockquote>While the parades are gone and the streets have been renamed, one thing has not changed: The original owners of this tract of land kept a clause in its bylaws requiring the homeowners to be primarily &#x201C;of German extraction.&#x201D; That has kept this community of 45 families almost entirely white.<p></p>

<p>[The Keers] are suing the community organization that owns the land under their house, the German American Settlement League, alleging that the league&#x2019;s housing practices are discriminatory and violate the Fair Housing Act.</p></blockquote>&#x201C;You feel like a caged animal here,&#x201D; Mr. Kneer told the paper. <p></p>
