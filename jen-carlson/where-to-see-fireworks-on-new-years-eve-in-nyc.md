<p>New Year&apos;s Eve is a wonderful time to catch some fireworks in NYC&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103052249/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/05/photos_the_party_before_the_firewor.php#photo-1">unlike the 4th of July</a>, only those who can hack it in the cold can get the best view, so the crowds are smaller, for one. They are also often a delightful surprise as, unlike the 4th of July, again, they are not the centerpiece of your evening. You will likely go out, have some wine, and look up at the sky only to see it sparkle. For the most part, you have the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103052249/https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/new-years-eve">Parks Department</a> to thank for this. </p>

<p>Surprise fireworks are the best fireworks, and here&apos;s where they will be on New Year&apos;s Eve, so you can plan to be near them, even if you forget about them by the time they go off with &quot;Auld Lang Syne.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>CENTRAL PARK</strong>: This is for the New York Road Runners Run, but you don&apos;t need to run to see them. The general public will be able to see them best from south of 72nd Street inside the park, but note: you will be subject to security screening at any park entrance south of 72nd Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103052249/http://www.nyrr.org/races-and-events/2016/nyrr-midnight-run">More details here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PROSPECT PARK</strong> The Prospect Park Alliance and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams will be delivering their annual fireworks celebration, along with live music, hot chocolate and more. Get there by 11 p.m., and you&apos;ll be able to see the fireworks best from Grand Army Plaza, the Park&#x2019;s West Drive, and along Prospect Park West between Grand Army Plaza and 9th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103052249/https://www.prospectpark.org/news-events/events/2016/12/31#new-years-eve-fireworks-prospect-park-150">More details here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LIBERTY ISLAND:</strong> A fireworks display is scheduled to take place at the stroke of midnight on a barge near Liberty Island. You&apos;ll be able to see these from the Brooklyn Bridge (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103052249/https://nycwalks.com/brooklyn-bridge-walk-into-the-new-year-tours/">try this walking tour</a> if you want to make a night of it), the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, Lower Manhattan, and any number <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103052249/https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/new-years-eve-cruise/">of boats that are offering a midnight cruise</a>. </p>

<p><strong>LUNA PARK</strong> The 3rd Annual New Year&#x2019;s Eve Celebration in Coney Island starts at 6 p.m., with fireworks starting at 11:59 p.m. Bonus: There will be ice skating, live music, and the Wonder Wheel and the Gigamon VR will be open, with free rides from 6 to 10 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170103052249/http://lunaparknyc.com/events/new-years-eve-celebration/">More details here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TIMES SQUARE:</strong> This is definitely the most chaotic place to take in some fireworks, but if you want to ring in the new year in the midst of chaos, go for it. They&apos;ve got fireworks coming off of One Times Square.<br>
