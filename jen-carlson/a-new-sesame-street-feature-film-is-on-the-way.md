<p>20th Century Fox has picked up the movie rights to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511050741/http://gothamist.com/tags/sesamestreet"><em>Sesame Street</em></a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511050741/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sesame-street-movie-works-fox-339374">the Hollywood Reporter</a> says longtime writer of the show, Joey Mazzarino, will be penning the feature film&apos;s script. Since the show first aired on the small screen in 1969, it&apos;s gotten two big screen treatments.  </p>

<p>The first movie was 1985&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511050741/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089994/"><em>Follow That Bird</em></a>, which (obviously) put Big Bird in the leading role, along with humans Sandra Bernhardt, Chevy Chase, and John Candy.</p>

<p>The second was 1999&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511050741/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159421/"><em>The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland</em></a>, which had Elmo in the lead, along with humans Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa Williams.</p>

<p>So, what Sesame Street character should get the spotlight this time around, and what humans should be his or her co-star?</p>
