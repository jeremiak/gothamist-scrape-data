<p>You had a good run, Ridgewood. Your rents were reasonable, you had just the right number of bars, you were a comfortable distance from Williamsburg... but this past year you really blew up. The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042515/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/07/ridgewood_quooklyn_comments_ny_time.php">wrote about you</a>, several new bars opened, a venue was announced, Quooklyn happened... and now, Sonja, who was &quot;raised on a farm in the Midwest&quot; and received her &quot;higher level education at the University of Utah,&quot; is opening a bar with her friend Rina. It&apos;s called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042515/http://www.thebadolddays.com/">Bad Old Days</a>. </p>

<p>They announced some details on their website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042515/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1882083817/the-bad-old-days">and Kickstarter</a>: &quot;We will be offering late night food, easy drinking cocktails, and plenty of sass. We are working hard to give you all a new place to rest your feet and wet your whistle. Look out for us in Summer of 2015!&quot; But will there be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042515/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php">broken windows and graffiti</a> and real life danger? Needles? Staged muggings? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042515/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/26/ny_post_bad_old_days_are_back_becau.php">Three-card Monte scams</a>? Will there be authentic <em>grit</em>? Just how method are we going here? </p>

<p>Not very. The bar will have an aesthetic from a pre-pre-pre Giuliani era&#x2014;they&apos;re going for &quot;a mid-century den with a great book collection... living room vibe.&quot;</p>

<p>Bad Old Days is located at 1684 Woodbine Street, between the Myrtle-Wyckoff L and the Seneca M stop. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042515/http://gothamist.com/tags/badolddays"><em>THE</em> Bad Old Days</a> were located somewhere between a peep show in Times Square and the East Village squats in the 1980s.</p>
