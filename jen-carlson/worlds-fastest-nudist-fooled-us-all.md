										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="wfn1009.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612024418im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/wfn1009.jpg" width="275" height="206" class="image-left"> </span>Last month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612024418/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/29/video_have_you_seen_this_naked_man.php">the World&apos;s Fastest Nudist</a> was just a mysterious, fanny-pack wearing man trotting through the boroughs, scaring young children, and posting videos on YouTube. After getting coverage both online and on screen &#x2014; it even made it to the desk of Anderson Cooper &#x2014; the veil has been pulled off: he&apos;s just another marketing tool, and we&apos;ve all been duped.</p>

<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612024418/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/business/media/29zappos.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> reports on the latest video, which is a blatant advertisement for online shoe company Zappo&apos;s. They declared: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not preying on anyone&#x2019;s emotions. This was all about fun.&#x201D; But what about all those other nude running enthusiasts who looked up to the WFN as a mentor &#x2014;&#xA0;what about <em>their emotions</em> unnamed online shoe company?</p>

<p>The agency who dreamed up the WFN told the paper that since they &quot;did not pitch to Mr. Cooper&#x2019;s show, to &apos;have a viral video go out over CNN was a breakthrough.&apos;&#x201D; Sigh, it&apos;s like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612024418/http://gothamist.com/tags/balloonboy">Balloon Boy</a> all over again. </p>
