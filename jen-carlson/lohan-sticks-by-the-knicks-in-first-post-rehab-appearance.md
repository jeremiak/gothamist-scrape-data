</div></div><p>Lindsay Lohan is sporting a nice post-rehab glow! She made her first public appearance since leaving Betty Ford, at the Knicks vs. Lakers game in LA on Saturday. She was there with her friend and jeweler Pascal Mouawad, who recently gave her a $25,000 diamond necklace. While at the game, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412174504/http://twitter.com/#!/lindsaylohan/status/24300038293291009">she Tweeted</a>: &quot;Kobe sent me Lakers hats coz I&apos;m wearing Knicks&#x2014;I&apos;m from NY!!! Gotta stay loyal!&quot; But just last year Lindsay seemed to be rooting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412174504/http://plixi.com/p/27763154">for the Lakers</a>&#x2014;which leads us to believe she may just be a fair-weather fan, jumping on the Knicks bandwagon now that they&apos;re not sucking as much. Next up: a double date with The Situation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412174504/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/pauly_ds_new_girlfriend_chloe_sevig.php">Chloe Sevigny and Pauly D</a>?</p>
