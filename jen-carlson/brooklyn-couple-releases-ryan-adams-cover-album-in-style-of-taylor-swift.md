<p>Last year Ryan Adams released an album in which he covered every song from Taylor Swift&apos;s <em>1989</em>, but in his classic Ryan Adams way... and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222132/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/10/ryan_adams_t_swift.php">it was glorious</a>. Now a Brooklyn couple has done what Swift herself should have: covered Adams&apos; <em>Love Is Hell</em> album in the style of Taylor. Take a moment to unravel that. </p>

<p>The new cover album comes from Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222132/https://www.facebook.com/babetowntheband">Babetown</a>, a husband and wife duo made up of Danny Ross and Jessica Leibowitz, Gothamist&apos;s video producer. (Did you know Jessica made music? We only found out last Friday.)</p>

<p>Leibowitz and Ross have spent the past few months working on the project, called <em>1989 is HELL</em>, and are now premiering three tracks ahead of the full album release on August 31st. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222132/https://soundcloud.com/babetown/sets/1989-is-hell">Listen here</a>, or below:</p>
