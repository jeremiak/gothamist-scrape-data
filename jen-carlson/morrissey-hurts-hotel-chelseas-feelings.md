title: Morrissey Hurts Hotel Chelsea's Feelings
---

	
										<p>The poor Hotel Chelsea is feeling a bit down after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501214132/http://legends.typepad.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2007/01/morrissey_misse.html">finding a letter from one Steven Morrissey</a> (known to most as. simply: Morrissey). The letter states that he will be leaving (artless) Texas to do a photoshoot using the hotel as an &quot;insignificant background&quot;. </p>

<p>Of course, legends are often forgiven, and this is no exception. The Hotel Chelsea bloggers write: &quot;Since your letter is dated January 16, 1981, I feel confident you have repented of your sin of false pride by this time. You can come back to the Chelsea and play a concert for us anytime.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the full letter:</p>

We couldn&apos;t find any pictures of The Smiths or Morrissey with insignificant backdrops.
