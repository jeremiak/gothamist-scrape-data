Originally opened in 1927, it was run by Loew&apos;s until the 1960s. It then became an indie-run theater until 1980. Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211448/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/chinatown_treasure_9mfs4ZTDMNOc0aqbpdEwDL">the NY Post</a> reports, it may have another lease on life, as an Asian-American arts group (CREATE: the Committee to Revitalize and Enrich the Arts and Tomorrow&apos;s Economy) hopes to revive it. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211448/http://cinematreasures.org/theater/521/">2,300-seat theater</a> has been sealed off, but now the arts group has the backing of building owner Thomas Sung to move forward with their plan for a cultural arts center. On top of Sung&apos;s support, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. gave the group a $150,000 grant to study the project, with another $140,000 promised for planning.</p>

<p>The theater, aside from being stripped of its seats, is still in good shape with the its ornate terra cotta design intact. City Councilmember Alan Gerson told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211448/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_348/theatercouldhave.html">the Villager</a>: &#x201C;It would be the first theater opening in Chinatown in over a generation, probably several generations. It&#x2019;ll bolster the arts and culture of Chinatown and it will also bolster the economy.&#x201D;</p>
