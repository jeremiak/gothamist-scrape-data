										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="obamaad0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101211639im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/obamaad0110.jpg" width="350" height="222" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday the president of Weatherproof clothing company, Freddie Stollmack, defiantly declared he would not be taking down his company&apos;s ad campaign &#x2014; which includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101211639/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/obama_selling_jackets_in_times_squa.php">President Obama on their billboard</a> in Times Square. The unauthorized image shows Obama in one of the company&apos;s coats during a visit to the Great Wall in China. </p>

<p>Stollmack likely chose his words to drum up more press, as the billboard is coming down anyway. After the billboard went up this week, White House spokesman Ben LaBolt stated, &quot;The White House has a longstanding policy disapproving of the use of the president&apos;s name and likeness for commercial purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101211639/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/07/white-house-pressures-garment-company-pull-obama-billboard/">Fox News</a>, after receiving a letter, &quot;Stollmack spoke by phone to the White House counsel&apos;s office Thursday and promised the company would remove the billboard.&quot; So, how long til it comes down? Let us know if you still see it out there.</p>
