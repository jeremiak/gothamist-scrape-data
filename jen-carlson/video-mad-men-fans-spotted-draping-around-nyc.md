<p>It&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve seen some silly trend sweep the YouTube Nation (remember planking?), but the wait for a new trend is OVER. Enter: Draping. We actually like this one! It involves posing like Don Draper and... that&apos;s about it. Check out <a href="gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> fans Draping around New York City&#x2014;and yes, ladies, you can Drape, too:</p>

<p>If you want to further this trend, we have some recommendations as to how you can act even more like Draper, but note, these are for experienced Drapers only:</p><ul><li>Be charming to a woman for a short period of time before acting like an asshole.<br>
</li><li>Steal someone&apos;s idea.<br>
</li><li>Steal someone&apos;s <em>identity</em>.<br>
</li><li> Start drinking whisky at 11 a.m., repeat all day until you fall facedown on your bed.</li></ul><p></p>
