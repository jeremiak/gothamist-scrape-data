<p>It&apos;s not like anyone thought the naked girl locked in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193804/http://gothamist.com/tags/charliesheen">Charlie Sheen</a>&apos;s hotel suite at the Plaza was, you know, <em>not</em> a porn star, but now it&apos;s been confirmed. The woman who escorted the actor that evening was Capri Anderson: 22-year-old hardcore adult entertainment actress. Sheen met her earlier that night at a bar inside the Plaza, before bringing her back to the Eloise suite where he was staying in (his children and ex-wife Denise Richards not far away). </p>

<p>Anderson is the daughter of Irish immigrants who once lived in the Bronx, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193804/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/10/27/2010-10-27_charlie_sheen_speaks_out_postdrunk_naked_ramage_the_story_is_totally_overblown_a.html#ixzz13fQnVItM">the Daily News</a>, and she <em>had</em> been keeping her job a secret from them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193804/http://www.tmz.com/2010/10/28/charlie-sheen-capri-anderson-christina-walsh-hotel-new-york-aspen-pitkin-county-held-against-will/">TMZ</a> reports that she&apos;s now lawyered up and is claiming she feared for her life as Sheen tried to knock open the door she had locked herself behind. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193804/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/10/27/2010-10-27_charlie_sheen_speaks_out_postdrunk_naked_ramage_the_story_is_totally_overblown_a.html">A tourist</a> who was staying across the hall that night says she heard &quot;happy noises, love-making&quot; in the suite, but &quot;It didn&apos;t go on for too long,&quot; and Sheen has said the entire story has been &quot;overblown&quot; (he did, however, cause $7,000 in damages <em>somehow</em>).</p>

<p>Currently Anderson is planning a trip to Colorado, where she will ask prosecutors to violate the actor&apos;s probation on grounds that he allegedly held her against her will. The NYPD says that Anderson, when interviewed, never made claims that Sheen was holding her against her will on Tuesday.</p>
