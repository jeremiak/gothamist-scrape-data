                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="DONTSTEALZOOEYSSOUL.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820060545im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/DONTSTEALZOOEYSSOUL.jpg" width="640" height="464" class="image-none"> </span><br>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="IPHONEZOOEY.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820060545im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/IPHONEZOOEY.jpg" width="350" height="186" class="image-right"> </span>Listen, we&apos;d all like to capture a piece of happy-go-lucky Zooey Deschanel&apos;s glowing soul, but she has politely requested that you leave her soul (which is insured for $1 Billion USD, 4 double rainbows, 18 watts of pure sunshine, and <span class="photo_caption">just a tiny flame of hellfire</span>) in tact. Also, please leave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820060545/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/25/m_ward_musician.php">M. Ward</a>&apos;s soul alone, too. His is more solemn, tortured, and probably weepy at times, but some people are into that, and those people should leave M. Ward&apos;s soul <em>be</em>.</p>

<p>While the &quot;He&quot; in She &amp; Him has been camera-shy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820060545/https://twitter.com/allsongs/statuses/201833300686417922">in the past</a>, reportedly the band&apos;s manager specified it was the &quot;She,&quot; Zooey, who didn&apos;t want to see technology out at concerts, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820060545/http://o.canada.com/2013/07/04/she-and-him-toronto-no-pictures/">saying</a>: &quot;Zooey doesn&apos;t want to see phones!&quot;</p>

<p>So, if you&apos;re attending She &amp; Him&apos;s concert in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820060545/http://www.cityparksfoundation.org/calendar/she-him-camera-obscura-2/">Central Park tonight</a>, power down your soul-stealing mechanisms and enjoy the experience IRL. If not for the band, then do it for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820060545/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/24/are_cameraphones_killing_concerts.php">all those other precious souls</a> in attendance.</p>
