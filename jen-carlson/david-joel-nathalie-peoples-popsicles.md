Okay. So when we heard there were some folks handmaking them from fresh ingredients provided by local farmers at the GreenMarket... our heart skipped a beat. David, Joel and Nathalie are the trio of geniuses who concocted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610055316/http://www.peoplespops.blogspot.com/">People&apos;s Pops</a>, and they can be found around town (track them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610055316/http://twitter.com/peoplespops/">on Twitter</a>) selling their goods (which on any given day may include something like a Blueberry &amp; Cardamom pop). Also, they will deliver. Say hello to your new best friends...</em></p>

<p><strong>National Ice Cream Day is coming up, is there a National Popsicle Day? How would you celebrate? David:</strong> After Barack Obama is elected to his second term and the gloves come off, July 31st will be declared National Popsicle Day.  The streets will be filled with break-dancers and unregulated popsicle eating contests.<br>
<strong>Joel:</strong> Actually Dave, National Popsicle Day was outlawed along with prohibition in the late 30&#x2019;s due to excessive brain freezes. The surgeon general declared popsicles a national threat to Americans&#x2019; well-being, thus turning possession into a class-A felony. As far as we know, this is still the case.<br>
<strong>David:</strong> I heard they&#x2019;re considering decriminalizing it in certain states.<br>
<strong>Nathalie:</strong> Every day is National Popsicle Day, as far as I&#x2019;m concerned.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the business... how did you come up with the idea? D:</strong> During the summer popsicles basically sell themselves.  The only problem was that there was no one selling good popsicles.<br>
<strong>N:</strong> People&#x2019;s Pops was just supposed to be a one-day event for the New Amsterdam Public Market last year, but we had so much fun that we decided to turn it into a business.</p>

<p><strong>Where do the flavor ideas come from? D:</strong> We go to the GreenMarket each week and try to build flavors around the best produce that the farmers brought to market that week.  </p>

<p><strong>Is there a flavor you haven&apos;t tried to create yet that&apos;s been brewing in your minds? D: </strong> Blood, sweat &amp; tears.</p>
