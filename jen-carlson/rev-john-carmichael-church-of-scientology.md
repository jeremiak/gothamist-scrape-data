<p>We&apos;re turning comments on for this interview, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529172130/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/14/big_yellow_taxi.php#comment-1172435">something we don&apos;t normally do</a>.</p>

<p><strong>There are a lot of myths that fly around about your religion, could you please tell us about some of the basics of Scientology?</strong><br>
First of all let me say, the best way to find out about Scientology (or anything else, for that matter) is to look for yourself.   And that&apos;s not difficult -  there are several Churches of Scientology in New York; the one at 227 West 46th Street is open from 9 am til 10 pm, seven days a week.  Or buy a book -- even get one from the library -- by L. Ron Hubbard.  Dianetics (means &quot;through the mind&quot;) is the book that started it all in 1950, and became a bestseller and has remained a perennial bestseller. Having said that, here&apos;s the short version:</p>

<p>Scientology is a unique and practical religion, one which contains tools people use to lead better lives, lives of greater self-respect and respect for others, greater happiness and understanding.  The name means, &quot;study of wisdom,&quot; or &quot;knowledge in the fullest sense of the word.&quot;   So it is about knowing, not believing, and no one is expected to take anything in Scientology on faith.</p>

<p>It&apos;s based on the premise that the individual is an immortal spiritual being, seeking to survive, basically good, and with tremendous potentials not currently realized.  Because we believe the individual is basically good, Scientology is based on restoring to the individual his or her own freedom.  In freedom the individual also finds responsibility and happiness.</p>

<p>How this is done is the whole subject of Dianetics (the precursor and substudy of Scientology) and Scientology, and is just too much to explain here.   In brief, the Church provides:  1) courses in the fundamentals of life and their application, and 2) a kind of one-on-one application called &quot;auditing&quot;  (from the Latin, audire, meaning to listen) -- it&apos;s not called counseling, because the auditor does not tell you what to think about your problems or their solution.  Instead, you find out for yourself what has kept you from solving your own problems -- and from knowing your own spiritual nature, as well.</p>

<p>Millions of people around the world have found the applied philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard enormously valuable - from dealing with an inability to study, to coming to their own conclusions about the age-old questions about the universe -- so much so, that Scientology and Dianetics now include some 7,500 Churches, missions and groups in 163 countries.</p>
