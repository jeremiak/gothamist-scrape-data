<p>Twenty three years ago&#x2014;on July 18th, 1989&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174151/http://gothamist.com/tags/nirvana">Nirvana</a> was in New York City for the New Music Seminar, where they performed for about thirty minutes at the Pyramid Club. The band, which didn&apos;t include Dave Grohl yet, had just embarked on its first national tour following the release of their debut album, <em>Bleach</em>&#x2014;their set that day included &quot;Dive,&quot; &quot;Love Buzz,&quot; and &quot;Polly.&quot; This was the band&apos;s last show with second guitarist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174151/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Everman">Jason Everman</a>. </p>

<p>And now, &quot;please welcome, Sub Pop artists Nirvana...&quot;</p>

<p>A few days prior to that show, on July 13th, the band played Maxwell&apos;s in New Jersey&#x2014;here&apos;s twenty minutes of that set, which included &quot;School,&quot; &quot;Floyd The Barber,&quot; and &quot;About A Girl.&quot;: </p>

<p>This was an early and transformative time for the band, they would go on to reform with new band members, and drop Sub Pop for DGC Records; in a late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174151/http://kurtcobain.com/interviews/nirvana-interview/">1989 interview</a>, Kurt Cobain noted that their music was going in a slightly different direction: &quot;The early songs were really angry... But as time goes on the songs are getting poppier and poppier as I get happier and happier. The songs are now about conflicts in relationships, emotional things with other human beings. Most of the lyrics on the <em>Bleach</em> album are about life in Aberdeen.&quot; The following year the band began working with producer Butch Vig, and Krist Novoselic and Cobain auditioned Grohl, knowing &quot;in two minutes that he was the right drummer.&quot;</p>

<p>Following <em>Bleach</em>, the band only released two more studio albums (not including their compilation album, <em>Incesticide</em>). In 1991 they released <em>Nevermind</em> as their first DGC release, it was produced by Vig and was (mostly) recorded in California. In 1993 they released <em>In Utero</em>, which was produced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174151/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevealbini">Steve Albini</a>, and recorded at Pachyderm Studios&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174151/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/kurt_cobain_1.php#photo-1">which we visited</a> a few years back.</p>
