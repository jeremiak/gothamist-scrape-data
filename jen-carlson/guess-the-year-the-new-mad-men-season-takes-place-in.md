<p>This week we received a screener of the two hour <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145439/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> premiere that will air on AMC this Sunday. Along with the screener was a note from the show&apos;s creator, Matthew Weiner, who asked that the journalist on the receiving end of the DVD not reveal a number of things, including the year the season begins. We&apos;ll follow the rules, but that doesn&apos;t mean <em>you</em> can&apos;t guess the year. Here&apos;s a spoiler-free shot of Betty outside of a building near St. Mark&apos;s Place during the season 6 premiere episode, can you guess the year? This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145439/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">the one time</a> we will not be updating with the answer or any more details.</p>
