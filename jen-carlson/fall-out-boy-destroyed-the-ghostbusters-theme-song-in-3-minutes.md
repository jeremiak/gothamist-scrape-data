title: Fall Out Boy Destroyed The 'Ghostbusters' Theme Song In 3 Minutes
---

	
										<p>The new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104936/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters"><em>Ghosbusters</em></a> theme song has been dumped onto the world like a tub of slime, featuring the screeching vocals of whoever the lead singer of Fall Out Boy is. (Adam Levine&apos;s little emo brother? Fake Trent Reznor?). The 3-minute insult to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104936/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc">Ray Parker Jr.&apos;s classic</a> was released today, and even Missy Elliott&#x2014;who was sadly dragged into this mess&#x2014;could not save it. We have now typed more words than it even deserves...</p>

<p>Can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104936/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Parker_Jr.#Ghostbusters_theme_song_lawsuit">Huey Lewis sue</a> Fall Out Boy for this theme song, too? We&apos;ll get in on that class action.</p>
