title: Sabatino Suckered LA Times? FBI Reports Implicating Diddy Don't Exist

The finger was now being pointed at Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs, who maintained he was not involved. </p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195124/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0325081sabatino1.html">The Smoking Gun</a> calls the paper out by saying their scoop was a scam. Their main resource, James Sabatino (pictured), has likely fabricated evidence and forged FBI reports that were used by the paper. Not a hard story to swallow given Sabatino is a con man (and former consultant for Diddy&apos;s Bad Boy Records) currently residing behind bars. </p>

<p>TSG reports that the LA Times fell victim to a hoax, and that the FBI reports &quot;are nowhere to be found in the bureau&apos;s computerized Automated Case Support database.&quot; It is believed that Sabatino fabricated them, as they &quot;share remarkably similar spelling deficiencies.&quot; Sabatino, who has long tried to implicate himself in some of hip-hop&apos;s big shootings, claims the reports were provided to him and told TSG, &quot;there is a lot of lies circulating around right now. But this is all going to backfire on Puff. I know him too well.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195124/http://gawker.com/372466/lats-tupac-shooting-scoop-based-on-a-hoax">Reportedly</a> The LA Times is launching an investigation to get to the bottom of these new claims. The paper&apos;s new editor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195124/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/report-on-1994-rapper-shooting-in-doubt/">Russ Stanton, said</a> they are &#x201C;taking this very seriously.&quot;</p>
