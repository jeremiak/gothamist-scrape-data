<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627030122/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> hits the road this summer it doesn&apos;t seem like she&apos;ll be doing so with the original Hole lineup (for a while, it seemed as though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627030122/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/14/video_hole_reunite_at_surprise_show.php">there was hope</a>). But let it go! You know what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627030122/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/billy_corgan_interview.php">Billy Corgan says</a>, &quot;Sentimentality is death.&quot; The good news (yes, &quot;we&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627030122/http://jezebel.com/5907044/i-found-courtney-love-in-a-hopeless-place">like Courtney Love</a> and deem this good news) is that she is touring... and three of the shows are in New York, one is in New Jersey, and another is in the unofficial sixth borough of Philly.</p>

<p>Love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627030122/http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2013/04/courtney-love-the-new-face-of-saint-laurent-and-njoy/">recently spoke about</a> her new solo stuff, saying, &quot;I have two A-sides coming out in mid-April [ed. note: still waiting]... I had six songs, but I decided to pick the two excellent songs instead of four really good songs and two excellent songs. I keep writing about California so I just finally called a song straight up fucking &apos;California&apos;. Not even Malibu, which I still don&#x2019;t have the keys to the city and I&apos;m really pissed... It&apos;s like when Billy Corgan told me he was calling a song &apos;Tonight, Tonight&apos;. I was like, &apos;If that song isn&apos;t the best fucking song I&apos;ve ever heard, you will be carted out of town on a cross&apos;. You don&apos;t call a song &apos;Tonight, Tonight&apos; or &apos;California&apos; unless you know it&apos;s major.&quot;</p>
