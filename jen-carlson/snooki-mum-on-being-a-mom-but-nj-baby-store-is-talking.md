<p>Snooki has remained tight-lipped about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174349/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/29/snooki_is_pregnant.php">her rumored pregnancy</a>, but others have no problem with the baby talk. Over in Jersey City&#x2014;where Snooks is currently filming her new show with J-Woww&#x2014;a baby store was contacted by producers about shooting on location. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174349/http://bambibaby.com/pages/bambi-baby-jersey-city-contact-information-35">Bambi Baby</a>&apos;s owner told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174349/http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/02/jersey-shore-snooki-spin-off-baby-stores/#.T1DVW3JWq-0">TMZ</a> that someone from 495 Productions got in touch with them over the past few weeks&#x2014;around the same time Snooki was talking plenty about the pregnancy rumors, by adamantly denying them. </p>

<p>Bambi Baby&apos;s owner has agreed to let the show film some scenes inside of the store. Sadly, Snooki won&apos;t be able to enjoy the food&#x2014;including the PICKLES&#x2014;at Barcade, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174349/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/10/snooki_j-woww_will_be_tailed_by_jer.php">confirmed the show</a> will not be filming there (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174349/http://www.facebook.com/barcadejerseycity/posts/315699921813916">much to their regulars&apos; relief</a>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174349/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2109168/Snooki-pregnant-2012-Jersey-Shore-star-steps-loose-fitting-pregnancy-rumours-continue.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">here are some photos</a> of the 24-year-old in Jersey yesterday, wearing a very loose-fitting top, and in possession of many tightly sealed bags from a local department store.</p>
