title: Tourist: The National Tours New York With Arcade Fire
---

	
										<p><em>A couple of years ago, Bryan Devendorf (drummer for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203040539/http://americanmary.com/">The National</a>) documented the band&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203040539/http://www.gothamist.com/2005/03/25/dear_sxsw_diarypart_2.php">trip to SXSW</a> for us. We enjoyed it so much, we asked him to do it again! This time he documented their recent shows with Arcade Fire right here in New York, and even addresses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203040539/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/05/10/af.php">those security guards at Radio City</a>. </em></p><em>

In the late-morning glare, the world assembles itself in fragments. Birds crying majestic arpeggios dominate the natural noise floor. A screen door opens, the dog with the jingly collar is let out, and the screen door bangs shut in the characteristic way of all screen doors. Timeless. Then the neighbor with the dog sparks up his Zippo. He is always over there taking smoke breaks, all day long and deep into the night. I imagine him to be the lone cameraman in a homemade porn operation, overworked and overstressed. But, ah, the view of the garden from the back window is incredibly detailed and utterly green. I see a pair of giant hornets, an invasive European variety, engage in a pas de deux in the dizzy sunlight before vanishing into the shrubbery. Springtime in Brooklyn. Love it. </p>

Our orbit through the Southeast opening for Arcade Fire is a blur of velvety heat and adventure. In Atlanta, there was a post-show Whirly Ball challenge. (In this sport, players armed with jai alai-type scoops tool around in bumper cars and attempt to fire a plastic ball into an elevated goal.) Whirly Ball is not for the fainthearted. Collisions abound. An errant pass strikes me in the face and a member of Team AF suffers &#x201C;possible internal injuries&#x201D; when his car&#x2019;s control stick jams him in the ribcage. My game stats: 2 pts, 2 assts, 2 Coors Lights.  <br>
From Atlanta back north to the Mason-Dixon Line, heroically lit gas stations with ridiculous names like Pumper&#x2019;s and BJ&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203040539/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_05_arts_national4.jpg">are laid out like stepping stones</a>. Outlandish! </p>

<p>The next two days, we will be in Washington Heights at the United Palace, which, you may know, is a functioning church whose flock is shepherded by one Reverend Ike. Anyway, we are tasked with warming up the crowd, a concept that has taken on a literal meaning, playing in chill, air-conditioned venues many times the size than we are accustomed to. It&#x2019;s quite amazing, even surreal. We are through the looking-glass, people. Florae and faunae speak; each brook we ford brings new adventures, new characters. </p>
