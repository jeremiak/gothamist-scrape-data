title: Q: Is Scorsese's Vinyl Good Yet?
---

	
										<p>A: No. </p>

<p>The second episode of HBO&apos;s <em>Vinyl</em> (which didn&apos;t feature 1970s NYC quite as prominently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031143843/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/16/vinyl_history_scorsese.php">as the pilot</a>) aired last night, a full hour shorter than the premiere and yet it still dragged on slower than Richie Finestra on quaaludes. And yet, despite awful reviews, it has already been renewed for a second season&#x2014;a decision, no doubt, that has everything to do with the bold-faced names attached to it (this is basically the vanity project of Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger). </p>

<p>And now, some tweets:</p>

<p>Kurt Loder may hate <em>Vinyl</em> the most out of anyone: </p>

<p>Rolling Stone thinks the show has a woman problem&#x2014;&quot;prestige drama&apos;s &apos;wife problem&apos; is an issue of long standing, and giving the females in these bad boys&apos; lives something interesting to do &#x2014; even if it&apos;s constrained by the sexism of the time &#x2014; is hardly asking the a writers&apos; room to split the atom.&quot;</p>

<p>In other television criticism, <em>The New Yorker</em>&apos;s Emily Nussbaum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031143843/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/vinyl-and-billions-reviews">has called the show</a> &quot;disappointing&quot; and compared it to the Hard Rock Caf&#xE9; (&quot;chaos for tourists&quot;), but praises Cannavale for his role, calling him &quot;a hairy life force of an actor who improves even misbegotten shows.&quot; Cannavale is matched by Ray Romano, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031143843/https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/701638809218392065">Scorsese didn&apos;t even know existed</a>, but is winning over fans for his role.</p>
