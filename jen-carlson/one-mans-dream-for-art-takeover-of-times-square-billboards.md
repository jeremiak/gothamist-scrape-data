<p>What if all the billboards in Times Square weren&apos;t for ads, but for art? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412165504/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/11/times-square-to-art-square/">Animal</a>, some crazy Dutchman called Justus Bruns wants to make that a reality within five years. It&apos;s called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412165504/http://www.timessquaretoartsquare.org/">Times Square To Art Square</a>, or TS2AS, and so far he&apos;s raised about $1,400 of the $10,000 he&apos;s looking to raise. Here&apos;s a little video explaining the project. Think it can work, if only for a day... and would anyone even notice?</p>
