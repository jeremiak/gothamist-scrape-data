<p>The Henson Company has uploaded a couple of new vintage gems to the YouTubes. First up, listen to a couple of cool <strike>cats</strike> Muppets talk about jazz, man. It&apos;s like a scene out of <em>Reefer Madness</em>!</p>

<p>Then there&apos;s some early commercial work by Henson, for Wilkins Coffee. In which non-Wilkins drinkers get shot, punched, thrown out of a plane, stomped on, and electrocuted!</p>
