</div></div>					<p>This is it, the last week of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s open-air art show in New York City. The artist just posted his latest piece on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/http://instagram.com/banksyny">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/http://banksy.co.uk/2013/10/28/coney-island">his website</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s a robot, a barcode, and a pigeon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/http://banksy.co.uk/2013/10/28/coney-island">in Coney Island</a>. The exact location is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=stillwell+and+neptune&amp;ll=40.579142,-73.981934&amp;spn=0.006552,0.013218&amp;sll=40.579219,-73.981946&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,244.34,,0,13.72&amp;cbll=40.579047,-73.981915&amp;hnear=Neptune+Ave+%26+Stillwell+Ave,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11224&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=2Xn6ngqbOmK5Q6jCwUNM2Q">Stillwill and Neptune</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Banksy put up a text piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/banksy_says_latest_greenpoint_piece.php">in Greenpoint</a>&#x2014;which read: This Site Contains Blocked Messages&#x2014;a response to the NY Times rejecting his op-ed column criticizing One World Trade Center.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 11:30 a.m.:</strong> We&apos;re told the owner is on site already and has arranged for plexiglass to protect the piece. He has also &quot;already reviewed an offer for $25,000.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 12:45 p.m.:</strong> The owner is already measuring for plexi, though we hear a gate will also be involved in his preservation plans. The NYPD is on site, but they&apos;re just taking photos and joking around, they haven&apos;t asked about the owner about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/nypd_vs_banksy.php">filing a complaint</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 1:30 p.m.:</strong> We&apos;re told the &quot;owner of building, Anthony Ruocco, was not aware of Banksy.&quot; He told us his feelings on the piece: &quot;Well, you know, It&apos;s not bad.&quot; The building was shut down after/during Hurricane Sandy and is not a convenience store anymore.</p>

<p>Police came by and gave the owner a copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023311/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-disses-1-wtc-canadian-vanilla-article-1.1498564">the Daly News story</a> with the recent World Trade Center Banksy story.&quot; The owner says they just gave it to him to show him who Banksy was.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 5 p.m.:</strong> The metal gate is down! Building owners Joe Scaglione and Anthony Ruocco says it&apos;s &quot;just for the night,&quot; and tommorow they&apos;ll cover it with Lexan, an &quot;unbreakable&quot; plexi. The owner and the people who helped put the gate up received applause from the crowd&#x2014;Nic Garcia tells us, &quot;They&apos;re being very nice. Huge crowd now, they keep opening it back up for people and letting people go up to it.&quot;</p>
