<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105445/http://gothamist.com/tags/oneworldtradecenter">One World Trade Center</a> became New York City&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105445/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/photos_one_world_trade_center_so_ta.php#photo-1">tallest building</a>, and now it continues to grow to its final height of 1,776 feet. While it may look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105445/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/is_the_freedom_tower_going_to_be_to.php#photo-1">a little small</a> from some spots, the view from space is pretty majestic. NASA has released this image taken on March 11th from an altitude of 243 miles, taken by crewmembers of the International Space Station. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105445/http://lightbox.time.com/2012/04/30/nasa/#ixzz1td0uSDru">TIME</a> notes, &quot;Most poignant&#x2014;if least conspicuous&#x2014;are the sawtooth shadows extending from the southwest edge of Manhattan into the Hudson. The longest tooth of them all is cast by the new World Trade tower.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a timelapse of the construction of the building, which will take you from October 18th, 2004 through April 20th, 2012 in two minutes.</p>
