According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151654/http://www.nme.com/news/yoko-ono/57926">NME</a>, Ono has threatened to sue the bar&apos;s owner, Mike Craig, for copyright infringement, and her lawyer has already been in touch. <p></p>

<p>Craig says he&apos;s spent a lot of money on Beatles memorabilia for his pub, named Lennons, that Ono now wants removed from the bar within the next 14 days! She would also like the name to be changed during that time frame. Craig says, &quot;It&apos;s ridiculous. The pub&#x2019;s been called Lennons for about five years, but the signs will be removed this week.&quot;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151654/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/13/yoko_ono_sues_l.php">2008</a> Ono threatened to sue performer Lennon Murphy for performing under her late husband&apos;s name, which incidentally, was all the performer&apos;s birth name!</p>
