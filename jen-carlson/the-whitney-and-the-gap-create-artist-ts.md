The retailers aren&apos;t quite trying to set up shop in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172931/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/03/the_whitney.php">the new downtown outlet</a>, but they are getting their T&apos;s imprinted with famous artist designs thanks to the museum (and the nonprofit Art Production Fund). </p>

<p>The Artist Editions T-Shirts feature 13 contemporary artists who were previous Whitney Biennial participants: Chuck Close, Jeff Koons, Marilyn Minter, Kiki Smith, Cai Guo-Qiang, Barbara Kruger, Ashley Bickerton, Kenny Scharf, Glenn Ligon, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Kerry James Marshall, Hanna Liden and Sarah Sze. </p>

<p>The shirts have just been made available online; coming in two styles (women&#x2019;s open-neck tee and a men&#x2019;s crewneck) they&apos;ll run you about $28 to $38. They&apos;re also available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172931/http://www.theshophound.typepad.com//the_shophound/2008/03/its-tee-time-at.html">the Whitney bookstore</a>. </p>

<p>Is this the only thing available for purchase at both the Whitney bookstore <em>and</em> the Paramus Mall?</p>
