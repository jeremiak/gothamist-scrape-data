<p>The Huxtable Family was really known for their style, all around&#x2014;remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605081209/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crnPfls0fHw">Theo&apos;s &quot;designer&quot; shirt</a>? But a new Tumblr is focusing on the matriarch of the family: Clair Huxtable. It&apos;s called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605081209/http://clairhuxtable.tumblr.com/">Clair Huxtable: Mom Style Icon</a>, and features an ongoing Q&amp;A; about Clair&apos;s style, and photos from the show featuring her looks with some commentary (&quot;accordion pleating across the back spilling over to create a bunchy fold over the perfectly tight sash-belt!&quot;). From tunics to Tina Turner costumes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605081209/http://clairhuxtable.tumblr.com/">click forth</a> and enjoy&#x2014;even if it is just a rip-off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605081209/http://clairscloset.tumblr.com/">of Clair&apos;s Closet</a>. Hopefully they&apos;ll get to the &quot;tacky barrette&quot; one day: </p>
