One of the wild animals killed a pet poodle in Rye this week, just about 20 miles outside of the city. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195959/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/new_york_state/coyote-kills-pet-poodle-in-westchester-20100402-akd">MyFox5</a>, the poodle was tied up outside a retirement home Wednesday night. A witness called the police to report the attack, but when the authorities arrived, they found only the lifeless dog&apos;s carcass. The coyote was seen running off... perhaps <em>towards the city</em>? We&apos;re expected to see a coyote boom here sometime around this fall, and a few brave ones have already gone urban this year. It&apos;s worth noting that our recent visitors have also attacked humans; late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195959/http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/10/29/canada.singer.killed/index.html">last year</a> a Canadian singer/songwriter was killed by coyotes in Nova Scotia.</p>
