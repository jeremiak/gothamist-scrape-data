Okay, it was just a small fire, but it evacuated the store as thick, black smoke traveled throughout floors. One tourist said, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know why they didn&#x2019;t immediately evacuate the [entire] building. I was very scared.&quot; <p></p>

There were no injuries reported (just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054521/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/12/21/2009-12-21_fire_forces_5000_holiday_shoppers_to_flee_macys.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">some damage to merchandise</a>), so as far as we know, Santa is doing just fine; and the store is now open 24 hours a day until Christmas Eve.</p>
