All in all there are around 1,200 &quot;new&quot; photos being hosted on the museum&apos;s website, all from photographer Edmund V. Gillon, who documented New York City in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200548/http://gothamist.com/tags/1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200548/http://gothamist.com/tags/1980s">1980s </a>.</p>

<p>They museum says &quot;the bulk of the collection is architectural in nature, portraying the city&#x2019;s historic districts, landmarks, architectural ornamentation, and civic sculpture. His photographs bring to life not only the countless readily apparent changes that have taken place in the city&#x2019;s urban landscape over the past several decades, but also the many subtle changes that transformed neighborhoods such as SoHo, Tribeca, and DUMBO as they transitioned, building by building, from gritty wastelands into the vibrant urban oases they have become.&quot;</p>
