										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232412/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/08/new_yorks_hit_f.html">Brooklyn Vegan</a> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232412/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=domesticNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-08T214227Z_01_N08191823_RTRUKOC_0_US-PROPERTY-HITFACTORY.xml&amp;archived=False">Reuters</a>) reports that New York&apos;s Hit Factory studio will be turned into condos. The building, which is on West 54th Street between Ninth and 10th, closed in 2005. Prior to that musicians like John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Madonna and U2 recorded there. This place should be a museum, not someone&apos;s $1 million bachelor pad.</p>

</p><p>The seven recording studios and five mastering suites, one space seen above, will now be replaced with kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms. According to Reuters, there will be &quot;27 units, from one-bedroom apartments to penthouse duplexes with private terraces. Prices will range from about $1.1 million to more than $4 million...expected to open in early 2007.&quot;</p>
