<p>On HBO&apos;s <em>Girls</em>, Hannah Horvath shares a two-bedroom rental in Greenpoint, where her roommate is mostly responsible for the rent. But Hannah&apos;s world is nowhere near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508183829/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a>&apos;s, the 25-year-old that created her. Dunham just bought her own digs in &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508183829/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/09/lena_dunham_girls_guide_to_going_ou.php">Grown Up Brooklyn</a>&quot;&#x2014;moving out of her parent&apos;s Manhattan home and settling into a Brooklyn Heights one-bedroom of her own. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508183829/http://realestalker.blogspot.com/2012/06/afternoon-tidbit-lena-dunham-buys-in.html">the Real Estate Stalker</a>, Dunham (who attended St. Ann&apos;s in the neighborhood) purchased her 800-square-foot, top floor apartment for $500,000. They also note it&apos;s a &quot;1 bedroom and 1 bathroom co-operative apartment on the top floor of Mansion House, a large and dignified, pre-war doorman building&quot; that was built in the 1930s. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508183829/http://www.elliman.com/new-york-city/mansion-house-145-hicks-street-unit-a47-brooklyn-nrxunur">Here&apos;s a look</a> inside a recently sold one bedroom in the building.)</p>

<p>It&apos;s all very appropriate, since (according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508183829/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2007/07/historic-height/">to Brownstoner</a>) Mansion House was built on the site of a former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508183829/http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&amp;strucID=690511&amp;imageID=801195&amp;word=Universities%20%26%20colleges%20--%20New%20York%20(State)%20--%20New%20York&amp;s=3&amp;notword=&amp;d=&amp;c=&amp;f=2&amp;k=0&amp;lWord=&amp;lField=&amp;sScope=&amp;sLevel=&amp;sLabel=&amp;sort=&amp;total=254&amp;num=100&amp;imgs=20&amp;pNum=&amp;pos=101">Brooklyn Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies</a>&#x2014;a 19th Century finishing school.</p>
