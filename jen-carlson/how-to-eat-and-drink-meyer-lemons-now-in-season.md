title: How To Eat And Drink Meyer Lemons, Now In Season
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205154/http://gothamist.com/tags/meyerlemon">Meyer lemons</a> are back in season, and should be pretty easy to find through March. We called around this morning and they can currently be found at all NYC Trader Joe&apos;s, Whole Foods, and the Gourmet Garage. If you&apos;re unfamiliar with the citrus fruit, they&apos;re basically a cross between a regular lemon and an orange, meaning you won&apos;t pucker your lips too much if you bite into one. Because of their even blend of sweetness and tartness, they can be used in <em>so many recipes</em>, both food and drink, and sweet and savory. Below you can find a few ways to utilize the seasonal treat...</p>

<p><strong>PRESERVED MEYER LEMONS</strong></p>

<p>There are many ways to preserve Meyer lemons, and last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205154/http://gardenofeatingblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/preserved-meyer-lemons-moroccan-style.html">the Garden of Eating</a> did them up Moroccan Style. For this, all you need is &quot;6-8 Meyer lemons, washed and dried; Salt (use either kosher salt or a coarse sea salt, do NOT use table salt); and a sterilized quart jar with lid.&quot; (Other recipes include adding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205154/http://www.gourmet.com/recipes/1990s/1999/12/preservedmeyerlemons">olive oil</a>.) But you know what&apos;s even better? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205154/http://www.thepauperedchef.com/2008/02/two-ways-to-pre.html">Meyer Lemon Marmalade</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MEYER LEMON WHISKEY SOUR</strong> (from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205154/http://www.thekitchn.com/meyer-lemon-whiskey-sour-a-sun-136152">The Kitchn</a>)</p><ul><li>1 1/2 ounces whiskey (rye or bourbon)<br>
</li><li>1 ounce freshly squeezed Meyer lemon juice <br>
</li><li>1/4 to 1/2 ounce simple syrup<br>
</li><li>Maraschino cherry for optional garnish</li></ul>Since the Maraschino cherry is probably the most disgusting food item in existence, might we recommend a different garnish? Try sage; an orange slice; or a toothpick garnish featuring a small kumquats, blackberries, or blueberries.<p></p>

<p>And here&apos;s that <strong>MEYER LEMON PIZZA</strong> recipe again:</p>

<p>First you&apos;ll need some dough (we like Smitten Kitchen&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205154/http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/01/pizza-and-the-limits-of-diy/">simple dough recipe</a>)</p><ul><li>Put some cornmeal on a pan, and place your 1/4-inch thick, round crust on top<br>
</li><li>Brush the dough with olive oil<br>
</li><li>Sprinkle on cheese (we prefer Fontina)<br>
</li><li>Place thinly-sliced Meyer lemons and red onions on top<br>
</li><li>Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano<br>
</li><li>Sprinkle on some herbs (thyme or rosemary or BOTH work nicely)<br>
</li><li>Bake at 400&#xBA;F for 20-25 minutes</li></ul><p></p>
