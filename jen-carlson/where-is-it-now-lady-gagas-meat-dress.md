<p>Can you believe it was only last year that Lady Gaga donned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144355/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/lady_gaga_distracts_from_scandal_wi.php">that meat dress</a> to the VMAs? Well, it <em>was</em>, but now that meat dress is at least nine months old, so surely it&apos;s been thrown away or burned by now, right? Wrong-o! The dress has been <em>cured</em>, as in jerky, and is being donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

<p><em>Cure</em>-ators there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144355/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665885/lady-gaga-meat-dress.jhtml">say</a>, &quot;It&apos;s going to be in a case and we are putting some canisters in there to control the humidity, and then we have this other canister that soaks up the glutens. But it&apos;s in a sealed case and we have the gels to control the environment in there.&quot; So there you have it, Lady Gaga&apos;s dress is now a giant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144355/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXTagE7BtRU">Slim Jim</a>. Gross.</p>
