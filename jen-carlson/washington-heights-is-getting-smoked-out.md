title: Washington Heights is Getting Smoked Out
---

	
										<p>Thick black smoke hovering above Washington Heights is apparently a common occurrence, but it is <em>legal</em>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165345/http://thegayrecluse.com/2008/03/23/on-671-west-162nd-street-no-smoking-please/">The Gay Recluse</a> has some photos of the area and says it&apos;s the result of &quot;improperly maintained or outdated boiler systems,&quot; with one building in particular being a main culprit (671 West 162nd Street). Has anyone seen something similar, or worse? This certainly can&apos;t be helping with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165345/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/13/wheezing_throug.php">rising asthma problem</a>.</p>
