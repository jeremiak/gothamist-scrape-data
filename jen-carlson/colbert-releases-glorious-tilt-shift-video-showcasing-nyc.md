<p>In August, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153816/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> was filming the intro for his <em>Late Show</em> program, but certain shoots from around the city didn&apos;t make it to the final cut. Namely, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153816/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/16/video_stephen_colbert_brings_balloo.php">the Union Square shoot</a> that a few Gothamist editors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153816/https://twitter.com/lindsayism/status/664866380580286465">were a part of</a>. Today, Colbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153816/https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/664853676222115841">tweeted out</a> the Director&apos;s Cut, which is 2.5 minutes of glorious tilt shift action taken around NYC, including that Union Square shoot.
