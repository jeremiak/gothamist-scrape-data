										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpBHru5nAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522163631im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpBHru5nAM.jpg" width="258" height="257" class="image-left"> </span>About 24-hours after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522163631/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/terror_suspect_shahzad_talking_waiv.php">Times Square terror scare</a>, firefighters and the NYPD bomb squad rushed to a storefront at 1133 Broadway after getting calls from people who thought they saw a bomb inside. What they found, however, was an art display that included a fog machine, a fake time bomb and vials of liquid (turns out it was perfume) that looked like pipe bombs. </p>

<p>The unfortunate piece was created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522163631/http://lisakirkprojects.com/project.cfm?kirk_id=73">artist Lisa Kirk</a>, and the perfume inside is called &quot;Revolution,&quot; which is meant to smell like smoke, gasoline, tear gas, burnt rubber and decaying flesh. </p>

<p>Kirk told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522163631/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/art_attack_in_window_is_just_scare_MMcDidXVlbqnMr9NscyWZP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, &quot;I feel really bad that that happened. I know they&apos;re really busy... There are more important things to deal with than some art installation.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently there&apos;s an added written explanation next to the display noting that it&apos;s just art. Up next: terrorists writing handwritten letter decoys.</p>
