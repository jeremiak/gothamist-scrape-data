Not a bad price for a castle, 12,000-square-feet of living space and a 62.5 x 100-foot lot. Originally built in 1888 for the co-founder of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, the freestanding structure is saturated with plenty of luxurious details throughout the interior (stained glass, hand-carved wood), but is said to need significant repairs. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506224408/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122661419665725939.html">Wall Street Journal</a> reports that it was purchased by a former funeral home director in 1951 (Marguerite Blake, who still lives there with her niece), but only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506224408/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bailey_House">Wikipedia</a> says the house was actually a mortuary at one point&#x2014;so we&apos;re guessing there&apos;s <em>probably</em> no need to bring in the Ghostbusters. Check out more photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506224408/http://harlemhybrid.blogspot.com/2009/05/bailey-house.html">at Harlem Hybrid</a>, who just went on an open house tour.</p>
