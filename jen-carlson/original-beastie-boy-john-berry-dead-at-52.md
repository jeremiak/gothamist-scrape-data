title: Original Beastie Boy John Berry Dead At 52
---

	
										<p>John Berry, an original member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090715/http://gothamist.com/tags/thebeastieboys">the Beastie Boys</a>, died Thursday morning at a hospice in Massachusetts, his father confirmed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090715/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/original-beastie-boys-member-john-berry-dead-at-52-20160519#ixzz49CBi4zWA">Rolling Stone</a>. He was 52 years old, and had been suffering from frontal lobe dementia, a rare form of dementia that occurs when the frontal lobes of the brain begin to atrophy. His condition had reportedly deteriorated in recent months.</p>

<p>The origin story of the Beastie Boys starts around 1978, when Michael Diamond, Jeremy Shatan, Kate Schellenbach, and John Berry started a hardcore punk band called The Young Aborigines. By 1981, Shatan left, Adam Yauch joined, and they became the Beastie Boys&#x2014;a name that Berry is credited as coming up with. </p>

<p>In &apos;82 the band released their first EP, <em>Polly Wog Stew</em> (recorded at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090715/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/04/beastie_boys_tour.php">171A studios</a>), but shortly after, Berry left. This was just before the band released their 12-inch <em>Cookie Puss</em> and, in 1985, they would go on tour with Madonna and release their debut album <em>License to Ill</em>. Berry was replaced with Horovitz, Schellenbach had also left by this time, and the trio became the Beastie Boys you know today. They would always credit Berry, however, as being a part of it. </p>

<p>In 2012, the Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where Horovitz read a speech by the late Adam Yauch. &quot;To John Berry,&quot; Horovitz read, &quot;[and] to John Berry&apos;s loft on 100th and Broadway, where John&apos;s dad would bust in during our first practices screaming, &apos;Would you turn that fucking shit off already!&apos;&quot;</p>

<blockquote>John was like my first high school older brother. He was a grade older than me and was my first teacher of all things punk. When I would be unsure about sneaking out of the house to go to a Bad Brains or Gang Of Four show, he would just give me this look and say &quot;c&apos;mon&quot; and I was in.  He showed me what a lack of fear and some reckless abandon could look like.  I will forever owe him that debt of punk inspiration. He may have quickly become disinterested when the band became more involved in hip-hop &#x2014; which is why he soon left, but he always followed his own intuitive lead. - Mike</blockquote>
