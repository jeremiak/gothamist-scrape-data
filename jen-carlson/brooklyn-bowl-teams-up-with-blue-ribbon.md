										<p>Earlier this month news of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171259/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/10/rock_n_bowl_in_williamsburg.php">Brooklyn Bowl</a> opening in Williamsburg started to spread. The bowling alley, located over by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171259/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/12/the_gutter.php">The Gutter</a> and right next to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171259/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/20/hard_for_brooklyn_brewery_to_find_a.php">Brooklyn Brewery</a>, is also a venue, and has promised to offer up some grub once they open in the fall. So far former Wetlands owner Peter Shapiro and manager Charley Ryan, who are opening the joint, have been hush hush about the dining options at the place, but now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171259/http://eater.com/archives/2008/07/blue_ribbon_to_operate_in_brooklyn_bowl.php">Eater reports</a> that they&apos;ll have &quot;a full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171259/http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/">Blue Ribbon</a> menu.&quot; The downside? The menu <em>might</em> only be served in the VIP section, which (if true) would seriously harsh the vibe, Wetlands dudes.</p>
