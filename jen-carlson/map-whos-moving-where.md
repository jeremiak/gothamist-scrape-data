</div></div>					<p>The people at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205050631/http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/migration-moving-wealthy-interactive-counties-map.html">Forbes</a>, with the help of some Internal Revenue Service data, have created an interactive map tracking where Americans moved during 2008. </p>

<p>The red lines indicate outward movement, while the black lines indicate inward movement, and they&apos;ve separated everything into counties, so you can get a good look at the movement trends in to and out of Queens, Bronx, Kings, Richmond and New York counties. (Poor Staten Island, looks like they lose this round.) Another feature: you can click on certain spots on the map to find out exact numbers&#x2014;for example, 14,581 people moved from Queens County to Kings County that year, with 21,054 moving from Kings to Queens.</p>

<p>For fun, and to perpetuate the coastal rivalry, we added the Los Angeles county map&#x2014;looks like they lost a lot more residents than NYC that year.</p>
