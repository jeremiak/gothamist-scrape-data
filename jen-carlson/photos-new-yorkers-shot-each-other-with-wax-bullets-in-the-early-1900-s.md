</div></div>					<p>Before there was paintball (which wasn&apos;t around until the 1980s), there was the much more painful game of wax bullet dueling! In the early 1900s, those who pined for the days of <em>real</em> duels decided to keep the practice alive, and this was their solution. </p>

<p>Wax bullet dueling started in Paris as a form of simulation training, then came <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608004707/http://cemeterysgunblob.com/2012/05/18/bloodless-dueling-with-wax-bullets/">to the States</a> as a recreational sport, where the &quot;bloodless duel&quot; seemed to have established itself in New York City with the help of the Carnegie Sword and Pistol Club and the New York Athletic Club.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="waxbulnyt01.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608004707im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/waxbulnyt01.jpeg" width="640" height="383" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608004707/http://www.bartitsu.org/index.php/2011/12/paintball-edwardian-style-bloodless-duelling-with-wax-bullets-circa-1908/">Bartitsu</a>, the sport wasn&apos;t always &quot;bloodless,&quot; however, despite the leather protective garments and face masks the participants would wear&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608004707/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19080824&amp;id=RQsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zUgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3289,4669269">at least one man</a> had a wax bullet go through his hand. The shooter was Walter Winans, who told the NY Times in 1908, &quot;There is a very real danger in this wax, or rather composition bullet, shooting at each other. When I first tired it several years ago, I shot out the soft piece of flesh connecting the thumb and forefinger of the right hand of Mr. Gustave Vouiquin... he tells me it still pains him when he has a lot of writing to do.&quot; He also talked about being a believer in a the duel:</p>

<p>Though Winans would say only experts should try their hand at the wax bullet dueling, the bullets were &quot;widely available on the civilian market and by the early 1900s they were used for indoor practice and in shooting galleries,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608004707/http://www.firearmstalk.com/entries/The-1909-New-York-Wax-Bullet-Duel.html">FireArmsTalk</a>.</p>

<p>The photos in the above gallery were taken outside of Carnegie Hall, of &quot;two gentlemen dueling with 44 caliber black powder percussion dueling pistols loaded with wax bullets.&quot; Those men were Dr. Graeme M. Hammond, President of the Amateur Fencing League of America and Mr. CB Miller of Columbia University&#x2019;s Sports Club. The duel ended in a draw.
