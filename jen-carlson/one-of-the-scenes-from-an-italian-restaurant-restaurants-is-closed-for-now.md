<p>On Monday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140425090131/http://www.yelp.com/biz/christianos-restaurant-syosset">Christiano&#x2019;s restaurant</a> in Syosset closed. Some joint on Long Island closed, big deal, right? Well, the place has a little bit of history: it&apos;s been called the inspiration for Billy Joel&apos;s &quot;Scenes From An Italian Restaurant.&quot; Though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140425090131/http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2831">others say</a> the inspiration was the now-shuttered Fontana di Trevi at 151 West 57th Street, (someone from Long Island put on) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140425090131/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenes_from_an_Italian_Restaurant">Wikipedia</a> that it is Christiano&apos;s, noting: &quot;On May 6, 1977, before the song&apos;s official release, Joel premiered it at Long Island University C.W. Post Campus. He dedicated the song to Christiano&apos;s restaurant, located in Syosset, New York.&quot;</p>

<p>BUT... last year Joel admitted he was &quot;going for applause&quot; when he made that dedication&#x2014;&quot;It was like saying &apos;Yankees&apos; when you&apos;re playing in New York.&quot; </p>

<p>Back to Christiano&apos;s, which at least for one night was The Restaurant... according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140425090131/http://long-island.newsday.com/restaurants/feed-me-1.812004/christiano-s-billy-joel-s-syosset-inspiration-closes-1.7200978">to Newsday</a>, the Singh Hospitality Group announced its plans to give the restaurant a makeover last year, and company president Harendra Singh says, &#x201C;Whatever we do, he [the Billy Joel memorabilia] will always be a part of it&quot;... though according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140425090131/http://syosset.patch.com/groups/business-news/p/christiano-s-to-close">Patch</a> it probably won&apos;t even be an Italian restaurant anymore.</p>

<p>So from this point forward, the Italian Restaurant&#x2014;until Joel declares otherwise&#x2014;is just Whatever Italian Restaurant You Go To, probably.</p>
