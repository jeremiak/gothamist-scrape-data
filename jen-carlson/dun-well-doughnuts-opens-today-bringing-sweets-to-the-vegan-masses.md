<p>Dun-well Doughnuts (who brought us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160704044625/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/09/a_faux_vs_foie_gras_doughnut_taste-.php">the Faux Gras Doughnut</a>) is finally opening its doors today! The East Williamsburg storefront is located at 222 Montrose Avenue, and proprietors Christopher Hollowell and Daniel Dunbar say it&apos;s the premiere vegan doughnut shop on planet Earth! They note, &quot;Vegans and those with egg and dairy dietary restrictions often sacrifice flavor and texture to satisfy their sweet cravings, but Dun-well Doughnuts allows them to enjoy fried doughy delights along with their non-vegan friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Hollowell tells us they&apos;ll have over 50 varieties of doughnuts, costing about $2.50 each, with rotating flavors&#x2014;from Earl Grey Tea to Mexican Chocolate to Lavender Lemon. And they will be serving up the Faux Gras Doughnut on certain days as well. </p>

<p>Their doughnuts have been available at cafes around the city for some time, and they&apos;re pretty amazing, so we suggest you stop by&#x2014;their hours are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
