The late musician&apos;s partner, Tom Lee (pictured to the right of Arthur), is a major voice in the film. Still living in their East Village apartment, he recently talked to us about what life with Arthur was like, and how it has changed since he died in 1992. The film plays at MoMA tonight and December 19, and is just one of the many ways Arthur is still being celebrated today.</em></p>

<p><strong>When did you meet Arthur?</strong> I met Arthur in the summer of 1978.  I had just moved into New York from New Jersey and I was working on West 29th St for a fine art silk screen printing company.  Through contacts at work I found a cheap studio on Avenue A, between 12th and 13th streets.  I used to come home each day on the R train and walk along St. Mark&#x2019;s Place.  I started to notice Arthur on the phone along the wall of the Gem Spa, a newspaper and magazine store.  I was also going out to some bars and clubs to hear music with college friends and it seemed over the course of a few weeks I would spot him.  It intrigued me that I kept noticing him and I became determined to say hello and meet him.  When I think back to that time I think I was looking for a way to make some friends in New York and he seemed like a good place to start!  </p>

<p>Finally one night I saw him at the Gem Spa buying an ice cream around 2 in the morning on my way home from the club, Hurrah&#x2019;s.  I followed him a bit and we began to talk.  In the week that followed I saw him again on the phone and he didn&#x2019;t have a pencil but gave my number to his friend Ernie, with whom he was talking.  We soon started to hang out together, either at his apartment on East 12th Street, where I live now, or at my apartment on Avenue A.  The advantage to staying at my apartment was that I had a telephone and electricity.  </p>

<p>At the time Arthur was working on contrasting sounds of the male and female vocals of &#x201C;Is It All Over My Face?&#x201D;, which I found very odd compared to the music that I favored, but we fell into each other&#x2019;s worlds quite easily.  We went to see music together, usually people who he knew or groups I was interested in.  We&#x2019;d go to places such as The Kitchen, Tier 3 and CBGB.</p>
