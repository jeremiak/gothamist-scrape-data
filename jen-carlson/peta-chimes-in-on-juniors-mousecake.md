										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpdrwn5nPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155409im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpdrwn5nPM.jpg" width="350" height="206" class="image-right"> </span>Following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155409/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/mice_love_juniors_cheesecake_too.php">Junior&apos;s mousecake</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155409/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/21/juniors.php">incident</a>, PETA has sent an urgent open letter to owner Alan Rosen, asking that he only use humane, non-lethal rodent control (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155409/http://www.petacatalog.com//products/Humane_Smart_Mousetrap-117-25.html">this cute house</a>). Yet there&apos;s no word of a letter to Delta after the airline was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155409/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/mouse_attack_at_jfk.php">infiltrated by a furry friend</a> earlier this week!</p>

<p>The organization points out that &quot;using lethal traps or poisons to kill mice and other small animals is not only cruel but also ineffective because as long as conditions remain inviting, other animals will simply move in to replace those who are killed.&quot; Plus, those glue traps are just disturbing, even for the humans who have to handle them.</p>

<p>The full letter is after the jump, but we loved this Disney-esque section, which notes that mice &quot;communicate with each other, play together, wrestle, and love sleeping curled up together. They are also good parents,&quot; and sometimes help Cinderella hem her ball gowns.</p>
