<p>Last week beloved supermarket wonderland Stew Leonard&apos;s (which has locations in Connecticut and Yonkers, NY) announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134150/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/are_you_ready_for_the_croissant-bag.php">they have created a Crogel</a>, a croissant-bagel hybrid. The item is only available at their Norwalk, CT store for now, and while that&apos;s a pretty quick trip on MetroNorth, we hoped to find a similar version in the five boroughs. Success! And by success we mean derivative dead horse trend flogging forever!</p>

<p>Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134150/http://www.thebagelstoreonline.com/">Bagel Store</a> (located on Bedford and South 4th Street) alerted us to their Cragels, which are actually quite different from Stew&apos;s Crogel, as they bake a &quot;delicate, flaky, buttery croissant&quot; <em>into a bagel</em>. It is truly a hybrid, made up of 50% croissant and 50% bagel. The store&apos;s Ross Helrich told us, &quot;Our first prototype came out this past July, it was then introduced to food aficionados and Bagel lovers in September&quot;... that&apos;s over four months of <em>no one telling us about these things</em>. You guys know we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134150/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">a tips line</a>, right? Obviously, we had to try them...</p>

<p>The Cragels are $2.95 each, and come in one flavor, which we&apos;ll call Classic Cragel.  They&apos;re being scooped up fast, but we managed to score four before 8 a.m. today. No line. How are they? A little sweet and sticky on the outside, but otherwise they are Just Fine. We wouldn&apos;t complain if they were a little more croissant than they are bagel, but if you&apos;re more into the latter these are for you. </p>

<p>We got ours just as they came out of the oven, so they were soft, warm, and with a nice contrasting crispier protective layer. While reactions among Gothamist staffers were mostly measured, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134150/http://twitter.com/laurenfaceevans">Lauren Evans</a> declared: &quot;These are delicious. In a Cronut v. Cragel smackdown these should hands-down win.&quot; We should also note that Ms. Evans mistook the butter for cream cheese, and prepared hers with a healthy serving of the spread.</p>
