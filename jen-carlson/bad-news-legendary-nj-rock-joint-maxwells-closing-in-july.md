                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="MAXWELLSRIP.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005042026im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/MAXWELLSRIP.jpg" width="640" height="396" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It has always been well worth the short trip to Hoboken to spend a night at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005042026/http://www.maxwellsnj.com/">Maxwell&apos;s</a>, which has not only offered stellar lineups, but also delicious mac n&apos; cheese throughout its decades and decades as a venue/restaurant. But sadly, the joint will close up shop on July 31st. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005042026/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2013/06/maxwells_a_hoboken_rock_instit.html#incart_m-rpt-1">NJ.com</a>, their lease is up at the end of July&#x2014;co-owner Todd Abramson (who also books the Bell House in Brooklyn) says they were &quot;offered a renewal with rates that weren&apos;t necessarily onerous,&quot; but still, &quot;after much thought, given the changing nature of Hoboken and the difficulties of trying to run a business in this town, we decided it was time.&quot;</p>

<p>But <em>whyyyyy?</em> He explained there&apos;s a lack of parking, which has been a problem, and that &quot;the culture in Hoboken is driven by reality TV now. A lot of the bars downtown are fighting with each other for who has the most giant TVs. That&apos;s what Hoboken nightlife has become.&quot;</p>

<p>To close out their time at the corner of Washington and 11th Street in Hoboken (whereabouts the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005042026/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Birthplace_of_baseball">first recorded game of baseball</a> was played&#x2014;there are bases outside of the venue), they&apos;ll be inviting back some of the first bands who ever graced the stage there. Abramson says, &quot;On July 31st, I think we&apos;re going to go out the way we came in&#x2014;with the band &apos;a&apos;.&quot; &quot;a&quot; featured members of the Bongos and Glenn Morrow, who went on to found Bar/None Records.</p>

<p>Maxwell&apos;s, though it&apos;s undergone changes during its time, opened in 1978, and has seen bands like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005042026/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/nirvana_1989_tour_footage.php">Nirvana</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005042026/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/13/liz_phair_interview.php">Liz Phair</a>, and many many many more pass through. Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005042026/http://gothamist.com/tags/yolatengo">Yo La Tengo</a>... Where are they gonna play now?</p>
