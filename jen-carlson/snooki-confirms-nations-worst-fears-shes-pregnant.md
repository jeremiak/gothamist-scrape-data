You know you&apos;re having a baby for all the right reasons if you make the announcement through an exclusive cover story that a rag probably paid you a lot of money for. And thus begins the saddest baby story ever told. </p>

<p>The 24-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174343/http://gothamist.com/tags/snooki">Snooki</a>, who may want to think about dropping her childish monicker at this point, says she is engaged to boyfriend Jionni LaValle, who is <em>allegedly</em> the father. She also reveals that she was drinking and partying heavily before she found out she was pregnant&#x2014;her first thought after taking the test was, &quot;Fuck, I&apos;ve been drinking!&apos;&quot; She told the magazine, &quot;I was worried. It was New Year&apos;s Eve and we were in Vegas, so I did go crazy.</p>

<p>Snooki is 15 weeks pregnant, meaning she&apos;s due around August/September, and is calling the life-changing event &quot;a happy accident.&quot; She also promises that she has &quot;different priorities now.&quot; For one, she won&apos;t be living with the <em>Jersey Shore</em> cast this summer... but she will be dropping by to film some scenes. You know, when she&apos;s not busy reworking contracts for her new reality show based on raising the little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174343/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/snooki_mum_on_being_a_mom_but_jerse.php">guido or guidette</a>.  So when do we get a reality show about our courageous decision not to kill ourselves before Snooki gives birth?</p>
