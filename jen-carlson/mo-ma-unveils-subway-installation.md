</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152447/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/03/moma_targets_locals.php">Earlier this month</a> MoMA started installing vague signs in the Atlantic/Pacific subway stop in Brooklyn, alluding to an exhibit on the way. Today they unveiled their publicity campaign, which saturates every ad space in the two connected stations (including the turnstiles). Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152447/http://atlanticpacific.moma.org/">accompanying website</a> explains that they&apos;ve filled the station &quot;with reproductions of over 50 works of art in the MoMA collection. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, walk through the station to see images of works by Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Charles Eames, Cindy Sherman, Andy Warhol, and many other great artists, filmmakers, and designers.&quot; This is their first large-scale campaign aimed at getting locals in to see their permanent collection, and it even comes with audio for a little tour if you&apos;re not in a rush (or stuck waiting on a train). Wonder if any Posterboy&apos;s out there will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152447/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/23/poster_boy_keeps_mashing_up_ads.php">mash-up</a> the masterpieces.</p>
