					<p>I once had a coworker who would get a delivery from Zappos what seemed like once a month. &quot;Imelda Marcos,&quot; we called him, but he was quick to explain that every delivery was a new pair of the same shoes, which the city destroyed on a regular basis. Unlike most of the country, and even unlike other cities&#x2014;like that driving town of Los Angeles&#x2014;NYC was made for walking. And that constant walking is eating our footwear.</p>

<p>What about New York City makes it difficult to keep shoes in good shape? There&apos;s the constant push of concrete ripping at the sides and soles, the puddles which feature a special NYC cocktail of chemicals, dirt, human tears, and probably rat poison. Not to mention the hustle. The bustle. And the heels getting stuck in the subway grates. Not even your sturdy Frye boots stand a chance against these urban elements; the streets win every goddamn time.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear NYC, why must you DESTROY all of my flats? I can&apos;t afford to replace all of the shoes you keep devouring, and demand answers.</p>&#x2014; Abbey Conolly (@abbeyconolly) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/https://twitter.com/abbeyconolly/status/531928597922316288">November 10, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170318221735js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Edward Shamalov, the owner of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/https://www.yelp.com/biz/azzurro-brooklyn-5">Azzuro Shoe Repair &amp; Shine</a>, broke it down for us inside his Brooklyn shop: &quot;In this city, everything&apos;s close by, so you don&apos;t have to take the bus or subway all the time, and people walk around. If you go just out of New York, even to Long Island, you&apos;re not walking. You&apos;re driving. New York City is great for walking, but bad for shoes.&quot;</p>

<p>And the winter is the worst time for your shoes&#x2014;Shamalov explains, &quot;There&apos;s a lot of salt outside, which gets on your shoes&#x2014;people don&apos;t know how to take care of their shoes, to stain protect them. The oil, grease, and salt of the street mixes with water and snow and is murder on your shoes.&quot; </p>

<p>And if you skateboard, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/fashion/25skates.html">fuggedaboutit</a>.</p>

<p>Ever since there have been shoes, there have been shoe doctors. In fact, one of &quot;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/becoming-modern/early-photography/a/daguerre-paris-boulevard/">earliest known photographs</a> of a human features a man having his shoes shined.&quot; Outside of putting your own elbow grease into it, the shoe shine and the cobbler are your only hopes for shoe preservation, always have been, always will be (they just might be replaced by anthropomorphic robots one day).</p>

<p>In 1982, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/23/style/consumer-saturday-of-winter-shoes-and-autos.html">the NY Times</a> touched upon the topic, noting&#x2014;as Shamalov did above&#x2014;that the salt is a shoe&apos;s greatest enemy, and &quot;appears on footwear as it dries, and if not removed may split, crack and destroy leather.&quot; </p>

<p>At the time, one of the oldest shoe repair shops in the city was T-O-Dey on Fifth Avenue (which is still around, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/http://www.todeyshoesnyc.com/">in a new location</a>), and the manager there, Thomas Angelo, had told the paper, &quot;Salt can destroy anything. It weakens the fibers and can totally destroy a shoe.&apos;&apos; To remove it, he said, you just need a damp cloth and a little water (but not too much), and dry them in the cool air. &quot;Do not put them in the oven, near a radiator, or even in a very hot room,&quot; he explained. &quot;Heat can warp a shoe.&apos;&apos;</p>

<p>To prevent the last gasp of winter from decimating your footwear, you can treat your shoes at home by using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/https://www.amazon.com/Moneysworth-Best-Winter-Wipes-Remover/dp/B00TV2DG0O">Winter Wipes</a> (these deal with salt and dirt removal), an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Martens-Unisex-Wonder-Balsam/dp/B000M3R2HE">oil-based protective polish</a>, and perhaps even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221735/http://jezebel.com/winter-is-hard-on-your-shoes-heres-what-to-do-about-i-1450901787">some cornmeal</a>. Beyond that, your only option is moving to a rural oasis where you can travel barefoot through the grass.</p>
