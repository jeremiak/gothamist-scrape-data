<p>If there&apos;s one show that should not have a cookbook dedicated to it, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803052154/http://laist.com/tags/gilmoregirls"><em>Gilmore Girls</em></a>. Wonderful show, but the two main characters practically made a sport out of eating poorly&#x2014;a daily meal breakdown might include: candy, pizza, coffee, more coffee, pancakes, vodka martinis, burgers, chips, more candy, and so on. The amount of terrible food Lorelai and Rory put away would have killed them by now had this been real life.</p>

<p>However, there were two good chefs creating healthier meals: whoever did Emily and Richard&apos;s cooking for the Friday night dinners, and Sookie St. James, particularly for her Dragonfly Inn meals.</p>

<p>With a <em>Gilmore Girls</em> comeback on the horizon, one woman has hitched her wagon to Stars Hollow&#x2014;Kristi Carlson (no relation), has made an <em>Eat Like A Gilmore Cookbook</em>. It&apos;s &quot;a means to combine two of my favorite things: cooking, and life in an imaginary world called Stars Hollow,&quot; she explains on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803052154/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kristicarlson/eatlikeagilmore">her Kickstarter page</a>. </p>

<p>The book&apos;s title is a little misleading, as eating like a Gilmore would include only the aforementioned garbage, while the book actually (and thankfully) includes mostly recipes imagined to be those of the chefs of Stars Hollow. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803052154/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/luke_danes_sucks_face_it.php">Even terrible Luke</a>. However, she still goes into the quirky creations that turned up or got mentions on the show, like a s&apos;mores wedding cake. The book will include three types of recipes: Items found on a menu in a small town diner (to represent Luke&apos;s), foods for Friday night dinner (at Richard and Emily&apos;s), and food served at an independent inn, like the Dragonfly. If it includes the salmon puffs prominently mentioned in a few episodes, we&apos;ll buy it.</p>
