<p>In 1972, Italian designer Massimo Vignelli redesigned George Salomon&apos;s New York Subway map, which lasted until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916234911/http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project_details.cfm?index=266&amp;id=266&amp;domain">around 1979</a>, when it was replaced by Michael Hertz&apos;s design. In 1999, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916234911/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/Subway%20signs,%20outdated/oldsigns.html">Forgotten-NY</a> discovered the old design in place at the 57th and 6th subway station; he wrote, &quot;A mid-1970s Transit Authority map is still in place, albeit behind a modern map and shielded behind plexiglass!&quot; Well, it&apos;s still there. </p>

<p>A tipster sent in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916234911/http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholashall/4977203192/in/photostream/">this photograph</a> of it taken on September 10th of this year. Of course, since 1999 the plexiglass has been covered in other posters and markings, all of which are slowly fading to reveal the Vignelli again.</p>
