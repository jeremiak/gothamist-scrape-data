Tomorrow night her and the band will end a long tour in her hometown, New York, with a show at (Le) Poisson Rouge. </em></p><em>

<p><strong>Your music seems to combine everything from rock to opera to classical, and it all has a very theatrical feel at the live show&#x2014;how did your diverse sound take shape?</strong> My parents have really wide listening palettes and the fact that we moved so many times in my life affected my listening a lot too. Environment has a lot to do with one&apos;s aesthetics. Being in New York, where there is such a huge pool of amazing classical artists like Osso, Gabriel Kahane, Clare and The Reasons and Clogs, has really created an organic environment for this kind of music to be made.  Years ago, I was seeing people like Antony, Rebecca Moore and Nina Nastasia at the Knitting Factory and they were all using strings or alternative instrumentation with their songs and it inspired me a lot to pursue my own arranging.</p>

<p><strong>Are you classically trained? How did you begin branching out?</strong> I have a degree in classical vocal performance and I studied arranging with Padma Newsome (Clogs/The National).  I was seriously writing songs in college.  I always have had my feet in a bunch of puddles at once. </p>

<p><strong>What did you listen to growing up?</strong> A lot of pop music on the radio. My dad brought home records for me from the library and the first batch I remember was Thriller, a Joan Jett album and Amy Grant. We moved to Michigan and I started listening to a lot of hip hop and R&amp;B.;</p>
