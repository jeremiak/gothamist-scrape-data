<p>In 2009 we got a small peek inside the Washington Square Arch (thanks to Curbed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074754/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/inside_the_archway.php">take a look back here</a>), and now the Wall Street Journal has infiltrated the historic structure, returning with a few <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074754/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703386704576186622072300888.html">sweet photos</a> from the inside.</p>

<p>Their writer was given a guided tour, and reports back, &quot;I found myself inside the arch, and not just inside it, having entered through a small side door in the arch&apos;s western leg, but climbing a 102-step spiral staircase toward its summit... One of the triumphs of the renovation is that the roof no longer leaks.&quot;</p>

<p>So now that it&apos;s all fixed up, <em>why can&apos;t the rest of us go up there?</em> Well, &quot;the stairway is quite dangerous and the roof is quite fragile. If we allowed the public up here, the roof would fail quite quickly.&quot; If the public <em>were</em> allowed, here&apos;s what they&apos;d see from the top: a clear shot up 5th Avenue (looking north), the Wall Street skyscrapers (to the south), and the Freedom Tower&apos;s construction. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630074754/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/04/flashback_washington_square_park_ar.php">Here&apos;s a look back</a> at the Arch&apos;s history&#x2014;it turns 116 this year!</p>
