<p>Last week not only did we have the pleasure of seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082540/http://www.myspace.com/theblackangels">The Black Angels</a> perform a few songs, but they were inside of the gorgeous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082540/http://www.orensanz.org/">Angel Orensanz</a> building at the time. This was prior to their secret show later that evening in the space, and the very talented Adam and Daniel at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082540/http://www.foglightfilms.com/">Foglight Films</a> caught their private, sun-soaked performance for us all on video. Enjoy!</p>
