According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001615/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/soup_er_rare_warhol_in_sale_apQlMA52zfVIevTyZao31M?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz13OCNuLGj">the NY Post</a>, his &quot;Big Campbell&apos;s Soup Can with Can Opener (Vegetable)&quot; piece is expected to get up to $50 million when it&apos;s on the block at Christie&apos;s next month. Auction house spokeswoman Laura Paulson told the paper that the 1962 classic is an &quot;incredibly important, very iconic work. When he painted the soup can picture... it changed the course of art history. No one had seen anyone do anything like this.&quot; There are only 11 large-scale soup can paintings, and 8 are held by museums.</p>
