<p><img alt="chapmanmug.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082714im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/chapmanmug.jpg" width="240" height="293" class="left"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082714/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/08/10/2008-08-10_lennon_killer_gets_wife_time_in_attica.html">The Daily News</a> takes a look at Mark David Chapman&apos;s time behind bars at New York&apos;s Attica Correctional Facility; the man who killed John Lennon is up for parole for a fifth time this week. In 2000, Yoko Ono <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082714/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/americas/955216.stm">wrote a letter</a> to the parole board, referring to Chapman only as &quot;the subject&quot; and asking that he not be released because &quot;With his one act of violence in those few seconds, [he] managed to change my whole life, devastate his sons, and bring deep sorrow and fear to the world.&quot; She recently reiterated those sentiments, and fears that his release would leave her family unsafe--the board has also received around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082714/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/08/06/2008-08-06_john_lennons_fans_cant_imagine_mark_davi.html">50 letters</a> from Lennon fans this time around. </p>

<p>It <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082714/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1042745/Mark-Chapman-tried-sell-album-Lennon-signed-shot-him.html">recently came out</a> that Chapman had written a letter of his own, in 1986 to a memorabilia specialist from New Jersey inquiring how much his signed Lennon album would be worth. He writes, matter-of-factly, &quot;On December 8, 1980 I shot and killed John Lennon. Before this, earlier in the afternoon, I had asked him to sign his <em>Double Fantasy</em> album. He did this, also signing the date: 1980. I then placed this album behind the security guard&apos;s booth where it was found after my arrest.&quot; He continues on to write that he has tried to get the item back, and insinuates that ultimately he would like to profit from it. </p>

<p><em>Meanwhile</em>, the News also reports that Chapman &quot;has been enjoying conjugal visits with his wife [Gloria Hiroko Chapman] for at least 16 years&quot; of the 28 he&apos;s been imprisoned. Under the Family Reunion program, he &quot;gets to spend 44 hours straight with his wife in a special modular private homelike setting.&quot; Allegedly she visits about once a year.</p>
