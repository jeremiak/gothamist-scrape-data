<p>Sure, office curmudgeon John Del Signore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081149/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/no_more_no_pants_subway_ride_please.php">railed against The No Pants Subway Ride</a> earlier this week, but we&apos;re happy to report that he&apos;s been coming in to the office <em>sans</em> pants all week and it has really turned him around on this whole thing. So we lift our ban, for now, on No Pants Subway Ride coverage... because we don&apos;t really have a ban on <em>coverage</em>, just a desire to see them take it to the next level. And yes, there&apos;s MORE to say! Actually, there&apos;s nothing more to say. What you just read was FILLER, all we&apos;ve really got is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081149/http://improveverywhere.com/2012/01/11/no-pants-subway-ride-2012">this new video</a> of the action. Enjoy!</p>
