But now a new Disney game promises to be a new kind of spirit guide, simulating the New York City experience for each player, giving tips on how to &quot;climb the social ladder and make your dreams come true!&quot; The program will also strip away your authenticity and uniqueness and transform you from &quot;country bumpkin to glamour girl.&quot; And if you do it right, there&apos;s probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207033920/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/do_over_carrie_bradshaw_math.php">no pesky math</a> required.</p>

<p>We dipped into the simulated life, to find the protagonist&#x2014;a transplant from Small Town, USA&#x2014;in a modest apartment (described by the creators as a &quot;grungy studio&quot;), however, as you work your way up you can land a Park Avenue penthouse. The two &quot;glamorous&quot; career paths offered are fashion designer and chef, and your new &quot;fabulous friends&quot; include &quot;a child of privilege,&quot; and an array of other materialistic social climbers.... who sometimes go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207033920/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=579217532088645&amp;set=a.470431586300574.115106.468091813201218&amp;type=1&amp;theater">this &quot;rustic&quot; cafe</a> that may or may not be in Williamsburg.
