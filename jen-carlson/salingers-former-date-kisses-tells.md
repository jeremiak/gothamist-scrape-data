Salinger</a> kept his life well-guarded, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150903001019/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/28/rip_jd_salinger.php">his passing</a> some bits of it are now popping up in print. Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150903001019/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/green-eyes-pretty-mouth-and-a-strangers-kiss/">the NY Times</a> talks to one Upper East Side woman, now 83 years old, who once went on a blind date with the author.</p>

<p>In 1946, the then 20-year-old Alice Sheba (a pen name) accepted an invitation for a double date from a colleague and her husband (Salinger&apos;s literary agent at the time); the foursome went to dinner followed by dancing at the Village Vanguard. Salinger was going through a divorce at the time&#x2014;from his first wife Sylvia (a French woman he met in Europe&#x2014;and Sheba still lived with her parents. </p>

<p>She recalls, &#x201C;I knew that sexually speaking, I knew nothing. I was inexperienced and it was going to stay that way.&#x201D; She did get a kiss from the author that night, however, who would go on to publish <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> years later. He would also go on to write the short story &#x201C;Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes,&#x201D; which she thinks could be about her&#x2014;as that was the color of the eyeshadow she wore on her one and only date with the man she knew as &quot;Jerry.&quot;</p>
