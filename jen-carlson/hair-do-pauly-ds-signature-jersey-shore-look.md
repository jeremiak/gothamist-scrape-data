While Snooki is clearly the breakout star, today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045951/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/12/21/2009-12-21_secrets_of_a_guido_jersey_shore_star_shows_news_how_he_takes_hair_to_heights.html">the Daily News</a> focuses on Pauly D &#x2014; declaring his hair style could be the next &quot;Rachel.&quot; <p></p>

<p>He told the paper, &quot;Before the show, I always stood out because of my hair. Now, perfect strangers are coming up to me and asking how I do it.&quot; <em>Who are these strangers?</em> If you are one of them, you&apos;ll be happy to know that he describes just how to get his signature blowout look. First, you&apos;re gonna need a bigger tub of hair gel &#x2014; specifically Joico&apos;s Ice Spiker, a water-resistant &quot;styling glue&quot; that will give you a &quot;cement finish.&quot; Pauly D likens it to Elmer&apos;s glue, and says to finish off the look you&apos;ll also need a nice dose of Glued Spiking Freeze spray (which is a real product). By the end of the 25 minute process, you too can have a Solid Glue Crown on your head.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Snooki is appearing at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045951/http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs042.snc3/12949_379061290401_505590401_10278491_7495418_n.jpg">this party</a> on Long Island tomorrow night, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045951/http://twitter.com/Sn00ki/status/6891607588">has announced</a> that she is <em>right now</em> in NYC... &quot;to do work....and party. ;)&quot; Too bad she didn&apos;t make it earlier to surprise SNL&apos;s Bobby Moynihan while he was portraying her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045951/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/clips/update-snookie/1187091/">on the show this weekend</a>.</p>
