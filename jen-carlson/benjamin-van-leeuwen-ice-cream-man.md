Made with meticulously sourced ingredients and an emphasis on sustainability (the ice cream comes in cups produced from Bagasse, a chemical-free fiber made from sugar cane; the spoons are made from cornhusks), it&apos;s a dessert that&apos;s as delicious as it is conscientious. Benjamin Van Leeuwen, the young founder of the company, recently told us a little bit about what sets his artisanal product apart from the others.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did the idea for the truck come about?</strong> I used to drive a Good Humor ice cream truck, but I never enjoyed eating that ice cream.  I have always been obsessed food and how great ingredients are produced. I am very interested in the biodynamic and slow food movement, basically food that is produced in a traditional way, where the focus is quality rather than efficiency.  I needed an outlet for this.  I chose ice cream, as it is one of the few things that can be produced on a large scale without any degradation of quality. I wanted to re-energize the ice cream truck and sell, not good ice cream, but incredible ice cream out of it. </p>

<p><strong>How have the flavors been decided?</strong> I wanted to do classic flavors as well as they could possibly be done. I wanted to showcase the wonderful intricacies of flavors like chocolate, vanilla and Pistachio. I think this can be done well by keeping it simple.  And when it is simple, it is harder to hide blase ingredients. Since we only use the best, we can keep them basic.  It&apos;s like eating a really good local organic fresh carrot; you can eat it raw on its own.  A generic grocery store carrot would have to be roasted in duck fat to taste good.  Some of our flavors chose themselves, in the sense that I found the flavor and decided it was so good that we absolutely had to incorporate it into ice cream.  This was the case with the Hudson Valley red currants and the Piedmont hazelnuts. </p>

<p><strong>Are there any upcoming flavors we could look forward to?</strong> Caramel, Banana and Pumpkin. </p>
