The ice cream is known for its rich flavor and dense texture, which it definitely lived up to when we sampled each and every flavor they sent to Gothamist HQ (it&apos;s a living) last week. The pints (currently on sale at $4.99 a piece) come in Black Raspberry Chip (their signature flavor), Chocolate Chocolate Chip, Mint Chocolate Chip, Mocha Chocolate Chip and Vanilla Chocolate Chip. <p></p>

<p>But why is this such a big deal? Friend of Gothamist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201442/http://twitter.com/conrad">Conrad Doucette</a>, who hails from Cincinnati, tells us: &quot;It&apos;s very rich, with a high percentage of butterfat, a sturdy, well-built product from a bygone age&#x2014;something appreciated in somewhat conservative Cincinnati. Graeter&apos;s is justly beloved for its lush character and timeless flavors. It&apos;s not trendy in the slightest, but it&apos;s one of the most heavenly ice creams you&apos;ll ever have.&quot;</p>

<p>And how do they do it? We&apos;re told Graeter&#x2019;s is made using the French pot method&#x2014;&quot;a slow, small batch process that makes it completely different from everyone else&#x2019;s. Each batch (only 2 gallons at a time) is hand-crafted and so thick it must be hand-packed into containers.&quot; Bonus: The company, founded in 1870 by Bavarian immigrants Regina and Louis Graeter, is still a family owned and run business today.</p>

<p>Grater&#x2019;s Ice Cream will be in all 12 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201442/http://www.fairwaymarket.com/">Fairway Markets</a> in the tri-state area.</p>
