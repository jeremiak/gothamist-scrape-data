										<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141104070959/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/12/video_staten_island_ferry.php">January 12th, 2011</a>, we caught our first glimpse of a girl dancing on the Staten Island Ferry. Intrigued, we wanted to know more, and quickly found out the video was just a teaser for what would be a 70-minute music video filmed around New York City, and set to the tune of Girl Talk&apos;s <em>All Day</em> album. Now here we are, almost a year later, to the date, delivering the final chapter of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141104070959/http://gothamist.com/tags/girlwalkallday">Girl Walk//All Day</a>.</p>

<p>We really love this project&#x2014;which was created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141104070959/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/07/jacob_krupnick_talks_about_his_epic.php">Jacob Krupnick</a> and his team&#x2014;and hope that it inspired you to dance, at least in your chair or cubicle.</p>
