<p>The &apos;80s classic <em>Troop Beverly Hills</em> is being revived with a sing-a-long spin. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213025525/http://www.92y.org/tribeca/tickets/production.aspx?pid=77995">92YTribeca</a> will be hosting &quot;Troop Beverly Hills: The Experience&quot; this Thursday, and they&apos;re promising &quot;a night of nostalgia, trivia, khaki wishes and cookie dreams.&quot; The interactive film screening will be a sing-a-long, a dance-a-long, and a quote-a-long&#x2014;giving you a chance to become a Wilderness Girl, just like Jenny Lewis. And if you&apos;re going, you might as well dress up&#x2014;organizers say it may just earn you a badge. Just don&apos;t embarrass yourself by not knowing the lyrics to &quot;Cookie Time&quot;:</p>
