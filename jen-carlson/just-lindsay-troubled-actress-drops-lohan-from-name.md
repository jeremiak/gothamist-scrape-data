<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="nolohan0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185807im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/nolohan0311.jpg" width="365" height="412" class="image-right"> </span>Let the Lohan de-branding begin! According to Dina Lohan her daughter is dropping her last name, and will just be going by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185807/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindsaylohan">Lindsay</a> from now on. On top of that, she tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185807/http://www.popeater.com/2011/03/25/lindsay-lohan-name-change-dina-sullivan/">PopEater</a> that she &quot;and [younger daughter] Ali will be officially changing our last names back to my maiden name, Sullivan.&quot;</p>

<p>Allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185807/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/21/lohan_wins_100_million_in_milkaholi.php">the E-Trade commercial</a> that may or may not have parodied her, only using the name Lindsay, was a sign that she was recognizable without her last name. Or maybe dropping it will make future lawsuits easier to win?</p>

<p>A family friend says Lindsay &amp; Co. no longer want to be sharing the last name with Michael Lohan, but maybe this is about a clean slate. Also, this is sort of like renaming the Queensboro Bridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407185807/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/queensboro_bridge_could_be_koch_bri.php">the Ed Koch Bridge</a>... <em>no one is going to call it that</em>.</p>
