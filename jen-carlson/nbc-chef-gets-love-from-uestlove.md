<p><em>Aww.</em> Roots drummer ?uestlove, who questioned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121073349/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/04/nbc_cafeteria_celebrates_black_hist.php">the menu choices</a> of NBC&apos;s cafeteria in celebration of Black History Month (fried chicken, collard greens, black-eyed peas)... has made peace with chef Leslie Calhoun. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121073349/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/05/nbc_cafeteria.php">defended her menu</a> after the Twitpic he took of it made it all the way to the Jay Leno show, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121073349/http://twitter.com/questlove/status/8734293769">?uestlove says</a>: &quot;just so yall dont think that im all talk. i presented leslie in our kitchen with flowers and an extremely sizable gift certificate spa treatment with the works.&quot;</p>
