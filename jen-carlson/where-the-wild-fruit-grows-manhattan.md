										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="fruittreesnyc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209002946im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/fruittreesnyc.jpg" width="250" height="318" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209002946/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/09/make_your_own_salad_in_central_park.php">Last year</a> we took a little look back at Wildman Steve Brill&apos;s foraging tour when one blogger made an entire salad after hearing his edible plant tips. The cherry on top came in the form of an apple, picked right from a tree behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209002946/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/wild-fruits-and-drugs-in-manhattan.html">NYC the Blog</a> points to more free fruit growing right in Manhattan&#x2014;delicious wild blackberries, to be exact. </p>

<p>Spotted on West 44th Street between 10th and 11th: a blackberry bush growing by the Amtrak tracks. And according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209002946/http://Neighborhoodfruit.com/">this website</a>, Manhattan is home to plenty of berry bushes <em>and</em> peach trees. There&apos;s even an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209002946/http://neighborhoodfruit.com/iphoneapp">iPhone app</a> to help you locate them&#x2014;we checked it out, and there really <em>are</em> a lot of fruit trees around. But would you eat from them?</p>

<p>For the adventurous, we suggest hitting up Union Square Park for some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209002946/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/14/breaking_impending_ganja_invasion_i.php">free green</a> before sinking your teeth into any of the city&apos;s edible offerings. And for dessert, try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209002946/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeysuckle">a honeysuckle</a>! They&apos;re everywhere, and have a delicious edible nectar.</p>
