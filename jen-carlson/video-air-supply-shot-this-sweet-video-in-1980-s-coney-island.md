<p>Do you guys remember Air Supply? Your mom probably listened to them in your station wagon in the &apos;80s. But while you may have vivid memories of hearing this song over and over again there, and in the dentist&apos;s office... do you remember this video? Their 1982 hit &quot;Even the Nights Are Better&quot; had an accompanying video that was shot in Coney Island. It starts out with a dramatic shot in front of Spookarama, and moves on to the boardwalk, Gregory &amp; Paul&apos;s clam bar, and even Dante&apos;s Inferno. Turn it up to a reasonable 3.5 on the dial, a respectable volume for soft rock, and enjoy:</p>
