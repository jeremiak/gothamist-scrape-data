										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="janehotel01410.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033744im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/janehotel01410.jpg" width="350" height="235" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s been a while since we heard anything about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033744/http://gothamist.com/tags/nightmareonjanestreet">the Jane Hotel</a>, whose ballroom was shut down in October after numerous noise complaints were filed by locals (who also became a press force to be reckoned with, armed with a blog and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033744/http://twitter.com/nightmareonjane">Twitter</a>). But today their worst nightmare may be coming true: the Jane&apos;s ballroom is reopening! <em>Dun dun dun.</em></p>

<p>Currently there&apos;s no update on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033744/http://nightmareonjane.wordpress.com/">Nightmare on Jane Street</a> blog, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033744/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/jane-hotel-ballroom-is-allowed-to-reopen/">the NY Times</a> <em>is</em> reporting that after the Mayor&#x2019;s Office of Special Enforcement shuttered the joint last fall, the Department of Buildings and mayoral officials have confirmed that the hotel has been granted a temporary certificate of occupancy which went into effect this week. Their place of assembly permit has also been approved. </p>

<p>The city insists that the establishment has &#x201C;worked diligently to correct&quot; their flaws, and will now relocate their line from the sidewalk to inside the hotel. On top of that, the owner says they may not open to the public, keeping it private and invite-only. Of course, these exclusive terms won&apos;t deter public enemy #1: the Olsen twins! Get some sleep, neighbors, the owner says they&apos;ll be opening back up any day now.</p>
