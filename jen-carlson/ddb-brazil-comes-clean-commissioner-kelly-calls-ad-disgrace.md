										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpOvg16JAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpOvg16JAM.jpg" width="350" height="241" class="image-left"> </span>Looks like everyone&apos;s coming clean. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/03/wwf.php">Yesterday</a> the WWF admitted that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/01/wwf_never_forget_the_tsunami.php">the controversial 9/11-themed ad</a> was probably cleared by someone at the organization, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807/http://adage.com/globalnews/article?article_id=138794">AdAge</a> is reporting that &quot;after initially lying about it, DDB Brasil now admits it created a video version of the Brazilian print ad &apos;Tsunami,&apos; and entered both ads in the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in June.&quot; </p>

<p>The admission comes after the company claimed to have only run the ad only once in Sao Paulo and somehow mistakenly entered it in the One Show (which it won a Merit Award at). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807/http://www.dm9ddb.com.br/">DDB website</a> now contains the president&apos;s apology in full, where he says &quot;no ad is truly just local.&quot; Especially when the ad is <em>about the entire planet</em>.</p>

<p>The One Club&#x2014;who told us earlier this week that the ad didn&apos;t win an award, despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/02/ad_agency_responds.php">their website showing the ad</a> and declaring it an award winner&#x2014;has also made some new comments. President Kevin Swanepoel attempts to explain, saying, &quot;This points to the fact that with an international jury, not everybody is as sensitive to this. They may have seen is as acceptable and given it a higher score.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the WWF is attempting to find out the &quot;circumstance surrounding the creation of the ad,&quot; as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/02/video_ddb_brazil_made_a_911-inspire.php">the video</a>, which Police Commissioner Ray Kelly thinks are horrible and insensitive, telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529083807/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/national/090903_WWF_911_Video_Ad">MyFoxNY</a> that it&apos;s a &quot;disgrace that someone even dreamt it up.&quot;</p>
