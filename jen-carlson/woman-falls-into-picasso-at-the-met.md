										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:174px; "> <img alt="phpUOVtd3AM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161004102558im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpUOVtd3AM.jpg" width="174" height="300"> <br></div> Forget those dreams about showing up to school without your clothes on, how about showing up to art class &#x2014; on site at the Metropolitan Museum of Art &#x2014;&#xA0;and falling into an original masterpiece by Pablo Picasso! <p></p>

<p>That&apos;s what one woman did in her adult education class on Friday afternoon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161004102558/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/woman-collides-with-a-picasso/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">The NY Times</a> reports that she lost her balance and fell into &quot;The Actor,&quot; a rare Rose Period Picasso (circa 1905), leaving a six inch tear at the bottom right corner. The painting has hung there since 1952 and until now it has done so without incident.</p>

<p>The experts at the Met&#x2019;s conservation studio says &#x201C;the damage did not occur in the focal point of the composition and the curatorial and conservation staffs fully expect that the repair &#x2014;which will take place in the coming weeks &#x2014; will be unobtrusive.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The woman&apos;s name will remain anonymous, but this reminds us of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161004102558/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/23/061023ta_talk_paumgarten">a story in <em>The New Yorker</em></a> from 2006, in which casino magnate Steve Wynn suffered a similar tumble into his own $48 million Picasso.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161004102558/http://gawker.com/5455944/woman-who-fell-into-picasso-painting-not-magically-transported-to-world-of-cubism?skyline=true&amp;s=i">Gawker</a> tipster says, &quot;There was a group of students touring the 20th century area and a special needs kid was sitting on the floor or leaning on the wall, went to get up, tripped and tore a six inch long hole in Picasso&apos;s &apos;Actors&apos;.&quot;</p>
