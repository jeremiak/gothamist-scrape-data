<p>The Frederick MacMonnies sculpture overlooking Union Turnpike and Queens Boulevard in Kew Gardens, Queens has had a controversial life (of almost 100 years). At first, the statue&#x2014;called Civic Virtue&#x2014;upset women because the naked man was shown stepping on two figures of the fairer sex... but they were <em>sirens</em>, and this man was simply conquering both Vice and Corruption. The statue remained in the city, but was banished to Queens by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. Now it seems the city has neglected the big guy, who has not been able to conquer old age and natural elements on his own; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150809/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/01/31/2011-01-31_eyesore_next_door_nearly_centuryold_nude_statue_in_kew_gardens_crumbling_from_la.html">the Daily News</a> is now deeming him an eyesore.</p>

<p>A Community Board member told the paper, &quot;It&apos;s deteriorating. We were told if it&apos;s left to its own devices, it will eventually crumble into dust.&quot; The Parks Department is in charge of caring for the statue, but claim a proper cleaning and repair work would cost &quot;tens of thousand of dollars.&quot; Can&apos;t we just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150809/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/05/citys_statues_get_caped.php">give him a cape</a>?</p>
