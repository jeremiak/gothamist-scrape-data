										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpbN7WSVPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074857im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpbN7WSVPM.jpg" width="248" height="194" class="image-left"> </span>A Brooklyn building owner was recently fined $25 for putting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074857/http://gothamist.com/tags/recycling">recyclables</a> in a black trash bag designated for non-recyclables. Problem is: there were no recyclables in that trash bag.</p>

<p>Tony Scott told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074857/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/investigative/sanitation-summons-20100506">Fox 5 News</a> that his surveillance camera caught the Department of Sanitation worker walking on the sidewalk and simply kicking trash bags before writing up tickets. His ticket read: &quot;did observe metal cans, unsoiled paper, and cereal boxes out for collection in 1 black plastic bag non-designated for any recyclables.&quot; But he the worker never even opened the bag, which could mean the agency is walking around giving out undeserved tickets. Scott says, &quot;They can just write down anything. It may not be for $25, it can be for much more. It&apos;s like taking food out of my family&apos;s mouth, for a ticket that&apos;s unwarranted.&quot;</p>

<p>Scott says he enforces a strict recycling policy with his tenants, and has even made them sign an agreement pledging to separate their trash properly. He has fought the ticket, and was told by a judge that he&apos;d get the decision in the mail within the next 30 days.  </p>
