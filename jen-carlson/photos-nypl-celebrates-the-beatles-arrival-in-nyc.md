They were swarmed by teenage fans, the press, and the NYPD&#x2014;Ringo recalling in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303013813/http://books.google.com/books?id=HWuQu8EMDKcC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=It+felt+as+though+there+was+a+big+octopus+with+tentacles+that+were+grabbing+the+plane+and+dragging+us+down+to+New+York&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4O5Th34Dwx&amp;sig=H_AcByXKcd0lo5CUFqGhoXwITtM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=idPrUp36MPPNsQS14oHYBQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=It%20felt%20as%20though%20there%20was%20a%20big%20octopus%20with%20tentacles%20that%20were%20grabbing%20the%20plane%20and%20dragging%20us%20down%20to%20New%20York&amp;f=false"><em>The Anthology</em></a>, &#x201C;It felt as though there was a big octopus with tentacles that were grabbing the plane and dragging us down to New York.

<p>As part of the city-wide celebration of the anniversary, the NYPL is hosting an exhibit, which they tell us will feature &quot;a few full-scale installations, including a recreation of a Beatles-obsessed teenager&apos;s room, and a Woolworth&apos;s window packed with Beatles ephemera (lunchboxes, wigs, shoes, etc).&quot; The exhibit, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303013813/http://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/ladies-and-gentlementhe-beatles"><em>Ladies and Gentlemen... The Beatles!</em></a> is a collaboration between the Library and the GRAMMY Museum, and will run from February 6th through May 10th at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (40 Lincoln Center Plaza). </p>
