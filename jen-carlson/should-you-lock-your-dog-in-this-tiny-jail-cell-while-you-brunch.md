<p>It&apos;s difficult to have a dog in New York City&#x2014;especially if you are out doing errands and can&apos;t bring your pal inside of an establishment. Your options are limited: bring your dog back home and continue on with your business, sell your dog, or tie your dog up outside and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917164049/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/12/pomeranian_dognapped_outside_willia.php">hope no one steals your him/her</a>. If you choose the latter, you will likely receive some judgy looks... and rightfully, especially if it&apos;s cold outside. You probably shouldn&apos;t sell your dog, either, monster.</p>

<p>So, in that respect, this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917164049/http://www.dogparker.com/">Dog Parker</a> is kind of cool? But also it&apos;s kind of like leaving your dog in a tiny jail cell? And especially so in this &quot;lock the door and take off&quot; video:</p>

<p>The service had its pilot program going at the end of last year, when founder Chelsea Brownridge told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917164049/http://nypost.com/2015/11/27/you-can-now-pay-to-park-your-pup/">the NY Post</a> she created the Dog Parker after having to leave her dog at home too much&#x2014;&quot;I ran into this problem dozens of times. It was a bummer.&quot;</p>

<p>The Parkers come with a webcam and temperature monitoring, and are professionally sanitized on a daily basis. There are currently five around Brooklyn, but they plan to roll out more this year.</p>

<p>The service&#x2014;described below as &quot;Uber for tying your dog up outside the deli&quot;&#x2014;costs twenty cents a minute (or $12/hour), in addition to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917164049/http://www.dogparker.com/membership">an annual membership fee</a> of $25.</p>
