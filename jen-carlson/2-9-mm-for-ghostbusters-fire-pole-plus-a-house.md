<p>Apparently anyone that&apos;s anyone is living out in Palisades, New York. Bj&#xF6;rk Gudmundsdottir (better known by just her first name) was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710152300/http://realestalker.blogspot.com/2009/08/buy-or-lease-bjorks-house-in-snedens.html">selling her home</a> there last year, and Al Pacino, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Harvey Keitel are (or have been) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710152300/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-living-palisades-ny-star-lit-hudson-rustic-haven.html">residents</a>. Oh, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710152300/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0174883/">Didi Conn</a>&#x2014;who you know as Frenchie in <em>Grease</em>&#x2014;is now selling her home there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710152300/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/realestate/22deal2.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">The NY Times</a> reports that the home, once owned by Bill Murray, has about 5,000 square feet on about 2 acres, and Conn and her composer husband are asking $2.9 million. </p>

<p>The <em>real</em> selling point: &quot;Mr. Murray left a vestige of himself behind: a fireman&#x2019;s pole from the <em>Ghostbusters</em> movies still connects two floors in the garage.&quot; Or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710152300/http://www.bobvila.com/RealEstate/Property-NY-Palisades-3000530776.html">this listing</a> puts it: &quot;Separate garage with guest quarters/studio built around original <em>Ghostbusters</em> fire pole.&quot; Sadly, no listing sites actually have this magical place pictured.</p>
