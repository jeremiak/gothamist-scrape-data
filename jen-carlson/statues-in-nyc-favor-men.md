</div></div>					<p>Did you know that of the 150ish historical statues in all of New York City there are <em>only five</em> of real women? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102015/http://newyorkcitystatues.com/women/">NYC Statues</a>, Joan of Arc was the first, and the others are Eleanor Roosevelt, Gertrude Stein, Golda Mier, and Harriet Tubman &#x2014; who was the last one, put up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102015/http://jschumacher.typepad.com/joe/2007/10/harriet-tubman.html">in 2007</a>.</p>

<p>In 1993 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102015/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/opinion/statues-with-limitations.html">the Gray Lady</a> herself pointed out the lack of women memorialized in the city (in a cleverly titled article called &quot;Statues, With Limitations&quot;). They report that &quot;of a score or more stone and metal statues of women, nearly all are either personifications (Justice, Peace, the Four Continents, Wisdom and Alma Mater) or goddesses (Minerva)... one looks in vain for female artists, reformers, politicians.&quot;</p>

<p>Some of these other female figures placed about town include the American Venus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102015/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/12/audrey_munson.php">Audrey Munson</a>, immigrant everywoman Annie Moore, Alice in Wonderland, Mother Goose, a few famous actresses built into the side of the I. Miller building, and of course Lady Liberty. Surely the number of <em>real</em> women from our past should start balancing out with the amount of dead men around this city, however. Who would you suggest be next?</p>
