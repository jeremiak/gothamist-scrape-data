<p>Want to see what the Lower East Side was like before the Hotel On Rivington and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926202352/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/sht_diners_say_stop_opening_boutiqu.php">shops dedicated to meatballs</a> popped up? Ten minutes of exquisite footage, titled &quot;Viva Loisaida, 1978&quot; is now available on YouTube, showing &quot;decay and growth in the same place.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926202352/http://evgrieve.com/2012/10/a-journey-through-east-village-and.html">EV Grieve</a> points to this description:</p><blockquote>&quot;Produced by Gruppe Dokumentation &amp; Tylis and filmed in Loisada, by Marlis Momber, this 10 min. commercial gives a brief preview before gentrification occurred in Lower East Side in the Fall of October, 1978 with Chino Garcia &amp; Bimbo Rivas.&quot;</blockquote>The full thing is actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926202352/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/288270/Viva-Loisaida/overview">40 minutes</a>, and there seem to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926202352/http://www.vivaloisaida.org/Marlis/bio.html">DVDs available for purchase</a>. Below, you&apos;ll get a little glimpse, with shots of the Christodora House, Tompkins Square Park, and more.<p></p>
