title: Piranhas In Prospect Park!
---

<p>After months of its animals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131939/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/24/swan_1.php">dying off</a>, you know what Prospect Park needs: piranhas! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131939/http://www.prospectparkzoo.com/">The park&apos;s zoo</a> has brought in 18 red and orange bellied piranhas for their Flooded Forest exhibit because clearly they did not see the trailer for <em>Piranha 3D</em>!</p>

<p>Anyway, the Wildlife Conservation Society is already combating fears, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131939/http://www.zandavisitor.com/newsarticle-4023-Piranha_School_Visits_Prospect_Park_Zoos_Flooded_Forest_Exhibit">and claims</a> these things just have a bad rep and are actually quite docile. Sorry, WCS, <em>not buying it</em>. It&apos;s only a matter of time before they create some new super species with the rest of the animals over there and then you know what, we won&apos;t have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131939/http://gothamist.com/tags/canadageese">Canada geese</a> problem anymore, we&apos;ll have some crazy winged-piranha hybrid taking down airplanes.</p>
