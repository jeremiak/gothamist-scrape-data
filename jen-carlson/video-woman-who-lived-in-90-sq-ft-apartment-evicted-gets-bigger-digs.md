<p>In 2011 we met Felice Cohen, who at the time was living in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161843/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/video_woman_shows_off_90-square-foo.php">a 90-square-foot apartment</a> on the Upper West Side. Soon after the video tour of her home went viral, her landlord <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161843/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/30/woman_in_90-square-foot_apartment_k.php">tried to raise her rent</a> (which was $700/month), and now she&apos;s moved. The move wasn&apos;t motivated by any hunger for a larger living space, but when her landlord discovered she wasn&apos;t on the lease, she says she was threatened with eviction if she didn&apos;t sign a lease that would double her rent. Now she&apos;s moved to a 500-square-foot PALACE, which she owns, and is working on a book about living large in a small space. Her new apartment is also on the Upper West Side, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161843/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF6EzsDVnrM&amp;feature=youtu.be">FairCompanies</a> has a tour of the big digs:</p>
