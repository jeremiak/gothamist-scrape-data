<p>&quot;Locals call west side of the Park the best side.&quot; &#x2014; Central Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222133603/https://twitter.com/CentralParkNYC/status/678973470907064320">Twitter</a>, December 2015.</p>

<p>But <em>is it?</em> </p>

<p>If you had to pick just one side of Central Park, the east or west, to visit: which would it be? If you could <em>only</em> take one side of Central Park to a deserted island, which one would you take and spend eternity with? If there was an electric, invisible fence in the exact center of the Park, and you were about to be fitted with a chip that would shock you if you passed it, which side of the Park would you want to be on when that chip was installed? </p>

<p>You will never have to answer these questions, probably, but at a young age the urge to pick sides was instilled in us all.</p>

<p>There are other factors at play, however, and the biggest one is transportation. The West Side is exponentially easier to access, given the proximity of more subway lines. The B, D, A, C, 1, 2, 3, and Q will all get to various areas near the West Side, while the East Side relies heavily on the 4, 5, 6, you can also catch the F, N, R, and Q nearby. The West Side wins the accessibility challenge. </p>

<p>Then there are the <em>vistas</em>. The Park&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222133603/http://www.centralparknyc.org/events/individual-events/iconic-views-of-central-park-tour-12-26-2015.html">Iconic Views tour</a> highlights the Dairy, Sheep Meadow, Cherry Hill, the Lake, Bow Bridge, Bethesda Terrace, The Mall, and Literary Walk. 5 of the 8 of these are on the East Side, so that&apos;s where the trophy for this one goes.</p>

<p>There have also been plenty of movies shot there&#x2014;this is not a comprehensive list, but it&apos;s a fair breakdown showing what Hollywood prefers when it comes to the Park.</p>

<p><strong>East Side</strong></p><ul><li>The Plaza Hotel, which we&apos;re counting as an East Side attraction, was featured in Hitchcock&apos;s 1959 classic <em>North By Northwest</em>, as well as <em>The Way We Were</em>, <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, <em>Barefoot in the Park</em>, <em>Funny Girl</em>, <em>Cotton Club</em>, <em>Almost Famous</em>, <em>Brewster&apos;s Millions</em>, <em>Crocodile Dundee I and II</em>, and <em>Home Alone II: Lost In New York</em>.<br>
</li><li><em>Big Daddy</em>, <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em>, and <em>Maid in Manhattan</em> at The Mall.<br>
</li><li><em>Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s</em> and <em>Hair</em> at the Naumburg Bandshell.<br>
</li><li><em>Angels in America</em>, <em>Ransom</em>, and <em>Stewart Little II</em> at Bethesda Fountain.<br>
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222133603/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_love_story.php"><em>Love Story</em></a> and <em>Serendipity</em> at Wollman Rink.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>West Side</strong></p><ul><li><em> It Could Happen To You</em> and <em>Wall Street</em>, and <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em> in Sheep Meadow.<br>

</li><li><em>The Producers</em> at the Carousel.<br>
</li><li><em>27 Dresses</em> at the Boathouse.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>It&apos;s undeniable that each side has a pretty strong lineup, and the Central Park Conservancy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222133603/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/06/central_park_1980s_photos.php">has worked tirelessly</a> to make it all perfect... but we&apos;re giving the East Side the overall win here, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222133603/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/15/cute_alert_central_park_zoo_welcome.php">that side has the red pandas</a>.</p>
