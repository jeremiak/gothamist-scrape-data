title: New York Mag Turns 40 with Young, Nubile Brooklyn Bands

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063442/http://thelifevicarious.typepad.com/the_life_vicarious/2008/08/new-york-magazines-40th-anniversary-concert-exclusive-the-national-at-hammerstein-ballroom.html">The Life Vicarious</a> scooped New York Magazine on the announcement of their own 40th birthday extravaganza. As the mag goes over the hill, they&apos;ll have Brooklynites <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063442/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/21/matt_berninger.php">The National</a> and Grizzly Bear on hand. The concert, at Hammerstein Ballroom on October 10th, will also include some comedy, with hosting duties appointed to Stella (aka Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain) &#x2013; all in all you can expect to throw down $35 a ticket. Could all of these recent bookings (see: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063442/http://nymag.com/nyxny">NYxNY</a> event series) be the equivalent of the magazine&apos;s mid-life crisis Porsche?</p>
