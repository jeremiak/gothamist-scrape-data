	<p>Here&apos;s a look back at that bygone era long before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104341/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a> took over the area around Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush. These photos from the early 1900s show the Brooklyn neighborhood as a hub of activity, with the subway lines being constructed and the area getting built from the ground up. Click through for a look at the Barclays intersection before Barclays existed, in the early 1900s.</p>

<p>Some of this era of Atlantic Avenue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104341/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/27/sealed_off_atlantic_avenue_tunnel_a.php">may still be preserved underground</a>, in the sealed off section near Court Street that Bob Diamond has been trying to get into for years. And here&apos;s a look at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104341/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/06/old_atlantic_station.php#photo-1">old Flatbush Avenue Terminal</a>.</p>
