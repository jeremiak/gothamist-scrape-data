<p>Our inner Bart Simpson LOL&apos;d at this new Tumblr, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521041820/http://metropolitanmuseumofbutts.tumblr.com/">the Metropolitan Museum of Butts</a>, which (as if it needed explaining) is documenting all of the butts that can be seen in the museum (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521041820/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/07/the_met_is_being_sued_over_deceptiv.php">for free</a>!). Why? &quot;Everybody likes butts. And everybody has a butt,&quot; the site&apos;s creator explains. The site also includes descriptions so you know what butt you are looking at, for example: &quot;Marble statue of a bearded Hercules, Roman, Flavian period, A.D. 68-98.&quot; Hopefully this project will branch out to document butts in other museums as well&#x2014;we hear The Frick has some <em>real classy butts.</em> In conclusion: butts.
