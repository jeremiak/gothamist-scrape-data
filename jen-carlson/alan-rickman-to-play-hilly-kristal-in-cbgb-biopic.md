<p>Shuttered club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071203/http://gothamist.com/tags/cbgb">CBGB</a> is back in the zeitgeist this year! In January <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071203/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/we_hear_cbgb_is_planning_to_reopen.php">we broke the news</a> that the current owners would be reopening the venue, then in March it was announced that they&apos;d be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071203/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/cbgb_music_festival_coming.php">having a festival</a> this summer, and now the club is under Hollywood&apos;s shining spotlight, with the biopic on the venue finally moving forward.</p>

<p>The latest news on the film (which we first heard about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071203/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/19/cbgbs_hilly_kristal_will_get_biopic.php">one year ago</a>) is that Alan Rickman (n&#xE9;e Professor Snape) will be playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071203/http://gothamist.com/tags/hillykristal">Hilly Kristal</a>, the club&apos;s longtime owner who died in 2007, just after the club shut its doors.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071203/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alan-rickman-cbgb-founder-hilly-kristal-biopic-randall-miller-jody-savin-324031">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, the movie will be directed by Randall Miller from a script he wrote with Jody Savin, and filming will begin next month. Somewhere, a set designer is recreating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071203/http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=cbgb%20bathroom%20">the venue&apos;s bathrooms</a>...</p>
