A poster says: &quot;Lost penis sculpture. Last seen on February 4th, 2010 around 1 a.m. on display during the art show BYOA at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829161605/http://www.x-initiative.org/">X Initiative</a> located on 548 W 22nd St. The art piece is a life size realistic sculpture of the artist&apos;s penis and testicles made out of resin and beard hair. There were four Mark Billy penises on display but only one peach colored one went missing.&quot; Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829161605/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/new_sex_shop_will_cast_your.php">we know where he can get another one</a> on the cheap. You can get a closer look at the missing sculpture, and its friends, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829161605/http://img110.yfrog.com/i/1eo.jpg/">here</a>. Meanwhile, the artist is so distraught he hasn&apos;t even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829161605/http://twitter.com/markbilly8">Twittered about it</a>.</p>
