</div></div><p>Last week the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004822/http://brooklynkolacheco.com/">Brooklyn Kolache Co.</a> opened in Bed-Stuy, near the Clinton Hill border, which had us wondering: what <em>is</em> a kolache? The treats are often found in Texas, and rarely found in these parts, so we asked owner Autumn Stanford to introduce us to the food, normally devoured around breakfast time. She told us: &quot;Kolaches  are portable, neat-to-eat pastries that can be stuffed with savory ingredients such as eggs, sausage and cheese, or sweet house-made fillings like apricot, poppy seed and cherry.&quot; SOLD! </p>

<p>Stanford&#x2014;who tells us her kolache dough is &quot;slightly sweet and light, with a little chew and a yeasty finish&quot;&#x2014;serves up the standard kolaches, along with some specialty ones, like the PB&amp;J;, barbacoa, peaches and cream, and pork rib kolaches. Right now she&apos;s working on a Nutella bun, which would be similar to a cinnamon roll, and already has us drooling all over our keyboard. Below you&apos;ll find the menu as it stands now:</p>

<p><strong>Sweet Kolaches</strong>: sweet cheese, poppy seed, apricot, raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, peanut butter and jelly, chocolate, sweet cheese and blueberry and a weekly special (and maybe lemon curd).</p>

<p><strong>Savory Kolaches:</strong> Eggs, chorizo and cheese - eggs, hash browns and cheese, veggie scrambled eggs- bacon egg and cheese -weekly special (ie..smoked brisket, ham and cheese)</p>

<p><strong>Pigs in a Blanket:</strong> Smoked beef sausage, jalapeno cheese smoked beef sausage.</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast Tacos:</strong> Egg, hash brown and cheese, Egg chorizo and cheese,  Egg bacon and cheese</p>

<p>Kolaches range from $2.25 (sweet) to $3.75 (beef). There&apos;s also a full espresso bar, along with cold beverages like hibiscus iced tea and house made cherry limeade. Their hours are Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. And if you follow along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004822/https://twitter.com/#!/brooklynkolache">on Twitter</a>, you might be alerted to some deals, like their happy hour, where every weekday starting at 2:30 p.m., it&apos;s buy one get one free.</p>
