                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="famkedoll0813.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928030039im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/famkedoll0813.jpg" width="640" height="465" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Actress Famke Janssen recently reported an odd crime at her Greenwich Village home, and since then everything has gotten really weird and confusing. Let&apos;s see if we can crack this case... </p>

<p>Last weekend Janssen called the police reporting that when she returned home she found a (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928030039/http://guardianlv.com/2013/08/famke-janssen-burglar-leaves-creepy-but-possibly-valuable-gift/">first edition</a>!) copy of the 1957 children&apos;s book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928030039/http://www.amazon.com/The-Lonely-Doll-Sandpiper-Books/dp/039590112X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376575862&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+lonely+doll"><em>The Lonely Doll</em></a> by her bedside. She claims she has never owned that book, and had given no one else access to her apartment.</p>

<p>So, she is rightfully creeped out, because intrusion, but also because DOLLS.</p>

<p>In 2005, Janssen had a stalker who wouldn&apos;t stop sending her photos and letters, and at the time she filed a harassment report with police. And as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928030039/http://www.tmz.com/2013/08/13/famke-janssen-cops-creepy-burglary-the-lonely-doll-childrens-book-x-men/#ixzz2c30OJkV0">TMZ</a> scaremongeringly points out about the latest incident: &quot;<em>The Lonely Doll</em> is about a couple of toys who promise to NEVER, EVER LEAVE each other.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD has been investigating the incident as a burglary, but they haven&apos;t found a thing. There were no signs of a forced entry, surveillance footage showed nothing&#x2014;a source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928030039/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/doubt_on_famke_break_in_CuNYFmw9dfRkYdrkkmE1cK">the Post</a>, &#x201C;There is nobody suspicious... all the people on the video are accounted for,&quot; and there were no fingerprints on the book.</p>

<p>So what happened? Ghost? Drunken impulse purchase of <em>The Lonely Doll</em>? Shrewd viral marketing for Janssen&apos;s forthcoming <em>Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters</em>?</p>
