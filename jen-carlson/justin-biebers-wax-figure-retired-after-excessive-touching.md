<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052724/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">Justin Bieber</a> wax statue at Madame Tussauds in Times Square has been removed... <em>forever</em>. The decision to retire the statue was not made because of the entitled little hellion&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052724/http://laist.com/2014/01/29/justin_bieber_to_turn_himself_in_to.php">recent bad behavior</a>&#x2014;you see, the pop star&apos;s wax likeness was subject to so much groping over the years that the museum felt it was too damaged to leave on display. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052724/http://pagesix.com/2014/02/10/even-justin-biebers-wax-figure-is-melting-down/?_ga=1.64030509.340184727.1390920370">the NY Post</a>, Bieber&apos;s wax figure&#x2014;made when he was still in the good graces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052724/http://dcist.com/2014/02/virginia_senator_mark_warner_also_t.php">of the U.S.</a>&#x2014;was &quot;groped, fondled and grabbed by so many excited fans&quot; over the years that there was no saving it. A source told the paper, &#x201C;With no ropes or barriers to stop them, thousands of fans have had their photographs taken with him since then&#x2014;but it has taken its toll.&#x201D; The museum&apos;s manager hints that a new one could be on the way, however&#x2014;&#x201C;This is disappointing, but hopefully we can welcome a new &#x2018;grown-up&#x2019; Justin back to the attraction in the near future.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Can we have the old one, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052724/http://laist.com/2014/01/14/police_raid_justin_biebers_home_ove.php">a carton of eggs</a>?</p>
