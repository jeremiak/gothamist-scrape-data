Jordan is now trying to find his saviour, who fled the scene after carrying him 100+ yards back to shore and saving his life.  </p>

<p>Jordan, who dove into the water after his speedboat became untied from a pier, only has a partial photo to go by; a passerby snapped the shot, which shows a sea-themed tattoo. The photographer also commented on Jordan&apos;s condition at the time, saying, &quot;I thought he was dead. He looked purple.&quot;</p>

<p>A delicious reward is also being offered if the mystery surfer steps up; Jordan&apos;s family owns the Sheepshead Bay mainstay Jordan&apos;s Lobster Dock, and he says, &quot;I&apos;ll give him a big lobster dinner. I&apos;m beside myself with thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407114848/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/05/sexy_surfer_saves_the_day.html">NYMag</a> ponders the mind-blowing reality that a heroic, life-saving &quot;sexy shirtless surfer dude&quot; (who they liken to Nick Lachey) exists outside the pages of romance novels and comic books.</p>
