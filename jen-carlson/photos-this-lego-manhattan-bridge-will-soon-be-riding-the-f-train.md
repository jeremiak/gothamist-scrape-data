</div></div>					<p>Remember when Brooklynite Jonathan Lopes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141020051701/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/jonathan_lopes_lego_artist.php">built a miniature Brooklyn</a> inside of his apartment? Well he&apos;s back, with a massive LEGO version of the Manhattan Bridge! This morning he told us it comes &quot;complete with the south side walking path and the north side BIKE LANE!  The sculpture is 12 feet long and there are approximately 21,000 LEGO pieces in it. It took about 35 hours to build (along with lots of time walking and also staring at the bridge!).&quot; He&apos;s even got the archway in there, but sadly, we don&apos;t see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141020051701/http://gothamist.com/tags/stabberalley">Stabber Alley</a>.</p>

<p>The piece is currently in the offices of his day job in Midtown (closed to the public, of course), but he tells us, &quot;It will be brought back to my Brooklyn Studio early next week.  F train riders: keep and eye out for a dashingly handsome rider next week, likely in the last car, with large pieces of a bridge in tow.&quot; But we&apos;re trying to convince him to ceremoniously walk it across the bridge itself...</p>
