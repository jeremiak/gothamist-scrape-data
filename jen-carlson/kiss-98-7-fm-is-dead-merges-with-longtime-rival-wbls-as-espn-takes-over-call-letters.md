<p>It&apos;s the end of an era! And it was all announced in a sterile press release sent out this morning, which stated that <em>thirty year long</em> rival stations 98.7 KISS FM and WBLS (107.5) would soon be &quot;one family, one station.&quot; </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002855/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/espn-buys-98-7-fm-frequency-sports-radio-station-home-nyc-legendary-kiss-fm-article-1.1067863">the Daily News</a>&#x2014;who compare the merger with a Yankees/Mets merger&#x2014;the stations began simulcasting this morning, starting with a tribute to the 30-year legacy of KISS. Then on Monday, they will officially become one station, with all hosts (as of now) being integrated under the WBLS call letters, meaning KISS 98.7 FM is dead.</p>

<p>But who&apos;s got the blood on their hands? Those brutes over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502002855/http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/7857507/espn-new-york-1050-moving-987-fm-dial">ESPN</a>, of course. Disney owns 98.7, and in a &quot;complicated $96 million deal&quot; they have leased it to ESPN radio (who were on a weaker signal at 1050 AM).</p>
