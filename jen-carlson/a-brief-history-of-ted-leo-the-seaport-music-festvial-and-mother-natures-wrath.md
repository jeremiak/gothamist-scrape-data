title: A Brief History of Ted Leo, the Seaport Music Festvial and Mother Nature's Wrath
---

	
										<p>Tonight marks the five year anniversary of Ted Leo and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717004559/http://seaportmusicfestival.com/">Seaport Music Festival</a> (they really are such a cute couple). The relationship is quite literally a stormy one, however. Legend has it if you hold your ear up to a seashell on the day of a Ted Leo performance at the Seaport, you will hear the sound of the SMF&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717004559/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/06/02/stephen_dima_pr.php">Stephen Dima</a> weeping. Nearly every year something crazy happens on this night, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717004559/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/08/25/tornado_maybe_m.php">tonight is no exception</a>. <br>

Here&apos;s a brief recap of the past five years:</p>

<blockquote>2002 - Ted&apos;s first performance at the Seaport Music Festival. He plays solo, opening for Radio 4.

<p>2003 - The Blackout. The frappuccino van was brought up to the stage so they could run off their generators. One song appears in the &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; DVD as an extra.</p>

<p>2004 - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717004559/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/archives/2004/06/28/ted_leo_the_pharmacists_trade_lab_coats_for_raincoats.php">Rain</a>. News-worthy, &quot;Biblical&quot;, torrential...rain. Again, one song appears on the DVD as an extra.</p>

<p>2005 - The sun shines down on Ted Leo and 6,000 fans. Finally.</p>

<p>2006 - Tonight, the fifth year, there is a TORNADO WATCH. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>We&apos;ll be there, rain, shine or funnel clouds. </p>
