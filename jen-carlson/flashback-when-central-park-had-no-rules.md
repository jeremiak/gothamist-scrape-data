<p>Ah, Central Park in 1961... when you could just ride your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110502180527/http://gothamist.com/tags/unicycle">unicycle</a> around without worrying about getting ticketed and find free parking on the unmowed grass. Plus, that guy looks about ready to take his dog off the leash. Total anarchy! Though to be fair, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110502180527/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/08/huts.php#photo-3">the Hoovervilles</a> were gone by this time, and the Public Theater&apos;s annual Shakespeare in the Park festival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110502180527/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_park#1960.E2.80.931980">was just settling into</a> the Delacorte Theater.</p>
