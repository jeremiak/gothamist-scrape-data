<p>The gorgeous TWA flight center at JFK already got a new breath of life when JetBlue moved in and reopened it in 2008, and soon the airline will get some stylish company. The Port Authority and JetBlue have been contemplating what to do with the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161707/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a> head house, and it&apos;s now been announced that the winning proposal comes from luxury hotelier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161707/http://gothamist.com/tags/AndreBalazs">Andre Balazs</a>. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161707/http://pagesix.com/2013/09/08/balazs-tapped-to-develop-jfks-historic-twa-terminal/">Page Six</a>, Balazs&apos;s company has been chosen by Port Authority officials to develop the terminal, with a centerpiece called The Standard, Flight Center. A hotel that will undoubtedly Change the Airport Hotel Game.</p>

<p>Port Authority&apos;s Pat Foye promised in a statement that they are &quot;committed to preserving the essence of [Saarinen&#x2019;s] iconic design and to continuing to work with [Balazs Properties] on a plan to transform the historic TWA Flight Center into a one-of-a-kind hotel and conference center in the heart of JFK&#x2019;s central terminal area.&quot; As of now they have not approved Balazs&apos;s final proposal, and no time frame has been specified for the project. But Balazs has proven himself adept at deftly transforming beloved old structures into contemporary destinations without sacrificing their unique history&#x2014;his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161707/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/09/guide_miami_florida_keys.php#photo-15">finesse with renovating the old Lido Spa in Miami</a> is a prime example. </p>

<p>Along with The Standard, there will be a conference center, restaurants, retail space, a spa and fitness center, and a flight museum. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161707/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/8_reasons_air_travel_used_to_be_coo.php">Is air travel getting cool again</a>? And can Balasz also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161707/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/21/a_look_back_at_pan_ams_soon-to-be_e.php">save the flying saucer building at Terminal 3</a>?</p>
