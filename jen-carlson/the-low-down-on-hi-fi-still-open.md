<p>Earlier today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153731/http://evgrieve.com/2011/03/breaking-nypd-shutters-hi-fi.html">EV Grieve</a> posted notice that the East Village spot Hi-Fi (formerly the beloved Brownies) was shuttered by the NYPD; according to the signs on the door, this was due to &quot;illegal sale of alcoholic beverages.&quot; (The signs also stated that &quot;removal of property from the premises was prohibited&quot;&#x2014;so at least we knew their amazing jukebox wouldn&apos;t be going anywhere anytime soon.) However, we just called Hi-Fi and were assured that they are open (we could even hear the aforementioned jukebox in the background!)&#x2014;so go, drink, and be merry... because those signs were real, and the end may be nigh. Or not.</p>
