<p>Public bathrooms in New York City&#x2014;the lack of them, and the condition of the ones that do exist&#x2014;can be a hot topic... you know, in the world of restroom chatter, at least. The latest word comes from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072247/http://www.virtualtourist.com/press-center/ugliest-buildings-list">Virtual Tourist</a> website, which has declared Bryant Park&apos;s public potties #1 in all the world! </p>

<p>Reps for the toilets (who are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072247/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/best_bathroom_nominees_bryant_park.php#photo-1">used to this</a> kind of recognition) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072247/http://blog.bryantpark.org/2011/10/bryant-park-bathroom-in-news.html">say</a>, &quot;We are honored to be recognized, as we take a great amount of pride in our efforts to maintain the facilities. We aim to keep them clean, smelling fresh, and in good working order with flowers and an attendant on-duty at all times.&quot;</p>

<p>The Virtual Tourist was a little underminey in their write-up, however, noting how it was surprising to find such a nice &quot;loo in the middle of such a dirty, noisy, frenetic city.&quot;</p>
