										<p><img alt="2006_10_arts_bowery.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230154256im_/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2006_10_arts_bowery.jpg" width="150" height="204" align="left" hspace="5">During CMJ, everything becomes a venue - from a living room to an abandoned storefront. During the rest of the year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230154256/http://www.toddpnyc.com/">Todd P</a> keeps that sort of thing going on. And in the more &quot;legit&quot; world of venues, new ones are popping up everywhere. </p>

<p>Maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230154256/http://www.cbgb.com/">some clubs</a> can&apos;t make it in the city, but others are thriving. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230154256/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/27/arts/music/27club.html">The New York Times reports</a> that in the next few months as many as five new spaces will be coming our way, &quot;giving the city&#x2019;s rock infrastructure its most substantial expansion in years.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the bigger empires is the Mercury-Bowery group, or as they are now called: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230154256/http://www.bowerypresents.com/">The Bowery Presents</a>. Booking three of the better venues, &quot;bands can be sent up the chain, from the 250-capacity Mercury to the 575-person Bowery to Webster Hall, at 1,400.&quot; If you ask any band starting out where they want to play, they will almost always tell you Bowery Ballroom, and they all know Mercury Lounge comes first. </p>

<p>Make that four venues. The Bowery Presents just acquired Northsix and will be renovating it and renaming it The Music Hall of Williamsburg. </p>

<p>The Times also reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230154256/http://www.livenation.com/">Live Nation</a> will have a hand at booking the new Luna Lounge. The venue that closed its doors last year on Ludlow Street will be reopening this year in Williamsburg, in a 350 capacity space. Live Nation booking Luna Lounge just seems wrong, doesn&apos;t it?</p>
