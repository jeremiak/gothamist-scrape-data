</div></div>					<p>Bob Guccione, founder of <em>Penthouse</em> magazine and one-time owner of &quot;one of the biggest private houses in Manhattan,&quot; died yesterday at the age of 79 from throat cancer, which he had been battling for years&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005037/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/business/media/21guccione.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> notes that he &quot;did not drink, smoke or use drugs.&quot; Guccione was born in Brooklyn, but was living in Texas at the time of his death.</p>

<p>Once named one of the wealthiest people by Forbes (with a net worth of $400MM in 1982), he eventually lost his fortune; one of his major financial losses was in 1979&#x2014;just 10 years after bringing <em>Penthouse</em> to the States&#x2014;when he invested $17.5 million in the X-rated film <em>Caligula</em>. Over a decade later Internet pornography grew increasingly competitive, causing more financial strain for Guccione&apos;s empire. </p>

<p>Along with his fortune he lost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005037/http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/milbank-mansion-closes-without-setting-townhouse-record">his Manhattan mansion</a> (located at 14-16 East 67th Street), which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005037/http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/n_9815/">NY Mag</a> said he had been living in like a &quot;near-recluse.&quot; He moved out in 2006, three years after his company General Media filed for bankruptcy and he resigned as chairman of <em>Penthouse</em>, and 26 years after he bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005037/http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2004/feb/01/features.magazine87">a $1MM+ Picasso</a> at Sotheby&apos;s because he &quot;was in the mood to buy something.&quot;</p>
