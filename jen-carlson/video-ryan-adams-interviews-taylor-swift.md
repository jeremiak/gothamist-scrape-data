<p>As some added value to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223230935/http://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story">that in-depth Chuck Klosterman piece</a> on Taylor Swift, GQ has now released the below interview between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223230935/http://gothamist.com/tags/ryanadams">Ryan Adams</a> and Swift, whose album <em>1989</em> he just covered and released. Check it out: </p>

<p><script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20151223230935js_/http://player.cnevids.com/embedjs/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000006/video/561eaccc61646d4d2a00000a.js"></script></p><div style="margin:10px 0; text-align:center;"></div><p></p>

<p>Nothing truly groundbreaking is revealed, but it&apos;s the first time we&apos;ve seen the two interacting face-to-face since the release of the cover album, which Swift has supported since day one. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223230935/http://www.billboard.com/taylor-swift-1989-ryan-adams-royalties-bruce-springsteen-patti-scialfa-jessica-springsteen-longines-masters-of-los-angeles">recent Billboard article</a> delved deeper into the financial side of that deal, and it turns out that&#x2014;in Swift math&#x2014;she&apos;ll be getting &quot;mere pocket change.&quot; Here&apos;s the loose breakdown:</p>

<blockquote>As of Oct. 5. And Billboard estimates that publishing royalties for digital album and track sales, audio and video streaming, and radio spins for that period total $81,234. Swift, 25, will get only a portion of that because she worked with six other songwriters on <em>1989</em>&#x2014;Max Martin, Shellback, Ryan Tedder, Jack Antonoff, Ali Payami and Imogen Heap&#x2014;who, along with their publishers, will each get a cut based on their respective publishing deals and song-share splits. Even if Swift kept the whole bundle it wouldn&#x2019;t buy much in the ritzy Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca, where she lives. Meanwhile, 40-year-old Adams&#x2019; artist royalties from the album total about $152,000.</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the two can do a small club tour in support of the cover album to make some extra cash. (Please?)</p>

<p>If you hadn&apos;t listened to Adams&apos;s version of the album yet, we highly recommend it, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223230935/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/21/welcome_to_1989_ryan_adams.php">you can do so here</a>.</p>
