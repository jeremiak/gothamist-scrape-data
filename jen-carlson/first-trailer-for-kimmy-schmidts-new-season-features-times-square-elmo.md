<p>While rumors swirled that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022145055/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/like_a_rat_trap_but_for_clicks.php">Pizza Rat would be making a cameo</a> this season, he was left on the cutting room floor for trailer #1&#x2014;this one does feature the infamous Times Square Elmo, however. Or as Kimmy refers to him: &quot;Junkyard Elmo.&quot;</p>
