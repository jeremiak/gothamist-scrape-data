Who does one vote for in a Gwyneth Paltrow versus <em>Real Housewife</em> Bethenny Frankel deathmatch? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170737/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/08/10/2009-08-10_rael_housewives_star_bethenny_frankel_.html">The Daily News</a> reports that Frankel, who is also a chef when she&apos;s not busy being a reality television puppet, doesn&apos;t want to see the Hollywood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170737/http://www.goop.com/">starlet-turned-lifestyle guru</a> get her own cooking show; &quot;I&apos;d rather staple my eyelids shut than watch Gwyneth cook.
