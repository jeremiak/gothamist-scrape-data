                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="newjayzmarqueenope.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025907im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newjayzmarqueenope.jpg" width="225" height="187" class="image-right"> </span>If you were planning on seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025907/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay-Z</a> play atop the Ed Sullivan Theater marquee on July 9th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025907/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/jay-z_planning_july_performance_ato.php">a &quot;surprise&quot; performance</a> that the rapper reportedly got permits for, the city has now taketh your plans away!</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025907/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/concert_gets_the_jay_zap_bJ7HpBzESbsECX2MRoR1dP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">NY Post</a> source, &quot;The mayor&#x2019;s office approved it, and then just like that, it got denied. t&#x2019;s because of the holiday weekend. They were concerned about fireworks and terrorism.&#x201D; The last time Jay-Z wasn&apos;t allowed to play the marquee, he managed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025907/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/21/jay-z_is_performing_outdoors_tonigh.php">secure the roof instead</a>... so <em>something</em> may still happen.</p>

<p>At a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025907/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/report_nypd_crime_stat_manipulation.php">press conference yesterday,</a> NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly was asked if the department was taking additional security measures for the concert. Kelly sternly replied, &quot;I&apos;d go back and check on that.&quot;   </p>

<p>Oh well. Let&apos;s just revisit this performance from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807025907/http://gothamist.com/tags/phish">The Best Band</a> To Ever Play The Marquee:</p>
