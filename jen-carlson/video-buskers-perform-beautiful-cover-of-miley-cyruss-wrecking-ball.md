                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mileybuskers.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095101im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mileybuskers.jpg" width="640" height="361" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>These two buskers&#x2014;Guitaro 5000 and Najee&#x2014;recently set up on the Bedford Avenue L platform and performed a pretty gorgeous version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095101/http://gothamist.com/tags/mileycyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>&apos;s &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; with electric guitar and violin. There&apos;s no nudity, no licking of sledgehammers, no Terry Richardson... even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095101/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/sinead_pens_2nd_letter_to_miley.php">Sinead O&apos;Connor</a> would approve. And the Williamsburg L train crowd <em>loved it</em>, naturally.</p>

<p>If strings ain&apos;t your thing, maybe you&apos;ll enjoy this interpretive dance to Cyrus&apos;s MDMA hit &quot;We Can&apos;t Stop&quot;:</p>
