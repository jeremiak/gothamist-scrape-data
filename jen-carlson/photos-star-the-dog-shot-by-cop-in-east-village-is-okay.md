<p>Almost two weeks ago the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032018/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/14/dog_killed_by_nypd_in_east_village.php">shot a dog</a> in broad daylight in the East Village. The dog, named Star, was found barking near her owner, who was passed out and was believed to be having a seizure on the sidewalk. One witness told us, &quot;The dog was protecting the owner, that&apos;s what it does.&quot; When the NYPD arrived on the scene, Star continued barking and running around, and presumably believing she was dangerous, an officer shot her&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032018/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/14/graphic_video_dog_shot_in_east_vill.php">there is graphic video of the shooting</a> (see below)&#x2014;and then pepper-sprayed her. Star miraculously survived the point-blank shot, and has been at Animal Care &amp; Control since, but her status has been unknown&#x2014;until now. This morning Richard Gentles told us that Star &quot;is improving, [but] she&apos;s still resting and not up for visitors at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>Gentles tells us Star was officially released to Animal Care &amp; Control yesterday at 8 p.m. &quot;Her owner had until that day and time to reclaim her but since he didn&#x2019;t ownership was legally transferred to AC&amp;C.;&quot; Until last night, the AC&amp;C; couldn&#x2019;t provide information because of this, but now that she has been released to them, they are free to place her and disclose her status. (Star&apos;s owner is believed to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032018/http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/police-shooting-star-the-pit-bull-was-justified-plus-video-of-the-aftermath/">Lech Stankiewicz</a>, who has not been reported to have been seen since the day of the shooting.)</p>

Since her arrival on August 13th, Gentles says they&apos;ve &quot;ensured that she has received proper veterinary care and attention.&quot; Additionally, her medical bills, which have already amounted to nearly $10,000, will be paid for through donations to AC&amp;C;&#x2019;s Special Treatment and Recovery (S.T.A.R.) Fund. Once she is through recovering, they will &quot;ultimately transfer ownership of Star and her continued care to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032018/http://nycacc.org/NewHope.htm">the Mayor&#x2019;s Alliance for NYC&#x2019;s Animals</a>&quot; (specifically AC&amp;C;&apos;s New Hope partner, where homes are found for unwanted animals).

We will update once Star leaves the hospital and that happens. It&apos;s expected she&apos;ll be put up for adoption&#x2014;but Gentles says no one has expressed interest in being her human (yet)!
