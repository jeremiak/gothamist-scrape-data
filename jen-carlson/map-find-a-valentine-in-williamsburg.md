title: Map: Find a Valentine in Williamsburg
---

	
										<p>You&apos;ve only got one more day to find a valentine, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040649/http://www.flickr.com/photos/sgoralnick/3276996956/in/photostream/">Steph Goralnick</a> just made it much easier! She says she designed a set of valentine cards to sell &quot;but then decided that since the economy is in a state of such deep suckage I would spread a little sweetness and give them all away for free.&quot; Originally 22 packets were scattered about Williamsburg, but they&apos;re quickly being picked up. Here&apos;s a heart-shaped map to help you find what&apos;s left:</p>
