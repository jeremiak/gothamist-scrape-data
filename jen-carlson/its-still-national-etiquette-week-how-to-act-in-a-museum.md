Some rules on how to behave when surrounded by priceless works of art include:<br>
</p><ul><li>Dress up.<br>
</li><li>Turn off your cell phone.<br>
</li><li>Act out of consideration for others, show respect.<br>
</li><li>Talk, but not too loudly.<br>
</li><li>Okay, if you don&apos;t want to dress up, at least ditch the baseball hat.<br>
</li><li>No pointing!<br>
</li><li>Can&apos;t get a good vantage point? Be patient. (Likewise, don&apos;t hog prime space in front of a piece for too long.)<br>
</li><li>Keep your clothes on. Especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144201/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/27/photographer_brings_21st_century_nu.php">at the Met</a>.<br>
</li><li>Please don&apos;t make out in the planetarium.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>And about the kids? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144201/http://en.paperblog.com/museum-etiquette-7229/">Paperblog</a> says, &quot;Kids running around or being loud is unacceptable.&quot; So instead of taking them to MoMA (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144201/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/worlds_youngest_art_critic_upset_ab.php">where there are no dinosaurs</a>), maybe take them to a more interactive, fun exhibit.</p>
