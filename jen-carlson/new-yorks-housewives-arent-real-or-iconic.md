The show premieres tonight, and critics have already gone sour on it. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180012/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03032008/news/regionalnews/dont_buy_this_wives_tale_100229.htm">The NY Post</a> describes the five women chosen to represent NYC as &quot;status-hungry, money-mad matrons&quot; (a real life <em>Cashmere Mafia</em> living in a <em>Lipstick Jungle</em>?). Appalled that out of &quot;8 million residents representing every known corner of the globe&quot; the network picked five who don&apos;t represent actual real New York housewives. Not really a shocker. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180012/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936380.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1">Variety</a> calls the New York show an &quot;irritant&quot;, where the original in California was merely a guilty pleasure. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180012/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/03/03/2008-03-03_poor_excuse_for_ny_housewives.html">The Daily News</a> weighs in on the shallow show as well: &quot;saying these women represent &apos;New York housewives&apos; is like saying Alex Rodriguez represents the New York working class.&quot; </p>

<p>Bravo&apos;s VP or programming, Andy Cohen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180012/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-03-03-real-housewives_N.htm">declares</a> &quot;These woman are as iconic to New York City as the other ones are to Orange County.&quot; Iconic? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180012/http://www.raken.com/american_wealth/OTHER/newsletter/chronicle111103.asp">Not anymore</a>. Do these women look familiar to <em>you</em>?</p>
