<p>Last week marked the 20th anniversary of the Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Wallace&apos;s death. On Sunday night, at the Nets/Knicks game at Barclays Center, the home team paid homage to the late Brooklyn rapper with Biggie Night. His family and friends presented a banner to Biggie during halftime, with Diddy taking to the court for an official unveiling. The banner will remain in the venue permanently. </p>

<p>&quot;There would be no Biggie without Brooklyn,&quot; Diddy said, asking the audience to &quot;please look up, so we can do something real special tonight.&quot; The announcer came on declaring, &quot;This banner, honoring the life and legacy of Biggie Smalls, will hang permanently at Barclays Center.&quot; Watch the unveiling below.</p>
