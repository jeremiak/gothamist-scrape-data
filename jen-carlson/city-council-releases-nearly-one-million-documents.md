According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608190938/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/a-treasure-trove-of-documents-courtesy-of-the-city-council/?smid=tw-nytmetro">CityRoom</a>, &quot;The collection includes a half-century of Local Laws since 1955, searchable by date and topic, and, as evidence for doubters, 66,000 photographs of council members at work through 2005.&quot; Woohoo, <em>legislative archives</em>. But this is actually pretty neat&#x2014;as Professor Lieberman says: &#x201C;For the first time historians, journalists, students and the general public will have access to the other half of New York&#x2019;s history.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Lieberman added, &#x201C;In these times of calling for transparency in government, the City Council legislative archive makes accessible the back-story on how all the local laws for the past 50 years were debated and written.&quot; The archives includes everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608190938/http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/NYCC_DOCS/HIGHLIGHTS/Gay_Rights_Docs.pdf">gay rights documents</a> from the 1970s and &apos;80s (including bills, letters for and against, and LGBT photos) to photos of Ed Koch signing bills. </p>

<p>This all makes us want to listen to some classic Schoolhouse Rock tunes:</p>
