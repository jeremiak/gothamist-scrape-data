<p>There <em>is</em> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150902010032/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/recreation_centers/view_recreation_center.php?ID=B085">Metropolitan Pool and Fitness Center</a>, located on Bedford and Metropolitan. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150902010032/http://www1.villagevoice.com/nycguide/ve9394,18.html">the Voice</a>, it offers: &quot;two gym rooms and a three-lane, 25-yard pool.&quot; Racked also got an email informing them of a new gym which will be opening soon on the south side near Graham Avenue or somewhere in the McCarren Park vicinity. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150902010032/http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=gym&amp;find_loc=Brooklyn%2FWilliamsburg+-+South+Side%2C+New+York%2C+NY">Yelp</a>,  there&apos;s a Curves, some personal trainers...and Frenchie&apos;s Gymnasium (which apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150902010032/http://www.flickr.com/photos/zkorb/26551658/">looks like this</a>). Anyone else have any leads on Williamsburg gyms? <br>
