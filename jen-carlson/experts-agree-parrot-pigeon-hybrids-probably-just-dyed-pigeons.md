<p>Last weekend some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121159/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/10/photos_half_pigeon_half_parrot.php">mysterious pigeon-parrot hybrids</a> were spotted in Queens, but experts now tell us these are just your garden variety rock pigeons with some colorful dye applied. Next they&apos;ll tell us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121159/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/31/anthony_weiner_and_citi_bike_friend.php">this <em>isn&apos;t</em> a photo</a> of Anthony Weiner astride a pegasus! Below are theories and thoughts from a birder, a pigeon fancier, and the NYC Audubon.</p>

<p>New York City birder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121159/https://www.flickr.com/photos/yojimbot/">Yojimbot</a> tells us the pigeon &quot;has been dyed... impossible to say with what but I&apos;m guessing some vegetable based dye, because anything else would affect the flight of the bird. I&apos;ve heard of similar things in Europe and India for religious ceremonies.&quot;</p>

<p>Onorio Catenacci, a pigeon fancier from Michigan, tells us the process is painless: &quot;I&apos;ve seen pigeons with dyed feathers before; it doesn&apos;t hurt the birds at all any more than a human being dyeing his or her hair would hurt them. The feathers will stay dyed until the bird molts them.&quot; As to why someone would dye a pigeon&apos;s feathers&#x2014;&quot;it might be that they just like the way the dyes look or it may be that they&apos;re trying to make their pigeons easier to identify from the ground. There are lots of pigeons that are around in colors that occur naturally; if you dye a pigeon&apos;s feathers, you can easily tell which bird is yours from the ground (with field glasses of course).&quot;</p>

<p>Tod Winston at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121159/http://www.nycaudubon.org/">NYC Audubon</a> agrees the pigeons were dyed, but believes the process is harmful to the pigeons and any predators that may get a taste: &quot;These are pigeons that have had some of their feathers dyed or painted. Though they are pretty, it is most likely not good for the birds; birds preen their feathers and will likely ingest the paint (which might be toxic)  when they do so. The paint will also make the pigeons more obvious to predators&#x2014;and if they are killed and eaten by predators such as our native red-tailed hawks, the hawks will themselves ingest the paint and possibly be harmed by it.&quot;</p>
