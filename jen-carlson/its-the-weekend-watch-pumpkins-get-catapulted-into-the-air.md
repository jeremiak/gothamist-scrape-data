<p>&quot;A catapult is a ballistic device used to launch a projectile a great distance <em>without </em>the aid of explosive devices,&quot; declares <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult">Wikipedia</a>. [Emphasis added.] And that&apos;s a shame, because the New York Hall of Science&apos;s pumpkin catapult launch would be a whole lot cooler with explosives. Or at least lit up jack-o-lanterns. But still, they&apos;ll have a catapult and they&apos;ll have pumpkins, and you can just sit back and watch them get hurled into the air all day. Pumpkin catapulting is the new apple picking.</p>

<p>Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184059/http://nysci.org/event/pumpkin-chucking/">listing</a> simply states: &quot;Watch our catapult, &apos;Chuck,&apos; toss pumpkins in the air.&quot; Understated but elegant. And here is what that looks like&#x2014;be sure to listen for the loud, gratifying thud as the pumpkin makes contact with the grass.</p>

<p>It is actually pretty shocking that there haven&apos;t been <em>more</em> reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184059/http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/little-people-big-world-child-star-jacob-roloff-injured-by-catapult-1010377.php">pumpkin catapult injuries</a> in America, where every year hobbyists construct their own pumpkin chuckers without the education of an entire science museum behind them. It&apos;s like Autumn&apos;s version of Fireworks Season out there with these amateurs:</p>

<p><em>New York Hall of Science is located at 47-01 111th Street, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Catapulting takes place Friday from 4 to 5 p.m., and Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m.</em></p>
