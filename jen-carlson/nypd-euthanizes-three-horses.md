According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141008203454/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/eutha_neigh_sia_rage_at_nypd_big_R9dNlzsZF6XhkYSiK8x6yJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, the head of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141008203454/http://gothamist.com/tags/mountedunit">NYPD&apos;s Mounted Unit</a>, Capt. Barry Gelbman, ordered three retired police horses put down upon their retirement, saying various leg ailments made it impossible to transport them to new homes upstate and in New Hampshire.<p></p>

<p>The horses&#x2014;Danny, Willis and Richie Rich&#x2014;were 15 to 20 years old, and had life expectancies of up to 30, leaving many to question Gelbman&apos;s decision. Allegedly, he made it clear the animals were under his control, as property of his department. But one source told the paper, &quot;They did not need to be euthanized. They just could not travel cramped for 16 hours. They only needed special accommodations to move them.&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time the NYPD has been involved in scandals involving their horses. On top of running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141008203454/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/colt_dolt_cop_to_admit_guilt_pTZKr8uONm02upkbi2BMTN">a corrupt auction</a>, in 2005 they sent 58 retired horses to a bankrupt farm where it was discovered they were malnourished.</p>
