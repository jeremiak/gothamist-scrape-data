<p>Today in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081117/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">ramps</a> news: Did you know that the coveted seasonal vegetable is good for more than just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081117/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/ramps_have_arrived_celebrate_with_t.php">pesto</a>? You can also put it in your cocktail. And this $12 offering from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081117/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/09/inside_caffe_storico_the_new-york_h.php#photo-1">Caffe Storico</a> (located in the NY Historical Society) may be the prettiest thing we have ever seen, but it&apos;s off the menu, so just remember the word &quot;Prosperina&quot; (the Greek Goddess of Spring) when you&apos;re there. Whisper that cocktail name into the ear of the bartender, and you&apos;ll be served up a life changing beverage.</p>

<p>This gin cocktail contains &quot;simple syrup, lime juice and a hint of bubbly which all balance well with the star ingredient: pickled ramps!&quot; </p>

<p>Go soak up the hype with this intoxicating ramp cocktail, which will only be available for a limited time, just like ramps themselves.</p>
