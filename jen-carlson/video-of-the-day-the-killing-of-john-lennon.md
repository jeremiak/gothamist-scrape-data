										<p>Last year two biopics about John Lennon&apos;s assassination made the festival rounds, and are now poised to hit theaters in 2008. One, titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161807/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488988"><em>Chapter 27</em></a>, stars Jared Leto as Mark David Chapman and an actor named Mark Lindsay Chapman portraying John Lennon. While it may be an accurate casting to have Leto playing someone who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161807/http://www.thirtysecondstomars.com/">kills music</a>, his involvement in the film will likely have us choosing the second biopic, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161807/http://imdb.com/title/tt0881934"><em>The Killing of John Lennon</em></a> (trailer below).</p>

<p>The film opens at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161807/http://www.movietickets.com/house_detail.asp?house_id=9598">IFC Center</a> tonight and is prefaced with the line: &quot;All Chapman&apos;s words are his own,&quot; though more accurately (as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161807/http://www.nysun.com/article/68751">The NY Sun</a> points out) they are those of <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, <em>Taxi Driver</em> and <em>Apocalypse Now</em> -- &quot;it would appear that Chapman&apos;s head was not exactly buzzing with original ideas.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161807/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/movies/02lenn.html?ref=arts">The NY Times</a> also weighs in on the 114-minute cinematic jaunt through the killer&apos;s mind, saying:</p><blockquote>Although <em>The Killing of John Lennon</em> doesn&#x2019;t ask you to sympathize with Mr. Chapman, who is now serving a 20-year-to-life sentence in Attica state prison, it requires you to spend nearly two hours in his disturbing company. That&#x2019;s asking a lot. Grandiose, narcissistic, subject to delusions and extreme mood swings, he comes across as the kind of maniacally self-centered creep who, if encountered in a bar, would prompt most people to disengage after five minutes of small talk. If <em>The Killing of John Lennon</em> is a well-made film, it is also a total bummer.</blockquote>This year marks the 28th anniversary of his December 8th death, a day that Yoko Ono asked be a day of forgiveness in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161807/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/26/yoko_onos_messa.php">her letter printed in The NY Times</a> in 2006.<p></p>
