<p>Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152416/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/06/kfcs_denial_of_grilled_chicken_give.php">a couple years back</a> Oprah decided to offer up some free KFC and it almost sparked a riot? Get ready to make some more memories with the Colonel, because tomorrow there&apos;s gonna be free KFC original recipe chicken being doled out of a food truck courtesy of Country Music Television. Apparently it&apos;s to promote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152416/http://www.cmt.com/pictures/top-secret-recipe-food-truck/1670966/6554637/photo.jhtml">this show</a> with a guy and his mobile food lab, which sounds sort of like <em>Breaking Bad</em> but without the meth.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152416/http://midtownlunch.com/2011/10/04/get-free-kfc-from-cmt-today-and-tomorrow/">Midtown Lunch</a>, the truck (which was also out there today) will be parked at 44th Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue.</p>
