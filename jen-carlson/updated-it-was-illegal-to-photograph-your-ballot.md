<span class="photo_caption">Ooops, we&apos;re guilty.</span></p>

<p>Did you take a photo of your voting ballot today? After all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422150326/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/wheres_your_i_voted_sticker.php">most of us don&apos;t get stickers</a>, so how else would someone know we performed our civic duty if we didn&apos;t photograph it and circulate the proof via social networking sites? What Instagram filter did <em>you</em> use? Wait, that&apos;s not important, we&apos;re actually here to tell you it&apos;s ILLEGAL. </p>

<p>According to New York State Law (17-130), it is a misdemeanor in relation to elections to show your ballots after it is prepared for voting, or to &quot;reveal the contents.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422150326/http://www.citmedialaw.org/state-law-documenting-vote-2012#NY">This site</a> states that: &quot;Photographing or filming one&apos;s own vote at the time of voting and afterwards displaying the image on a publicly accessible platform like the Internet&quot; is illegal. We called the New York State Board of Elections to double-check on this and the woman we spoke with confirmed, after briefly chuckling.</p>

<p>Did you document your vote? See you in jail!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422150326/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/posting_photos_of_your_ballot.html">Syracuse.com</a>, &quot;Lawyers for the New York State Board of Elections made a decision today that it does not violate New York State laws to post photographs of ballots online.&quot; They explain: &quot;New York State law prohibits a voter from showing his ballot to others after it is filled out. But lawyers for the state Board of Elections determined today that a photo is different than an actual ballot, spokesman John Conklin said.&quot; We did it, Internet! Instagram your little hearts out.</p>
