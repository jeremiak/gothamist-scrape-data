<p>In the below video you&apos;ll see a cruise ship passenger&apos;s view of the massive vessel hitting the pier that the Intrepid is located on. The passenger can be heard in the video saying: &quot;Here we go... hold on! He just hit the pier. Captain&apos;s gonna need a long vacation.&quot; So what happens when when a giant ship like this hits a pier? Aside from making a loud noise, it&apos;s unclear at this point if there are any damages. An Intrepid spokesperson confirmed this morning that it was the pier the Intrepid is located on, however it is the Hudson River Park Trust&#x2019;s pier (Pier 86). They also the following statement:<br>
 <br>
</p><blockquote>Friday at approximately 8:30 a.m., a Norwegian Cruise ship grazed Pier 86, the home of the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, as it was turning to pull into Pier 88.  The Museum is inspecting the pier for damage but it appears minimal at this time.  There was no impact on the preparations for the flyover of the Enterprise almost two hours later.</blockquote> <br>
