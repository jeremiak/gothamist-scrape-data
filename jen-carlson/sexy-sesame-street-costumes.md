<p>What, no sexy Snuffleupagus? A costume shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710000304/http://blog.costumecraze.com/2010/02/first-look-at-cute-sesame-street-costumes">has announced</a> their new line of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710000304/http://gothamist.com/tags/sesamestreet">Sesame Street</a> costumes featuring Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Elmo&#x2014;all available in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710000304/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/12/how_young_is_too_young_to_be_slutty.php">teen</a> and women sizes. They call them &quot;super cute,&quot; but... we&apos;re conflicted! While sexualizing Sesame Street characters just seems <em>wrong</em>, that flapper Big Bird costume is sort of amazing. And it&apos;s not like the hemlines are <em>that</em> short. Anyway, if there&apos;s a Sesame Street-specific <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710000304/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom">Furry</a> fetish group out there... they are so psyched right now.</p>
