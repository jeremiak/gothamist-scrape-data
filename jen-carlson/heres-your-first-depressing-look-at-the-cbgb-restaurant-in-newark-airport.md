<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052821/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/21/cbgb_newark_restaurant.php">CBGB restaurant</a> appears to be at least partially open in Newark Airport, according to some photos that circulated on Twitter over the holidays. While the &quot;inside&quot; still seems to be under renovations (bathroom recreation is an art not to be rushed), the al fresco dining area looked pretty packed over the past week.</p>

<p>Just like the original CBGB, there are iPads for ordering, a flatscreen TV showing a sports match, stained glass, your Aunt Cindy from Flensburg, MN, a dark faux-brick facade, Togarashi-Seared Tuna served with a seaweed salad ($16), and a pillar with wallpaper depicting graffiti tags on it. <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052821/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">Ceci n&apos;est pas une CBGB</a>.</em></p>

<p>The restaurant is in Terminal C of Newark Airport in New Jersey, if you&apos;d like to be enveloped by an empty feeling while staring into an Epcot version of a past you may or may not have even experienced. They should have at least gone with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052821/http://luckypeach.com/first-look-the-new-cbgb-menu-newark-aiport/">a parody menu</a> as a nod to this absurdness.</p>
