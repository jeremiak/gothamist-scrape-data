										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="rollingstonecoversthennow.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144504im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/rollingstonecoversthennow.jpg" width="640" height="451" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><em>Rolling Stone</em> started off with such promise, the first ten covers (in order) were: John Lennon (pictured), Tina Turner, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix (Donovan and Otis Redding), Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix (again!), Monterey Pop Festival, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and Eric Clapton. Sure, there have been non-musicians: Woody Allen, Billy Crystal, E.T., and Jerry Seinfeld amongst them... but now the magazine has gone to the dark side. Darker than when they put Darth Vader on the cover (issues 400/401, 975, 1000). </p>

<p>Let&apos;s face it though, those people aren&apos;t going to discuss the hard-hitting issues like &quot;smushing&quot; or the size of Vinny&apos;s &quot;ding dong&quot;&#x2014;for that, there&apos;s only one expert. Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144504/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/snooki-discusses-smushing-and-the-stress-of-jersey-shore-in-rolling-stone-cover-story-20110302">the new cover</a> features none other than <em>Jersey Shore</em>&apos;s Snooki, and to be more specific, Snooki is being launched on a missile with the words: Snooki&apos;s Wild Ride (America&apos;s #1 Party Girl) underneath. The real sting of it all (aside from this being her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144504/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/06/exclusive-jersey-shore-cast-rock-out-rolling-stone-0">second <em>RS</em> cover</a>) is that in tiny print somewhere under the missile head is the name: Radiohead. You know, the highly successful band that just dropped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144504/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/.../happy_friday_radiohead_releases_new.php">their latest album</a>? That would have been a nice cover. </p>

<p>Below, Snooki discusses her own surprise at getting the cover, and how the <em>Rolling Stone</em> shoot was the &quot;most hardest&quot; shoot she&apos;s ever done.</p>

<p>So, which deserved musicians did this Poughkeepsie girl beat to the cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em>?</p>
