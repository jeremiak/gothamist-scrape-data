<p>This photo was taken earlier today at Bridge Apothecary in DUMBO, one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003235/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/19/tampons.php">last remaining stores</a> carrying o.b. tampons during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003235/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/19/tampons.php">the Great o.b. Tampon Shortage</a> (2010 - ????). As you can see their supply has now run out, even though two weeks ago the owner was certain they&apos;d be overflowing with boxes of the non-applicator brand in no time. In fact, Johnson &amp; Johnson has been assuring everyone that the tampons would be back on shelves &quot;soon&quot;... but that&apos;s been their canned answer <em>for months</em> now. Can we get WikiLeaks on this?</p>

<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118003235/http://www.bust.com/blog/2011/01/26/tampon-tv-marketing-ob-and-alternatives-to-consider.html">Bust magazine</a> has some alternatives to get you through this tampocalypse.</p>
