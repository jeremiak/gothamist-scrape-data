<p>SJP told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101400/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/04/02/2008-04-02_sarah_jessica_parker_outer_boros_will_ca.html">Daily News</a> that Manhattan is &quot;a really hard city, and it&apos;s very expensive and it&apos;s not what it used to be. That&apos;s why the outer boroughs are so desirable.&quot; But hold that chin up high future Carries, she adds that New York &quot;still is the place with a lot of promise and a lot of potential. And if you have the constitution and you manage to stick it out, it&apos;s well worth every obstacle and every stumbling block.&quot; </p>

<p>Even though her show made places like Brooklyn seem undesirable and ugly, the 2008 Carrie may think &quot;the outer boroughs are pretty sexy,&quot; at least, that&apos;s what SJP declares -- she even included that &quot;it&apos;s just a matter of time before they have their own shows.&quot;</p>
