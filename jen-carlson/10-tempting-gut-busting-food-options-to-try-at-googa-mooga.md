<span class="photo_caption">The Fried Cheesecake Bombs from James</span></p>

<p>Made epecially for GoogaMooga, James Restaurant in Prospect Heights has created the <strong>Fried Cheesecake Bomb</strong> which they&apos;ll offer up two-ways: a Lemon-Ricotta and a Chocolate. You&apos;ll get three per order, at $6 an order.</p>

<p>Tom Collicchio&apos;s Craft will serve up a spin on New York City&apos;s famous dirty water hot dogs with their <strong>Dirty Duck Dogs</strong>. The hot dogs, as the name gives away, will be made from duck and then topped with pickled cabbage and black garlic (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517040629/http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2012/05/16/dining/20120516-GOOGA.html?src=tp">the NY Times</a> has a food pornalicious photo of the creation). We dare you to pair one of these with the 1600 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517040629/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/09/a_faux_vs_foie_gras_doughnut_taste-.php#photo-5"><strong>fois gras doughnuts</strong></a> Do or Dine will have on hand.</p>

<p>You obviously can&apos;t go wrong with a lobster roll, and at the event Luke&apos;s Lobster will have you covered. Their <strong>lobster rolls</strong> cost $15, and they&apos;re well worth it according to Gothamist&apos;s John Del Signore, who says they&apos;re simply &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517040629/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php#photo-3">the best</a>.&quot; If you want something a little different from the sea, the Vinegar Hill House will be on hand with <strong>soft shell crab sandwiches</strong>, which will be made to order and placed on a sesame bun.</p>

<p>Over at the Meat Hook&apos;s stand, they&apos;ll be serving up small and large plates ($5-$10) of housemade pork sausage, jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, and hot sauce called &quot;<strong>Long Dong Bud</strong>,&quot; with sides of &quot;Mexican colesaw.&quot; A plain &quot;dog&quot; with no fixins will cost you 5 bucks. For more meat, the Brindle Room will have an <strong>aged steakhouse burger</strong> ($10) paired up with <strong>Donkey Punch</strong> (we&apos;re told it&apos;s like a big &quot;Bug Juice&quot; with strawberry, hibiscus, watermelon) for $5. And at DBGB Kitchen &amp; Bar they&apos;ll be plating some <strong>house made Thai sausage</strong>, which is a pork link served on a bun with red curry, lemongrass, cilantro, green papaya salad and peanuts. A single is $6 and a double is $10.</p>

<p>Vegetarians, this <em>is</em> a meat-heavy fest, but you&apos;ll be able to fill your belly with things like Roberta&apos;s pizza, so it could be worse. Roberta&apos;s will have <strong>personal 8&quot; pizza</strong> on hand. From the veggie friendly margherita (tomato, mozzarella, basil); to the meatier Specken Wolf (mozzarella, speck, mushroom, red onion, oregano) and Bee Sting (tomato, mozzarella, sopresseta, chili, honey). Prices will be around $10 and up.</p>
