										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="clapreturns0511a.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023441im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/clapreturns0511a.jpg" width="350" height="249" class="image-right"> </span>This morning it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023441/http://twitter.com/#!/cyhsyband/status/71202710199873538">was announced</a> that Clap Your Hands Say Yeah are <em>back</em>. It&apos;s been about four years since their last album <em>Some Loud Thunder</em> was released, and six years since they played <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023441/http://gothamist.com/2005/06/21/movable_hype_30_recap.php">our Movable Hype show</a> (in front of a crowd that included David Bowie!). In the recent downtime, various band members have started new projects, so to those on the outside, it&apos;s always been a little unclear if a resurrection was imminent. But here it is 2011 and the band is back... and not some zombie version of it&apos;s former self, either&#x2014;all original members are on board. This morning one of them, Robbie Guertin, told us a little bit about the big news: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;It&apos;s definitely a bit surreal to be getting the Clap machine moving again, but we&apos;re all really psyched about it and proud of the record we&apos;ve made.  I think people will really like it.  We&apos;re still working out details for future shows, putting together plans for some bigger tours for later in the year and next year, so we&apos;ll be adding more dates as we get it figured out.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>As for Guertin&apos;s other band, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023441/http://www.radicaldads.com/">Radical Dads</a>, he says they&apos;re &quot;definitely still going strong! Our record is coming out next month which is also very exciting.  Clap will become more of a priority as things really get going, but luckily I&apos;ve decided to give up sleep starting in the fall, so that should give me plenty of time to do both.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023441/http://www.clapyourhandssayyeah.com/">Clap&apos;s new album</a>, called <em>Hysterical</em>, will be out in September&#x2014;but you can get a taste below. And let&apos;s hope <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023441/http://gothamist.com/2005/09/20/clap_your_hands_say_graf.php">the Clap graffiti</a> returns with news of the band&apos;s comeback.</p>
