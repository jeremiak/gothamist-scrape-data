<p>A couple of years ago we spotted the Lincoln Center subway entrance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003517/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/06/subway_6.php">in DUMBO</a>, and now in nearby Brooklyn Heights, a new fake subway entrance has popped up for the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003517/http://gothamist.com/tags/meninblack"><em>Men In Black</em></a> movie. Reader Matt S. tells us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I was extremely confused this morning when I walked out and found a subway stop on my corner (3rd and Court) where there hadn&apos;t been one yesterday. Then I remembered that Will Smith&apos;s latest opus is filming on my block. But I&apos;m still left wondering: what&apos;s up with the serif typeface? Does the old timey lettering suggest a time travel plot twist... or just a lazy, LA based set designer?&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Well, they <em>are</em> going back in time in the movie, and we&apos;ve also heard there are a lot of vintage cars in the area (so you probably won&apos;t be seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003517/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/13/inside_the_heat_will_smiths_banishe.php">The Heat</a>). But was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003517/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/30/subway_font_porn.php">that font</a> ever used in the subway system?</p>
