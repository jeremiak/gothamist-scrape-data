<p>So the Keith Haring tribute mural <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164810/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/06/haring_takedown_on_houston.php">has been buffed</a>, and currently the Brazilian street art duo (and twin brothers) Os Gemeos (real names Gustavo and Otavio Pandolfo) are creating their own mural in its place (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164810/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/07/os-gemeos-paint-over-keith-haring-tribute-mural/">Animal has photos</a> of the work in progress). </p>

<p>If you&apos;ve been to Coney Island anytime in the past four years, it&apos;s likely you&apos;ve already seen Os Gemeos&apos; work, they have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164810/http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluejake/471325191/sizes/l/">mural opposite the Coney Island subway station</a> that Creative Time sponsored.</p>

<p>As for this new one, it&apos;s sponsored by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164810/http://www.deitch.com/">Deitch</a> (who also commissioned the Haring piece). They tell us it will &quot;blend ideas from artist&apos;s daily life with the fantasy or &apos;ludico&apos; world where the recognizable is harmonically blended with the abstract.&quot; And the artists are doing this as they go, the duo don&apos;t work off sketches, so we&apos;ll just have to wait and see!</p>
