<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sheenarrives0411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021438im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sheenarrives0411.jpg" width="365" height="380" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021438/http://gothamist.com/tags/charliesheen">Charlie Sheen</a> is <em>inside the building</em>. Or rather, he has arrived in New York City. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021438/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/04/07/2011-04-07_charlie_sheen_returns_to_new_york_actor_causes_frenzy_before_torpedo_of_truth_sh.html">the Daily News</a>, the MaSheen checked in to Trump International Hotel this morning (he was banned from The Plaza, and several other establishments), which was surrounded by paparazzi. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021438/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/sheen_lands_in_nyc_for_torpedo_of_idNOoPyIHN8u3E9htXLrzM#ixzz1IsQ21RgK">The Post</a> reports that he booked 12 rooms at the hotel for four nights. He&apos;s all ours until Monday, New York! And TMZ will be helping us cherish every moment by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424021438/http://www.tmz.com/2011/04/07/charlie-sheen-new-york-city-trump-hotel-plaza-hotel-capri-anderson/">documenting his every move</a>.</p>

<p>The actor will be aiming his Violent Torpedo of Truth at the Radio City Music Hall stage this weekend (do you think he&apos;s going to be allowed to light up in there?), with two shows at the <em>once iconic and now tarnished</em> venue (neither are sold out). <em>Sigh</em>, we&apos;ll be there, and will report back every vile detail we witness. According to the paper, his most recent show included a story about smuggling cocaine onto a plane with Nicholas Cage. But we&apos;re pretty sure we&apos;ve heard that one before.</p>
