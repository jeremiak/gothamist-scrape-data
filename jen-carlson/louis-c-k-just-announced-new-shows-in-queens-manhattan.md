<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161247/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> has added NYC dates to his summer tour&#x2014;one will be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161247/http://gothamist.com/tags/foresthillsstadium">Forest Hills Stadium</a>, which is shaping up to be the best venue in the five boroughs for summer shows. The event is billed as &quot;one night only,&quot; and will take place on July 22nd. Tickets are $55 and are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161247/http://ForestHillsStadium.com/">on sale</a> &quot;NOW,&quot; the email sent moments ago read, and as of 12:45 p.m. they aren&apos;t yet sold out, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161247/http://www.foresthillsstadium.com/#/event/1187733-louis-ck-forest-hills/">check here</a> and you may have some luck.</p>

<p>The other two will be in September at Madison Square Garden, tickets for those dates (September 8th and 12th) are also on sale now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161247/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/3B0050A3C49A12DC">here</a>. </p>

<p>Previously the only nearby shows Louis has only announced have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161247/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/09/louis_ck_announces_tour_dates_in_nj.php">in NJ and CT</a>.</p>

<p>In email he just sent out, he says to expect &quot;all new material&quot; on this tour, but adds &quot;if you saw me at a club or something since last May or so, you might be seeing some of the same material, though it has changed drastically over the months... but if you&#x2019;ve seen me on tour, in a major venue, you won&#x2019;t have seen these particular words. That&#x2019;s right. I am not using any words that I have ever said on stage. It was a very difficult challenge. I had to resort to words like &apos;cotton&apos; and &apos;trunk&apos; and even &apos;Salutation.&apos; Anyway. It&#x2019;s new jokes and I think I&#x2019;m better at comedy right now than I&#x2019;ve been for a while and I&#x2019;m going to dedicate the year to just doing great live shows.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 5/23:</strong> Louis C.K. just announced a third show at MSG, happening on September 15th (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161247/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/3B0050A3C4A712E1">tickets here</a>). According to his email, he is &quot;adding shows to the global planetary TOUR that I am currently&#x2026; doing. A lot of shows are selling out quickly so we are adding shows in some of those cities.&quot;</p>
