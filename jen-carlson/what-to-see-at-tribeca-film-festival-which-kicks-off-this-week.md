<p><strong>NY-CENTRIC DOCUMENTARIES</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Mistaken For Strangers</strong></em> (Director: Tom Berninger)<br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="BERNINGERS0412.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/BERNINGERS0412.jpg" width="640" height="360" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>What: Oh how we do love The National, and here&apos;s a chance to see some more of their magic in a behind-the-scenes look through the lens of Tom Berninger, brother of the band&apos;s frontman Matt, who dubs this (his debut film) a self-mockumentary. &quot;The prolific, innovative rock band is on its biggest tour to date, but newbie roadie Tom cannot help throwing a wrench into the well-oiled music machine. Tom&#x2019;s moonlighting as an irreverent documentarian creates a drama of its own for the band on the road. Following the musicians and crew day and night, in places public and, ahem, private, Tom is reprimanded time and again. As endearing as the boy next door and embodying the wherewithal of a Christopher Guest character, he brings a delightfully awkward humor into the serious world of the seriously awesome The National. Brother Matt and his bandmates lend witty and profound colors to the mix, allowing carte blanche access to everything and anything that goes down on tour.&quot;</p>

<p>Times, tickets: This is the festival opener on Wednesday, but that&apos;s nearly impossible to get in to&#x2014;luckily, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/5132382a1c7d76a6bb000172-mistaken-for-strangers">two other screenings</a> you can get tickets to.</p>

<p><em><strong>Big Shot</strong></em> (Director: Kevin Connolly)</p>

<p>What: In short, a look at the man who defrauded the NHL, the government and the people of Long Island. The longer synopsis: &quot;A meteoric rise and tragic fall are captured in this brief history of a beloved sports team and a man who took a chance. When the New York Islanders first burst on the national hockey scene, the team was unstoppable. Winning four straight Stanley Cups, it became the pride of Long Island, until subsequent years of turmoil left the Islanders in dire straits. Enter John Spano, an obscure Texas millionaire with big dreams and a persuasive smile. Emboldened by Spano&#x2019;s commitment to revitalizing the team, loyal Islanders fans welcomed this would-be hero with blind faith and a handshake. Then he took his seat in the front office.&quot; <em>Dun dun dun.</em></p>

<p>Times, tickets: Various theaters, days, and times, but you&apos;ll have to hope for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/513f8efbc07f5dd874000019-big-shot">rush tickets</a> once again.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bending Steel</em></strong> (Director: Dave Carroll)</p>

<p>What: This documentary brings the viewer on an &quot;intimate journey into the lost art of the oldetime strongman and one man&apos;s struggle to overcome limitations of body and mind. The film follows Chris Schoeck as he attempts to become a professional strongman, from training in his small basement storage unit, to his very first performance on the big stage at New York&apos;s historic Coney Island. Alongside his trainer Chris Rider, he meets living legends and heroes within the strongman community. The film bears witness to a tenacious man struggling to come out of his shell through the unique activity of bending steel.&quot;</p>

<p>Times, tickets: Various theaters, days and times, but you&apos;ll have to try for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/513a82fec07f5d471300011d-a-birder-s-guide-to-every">rush tickets</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Almost Christmas</em></strong> (Director: Phil Morrisson)</p>

<p>What: &quot;Two French Canadian ne&#x2019;er-do-wells travel to New York City with a scheme to get rich quick selling Christmas trees. Easygoing charmer Rene clashes with misanthropic ex-con Dennis, whose wife Rene just stole. Still, this odd couple must make an honest go of it.&quot; Also, the stars are Paul Rudd <em>and</em> Paul Giamatti, so it&apos;s already the best buddy comedy ever.</p>

<p><em><strong>Before Midnight</strong></em> (Director: Richard Linklater)</p>

<p>What: Catch up with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julia Delpy) and see if they&apos;ve figured their shit out yet now that they&apos;re in their 40s. This is the third chapter in the tale of the star-crossed lovers, who first met in <em>Before Sunrise</em> way back in 1995. This time around they&apos;re crossing paths in Greece.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/euOJkb0U8vE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Times, tickets: Various theaters, days and times, but you&apos;ll have to try for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/513a83b7c07f5d4713000348-before-midnight">rush tickets</a> with this one, too.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bluebird</em></strong> (Director: Lance Edmands)</p>

<p>What: This is the story of a bus driver, a bartender, and a bluebird that shows &quot;the interconnectivity of life.&quot; The drama &quot;uncovers the many layers of life that link us in unexpected ways. Atmospheric cinematography establishes a lucid sense of space, filling the shadowy corners of the logging town with the prevailing cold. Edmands&#x2019;s nuanced film portrays a world dictated by life&#x2019;s cyclical nature, where our control is minimal and forgiveness is necessary.&quot; The film stars Amy Morton, John &quot;Roger Sterling&quot; Slattery, Louisa Krause, Emily Meade, Margo Martindale, Adam Driver (from <em>Girls</em>).</p>

<p>Times, tickets: Thursday, April 18th, 6:30 p.m., SVA Theater 1 Silas. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5837499117">Buy tickets here</a> (and there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/5132382b1c7d76a6bb000191-bluebird">other screenings</a> which may end up having rush tickets).</p>

<p><strong><em>Greetings From Tim Buckley</em></strong> (Director: Daniel Algrant)</p>

<p>What: While we wanted to hate a movie that had <strike>that kid from <em>Gossip Girl</em></strike> Penn Badgley playing Jeff Buckley, he really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/hear_penn_badgley_covering_jeff_buc.php">has proved himself</a> as an alright knock-off. So it&apos;s worth checking out this feature film, which focuses on the real life tribute concert that took place in Brooklyn for the late musician&apos;s father, Tim. &quot;When young Jeff Buckley is asked to participate in a tribute concert... music opens his eyes to the artistic legacy that he is destined to follow. Neither inspiration nor forgiveness comes easy, but young intern Allie gives him a hand to hold along the way.&quot;</p>

<p>Times, tickets:Various theaters, days and times. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/513a82b9c07f5d471300003a-greetings-from-tim-buckle">Tickets available here</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Run and Jump</strong></em> (Director: Steph Green)</p>

<p>What: &quot;After a stroke leaves her husband mentally disabled and fundamentally changed, spirited Irish housewife Vanetia struggles to keep her family together in the wake of tragedy. A research grant from American doctor Ted Fielding, interested in documenting the family&#x2019;s recovery process, allows them to get by. Though Vanetia initially resents living under Ted&#x2019;s microscope, she soon finds comfort in his calming presence, while Ted responds to Vanetia&#x2019;s dynamic, unpredictable personality. As the two explore their bond within their unique situation, a new family begins to emerge.&quot; Notably, this is Will Forte&apos;s first step into the world of drama. </p>

<p>Times, tickets: Various theaters, days and times. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235855/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/513a83bac07f5d4713000359-run-and-jump">Tickets available here</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stand Clear of the Closing Doors</strong></em> (Director: Sam Fleischner)</p>

<p>What: This feature film is based on a true story, and was filmed in the Rockaways (in part during Hurricane Sandy). &quot;Autistic teen Ricky lives in Far Rockaway, Queens, and while his family struggles with economic hardship, he faces the difficulties of fitting in at school. When he is scolded for skipping class, he escapes into the subway, embarking on a days-long underground odyssey among the subway&#x2019;s disparate denizens as his mother wages an escalating search effort above ground.
