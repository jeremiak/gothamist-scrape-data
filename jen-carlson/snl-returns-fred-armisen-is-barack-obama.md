<p>Saturday Night Live is back! Wasting no time digging into primary season, the opening skit was a debate between Hillary and Barack, immediately answering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/21/snl_1.php">the big question</a> posed this week: who <em>will</em> be our Fauxbama? The answer: Fred Armisen! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/02/23/fauxbama-finally-fred-a_n_88146.html">The Huffington Post</a> raises the controversial points of this decision, given the previously-noted lack of minority players on the show (Armisen is not black - he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Armisen">Venezuelan and Japanese</a> - but has played Prince on SNL) and the whole &quot;Is Obama black enough?&quot; debate.  As for the sketch itself, it was about the media&apos;s infatuation with Obama - and it even included Obama Girl!</p>

<p>A familiar face to the SNL stage, Tina Fey, returned last night taking over hosting duties. Her monologue focused on the reason the show has been absent for so long, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/13/writers_strike.php">the writers&apos; strike</a>. Steve Martin joined her, himself having hosted about 14 times. Watch in the clip below:</p>

<p>Other highlights were the show&apos;s nod to some Oscar noms, <em>There Will Be Blood</em> and <em>No Country For Old Men</em>. Yes, there were milkshakes, Friendo:<br>

<p>Mike Huckabee himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/24/nader_08_it_is.php">made a cameo on Weekend Update</a>, but our highlight of that segment - besides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/24/clinton_plays_t.php">Tina Fey&apos;s bitch piece</a> - was Amy Poehler&apos;s mention of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/25/black_cat_lost.php">lost</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025732/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/17/georgia_the_esc.php">recently found</a> in the subway cat, Georgia. Poehler reported that Georgia survived her 25 days underground &quot;by hooking up with a hip-hop dance crew.&quot; </p>
