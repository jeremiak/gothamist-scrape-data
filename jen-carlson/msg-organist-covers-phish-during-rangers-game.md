<p>At last night&apos;s Rangers game against the Boston Bruins (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211157/http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400442511">go Rangers</a>!), Madison Square Garden organist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211157/https://twitter.com/ChadDinzes/status/285419449685786625">and phan</a> Chad Dinzes performed the hockey-friendly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211157/http://gothamist.com/tags/phish">Phish</a> song &quot;It&apos;s Ice&quot;&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211157/http://www.glidemagazine.com/hiddentrack/video-chad-dinzes-its-ice-madison-square-garden/">Hidden Track</a>, this was the debut of his cover.

When Trey composed the music he did so specifically with Page in mind... consciously design[ing] the song to highlight Page&#x2019;s piano playing.&quot; So, understandably it&apos;s a little choppy and not as smooth as Page would deliver, but Dinzes isn&apos;t working <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211157/https://vimeo.com/57275950">with this kind of rig</a>, and we appreciate the Phish tease. Now clear your ear palette with the real deal:</p>
