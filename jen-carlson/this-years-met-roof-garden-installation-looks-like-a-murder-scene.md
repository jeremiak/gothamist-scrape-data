<p>This year the Metropolitan Museum of Art has taken a turn towards the dark side with their roof garden installation. The site-specific work is from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144727/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2013/imran-qureshi">artist Imran Qureshi</a>, and the finished product looks like a large-scale promotional piece for <em>Dexter</em>. Or the scene of a gruesome, bloody murder spree (but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144727/http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/05/17/arts/design/20130517-quereshi-8.html">with gorgeous views</a> of a lush and alive Central Park!).</p>

<p>While up-close the red markings show ornamental patterns, from any distance it looks like a slaughter went down, which is sort of the point&#x2014;the project &quot;represents an emotional response to violence occurring across the globe in recent decades and his earnest hope for regeneration and lasting peace in the aftermath of man-made disasters.&quot; But is this really what we need to think about when we&apos;re trying to enjoy a little friggin&apos; escapism on a sunny summer afternoon? As Gwynnie would say: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144727/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/gwyneth_paltrow_hates_the_met_ball.php">UN-FUN</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>If you can detach yourself from every terrible, tragic, bloody thing that&apos;s happened in this world, however, the piece is actually really gorgeous&#x2014;Qureshi hand-painted his work on the 8,000-square-foot open-air space. And while it&apos;s not as interactive as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144727/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/photos_the_met_roof.php#photo-1">previous</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144727/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/24/bambu_1.php#photo-1">installations</a>, visitors (it&apos;s open to the public now) are encouraged to walk all over it.</p>
