<p>Listen, in 1969 half a million or so scrappy youths got themselves to White Lake, New York for a music festival. Honor them by leaving the five boroughs and getting a little nature (and art) with your music this summer. </p>

<p>In conjunction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831182722/http://www.groundcontroltouring.com/news/storm-king-art-center-and-ground-control-touring-announce-2015-summer-serie">with Ground Control Touring</a> (they basically have All The Good Bands), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831182722/http://www.stormking.org/">Storm King Art Center</a> is hosting a summer concert series featuring The Feelies and and Alex Bleeker &amp; the Freaks (9/20), Lee Ranaldo (8/9), and Porches and Frankie Cosmos (6/28). These all cost $15 (or $12 for seniors and $8 for students).</p>

<p>Currently on display on the grounds are Lynda Benglis&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831182722/http://benglis.stormking.org/">Water Sources</a> and Luke Stettner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831182722/http://stettner.stormking.org/">Outlooks</a>.</p>

<p>Storm King is located at 1 Museum Road in New Windsor, New York, which is about one hour from New York City. It&apos;s not that easy to get to, and if you want to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831182722/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/22/port_authority_once_nice.php">avoid Port Authority</a> you&apos;re best off renting a car (they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831182722/http://www.stormking.org/visit/">offer Zipcar discounts</a>, too).</p>
