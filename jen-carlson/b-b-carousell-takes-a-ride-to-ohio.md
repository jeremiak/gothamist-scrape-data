The entire team of colorful antique horses and other carousel components will be temporarily transferred to Marion, Ohio, where it will be meticulously restored by a nationally recognized expert in the field.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon its restoration it will be moved back to Coney Island into a custom-built home (Steeplechase Pavilion), all shined up in its original glory. Costing the city $1.8 million dollars upon purchase, this process will undoubtedly add another hefty sum to the original pricetag.</p>

<p>Along with the wooden carousel (which is the only of the original 25 that&apos;s left), the Gebruder band organ will also be restored, along with the brass ring device and ticket booth. Don&apos;t expect to take a spin anytime soon however, the completion of the process isn&apos;t expected to happen for another 2 or more years. </p>
