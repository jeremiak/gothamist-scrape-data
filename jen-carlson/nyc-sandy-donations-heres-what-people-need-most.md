<p>Many New Yorkers are wondering how, where, and when they can help those who were most affected or have lost their homes during Hurricane Sandy&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094641/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/heres_how_to_volunteer_time_money_t.php">here is a list</a>, which is growing each day with more grassroots efforts. But what do people need the most? At The Red Hook Initiative, located at 767 Hicks Street, we&apos;re told they are &quot;in desperate need of material donations,&quot; and their most needed list includes:</p><ul><li>Already prepared food (including food for children) <br>
</li><li>Blankets <br>
</li><li>Baby products (diapers, wipes, etc.) <br>
</li><li>Batteries, flashlights, candles, power strips <br>
</li><li>Toiletries (including toilet paper and paper towels) <br>
</li><li>Utensils such as spoons and bowls <br>
</li><li>Jugs of water<br>
</li><li>Ensure bottles<br>
</li><li>Vitamins<br>
</li><li>Generators<br>
</li><li>Sanitary pads, tampons<br>
</li><li>Toothpaste<br>
</li><li>Cat and dog food<br>
</li><li>Food: cereal, bread, canned goods (it can never hurt to donate a can opener, as well), chips, pasta</li></ul>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094641/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/runners_everyone_heres_how_to_help.php">know from Staten Island</a>, there is also a need for utensils and plates, warm clothes/socks/underwear, tape, cleaning supplies, water, heavy duty garbage bags, and of course: gas. In areas like Rockaway things like propane grills and tarps are also needed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094641/http://rockawayhelp.com/how-can-i-help/">here&apos;s a list for Rockaway</a>). While people are donating gift cards, and that&apos;s a very nice gesture, please keep in mind that people are unable to get to stores right now (cars have been destroyed by flooding, there&apos;s no gas, there&apos;s limited mass transit, etc), so this does not help the immediate need. If you want to donate money, you can do so through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094641/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fund/html/home/home.shtml">the Mayor&apos;s Fund</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094641/http://www.redcross.org/charitable-donations">Red Cross</a>.<p></p>

<p>Helping hands are also needed&#x2014;if you want to donate your time, you can also volunteer to clean-up and canvass areas, here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094641/http://www.nycservice.org/#s">a comprehensive list</a> from the city&apos;s volunteer effort, NYC Service, of how to help.</p>
