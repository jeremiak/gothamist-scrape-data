</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202455/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/greenwich-village/about-greenwich-village/620/">PBS notes</a> that during the 1950s &quot;the Village hit its most active time, as musicians, poets, and especially visual artists began to flock there. Two of the most exciting American movements were calling Greenwich Village their home. Nearly all of the Abstract Expressionists, including Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko lived in the neighborhood. Simultaneously, the New York School of Poets was sharing the same bars, restaurants, and lofts.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Kerouac sometimes lived at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202455/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlton_House">Marlton House</a> at 5 West 8th Street, during his time there he was writing <em>The Subterraneans</em> and <em>Tristessa</em>. <br>
</li><li>In 1953, Dylan Thomas died after a night of drinking in at the White Horse Tavern (but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202455/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/28/dylan_thomas_is_baaaaack.php">his ghost</a> still lives in Manhattan).<br>
</li><li>Borders of the neighborhood have since changed, but in 1956 Encyclopedia Britannica stated that the southern border of the Village was Spring Street.<br>
</li><li>In 1958, Off-Off-Broadway was created in the neighborhood, it was a response to Off Broadway and a &quot;complete rejection of commercial theatre.&quot;  Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street was considered amongst the first Off-Off-Broadway venues.</li></ul><p></p>
