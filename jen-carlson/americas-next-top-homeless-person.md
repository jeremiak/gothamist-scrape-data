The episode brings the fourteen newest model wannabes to the not always fashionable streets. After the troupe mingles with the tourists at their fashion show in Times Square, it&apos;s off to their first photo shoot. </p>

<p>For regular watchers of the show you&apos;ll know there&apos;s always a theme to the shoots, well tonight...they <strong>pose as homeless people</strong>. For those who recall the 2001 flick <em>Zoolander</em>, you&apos;ll know this isn&apos;t the first time homelessness and fashion have converged on screen. In that movie, Will Ferrell&apos;s character Mugatu designs a line called Derelicte, described as &quot;a way of life inspired by the very homeless, the vagrants, the crackwhores that make this wonderful city so unique.&quot; </p>

<p>Off-screen Mary-Kate Olsen has made that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519233623/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/fashion/06olsen.html?position=&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1204132474-vrAhsdRtf1kv6W5Io30Sag">homeless-chic</a> look into a trend. But you just <em>know</em> Tyra is going to make this serious -- see video of her going undercover as a homeless person for her talk show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519233623/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKgKIulmjJQ">here</a>. </p>

<p>Check out the awkwardness tonight at 8pm on the CW.
