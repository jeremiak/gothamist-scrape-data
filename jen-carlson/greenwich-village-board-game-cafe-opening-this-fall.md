title: Greenwich Village Board Game Cafe Opening This Fall
---

	
										<p>&quot;What is a play cafe?&quot; is the first question asked and answered on this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330023057/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1460605990/the-uncommons-board-game-cafe">Kickstarter page for The Uncommons</a>, a board game cafe planning to open in Greenwich Village (230 Thompson Street) this October. Think: board games, D&amp;D;, coffee, tea, and hot mini-donuts, served day and night.</p>

<p>The owners just launched a Kickstarter to help fund the final stage of the project (finishing touches, <em>more board games</em>, etc), and while we don&apos;t support all Kickstarters (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330023057/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/latest_kickstarter_for_grilled_chee.php">GRILLED CHEEZUS</a> AND <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330023057/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/the_best_one_tip_we_have_for_zosia.php">CABIN SISTERS</a> 4EVER), we do support this one. There aren&apos;t that many establishments in this city that offer good clean fun without alcohol... for those into that sort of thing.</p>

<p>They plan to &quot;offer a wide library of games, as many as we can fit... we&apos;ll set aside most tables to gamers of every variety- from collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering to &apos;Euro-style&apos; games like Settlers of Catan, and classics as well.&quot; They plan to charge a cover of around $5 per person. You can plan to get your nerd on come October.</p>
