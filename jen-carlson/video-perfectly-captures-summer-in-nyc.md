<p>Earlier this year filmmaker Colby Moore delivered a beautiful and dark look at NYC, packaged up in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130720013247/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/18/vid_3.php">two minute montage</a>. Now he&apos;s back to spread a little sunshine onto our screens, telling us, &quot;I recently shot a slightly more upbeat, summer-themed montage, entitled &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130720013247/https://vimeo.com/70481100">Apple In The Sun</a>.&apos;&quot; Locations include the subway, Roosevelt Island, East River Ferry, Coney Island, Union Square, East Village, Chinatown, Manhattanvile, Tenderloin (Grand Central), and Times Square... but don&apos;t let those bold-faced locations take away from the co-star of this two-minute film: the soundtrack. Which kind of sounds like the theme song to a kind of bad 1980s TV movie? But in a good way.</p>

<p>Moore told us this was &quot;all filmed in the last month or so, across several days and evenings out and about. The Coney Island stuff was the day of the mermaid parade, although I didn&apos;t wind up getting any real mermaid footage.&quot; And for the camera nerds, Moore told us, &quot;This one isn&apos;t in HDR, but I did shoot it in RAW on a Canon 5D Mk. II using the now infamous Magic Lantern hack. It&apos;s pretty cool being able to walk around the city with a 5-year old camera that won&apos;t even raise an eye.&quot;</p>
