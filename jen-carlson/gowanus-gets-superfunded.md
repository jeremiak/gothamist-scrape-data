An employee for the agency told them, &#x201C;If you asked me to put money on it, I think they will announce on Thursday.&quot; However, the EPA is set to make an announcement to the press <em>today</em> at 10 a.m. Once the call is officially made, expect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123224137/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/14/gowanus_goin-ons.php">the Toll Brothers</a> to toss aside any development plans they had for the area (the Superfund process takes 10-12 years), and for the mayor to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123224137/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/superfund.php">have a big sad</a>. A public meeting will be held this Thursday at 7 p.m. at PS 58 in Brooklyn.

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123224137/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/10/33_10_gk_gowanus_superfund_main.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> confirms the rumors; the Canal will be Superfunded. Judith Enck, the EPA&#x2019;s regional director, &quot;started her statement by declaring that taxpayers should rest easy that the feds went with a Superfund designation, which sets into motion a process of getting restitution from responsible polluters.&quot; She also likened the situation to the Hudson River, which was declared a Superfund site decades ago, saying, &#x201C;Back then, no one would have lived on the banks of the Hudson. But we made a massive commitment and now people flock to recreate and live on the shoreline.&quot; Even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123224137/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/09/bald_eagle.php">bald eagles</a>!</p>
