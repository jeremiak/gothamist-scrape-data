<p>Harlem&apos;s legendary Lenox Lounge will be closing at the start of 2013, according to various reports, which note that the era will officially end on New Year&apos;s Eve&#x2014;that&apos;s about 73 years after it first opened its doors as a speakeasy in 1939.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015035/http://www.blackenterprise.com/small-business/lenox-lounge-closing-harlem/">Black Enterprise</a>, owner Alvin Reed&#x2014;who purchased the Lounge in 1988 and suffered a $10,000 rent increase earlier this year&#x2014;says, &#x201C;I wanted to make a difference in Harlem, and I think my ownership of the Lenox Lounge helped me achieve that goal. I have to be out by [December 31st].  Anything that I leave behind will become the property of landlord or the new owner.&#x201D; Except the name, which Reed has trademarked&#x2014;though he says: &#x201C;If they want to use &apos;Lenox Lounge,&apos; they will have to negotiate with me. I brought it back and I want to see it stay there. I want to keep the legacy alive. I am Lenox Lounge, and I will be Lenox Lounge for quite some time. And if they want Lenox Lounge, they want me.&#x201D;</p>

<p>So is there any hope? Reed has said they could survive if they were to &quot;partner with someone from out of the community.&quot; Like maybe Robert DeNiro? Currently Nobu&apos;s Richard Notar is set to take over the Lenox Avenue space, and according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015035/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2012/12/lenox-lounge.html">to VanishingNY</a>, &quot;Notar is also a business partner of DeNiro. <strong>A tipster tells us that DeNiro has &apos;stepped in to save&apos; the Lenox Lounge: &apos;A very prominent jazz musician friend just played there Sunday night and told me straight from the owner&apos;s mouth.&apos;&quot;</strong> Which might mean that the name and the neon sign will stay.&quot; Stay tuned...</p>
