<span class="photo_caption">Why aren&apos;t there any video montage tributes to the Cosby sweater on YouTube?</span></p>

<p>Today Bill Cosby, or whoever is in charge of Bill Cosby&apos;s Internet Presence, Tweeted: &quot;Over the years, I have worn many sweaters. Tell me which is your favorite.&quot; Over on his website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920232235/http://billcosby.com/polls">a poll has been set up</a> where there are 24 photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920232235/http://gothamist.com/tags/thecosbyshow">Cliff Huxtable</a> donning different sweaters... many of which are shockingly bland. The top contender right now is this colorblocked knit:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cosbysweater1212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920232235im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cosbysweater1212.jpeg" width="640" height="457" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>This is just Round 1, and eventually only one sweater will be declared the Most Cosby-est Sweater Of Them All. We only wish that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920232235/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crnPfls0fHw">Theo&apos;s &#x201C;Gordon Gartrell&#x201D; shirt</a> could somehow also qualify.</p>
