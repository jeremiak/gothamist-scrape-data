<p>Yesterday morning a reader spotted this turkey in Battery Park, and told us &quot;no one else seemed to notice.&quot; Everyone is probably just used to seeing the turkey around though: it&apos;s Zelda! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003355/http://gothamist.com/2004/04/12/downtown_is_turkey_town.php">last we heard</a> she had wandered onto the West Side Highway, where cars skidded to avoid her in 2004; then she was spotted again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003355/http://curbed.com/archives/2006/10/10/battery_park_turkey_still_alive_and_well.php">in 2006</a>. </p>

<p>Zelda is named after F. Scott&apos;s wife Zelda Fitzgerald, because during one of Mrs. F&apos;s many nervous breakdowns she went missing and was discovered in Battery Park. Zelda the turkey has been in the park since 2003, and it&apos;s &quot;presumed that she entered Manhattan&apos;s north end from the Bronx and then journeyed south (downtown), as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003355/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/23/nyregion/23TURK.html">during spring 2003</a> there were several turkey sightings in Manhattan at points progressively further south, all prior to Zelda&apos;s taking up residence in the park.&quot; More photos of the bird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003355/http://jschumacher.typepad.com/joe/2004/11/happy_thanksgiv.html">here</a>; let&apos;s hope she makes it through another Thanksgiving!</p>
