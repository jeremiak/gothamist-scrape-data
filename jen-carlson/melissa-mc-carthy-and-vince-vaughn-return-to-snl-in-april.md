<p>It has been <em>fifteen years</em> since Vince Vaughn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130315001404/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0694765/">first hosted</a> <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, but the actor will return to Studio 8H next month. He&apos;ll be hosting the show on April 13th (with musical guest Miguel), in support of his new movie <em>The Internship</em>&#x2014;a cameo from his co-star Owen Wilson would be <em>so money</em>. (Sorry. It&apos;s the most recent Vince Vaughn reference we have on file.)</p>

<p>One week earlier, on April 6th, Melissa McCarthy (and musical guest Phoenix) will return to the studio. The actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130315001404/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/02/videos_snl_tackles_hpv_vaccines_for.php">first hosted in 2011</a>, scoring rave reviews and big ratings. McCarthy&apos;s upcoming summer flick is a buddy-cop comedy she&apos;ll star in alongside Sandra Bullock, called <em>The Heat</em>.</p>
