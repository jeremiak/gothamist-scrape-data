<p>The firefighters usually get all the glory when it comes to shaking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509215733/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/19/firefighter_auction.php">their &quot;tails&quot;</a> for charity, but now there are some new (furrier) faces: the firehouse&apos;s cute canines (most of which are strays the firefighters have adopted). A charity calendar is coming out this fall and will be the first ever to honor the pups&#x2014;and amongst the 12 will be 3 city canines. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509215733/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/the_woof_is_on_fire_fsc8CwWnKBQN4LsM218rgI">The NY Post</a> is hosting the contest to narrow down the 12 to the final 3, so you can vote over there&#x2014;we&apos;re going with Ladder 122&apos;s Nikita, because who can resist a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509215733/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/fdny_firehouse_dogs_FVrK6jVLy8uTGGqs656FmI?photo_num=6">this photo</a>?</p>

<p>Other dogs will hail from New Jersey, upstate and Connecticut... but we think they should all be from the big city.</p>
