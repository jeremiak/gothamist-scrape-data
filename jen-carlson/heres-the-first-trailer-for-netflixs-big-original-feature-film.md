title: Here's The First Trailer For Netflix's Big Original Feature Film
---

	
										<p>Netflix has just released the first trailer for their big original movie, <em>The Discovery</em>, starring Jason Segel, Rooney Mara, Robert Redford, Jesse Plemons, and Riley Keough. The feature will screen at Sundance this month, and hit the streaming network on March 31st. And there&apos;s nothing like an early 1960s pop song playing over gloomy scenes before coming to a screeching, distorted halt to tell you that something ain&apos;t right. </p>

<p>The movie is about Dr. Thomas Harbor (played by Robert Redford), and his &quot;scientific breakthrough that shocked the world... thrown our lives off balance and challenged everything we know about life and death.&quot; McDowell has presumably discovered that the afterlife is for real, and now it&apos;s the #1 destination for humans. </p>

<p>From Netflix&apos;s release: &quot;It&apos;s a love story set in a world where the afterlife has been scientifically proven, and as a result millions of people start taking their own lives to get there.&quot; That&apos;s some pretty dark stuff (with tones of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120150506/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/18/netflix_the_oa_theories.php"><em>The OA</em></a>), and perfect material for <em>The One I Love</em>&apos;s director Charlie McDowell to tackle.</p>
