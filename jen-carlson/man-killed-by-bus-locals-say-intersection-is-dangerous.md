He was rushed to Roosevelt hospital but was pronounced dead by 9:11 a.m.</p>

<p>A witness told the paper, &quot;The front of the bus hit him, and his legs went under the wheel.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142221/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/108462/mta-bus-hits--kills-woman-on-west-side/">NY1</a> (which says the victim was a woman) notes that those familiar with the area regard it as a very dangerous intersection. One local told them, &quot;<strong>That particular corner always has some accidents. All the cars travel very fast and there&apos;s too many buses using 53rd Street and they don&apos;t even look for pedestrians. I got hit about two months ago</strong>, and last month one lady got hit.&quot;</p>
