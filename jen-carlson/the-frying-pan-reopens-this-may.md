<p>The Frying Pan, the party boat known for its rusty charm in a sea of slick Chelsea nightclubs, hasn&apos;t invited anyone to come aboard in quite some time. Last year it moved from Pier 63, its home for a decade, to Pier 66...but never reopened due to lack of permits.</p>

<p>While at Pier 63, the complex the boat was a part of included a bar, dance club, restaurant and venue (with bands even playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150139/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenc/27033227">in the belly of the boat</a>), and stayed open way past your bedtime. Needless to say, the unique setting has been missed, but the good news is that the boat and Lackawanna barge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150139/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/on-the-good-ship-frying-pan-a-spirited-return-is-planned/">are coming back</a> (for real this time). Reopening at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150139/http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/parkmap/NchelseaArea.htm">Pier 66a</a>, it will have an earlier closing time, 1 a.m., to coincide with Hudson River Park&apos;s curfew. So while you can expect to romp around the decks come this May, it&apos;ll have to be at a respectable hour. </p>

<p>Last year John Krevey, who runs the complex, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150139/http://chelseanow.com/cn_32/fryingpan.html">ChelseaNow</a> that &#x201C;the bar and caf&#xE9; will be maintained, but the nightlife activities are terminated. No longer will we have turntables on the Hudson, because we will have an early closing.&#x201D; So get an early start, and prepare ye sea legs!</p>
