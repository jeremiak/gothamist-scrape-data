<p>This morning Dominique Ansel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/357880309498404864/photo/1">Tweeted</a> this gorgeous photo of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">Cronut</a> being held up to the damp light inside of MoMA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://gothamist.com/tags/rainroom">Rain Room</a>. And now the world finally has a replacement image for Scrooge McDuck diving into a pile of gold coins.</p>

<p>If your average New Yorker had tried to create this magical moment without a serious connection to both the pastry chef and the museum, it would have meant waiting on line for approximately 12 hours&#x2014;4 for the Cronut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/waiting_on_line_for_momas_rain_room.php">8 for the Rain Room</a>. But the chef didn&apos;t have to wait for either, he told us this afternoon: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The MOMA has been supportive of the bakery since B.C. (Before Cronut). Last year we did a nice event here and I was fortunate to have met some friends then. They were kind enough to invite me to a private after-hours viewing event of the Rain Room, and I thought it&apos;d only be appropriate to thank them with a Cronut. 

<p>It wasn&apos;t until we were standing there in the Rain Room holding the Cronut box and chatting about how early the lines for both are that I realized the two items are now standing face-to-face. Decided to capture the moment. It&apos;s amazing the power they both hold. Then I did a few dramatic silhouette poses of my own, as well... sans Cronut.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Now all we need is for Jeff Koons to create a Cronut sculpture for the museum, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/17/tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_at_moma_r.php">or Tilda</a> to eat one in her glass box, Tom Otterness to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/15/otterness.php">shoot</a> a cronut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/jay-zs_artful_mockery_of_the_art_wo.php">or Jay-Z</a> to toss them at patrons while dancing with Marina Abramovi&#x107; during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://gothamist.com/tags/sharknado">#Sharknado</a> and we can all take the rest of the summer off.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE ABOUT CRONUTS IN THE RAIN ROOM:</strong> Dominique Ansel wasn&apos;t the first man to bring a Cronut in the Rain Room... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134705/http://instagram.com/p/blv3MuHkPM">this dude</a> did it <em>last week</em>. And Andy Warhol probably did it in the &apos;60s.</p>
