<span class="photo_caption">&quot;Hi, I&apos;m Jessi, and my favorite color is Rainbow.&quot;</span></p>

<p>Did you know you can fund your next birthday party <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123103/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1211044888/worlds-largest-rainbow-parade?ref=live">on Kickstarter</a>? One 33-year-old lass has already reached her goal of $1,500 for her party, and doesn&apos;t it sound just <em>adorable</em>?:</p>

<blockquote>Hi, I&apos;m Jessi, and my favorite color is Rainbow. Last year on my birthday, I had a parade to celebrate my love of rainbows, and it was one of the most amazing feelings of my life. Since then, I&apos;ve been trying to recreate that feeling for others by hosting parades around the country. IT&apos;S MY BIRTHDAY AGAIN, and I was thinking&#x2026; We should have the BIGGEST, MOST COLORFUL PARADE YET!</blockquote> 

<p>Somewhere Zooey Deschanel is wondering why she didn&apos;t think of this. Anyway, if you want to contribute to this important cause, the cash will be going to &quot;Parade essentials, like hiring an incredible 20-piece marching band, balloons, streamers, bubbles, etc.&quot; We would but unfortunately we already donated all of our expendable income to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123103/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/latest_kickstarter_for_grilled_chee.php">Grilled Cheesus</a>.</p>

<p>Sorry for being jaded but our Kickstarter aimed at allowing us to sit alone on a barstool in a dive bar and just be left alone with our whiskey <em>never got funded</em>.
