</div></div>					<p>Dreading your commute home? These old photos from the blizzard of 1888 should make you feel slightly better &#x2014;&#xA0;after all, they include an illustration of NYPD officers rubbing snow on the frozen ears of passerby. Yikes! </p>

<p>The historic storm brought us around 25 inches of snow, 40 mph winds, killed 200 people, racked up $25 million in fire damages alone, and caused severe flooding (especially in Brooklyn). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919054150/http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/1888-blizzard.html">The NY Times</a> reported on it at the time, noting that wardrobe was no help to pedestrians; &quot;Never, perhaps, in the history of petticoats was the imbecility of their designer better illustrated. &apos;To get here I had to take my skirts up and clamber through the snowdrifts. With my dress down I could not move half a block,&apos; said a wash-woman when she came to the house of the reporter who writes this.&quot; Think about <em>that</em> the next time you put on your high-tech snow gear.</p>
