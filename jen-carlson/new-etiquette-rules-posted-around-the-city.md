<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153709/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/texting_zombies_youre_on_watch.php">latest etiquette signs</a> from artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153709/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/jayshells">Jayshells</a> have officially made their way to the streets of New York, currently instructing passerby on Bleecker Street, Astor Place, and in Times Square on how to be good citizens. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153709/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2011/09/jay-shells-bombs.html">The signs</a> say: &quot;Pay Attention While Walking (Your Facebook Status Update Can Wait),&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t Flick Your Butts on the Ground,&quot; &quot;Pull Up Your Pants&quot; and &quot;Clean Up After Your Horse&quot; (which is specifically directed at the NYPD). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153709/http://www.jayshells.com/">Jay</a> tells us that he&apos;ll be putting the signs up &quot;in many other places&quot; tonight and Sunday, and that Jason &quot;two on 10th and 42nd already got snatched.&quot;</p>

<p>What other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153709/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/10/its_national_etiquette_week_be_nice.php">http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette</a>&quot;&gt;etiquette signs do we need? These <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153709/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/lets_bring_back_these_anti-spitting.php">anti-spitting posters</a> sure were charming.</p>
