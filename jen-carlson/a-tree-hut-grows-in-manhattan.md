<p>Starting next week artist Tadashi Kawamata will make the above rendering a reality in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113718/https://www.madisonsquarepark.org/Programs/MadSqArt.aspx">Madison Square Park</a>. His &quot;tree huts&quot; represent his &quot;interest in the architecture of shelter and of the insertion of private objects into public spaces as a method of renegotiating the meaning of both.&quot; But how long do you think it will take until someone tries to climb into or inhabit one? Stay tuned for more images as the huts are built next week.
