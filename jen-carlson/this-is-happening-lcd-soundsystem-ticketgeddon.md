<p>Last week LCD Soundsystem announced their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065111/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/05/lcd_soundsytem_announce_last_show_e.php">last show <em>ever</em></a>, which will take place at Madison Square Garden on April 2nd. Tickets went on sale today, and as expected... it&apos;s an aggravating time for fans. A reader told us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I just wanted to drop you a note and let you know that there&apos;s a mini-revolt trending on Twitter and Facebook over this LCD Soundsystem ticketing process. A group of friends and I all tried on both the pre-sale date and today to buy tickets at the precise moment they went on sale, and they were immediately sold out. There&apos;s no way MSG sells the entire show out like that instantly, but, according to one estimate I read, StubHub has a high percentage of tickets available. Some of them are now on sale at StubHub for thousands. I would love to see some legislative action taken against these bottom-feeders.&quot;</blockquote> 

<p>Currently StubHub has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065111/http://www.stubhub.com/lcd-soundsystem-tickets/lcd-soundsystem-new-york-4-2-2011-1051789/">nearly 1,000 tickets</a> for sale&#x2014;including a set of 17 for $11,000, and a set of 3 for $10,000. Before you pull the trigger and get ripped off, even James Murphy says, &quot;No matter what we do, it is not worth that kind of money to see us!&quot; Seriously, it&apos;s not like they&apos;re playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065111/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-7DDHmWWqk">in your house (your house)</a>. </p>

<p>Murphy also called the website &quot;barely legal,&quot; told the owners to &quot;eat shit,&quot; and added that no fan would price tickets that high (follow along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065111/http://twitter.com/#!/lcdsoundsystem">on Twitter</a>). Currently, StubHub isn&apos;t responding to his Tweets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065111/http://twitter.com/#!/StubHub/status/36121006049337344">they just wanna know</a> if there are any Islanders or Penguins fans out there.</p>

<p>Until this mess gets straightened out, just stay calm. We just came back from the future and, spoiler alert: this isn&apos;t <em>really</em> their last show ever.</p>
