<p>At a recent pep rally for the Waverly High School football team&#x2014;located in Waverly, New York, just on the border of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144904/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090329/"><em>Witness</em></a> country&#x2014;a bunch of students performed a skit in blackface depicting Chris Brown beating Rihanna. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144904/http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-858297">According to a CNN citizen journalist iReport</a>, <em>first of all</em>, Waverly won 70-21 (Go Wolverines?), and secondly, the writer (Waverly alum Matt Dishler) goes on to note that the skit was approved by school administrators. However, Waverly Superintendent Joseph Yelich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144904/http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121015/NEWS01/310150070/Waverly-pep-rally-skit-called-racist-students-wore-blackface-portrayed-domestic-violence?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE">has since claimed</a> he was not aware of it prior to the rally. In that initial iReport, Dishler paints this picture:</p><blockquote>&quot;Three white students performed a skit in black face, depicting Chris Brown and Rhianna most notably. <strong>In this skit they would display acts of domestic violence as satire</strong> to an audience that included not only students but parents, faculty, and various members of the media and community leaders. None of them stopped the skit.&quot;</blockquote>While the school&apos;s officials have been fielding complaints (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144904/http://www.wetmtv.com/news/local/story/School-Officials-Meet-Tuesday-on-Controversial/WNjb7XrvbU-R4PPM1EMebg.cspx">will meet today</a> to discuss the incident), over on Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144904/http://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/students-alumni-defend-pep-rallys-chris-brown-ri">students are defending the skit</a>... and at least one Chris Brown apologist says the performer would &quot;whoop some ass&quot; if he knew about this.<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Waverly is messed up... Hope Chris Brown don&apos;t show up.
