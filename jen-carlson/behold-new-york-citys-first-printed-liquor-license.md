<p>Yesterday we visited with Michael Inman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101085428/http://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/brooke-russell-astor-reading-room/rare-books-division">at the New York Public Library</a>, to see what sort of treasures he holds behind locked doors in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101085428/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/10/rare_books_collection.php#photo-1">the Rare Book Division</a>. We&apos;ll have more to share from the visit, and the collection, in the near future, but here&apos;s one neat thing that caught our eye. First thing you&apos;ll notice is: it&apos;s <em>not</em> a book&#x2014;they actually hold a lot of other, non-bound materials in the collection. </p>

<p>What you&apos;re looking at here is the first ever printed liquor license (n&#xE9;e licenfe!) for the City of New York. It&apos;s unclear what specific establishments from the time received one of these, and this one remains blank&#x2014;Inman tells us:</p><blockquote>&quot;As the license form was issued under the authority of Queen Anne, its use wouldn&apos;t predate the beginning of her reign in 1702.  It is possible that hand-written licenses were issued prior to this date, but I can&apos;t confirm that offhand.  What I am fairly certain of is that this is the earliest printed license form, with &apos;printed&apos; being the operative term, thus making it the first example of its kind.&quot;</blockquote>Do you think everyone abided by the rules, and kept out any &quot;unlawful Games or Meetings&quot;?<p></p>
