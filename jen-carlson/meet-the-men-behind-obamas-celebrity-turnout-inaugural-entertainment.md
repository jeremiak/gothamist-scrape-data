<p><em>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807082117/http://dcist.com/tags/inauguration">President Obama&apos;s Inauguration</a> coming up, big names will be flocking to Washington D.C., with performances and celebratory soirees surrounding the swearing in. And behind every A-lister, every Inaugural entertainer and event, stand Eric Ortner and Bruce Roberts. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Previously Ortner and Roberts&#x2014;the team at the core of Obama&apos;s Entertainment Advisory Council&#x2014;helped the campaign in the months, weeks, and days leading up to the election, playing a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807082117/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/obama-bruce-springsteen-jay-z-390100">key role in mobilizing voters</a>&quot; for the President. Whenever you see a famous face turn up at a rally in Midwest, or a pop star perform at one in Nevada, chances are that Ortner and Roberts had something to do with it. Ahead of the busy weekend, we asked Ortner to tell us about how and why he does what he does.</em> </p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved with Obama&apos;s Entertainment Advisory Council? Ortner:</strong> This was during the late summer of &apos;11. The success of the President&#x2019;s policies had yet to be fully visible. (Saving the American Auto Industry from collapse, the affordable care act/Obama Care hadn&apos;t been implemented. DADT was still the policy of the military, and the shoots of green created by the Stimulus/Reinvestment &amp; Recovery Act were just becoming noticed.)  At that point the campaign was primarily raising money at events with The President, Vice President, or the First Lady in the room.  It was not a sustainable model considering the GOP super-PAC and dark money that we knew we&#x2019;d be fighting against.  There was an underutilized opportunity to engage the creative community and build events that didn&#x2019;t require the attendance of the principals.</p>

<p>After being recruited by California co-chair John Emerson, Ambassador Matthew Barzun, and Jennifer Rosenbaum, and Joe Reinstein, I called on my friend and colleague Bruce Roberts to be partners in leading a group that would enlist artists to join the campaign as surrogates for The President&apos;s policies, voter registration drives, and early voting pushes.  In partnership, Bruce and I set out to open our Rolodexes for The President.  </p>

<p>The council didn&#x2019;t have a name yet.  It started with us meeting with managers, agents and publicists to communicate the policies, and better understand the goals and comfort levels of the artists.  It was organizing in the most grass-roots sense&#x2026; literally pounding the pavement in Hollywood. The interest and support levels from our outreach were so strong that the campaign held a small gathering in October &apos;11 where the President could engage the gate-keepers and industry leaders to define his vision directly to them.  This was my first campaign event, and I was asked to make the opening remarks. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll ever feel as queasy as I did having to address my mega-peers and introduce our President.  </p>

<p><strong>Roberts:</strong> We had such passion about joining up and calling anyone we could, that&apos;s what gave us the strength.  We believed in what we were doing and we believed in the importance in reelecting our President. </p>

<p>Joe Reinstein and Jennifer Rosenbaum ran the surrogates department and started building plans for the surrogates.   These plans were next level smart.  Always geared towards delivering specific metrics.  Whether it was money raised, voters registered, earned media, or social messaging, nothing was done or asked for without a deliverable in mind.  There were so many power players in the business who wanted to help that we then created the council allowed the campaign to fully harness the equity of the artists and those who knew them best.<br>

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="ortnerhamm0113.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807082117im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ortnerhamm0113.jpeg" width="350" height="334"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Ortner and Jon Hamm at the DNC last September (Getty)</i></div> <strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the entertainment that was planned around re-election time&#x2014;do people approach you to be involved, vice versa, both? Ortner:</strong> Both, once we came into the main season, and the creative community saw the clear choice of two different visions for America, the calls came flooding in.  Thankfully, together with Joe Reinstein and Jennifer Rosenbaum we had many months of relationship building with artists and their camps.  <p></p>

<p><strong>How are entertainers paired up with different events and locations?</strong> The campaign had the smartest analytics I&#x2019;ve ever seen.  Requests for targeting specific constituency groups, geographic and demographics  were quite specific. They could tell us who we needed to reach, how many in each county, by what days. It was then a mix of tone judgment, programming gut, and maximizing the artist&#x2019;s equity to reach our goals. For example, in Nevada, we needed a strong turnout for early voting. The goal was to invigorate a community that had been saturated with stump speeches and political ads, as well as to drive in others from out of state to knock on doors. Katy Perry delivered that. With 17,000+ people there and many more who wanted to come, we captured attendee data for SMS pushes, follow-up calls and in person engagement for over 25,000 people. The opportunity to hear the President and enjoy a  day of entertainment with a mega-artist like Katy caused thousands to drive in from California. Many stayed and knocked on doors. We won Nevada by about 67,000 votes. These events mattered. </p>

<p>Another great example was The Red Hot Chili Peppers concert with a speech by the campaign manager, Jim Messina, in tandem to their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame performance in Cleveland. Free tickets were offered to volunteers who signed up for phone bank shifts. They sold out in a few hours&#x2026;. And even beyond that they filled 16,000 phone bank shifts in Ohio. Adding entertainment value and artistic context made a difference.</p>

<p><strong>Has the President ever showed particular enthusiasm towards a certain musician being involved?</strong> The President&#x2019;s iPod playlist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807082117/http://www.billboard.com/news/obama-s-ipod-from-jay-z-to-john-coltrane-1007993752.story#/news/obama-s-ipod-from-jay-z-to-john-coltrane-1007993752.story">is broad</a>. You try to pick a favorite from Jay-Z to Coltrane. Good luck!  </p>

<p><strong>When did you start planning Inaugural entertainment, and what was the process in picking that talent?</strong> The Presidential Inaugural Committee or &#x201C;PIC&#x201D; as we call it was formed just after the election night hangover had subsided and a nap. The joint congressional committee worked with The White House to select talent for the swearing in ceremony.  The Inaugural committee and Surrogates team (PIC) planned all the events&#x2026;. A big puzzle. The Inaugural Balls, Days of Service, side events&#x2026; it&#x2019;s a lot, and the process was dynamic. To say &#x201D;I planned&#x201D; is a vast overstatement. I was glad to be able to help the huge team we had in DC making this all come together.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="perryobama0113.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807082117im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/perryobama0113.jpeg" width="275" height="387"> <br> <i style=" width:275px; ;display:block"> Katy Perry performed at a campaign rally for Obama in Nevada last October. (Getty)</i></div> <strong>Does someone have to clear Katy Perry&apos;s outfits?</strong> Katy was the creative force behind her brilliant designs. It was an easy partnership. The White House/Campaign advance teams worked seamlessly with me and Katy&#x2019;s team well to strike the balance of allowing her to express herself creatively while suggesting ways to maintain the decorum and protocol required when representing the office of the Presidency. I can&#x2019;t think of any issues along the way&#x2026; She was a joy to work with.<p></p>

<p><strong>Is there anyone you wanted to get for the Inauguration that didn&apos;t work out?</strong> The talent bill is incredible, and Surrogates team at PIC (led by Joe Reinstein) has programmed an incredible 4 days of events, service, and celebration. I know there were many artists who were disappointed that their tour schedules and obligations conflicted with their dates. Virtually all of the artists who supported The President during the campaign wanted to be here for this culminating moment. But, they have day jobs. To name a few, the Foo&apos;s played the DNC and Dave Grohl was a key surrogate, they are in Sundance for their film. Gaga is on tour playing Los Angeles.  And the list of those with production and touring schedules is quite long. But, it&#x2019;s a long week, and you never know what surprises are in store.</p>

<p><strong>Was the last campaign trip to Ohio with Jay-Z and Bruce crazy? Do you have any good, share-able anecdotes from this, or other trips?</strong> A million great stories along the way&#x2026;. This one&#x2019;s one of my favorites: Stevie Wonder composed a new song called &#x201C;Forward!&#x201D; (our campaign slogan) for our &#x201C;30 Days to Victory&#x201D; Concert at Nokia in LA.  When he presented his song, a staff speech writer had a suggestion and sent notes back with a concern that the wording of the chorus didn&#x2019;t capture the message.  The event producer, Ken Ehrlich (Producer of the Grammys) and I were jaw dropped&#x2026;. Who would ever have the moxie to mess with the writings of the maestro?  We agreed to send the notes to Stevie and Ken jokingly asked if there was a re-write suggested for &#x201C;You Are the Sunshine of My Life.&quot;    Sure enough, Stevie not only took the note, but rewrote the chorus of the song to incorporate the essence of the campaign message.</p>

<p>So this kid went from grinding away in a campaign boiler room to helping work through the chorus of a musical legend.  Come to think of it, we still owe that  guy a copy of the song sheet.  Only on a campaign!</p>

<p><strong>Why is it important for politicians to use entertainers to reach the public?</strong> A few reasons: <strong>1. Earned media</strong>. Artists build an intimacy with their fans. They not only validate, they also help communicate. When someone watches a political ad, they tend to shut down&#x2026;. Some on the margins respond.  When an artist or entertainer communicates with their fans, the audience is open to hearing the context behind an idea. Surrogates also helped reach women, the youth and many constituency groups that are underserved in the traditional media. The messaging reach became horizontal and amplified into all forms of media (radio, online, entertainment shows, magazines, etc).</p>

<p><strong>2. Numbers game</strong>.  OFA&#x2019;s model was largely based on voter and constituent contact.  Meet people&#x2014;connect&#x2014;follow up.  Offering once in a lifetime entertainment experiences gave people the added incentive to travel further, stay longer, and engage stronger.   </p>

<p><strong>3. Excitement</strong>. It&#x2019;s pretty hard to not get pumped up to go and vote when the Boss (Bruce) plays before The Boss (Our President) speaks.</p>
