<p>Word of a trapped red-tailed hawk in the East Village spread today and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628185216/http://yojimbot.blogspot.com/2011/01/it-takes-east-village.html">Yojimbot at the Origin of Species</a> answered the call to help save it! He reports back that it &quot;was stuck in the building air-shaft since before the blizzard.&quot; He worked with Bobby Horvath, a concerned tenant, and the Super to get the hawk out, noting, &quot;we were able to shoo the bird to a 4th floor window ledge where Bobby snagged it! I was very relieved as it was kind of sketchy and either bird or human could&apos;ve been very easily hurt.&quot; </p>

<p>The bird made its internet debut on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628185216/http://evgrieve.com/2011/01/admiring-new-resident-on-east-third.html">EV Grieve</a> yesterday, where a tenant said it had been picking off pigeons in the airshaft. Not enough, however, as Yojimbot reports that the hawk was &quot;emaciated and tar stained&quot; and &quot;had torn off the tips of most of the primaries&quot; while trapped. But he&apos;s alive! Good job team.</p>
