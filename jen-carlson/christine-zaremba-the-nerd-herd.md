										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpzaP742AM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101822im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpzaP742AM.jpg" width="350" height="262" class="image-left"> </span><em>By now you&apos;ve heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101822/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/09/nerd_herd_gets_send-off.php">the Nerd Herd</a>, the team of four 12 to 14-year old St. Edmund&apos;s students who, this week, are headed from Brooklyn to the World Robotics Festival in Atlanta. With their motorized robot named Thingamajig, they won the championships here, and a spot alongside the Nation&apos;s best in Atlanta&#x2014;but first they needed to raise the necessary funds to get there. After getting some press, vacuum inventor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101822/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/27/british_vacuum_exec_bails_out_nerd.php">James Dyson</a> stepped in to give them the monetary push they needed, but so did New York, and they ended up with an excess of $11,000! </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>As the big festival begins today, wish Brooklyn&apos;s Nerd Herd luck (not that they need it)! This week they told us a little bit about the history of the Herd, their smarts, and what they like to do in New York when they aren&apos;t being geniuses. Their coach Christine Zaremba also told us what a little bit about what it&apos;s like to work with the team, and how the spotlight&apos;s been treating them.</em></p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s your reaction to the amount of press the Nerd Herd has gotten lately?</strong> <br>
<strong>Benjamin Kelk:</strong> I was very shocked about the amount of press covering us.<br>
<strong>Danny Alvarez:</strong> It&apos;s really incredible. I feel like 8.3 million people are depending on us to bring home the trophy. I never thought I would have my name in the paper for something I love to do!  It blows my mind that New Yorkers can be so generous in these difficult times. Thank you New York and Mr Dyson!<br>
<strong>Simon Shkreli:</strong> It was so hard to believe that a very small robotics team got a lot of publicity. After our first article in the Daily News, people from the tri-state area called not just to donate, but to tell stories about how they wish they had robotics and thatthere is finally some good news in the newspaper. We, as a team, are proud to be not just a herd of nerds who won the NYC Championship, but Brooklyn&apos;s Newest Rockstars!<br>
<strong>Gregory Chin:</strong> I am stuck in the middle of reverence and awe. I am extremely honored that the Daily News, the Tablet, Sing Tao( a Chinese newspaper), Fox 5 news, ABC news, News 12 Brooklyn, NY 1, and Sinovision(Chinese television) came to our school, St. Edmund&apos;s just to interview us. No words can explain how ecstatic I am. I would like to thank all these reputable newspapers and news channels.</p>
