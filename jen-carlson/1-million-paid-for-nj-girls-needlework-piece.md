										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:304px; "> <img alt="NEEDLEpoint0112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307170644im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/NEEDLEpoint0112.jpeg" width="304" height="359"> <br> <i>Antrim&apos;s piece</i></div> This is some real <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> stuff here. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307170644/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/schoolgirls-needlework-sampler-sells-for-1-07-million/?smid=tw-nytimesarts&amp;seid=auto">The NY Times</a> reports that a needlework sampler crafted by a New Jersey schoolgirl named Mary Antrim in 1807 has sold at auction for $1.07 million dollars. The piece sold <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307170644/http://www.sothebys.com/en/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2012/important-american-schoolgirl-embroideries-the-landmark-collection-of-betty-ring-n08832#/r=/en/ecat.fhtml.N08832.html+r.m=/en/ecat.lot.N08832.html/616/">at Sotheby&apos;s</a> in New York on Sunday, and features a farm scene on linen... it was estimated to go for a mere $120,000. So why did it go for so much more than that?<p></p>

<p>Dealer David Schorsch said the piece &#x201C;stood out in a unique way as a folk art statement.&quot; But still, even on the aforementioned TV show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307170644/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/200801A14.html">pieces like this</a> have only been appraised at $60,000 to $80,000. That piece was believed to have taken about a year to complete, and the appraiser said, &quot;This would have been, for your ancestor, the culmination of several years in a school specifically for the education of affluent young women. This started life as an enormous sheet of silk... Little, tiny needles, little, tiny silk threads, infinitesimal stitches. It took time, it took patience, it took discipline to do this.&quot;</p>

<p>The takeaway? Someone has that much money that they&apos;re spending over a million dollars on an old piece of needlework by some kid from Jersey.</p>
