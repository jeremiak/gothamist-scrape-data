	<p>Anyone knows that you can no longer declare your love for <em>just Brooklyn</em> unless you want to look like some fair-weather transplant&#x2014;you need to get all 2004 Neighborhoodies again and pick a specific neighborhood. Maybe the one you gentrified? Maybe one that some real estate company made up? Any neighborhood that is in Brooklyn and has gotten at least one New York Times trend piece mention, but hasn&apos;t yet crossed over into the luxury real estate section (but also one that <em>will</em>, eventually) suffices. It&apos;s a complex formula, but thankfully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522184050/http://gothamist.com/tags/UrbanOutfitters">Urban Outfitters</a> is here to help. They&apos;re offering up not one, but two pieces of clothing that will make you look really cool and <em>in the know</em> when it comes to the borough&apos;s hottest neighborhood: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522184050/http://gothamist.com/tags/bushwick">Bushwick</a>.</p>

<p>There&apos;s something for everyone&#x2014;for the sporty set, a $39 mesh jersey (this also comes in &quot;Harlem&quot; but c&apos;mon Harlem is the Williamsburg of Manhattan and you&apos;ll just look stupid):</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bushwickjersey0413.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522184050im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bushwickjersey0413.jpg" width="640" height="360" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>And for those who want to capture the essence of the young creative living in the neighborhood, there&apos;s this moody black &amp; white number:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bushwickdress0413.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522184050im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bushwickdress0413.jpg" width="640" height="388" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Either are going to look really great for that first trip to the hotly anticipated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522184050/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/bushwick_like_totally_needs_a_mall.php">Bushwick mall</a>.
