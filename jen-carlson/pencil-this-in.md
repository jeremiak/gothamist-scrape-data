<p><strong>LITERATI and GRAFFITI:</strong> Smith Dalek, Sasha Jenkins and Darin Rowland (one of the authors of the book &quot;Freight Train Graffiti&quot;) discuss the nature of the relationship between graffiti and art, and how a city fad broke out worldwide. A reception and book signing with the graffiti artists on hand will follow.</p>

<p><em>7 to 9pm // Chelsea Art Museum [556 West 26th St near 11th Ave] // Free</em></p>

<p><strong>ART:</strong> Witness a Gordian knot of artistic/intellectual conjecture as NYC&apos;s own Mr. End-of-Art, Arthur C. Danto, moderates a panel of artists in search for some answers to the pressing question, Does Contemporary American Art Reflect Contemporary Times? The five multi-generational American (and yes, contemporary) artists involved also have works currently on view in the museum&apos;s 181st Annual Exhibition. Expect enlightened profundity and impassioned debate ... or, maybe not. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142923/http://artsoldier.blogspot.com/"><em>Jason Laning</em></a></p>

<p><em>6:30 pm // The National Academy Museum, 2nd Floor [1083 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street] // $5 </em></p>

<p><strong>THEATER:</strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142923/http://tschreiber.com/index.htm">T. Schreiber Studio</a> is a well-known acting school that gives its top students chances throughout the year to perform alongside professionals. The studio&apos;s latest production, George F. Walker&apos;s Better Living (which follows what happens to a family when, ten years after the children and mother tried to murder him, the father returns) may not seem like an obvious choice of material, but the dark comedy and rampant dysfunction of the characters who are trying to navigate the difficulties of life together should afford plenty of opportunity for actors to stretch their wings and students and audiences alike to learn from Walker&apos;s great combination of wit and empathy in his writing. - <em>Mallory Jensen</em></p>

<p><em>T. Schreiber Studio [151 W. 26th St., 7th fl.] // Through June 24, Thurs.-Sat. 8pm, Sat.-Sun. 3pm // Tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142923/http://www.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/685">here</a> </em></p>

<p><strong>PARTY: </strong>We snagged this one from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142923/http://FreeNYC.net/">FreeNYC</a>, and can&apos;t seem to find any other info on it. It&apos;s a party called Neat Neat Neat and tonight will have a tribute to David Bowie, so it can&apos;t be that bad. Apparently it&apos;s also a monthly rock showcase with $3 PBR&apos;s (which actually seems like $1 too much for PBR). </p>

<p><em>10pm // Manitobas [99 Avenue B at 7th] // Free</em></p>
