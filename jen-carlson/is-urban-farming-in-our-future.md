title: Is Urban Farming in Our Future?
---

	
										<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165643/http://www.news.com/2300-11386_3-6181610-1.html">a farm floated into the city</a> on a barge and this coming summer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165643/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/02/19/more_insane_public_art_ps1s_urban_farm_in_lic.php">a farm will sprout</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165643/http://www.ps1.org/ps1_site/content/view/337/337/">PS1</a>, but will a sustainable urban farm ever take root in New York for good? </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165643/http://weburbanist.com/2008/03/30/5-urban-design-proposals-for-3d-city-farms-sustainable-ecological-and-agricultural-skyscrapers/">WebUrbanist</a> has the top 5 designs for a city farm (the first of which may be going vertical in Vegas soon). One design, the first of its kind, is a &quot;vertical farm project undertaken by Chris Jacobs in cooperation with the grandfather of skyscraper farm concepts: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165643/http://www.verticalfarm.com/">Dr. Dickson Despommier</a> of Columbia University.&quot; (Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165643/http://nymag.com/news/features/30020">NYMag</a> visited Despommier&apos;s ideas of transforming skyscrapers into crop farms.)</p>

<p>Which design would work for New York? Check out some renderings below -- and until our skyline gets a little more green, be sure to head to that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165643/http://www.archpaper.com/news/2008_0206a.htm">public farm in LIC</a> this summer!</p>
