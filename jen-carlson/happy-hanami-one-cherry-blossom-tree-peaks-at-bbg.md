But it&apos;s a new day, and now their map shows four trees at &quot;First Bloom&quot; and one at &quot;Peak Bloom&quot;!</p>

<p>Hanami, the Japanese cultural tradition of enjoying each moment of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412190746/http://www.bbg.org/discover/cherries/">cherry blossom season</a>, began on April 2nd and will run through May 1st (with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412190746/http://www.bbg.org/visit/event/sakura_matsuri_2011/">Cherry Blossom Festival</a> being that final weekend).</p>

<p>If you spot any cherry blossoms blooming around town, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412190746/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your pics or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr!</p>
