<p>Of the many wooden carousels that adorned Coney Island, this is the last remaining one -- and was purchased by the city for $1.8 million two years ago. When it was last operational, it stood near the old entrance to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407093547/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_Park%2C_Coney_Island">Luna Park</a>, surrounded by furniture shops. To get it restored there&apos;s another $2 million pricetag, even though it was still running when it was dismantled and put in storage in Brooklyn in January 2006.  </p>

<p>Once the 88-year old is back in tip-top shape, it may end up at Steeplechase Plaza, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407093547/http://gothamist.com/2005/09/15/city_presents_coney_island_redevelopment_plan.php">proposed public park</a> for Coney Island between the Boardwalk and KeySpan Park. Can a carousel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407093547/http://www.nydailynews.com/boroughs/brooklyn/2007/09/11/2007-09-11_keeping_the_wheel_of_history_turning.html">and the Wonder Wheel</a> survive amongst the Thor developments? It seems they&apos;ll at least have to co-exist. Dennis Vourderis, who as of now has no plans to sell the latter to the developer, says his father would have told him to make sure &quot;The Wheel keeps turning in Coney Island.&apos;&quot;</p>
