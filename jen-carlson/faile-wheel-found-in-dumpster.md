<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828111751/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/20/faile.php">first FAILE wheel</a> has been found! Someone posted a photo (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828111751/http://s658.photobucket.com/albums/uu303/ifoundfaile/">more here</a>) on the Brooklyn collective&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828111751/http://faileforum.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1459&amp;page=1">message board</a> stating they found it in a dumpster. Of course, this was followed up by asking the other posters how much it is worth and mentioning it may be landing on eBay soon. The thief seems to give himself away a few times, changing his story around and mentioning he would gladly issue a public apology if FAILE contacted him. Because, you know, people apologize for finding stuff all the time.</p>
