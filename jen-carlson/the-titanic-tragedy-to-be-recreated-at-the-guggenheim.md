										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="titanic0411gugg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152703im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/titanic0411gugg.jpg" width="365" height="219"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">You know someone is going to re-enact this.</span></i></div> On the 99th anniversary of its sinking, The Titanic will sink again... sort of. Art will imitate the real life event on April 14th, when artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster introduces a site-specific staged audience experience in the Guggenheim&apos;s rotunda, &quot;inspired by this historic event and wherein the audience plays a role.&quot; To accompany the visuals, Gavin Bryars&apos;s The Sinking of the Titanic will be at the core of the installation, performed by The Wordless Music Orchestra. There will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152703/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/education/adult-and-academic-programs/public-programs?option=com_calendar&amp;task=showevent&amp;mt=1302757200&amp;mh=+%40+8%3A40%26nbsp%3Bpm&amp;aid=3895">two boarding times</a>, 8:40 and 10:40 p.m.<p></p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152703/http://www.observer.com/2011/culture/titanic-date-night-disaster-drowning-performance-art-guggenheim">the Observer</a> reports, there will be recorded foghorns, a lifeboat suspended from the skylight, and stewards rushing passengers on to one of three &quot;decks.&quot; First class guests (higher paying ticket holders) will be placed higher up, and have the best chances of &quot;surviving&quot; the evening. </p>

<p>Charles Fabius, the show&apos;s producer, told the site that the evening &quot;is not a gimmick. Most projects [about the Titanic] have been sensational&#x2014;the movie, traveling exhibitions&#x2014;but this is really a very poetic project. It&apos;s very subtle.&quot; They also note that Benjamin Guggenheim (brother of Solomon) lost his life drowning after the crash. <em>But still..?</em></p>
