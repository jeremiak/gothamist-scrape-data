</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s something about old yearbook photos of strangers that always transports you to an almost unreal time and place. Particularly photos from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424124440/http://gothamist.com/tags/1980s">the 1980s</a>&#x2014;that wonderful decade where everyone decided to focus on their hair, and how high it could go, no matter what chemicals were needed to attain such heights. Even for those living in the &apos;80s, who partook in this grand experiment in gravity-defying locks, might ask: was this real? Oh, but it was&#x2014;real and spectacular.</p>

<p>Click through for a look at some of the looks from the 1988 Fort Hamilton High School yearbook, which also features some fly <em>wings</em>. It&apos;s just a shame these weren&apos;t full length shots.
