<p>A little over a year ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310033835/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/why_arent_there_any_real_shuffleboa.php">we wondered why</a> there was no shuffleboard club in New York City? We&apos;ve got bowling, we&apos;ve got bocce, we&apos;ve got It All! But we don&apos;t have a shuffleboard club, despite this city being filled with ghosts of former shuffleboard courts. Then, magically, two people appeared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310033835/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/shuffleboard.php">and created a shuffleboard club</a>: The Royal Palms.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not open yet, but Our Heroes Ashley and Jonathan are busy building out their massive 17,000 square-foot space in Gowanus. And it&apos;s going to look amazing. And it&apos;s so large that they say food trucks will be driving into it to serve you from indoors. What a world! Here&apos;s some more info on the space, and we&apos;re told they plan on opening this Fall/Winter. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310033835/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/948151585/bring-shuffleboard-back-to-brooklyn-on-its-100th-a">Help make it happen people</a>!</p>
