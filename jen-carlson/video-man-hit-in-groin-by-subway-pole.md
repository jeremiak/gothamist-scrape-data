title: Video: Man Hit In Groin By Subway Pole
---

	
										<p>In a world of so many violent subway fights caught on camera phones and uploaded to YouTube, this one of a subway prank gone <strike>bad</strike> hilarious is sort of refreshing! Sure, it&apos;s sort of derivative of the below Hans Moleman production, but we really like the element of surprise, and the use of public transit. Plus, the youthful protagonist takes it all in stride, making it less depressing, and making this an instant classic in the &quot;hit in groin&quot; genre.</p>
