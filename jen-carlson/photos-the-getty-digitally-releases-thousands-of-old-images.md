</div></div>					<p>Yesterday the Getty took one giant step into the digital era by sharing some of its collection online through an Open Content Program. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329103128/http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/open-content-an-idea-whose-time-has-come/#sthash.51atimAn.dpuf">In their announcement</a>, they wrote: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The initial focus of the Open Content Program is to make available all images of public domain artworks in the Getty&#x2019;s collections. Today we&#x2019;ve taken a first step toward this goal by making roughly 4,600 high-resolution images of the Museum&#x2019;s collection free to use, modify, and publish for any purpose. These are high-resolution, reproduction-quality images with embedded metadata, some over 100 megabytes in size.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>So, that&apos;s pretty spectacular. And there are plenty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329103128/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">old images of New York</a> in their offering&#x2014;click through for some sweet photos of our city, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329103128/http://search.getty.edu/gateway/landing">do some browsing here</a>.</p>
