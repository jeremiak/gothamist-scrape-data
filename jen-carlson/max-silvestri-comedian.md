He recently told us all about most of this.</em></p>

<p><strong>What does 2009 have in store for Big Terrific?</strong> Gabe Liedman, Jenny Slate and I plan to keep putting on a fun and friendly show and inviting the funniest people we know to help us. But there will be a few changes. We&apos;re going to make the whole thing a little more professional, by doing stuff like testing the microphones *before* the show starts and trying to wear clean sweatpants. Also, we&apos;ll have some new drink specials: I cooked up something called the Eggy Mary, which is egg nog, super spicy Bloody Mary mix, and white wine. I say &quot;cooked up&quot; because it&apos;s served piping hot in a champagne flute. It&apos;ll cost one hundred dollars and even if we only sell 20, 30 a night, we&apos;ll be rich really soon. </p>

<p><strong>How did you and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160058/http://videogum.com/">Gabe</a> get involved with Details?</strong> They sent us an email, and they included lots of compliments in that email. Pro tip for other men&apos;s glossies looking to employ Gabe Delahaye &amp; me: we love compliments. Also, give us walking around money. And a retainer. Are those things? Clearly I graduated magna cum stupid from Showbusiness University.</p>

<p><strong>You have a couple of Gabe&apos;s in your life, which one is your favorite?</strong> Gabriel Garcia Marquez and I just sold a Dark Knight parody video to CollegeHumor.com called Why So Magical Realist? I can&apos;t wait to get started on that never.</p>

<p><strong>Which New Yorker would you say has the most man style?</strong> My old roommate Jesse Finkelstein, who runs a design company called JF and Son. The nicest clothes I own are things he was about to throw out for being too stupid. I am blatantly plugging him here so that he continues to hand me down his garbage sweaters.<br>
 <br>
<strong>What was your reaction when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160058/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPsUmhqncAg">your video</a> was linked to by Radiohead? </strong> I think of all of us were a bit awed at the idea that Radiohead had maybe sat around and laughed at that video in their studio. It was a pretty cool feeling. But then the flirty MySpace messages from the band turned from harmless to relentless and stalkerish. I literally just got a message from Colin Greenwood saying &quot;wherez yr house i wanna meet your mouth&quot; and it&apos;s like, enough, you know? We get it.</p>
