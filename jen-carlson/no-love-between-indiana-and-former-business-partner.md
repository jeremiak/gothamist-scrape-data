According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151219091948/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/love_and_war_for_pop_artist_VsJVt5h9pXIZQg3ktmnCMJ">the NY Post</a>, his former business partner John Gilbert claims the artist signed an agreement three years ago which allowed him to license sculptures and other pieces bearing the word &quot;prem&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;love&quot;) in his iconic style.<p></p>

<p>Allegedly after getting paid around $55K, Indiana reneged on the deal, denying the pieces created weren&apos;t authentic. This led to the cancellation of auctions at both Sotheby&apos;s and Christie&apos;s, and according to Gilbert&apos;s breach of contract suit, kept him from &quot;meeting [his] obligations under current contracts and jeopardized prospective contractual agreements with numerous third parties.&quot;</p>

<p>Indiana, now 81 years old, has filed a counter-suit for alleged violations of trademark law, stating that never signed an agreement. He also wants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151219091948/http://prem-love.com/pictures3.php">these photos</a> of him and Gilbert hanging with the &quot;prem&quot; pieces to vanish from the internet.</p>
