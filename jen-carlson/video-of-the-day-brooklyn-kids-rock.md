										<p>This is way better than <em>School of Rock</em>; over in Mr. R&apos;s class in Brooklyn, the little ones are becoming luthiers. Mr. R, Paul Rubenstein, works for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421180752/http://www.workingplayground.org/">Working Playground</a> and teaches high school and middle school kids how to make electric guitars <em>and</em> amplifiers, a program he started 5 years ago. He tells us:</p><blockquote>&quot;We make them entirely from scratch (except for the tuning machines) including the pickups. It has just grown since then... now we make amplifiers and square wave oscillators too.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;We are setting the frets to an unconventional tuning system: 7-tone equal temperament. This means that instead of having the standard 12 notes (A, A#, B, etc.) we will have a seven-note scale with notes that don&apos;t correspond to the usual notes-- they fall in-between those notes, giving the scale a distinctive sound.&quot;</p></blockquote>Teach also sent us along the below video of the kids at  Franklin K. Lane High School playing their guitars, as well as a square wave oscillator and butter tub amplifier they made. Before you click play, check them out creating their musical masterpieces, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421180752/http://www.ubertar.com/kids7">here</a>, and then see their completed guitars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421180752/http://www.ubertar.com/kids8">here</a>.<p></p>

<p>These kids will know a lot more about playing the guitar than the ones in front of their flat screens playing Guitar Hero. </p>
