										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sallykatzs0812.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120234024im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sallykatzs0812.jpg" width="350" height="263" class="image-left"> </span>The other day a few Gothamist staffers were discussing their common fear of becoming plagued with an eternal case of the hiccups&#x2014;a horrifying fate to say the least. But what about a never-ending orgasm? A 44-year-old New Jersey woman, Kim Ramsey, has been blessed/cursed with such an affliction, becoming sexually aroused with every breath she takes (every move she makes, every bond she breaks, and so on).</p>

<p>She recently told The Sun, &quot;Other women wonder how to have an orgasm&#x2014;I wonder how to stop mine.&#x201D; Ramsey tried different cures when she began having the constant orgasms, saying, &quot;I even tried sitting on frozen peas.&quot; Now she regularly has 100 orgasms a day, which leave her exhausted and often in pain.</p>

<p>Doctors have diagnosed her with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder, which is a rare condition that makes any pelvic movement trigger an orgasm. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120234024/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2194160/Woman-100-orgasms-DAY-left-agony-doing-housework-trigger-climax.html#ixzz24r6F0fLO">It&apos;s believed</a> this may have developed after a fall down a flight of stairs over ten years ago, which resulted in &quot;a Tarlov cyst on her spine, at the point where a woman&apos;s orgasm originates.&quot;</p>

<p>For those who are cursed with zero orgasms a day, an Indian pharmaceutical company has released a new cream called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120234024/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2188637/Indian-Ultratech-cream-18-Again-promises-vaginal-rejuvenation-sparks-Twitter-outrage.html#ixzz24r8fL0xM">18 Again</a>,&quot; which promises &quot;vaginal tightening&quot; that will make you feel &quot;like a virgin&quot; again. Then again, you probably didn&apos;t orgasm that time, either. Falling down the stairs, it is!</p>
