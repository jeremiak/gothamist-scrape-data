<p>The Bard family ran the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191153/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">Hotel Chelsea</a> for many years, and specifically, Stanley Bard was a fixture there. Bard was ousted a few years ago, and now the legendary hotel is being gutted and stripped of any of its original character. Part of the hotel&apos;s storied past includes other legends, like Patti Smith, who lived there during two tough times in her life, thanks in large part to Bard. But now, it seems she&apos;s turned her back on the man that once helped her out. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191153/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2012/01/patti-smith-sings-for-chelsea-hotel-developer-joseph-chetrit.html">the Hotel Chelsea blog</a>, she&apos;ll be playing a private concert there for residents (we&apos;re told around 80 remain) this Thursday, at an event held by developer Joseph Chetrit, who now holds the hotel keys. </p>

<p>Two people who still live there told us, <strong>&quot;We really hope we can get the word out and get Patti to cancel.&quot;</strong> They believe she may not know &quot;the person sponsoring her upcoming event, Joseph Chetrit, is the same developer who took Stanley Bard&#x2019;s beloved hotel away from him and his family.  And surely she is unaware that this is the same Joseph Chetrit whose demolition crews <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191153/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/05/photos_of_the_hotel_chelsea.php">recently gutted over a hundred historic Chelsea Hotel rooms</a>.&quot; Also, this is the same Chetrit who is currently trying to evict the remaining residents via the housing and Supreme court.</p>
