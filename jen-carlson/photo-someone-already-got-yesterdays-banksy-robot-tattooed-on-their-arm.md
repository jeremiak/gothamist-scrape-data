<p>We&apos;re on Day 29 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054420/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s 31 day takeover of New York City, and at least a few people gotten the street artist&apos;s pieces from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054420/http://gothamist.com/tags/betteroutthanin">Better Out Than In</a> residency tattooed on their skin. Tattoo artist Miykey at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054420/http://nyhctattoo.com/">NYHC Tattoo</a> on Stanton Street posted this photo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054420/http://instagram.com/p/gB-8dsBxFw/">to Instagram</a> yesterday, showing the arm of someone inked up with Banksy&apos;s robot/barcode design... which just went up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054420/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/28/photos_new_banksy_piece.php">in Coney Island</a> <em>yesterday</em>. Not bad!</p>

<p>Miykey is a Banksy fan himself, and tells us: &quot;Art should be free. I think Banksy has a positive message despite the currently so called illegal approach to putting it out there. But like all revolutions the beginning of it always has its lowbrow approach. As a friend of and admirer of many street artists out here I have nothing but love and respect for the modern day Turk 182. These artists spend all the money they have and take all the risk to put out some eye candy for the world to see and enjoy for free.&quot; He previously did one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054420/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/photo_latest_banksy_seems_to_be_in_1.php#photo-1">the Woodside piece</a>, too:</p>

<p>If you get a tattoo of one of Banksy&apos;s pieces from his month long residency here, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054420/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us a photo</a>!
