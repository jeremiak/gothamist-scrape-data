In fact, at the time his new book Shortcomings had just come out, and now it&apos;s hitting paperback. He&apos;s currently on a book tour with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130619/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/01/seth_graphic_novelist.php">Seth</a>, stopping by the Strand tomorrow night, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130619/http://www.moccany.org/">MoCCA festival</a> this weekend. Recently he told us about living in Chris Rock&apos;s former apartment and, for you graphic novel newbies, where to start if you&apos;re intrigued by the illustrated world.</em></p>

<p><strong>What influences your illustrations and novels?</strong> I was talking to someone recently who announced that they were thinking of trying their hand at fiction writing. I asked, somewhat incredulously, if this was something they knew how to do. And this person responded by saying, &quot;Well, all <em>you</em> do is take a bunch of stuff from your life and change a few names, right?&quot; I do draw on my own experiences and observations for inspiration, but I&apos;d like to think this person was simplifying my creative process quite a bit.</p>

<p><strong>How do you feel about comics and graphic novels becoming feature films&#x2014;would you ever experiment with that medium?</strong> I know there&apos;s a lot of comics fans out there who get a big thrill simply from the fact that a comic they love was very faithfully translated into a movie, and I don&apos;t quite understand that. I feel like it&apos;s a little bit insulting to the comics medium when a film adaptation is viewed as like the ultimate form of validation. I think comics can be the basis for great films, but I think the focus of such a project should be on making the film as good as possible, not on painstakingly replicating the comic.</p>

<p><strong>What are you working on for the future&#x2014;what&apos;s next?</strong> I&apos;m working on a new, as-yet-untitled book, which is a collection of inter-related short stories. I can&apos;t say much about it at this point, other than that it will be in color, and that it&apos;s pretty different from my last book.</p>
