<p>Do you want to enjoy the grittiness of 1980s New York City while sitting safely on the High Line? This September the Friends of the High Line are bringing a free fall film series celebrating the decade to the elevated park.</p>

<p>The series begins at 7 p.m. on Thursday, September 6th with a free screening of <em>The Muppets Take Manhattan</em>, and after that it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010047/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/26/wild_style.php"><em>Wild Style</em></a> (which includes a Q&amp;A; with producer Charlie Ahearn), followed by <em>Working Girl</em>. Someone ask Ahearn what he thinks of the High Line <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010047/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/22/graffiti_mural.php">buffing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010047/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/24/high_line_cleaning_up_or_losing_cha.php">the graffiti</a> that was surrounding the park before it opened!</p>

<p>All film screenings are free and take place in the 14th Street Passage, the semi-enclosed passageway on the High Line at West 14th Street. There will be tacos, hot dogs, salads, gelato, and other snacks and beverages available for purchase. But no turkey... In their press release, the High Line included this fun fact: &quot;The last freight train ran on the High Line in 1980, carrying three carloads of frozen turkeys for Thanksgiving.&quot;</p>
