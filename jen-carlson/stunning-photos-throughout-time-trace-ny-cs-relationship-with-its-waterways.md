                            <p>A new exhibit opened in Queens yesterday, putting various visions of the city&apos;s beaches on display. &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908042053/http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/centers/yehgallery/silent_beaches">Silent Beaches, Untold Stories: New York City&#x2019;s Forgotten Waterfront</a>&quot; features work from various artists, photographers, and historical archives. The exhibit&apos;s curator, Elizabeth Albert, has sent us along a selection of the works, the coming together of which is based on understanding the city&apos;s relationship with its water environs, and the evolution of that relationship. </p>

<p>&quot;A recent renewal of interest in New York City&#x2019;s geographical and topographic history and an increasing focus on its waterfront has inspired &apos;Silent Beaches, Untold Stories: New York City&#x2019;s Forgotten Waterfront,&apos; an interdisciplinary exhibition exploring waterfront areas that are remote, neglected, or little known to the general public and which have experienced long and sometimes tumultuous relationships with New York City&#x2019;s changing needs. The exhibition will be a result of an investigation into what these remote waterfront areas reveal about New York City&#x2019;s past and present environment, industry, and culture as experienced through a selection of historical and contemporary photographs, maps, documents, artifacts, prints, drawings, film, and interactive displays.&quot; </p>

<p>Click through for a preview, which features North Brother Island, Dead Horse Bay, the Rockaways, and a car in the Gowanus, naturally.</p>

<p><em>The exhibit will be on view through November 9th at the Dr. M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Art Gallery/Sun Yat Sen Hall, St. John&#x2019;s University, 8000 Utopia Parkway, Queens.</em></p>
