And their itinerary for their 11-day tour looks something like this: Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Los Angeles. <em>What gives Will and Kate</em>, New York City showed you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124404/http://gothamist.com/tags/royalwedding">so much love</a> prior to your nuptials!<p></p>

<p>The couple will arrive in North America tomorrow, first taking their tour of Canada and then heading to sunny Los Angeles. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124404/http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2011-06-28-william-kate-north-america-royal-visit_n.htm">USA Today</a> reports that this is &quot;William&apos;s first official visit to the USA; Catherine hasn&apos;t been to either country and is &apos;beyond excited&apos; about the trip.&quot; Perhaps one day she&apos;ll get to see New York City, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124404/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/27/prince_harrys_mets_game_pitch_barel.php">Harry</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124404/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/07/queen_elizabeth_caps_off_nyc_trip_w.php">Queen Elizabeth</a> did last year.</p>

<p>The young Royals are seen as worldwide celebrities, so it&apos;s not surprising they picked LA over NYC; during the trip William will have a (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124404/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43577238/ns/today-today_people/">$4,000/head</a>) sit-down dinner for the British Academy for Film and Television Arts (an organization of which he is the president), aimed at delivering young British talent to Hollywood execs. But when you kids are ready to be ignored, come on over to New York City!
