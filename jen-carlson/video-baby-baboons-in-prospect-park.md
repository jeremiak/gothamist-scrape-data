										<p>Move over, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155306/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/06/piranhas_in_nyc.php">piranhas</a>, Prospect Park is welcoming two new residents to the zoo: baby Hamadryas baboons! The two male babies are the first baboon births at the zoo in six years, and were officially announced by the Wildlife Conservation Society this morning. In a statement, Denise McClean&#x2014;Director of WCS&#x2019;s Prospect Park Zoo&#x2014;said, &#x201C;Both mothers and babies are doing very well and are one big happy troop.&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
The duo don&apos;t have names yet, so the zoo is seeking your suggestions. Starting Tuesday you can submit names <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155306/http://www.prospectparkzoo.com/">at their website</a>, where they&apos;ll announce a winner on September 24th. Below you&apos;ll find video of the baboons, but you should really drop by to say hello&#x2014;they&apos;ll be out and about with their family from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily until November 1st, when their exhibit time will change.<br>
