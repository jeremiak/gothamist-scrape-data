But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624223637/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07072009/news/regionalnews/brooklyn/greenpoint_yells__cut__178008.htm">the NY Post</a> reports that locals there are also getting riled up over the takeover, which brings a lack of parking spaces and too much traffic. A shopkeeper told the paper, <strong>&quot;The thrill is gone. As far as I&apos;m concerned, this is a nuisance. This is of no benefit to anyone around here.&quot;</strong><p></p>

<p>Recently a new Jennifer Aniston movie blocked off a stretch of Manhattan Avenue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624223637/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/16/parade.php">to film a parade scene</a>, while <em>Step Up 3-D</em> and a Martin Scorsese-directed HBO pilot <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> also filmed. For the former, titled <em>The Bounty</em>, locals were offered a shot to be an extra with $75 pay&#x2014;however one resident says the fat cats in Hollywood just played them for fools so they&apos;d &quot;shut up,&quot; and brought in their own people in the end.</p>

<p>But Brooklynites may have to get used to it, as one industry insider notes, <strong>&quot;Manhattan is losing its eclecticism and diversity.&quot;</strong> There <em>is</em> a silver (screen) lining: at least productions, and their money, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624223637/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/12/film_tax_credits.php">didn&apos;t abandon New York</a>.</p>
