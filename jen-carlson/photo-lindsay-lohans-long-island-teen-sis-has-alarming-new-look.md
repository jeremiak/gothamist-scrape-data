<p>The latest Lohan to fall into a downward spiral is Lindsay&apos;s little sis Ali (or, ahem, Aliana), who recently signed a modeling contract, and this week she was photographed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151448/http://www.usmagazine.com/stylebeauty/news/model-agency-ali-lohan-has-not-had-any-surgery-201189">with a new look</a> that sorta screams &quot;plastic surgery.&quot; Not only that, the Long Island teen is allegedly down to just 95 lbs, and a Columbia University professor says she &quot;has the look of someone who may binge and purge plus calorie restrict.&quot;</p>

<p>Doctors told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151448/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/09/ali-lohan-skinny-plastic-surgery-lindsay-lohan">Radar</a> that it looks like she had botox injected into her face, but her modeling rep says it&apos;s totally natural for a girl&apos;s face to change like that! No really, that&apos;s actually what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151448/http://www.eonline.com/news/ali_lohan_plastic_surgery/262553">she said</a>: &quot;As a young girl who is growing up, it&apos;s natural for her facial features to change slightly, and we see this with many of the younger models we represent.&quot; (Sadly, that last part is probably true.) But the experts say Ali &quot;is very underweight. By looking at her cheekbones you can tell she has muscle wasting going on.&quot; </p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151448/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindsaylohan">Lindsay</a> says her sister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151448/http://www.hollywood.com/news/The_Daily_Shuffle_Lindsay_Lohan_Defends_Ali_Against_Plastic_Surgery_Rumors/7837100">has never</a> gone under the knife, their father Michael is alarmed, saying, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s scary to see my daughter looking like this.&quot; Someone give these kids their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151448/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/17/carvel_black_card_is_real_lohans_ab.php">Carvel black card</a> back.</p>
