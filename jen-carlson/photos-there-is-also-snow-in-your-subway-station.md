<p>It makes perfect sense, what with subway grates existing and all, that snow would find itself inside of the our city&apos;s subway stations... but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206185434/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/26/yep_thats_snow_inside_the_subway_st.php">every time it happens</a> it&apos;s like <em>hey snow what are you doing in here?!</em> It&apos;s magic and it&apos;s defeating all at the same time. But at least it&apos;s a Thing To Instagram. </p>
