</div></div>					<p>When Jim Carrey isn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229084506/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/12/video_jim_carrey_sings_radiohead_at.php">belting out Radiohead tunes</a> on the Lower East Side, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229084506/http://www.jimcarreytrulife.com/video-post/bladin-nyc-with-my-favorite-ex-girlfriend">rollerblading on the streets</a>, he&apos;s channeling his inner-starving artist at the Church Of FFC (which he says is &quot;the name I&apos;ve given my art studio&quot; in New York). We contacted some galleries and museums to give their thoughts about Carrey&apos;s works (his latest is a 16-foot by 12-foot painting titled &quot;Visible&quot;)&#x2014;but everyone was pretty mum. The Guggenheim, for example, told us &quot;no comment,&quot; and the New Museum said &quot;all our curators are traveling right now&quot; (or washing their hair?). Lucien, the director of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229084506/http://theinvisibledog.org/">the Invisible Dog</a>, however, wanted to see more. He told us (and please, pardon his French): </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Very hard to give a comment. His works looks colorful and powerful but I would prefer to see them in real. I&apos;m French and I&apos;m not familiar with Jim Carrey as a movie star even if I saw some of his [serious] films but His smile is def charming ;-)&quot;</blockquote>

<p><em>Awww.</em> Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229084506/http://www.jimcarreytrulife.com/video-post/man-in-a-lawn-chair">a little tour</a> of Carrey&apos;s studio&#x2014;what do you think. Should Carrey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229084506/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/11/james_franco_brings_james_franco_to.php">and Franco</a> team up for a joint exhibition?</p>
