<p>One woman decided to go on a date with the devil, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002552/http://gothamist.com/tags/martinshkreli">Martin Shkreli</a>, when he &quot;super liked&quot; her on Tinder, and now she has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/01/05/my-tinder-date-with-pharma-bro-martin-shkreli/">published a story</a> about that date that is only surprising in its overall ordinariness. He did order a $120 tea in Tribeca, however, and this was the most intriguing part of all&#x2014;here&apos;s the entire article stripped of everything that didn&apos;t have to do with the tea:</p><blockquote> I told him that I am a vegetarian but that I enjoy almost any type of food, and he chose a Japanese restaurant in TriBeCa called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002552/http://www.davidbouley.com/brushstroke-main/brushstroke-menus/brushstroke-a-la-carte-menu/">Brushstroke</a>. The waitress also pointed out the list of Japanese teas on the menu. Most of the teas were priced between $8 to $13, but there was a &#x201C;Gold Medal Sencha&#x201D; for $120 a cup. Apparently it&#x2019;s extremely rare and won an important tea competition in Japan. After the waitress left, we joked about paying $120 for a cup of tea. I thought about making a price-gouging joke, but couldn&#x2019;t think fast enough.<p></p>

<p>We finished our food, and Martin flagged down the waitress and ordered the $120 tea. This was the most surprising and jarring moment of the night. I know he&#x2019;s a multimillionaire, but I thought we were on the same page about this tea. He asked if I wanted a cup, and I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to say yes. </p>

<p>When Martin finished his tea, I asked how he liked it. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not really a big tea drinker,&#x201D; he replied.</p>

<p>My only regret is not guzzling a cup of that $120 tea.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<span class="photo_caption">&quot;As good as it gets!&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002552/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brushstroke-new-york?select=oU1SOi3Cn41fitChDfiYmg&amp;reviewid=rTfW1pXDvEqLPXbvVGCJwQ">Yelp reviewer</a></span></p>

<p>About this tea:</p><ul><li>The tea is still on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002552/http://www.davidbouley.com/brushstroke-tea-menu/">the menu</a>, listed under &quot;2014 Ministry of Agriculture National Tea Fair Gold Medal Sencha.&quot; And it does indeed cost $120.<br>
</li><li>This actually isn&apos;t the most expensive tea on the menu, however, that would be the $125 Gold Medal Gyokuro. <br>
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002552/http://nypost.com/2016/01/07/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-pharma-jackasss-120-cup-of-tea/">The NY Post</a> went to the spot, and say it&apos;s ceremonial tea that &quot;earns its price tag from its rarity: only four kilos of the tea leaves are grown in Japan each year.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Also: you eat the tea leaves with soy sauce.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>The tea has now been forever tainted by its name being associated with Shkreli, who would have charged $2,299 per cup, btw.</p>
