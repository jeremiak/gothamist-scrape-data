<p>Last year the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055124/http://www.PreservationNation.org/">National Trust For Historic Preservation</a> named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055124/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/14/national_trust.php">the Brooklyn Waterfront</a> one of the 11 Most Endangered Places, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055124/http://www.wcbs880.com/Lower-East-Side-on-Most-Endangered-Places-List/2219290">this year</a> some of New York&apos;s land gets the honor. The Lower East Side has made the annual endangered list, which highlights the country&apos;s areas deemed at risk of irreparable damage.</p>

<p><img alt="0805mchattan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055124im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0805mchattan.jpg" width="212" height="240" class="right">Thanks to new development, the &quot;social and physical fabric&quot; of the neighborhood is eroding. From the press release/obituary:</p><blockquote>New hotels and condominium towers are being erected across the area, looming large over the original tenement streetscape.  As this building trend shows no sign of abating, it threatens to erode the fabric of the community and wipe away the collective memory of generations of immigrant families.<p></p>

<p>Although the Lower East Side was placed on the National and State Registers of Historic Places in 2000, such a designation functions primarily as an &#x201C;honor roll&#x201D; and does not preserve a neighborhood&#x2019;s appearance or regulate real estate speculation.</p></blockquote>From the raising of the Blue Condos to the loss of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055124/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/22/breaking_temple.php">First Roumanian Synagogue</a>, the rise and fall of neighborhood structures is in overdrive; &quot;in 2007, permits were approved for the full demolition of 11 buildings on the Lower East Side, compared with just one in 2006.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The LES is turning into a gateway to McHattan (the Village Voice even states as much on a billboard that looms above the &apos;nabe), but who will defend its honor and grasp onto the old charm that places like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055124/http://curbed.com/archives/2005/02/15/libation_sparks_les_hipster_war.php">Libation</a> have destroyed? Two years ago the Lower East Side Preservation Coalition formed to protect the neighborhood and its history; president Richard Moe warned: &#x201C;The Lower East Side is truly an irreplaceable area that speaks to one of the most powerful narratives in American history. Should the streetscape be radically altered by out-of-scale development, we will forever lose the neighborhood&#x2019;s cultural context as well as its dynamic spirit.&#x201D; </p>
