On Monday we visited the Hotel Chelsea to speak with Stanley Bard and some of the residents, and to get a little tour of the place before it turns into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120444/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/19/chelsea.php">a shell of its former self</a>. The long-time residents of the hotel are, along with Stanley, the lifeblood of the building. Upon visiting, what we already knew became even more apparent: if &quot;new management&quot; tampered with the residents, the hotel would change just as drastically as if they tampered with the appearance.

<p>In the video you meet Debbie and Ed, both have lived there for twelve years (the rent? $1500/month) and run the unofficial hotel blog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120444/http://www.legends.typepad.com/">Living with Legends</a>. Being the eyes and ears they&apos;ve uncovered things that &quot;new management&quot; may be trying to sweep under the carpets, most recently that David Elder is not only trying to screw over the Hotel Chelsea population, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120444/http://legends.typepad.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2007/07/skeleton-key-to.html">also his family</a>. </p>
