And <em>did you know</em> the rink was sort of accidental?<p></p>

<blockquote>While many people consider the skating rink Rockefeller Center&#x2019;s most singular feature, few realize is that it was an accident. The Sunken Plaza, as the area was originally called, was lushly landscaped and boasted high-end shops and restaurants, but few people could be enticed down the stairs leading from the Channel Gardens. In the winter of 1936, in an effort to attract attention to the Plaza, Rockefeller Center&#x2019;s managers contracted an engineer from Cleveland to build a temporary rink. It became a permanent fixture.</blockquote>
