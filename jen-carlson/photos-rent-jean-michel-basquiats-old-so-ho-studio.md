</div></div>					<p>Yesterday Airbnb reached out to us with an &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235800/https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/406031">exciting new listing!</a>&quot; for Jean-Michel Basquiat&apos;s former art studio and living space. They claim the 2,330 square-foot space in SoHo is where the artist lived and worked during the height of his career in the early 1980s. Though this was not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235800/http://artnerdnewyork.tumblr.com/post/1253670170/jean-michel-basquiats-studio-and-apartment">the Great Jones Street space</a> he lived in at the time of his death... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235800/https://paddle8.com/work/ari-marcopoulos/14432-jean-michel-basquiat-crosby-street-1983">it is where he took this bath once</a>.</p>

<p>The massive space is located on Crosby Street, and it&apos;s going for a whopping $650 a night... but the listing promises it&apos;s located on &quot;THE HIP street in Soho right now.&quot; So, totally worth it. </p>

<p>On top of the HIP factor, you&apos;ll get two bedrooms, a kitchen, and the ghost of a cool &apos;80s Madonna, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235800/http://nakedrealestate.com/2009/09/crosby-street/">lived there</a> when she was working on her debut album.</p>
