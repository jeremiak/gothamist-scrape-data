<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719162302/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/06/street_performer.php">Runnin&apos; Scared</a>, he&apos;ll be pushing the piano out of a Manhattan Mini Storage on Spring Street, over to Washington Square Park, where he plans to play from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. </p>

<p>You may have seen him there previously with an acoustic upright piano (pictured), today, however, he&apos;ll not only have his new baby grand, but break dancers, folk musicians, and other artists will also be joining him. This is all happening after he raised nearly $9,000 through his Kickstarter campaign; you can watch his pitch below:</p>
