<p>When you&apos;ve been holding on to one of the last landmarked remnants of old Bowery for nearly five decades, you&apos;re bound to make some sweet, sweet cash when you finally sell it. Photographer Jay Maisel had been living in the massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063812/http://gothamist.com/tags/190bowery">190 Bowery</a> building, formerly Germania Bank, since 1966, before putting it on the market earlier this year&#x2014;he came out of it with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063812/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/07/landmarked_bowery_mansion_sold_for.php">$55 million</a>. (Maisel had bought it in 1966 for $102,000.) He&apos;s now taken $15.5 million of that and purchased the most expensive townhouse in Brooklyn. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063812/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/realestate/15-5-million-arecord-for-brooklyn-real-estate.html?WT.mc_id=2015-KWP-AUD_DEV&amp;WT.mc_ev=click&amp;ad-keywords=AUDDEVREMARK&amp;kwp_0=22432&amp;kwp_4=148896&amp;kwp_1=161954">The NY Times</a> reports on that (and what other wealthy people did with their money recently):</p>

<blockquote>&quot;An enormous brick townhouse in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, suitable as both home and studio with its voluminous rooms, soaring ceilings and built-in four-car garage, sold to the photographer Jay Maisel for $15.5 million, according to city records, breaking the record for the highest price ever paid for a single residence in the borough.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The townhouse is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063812/http://www.elliman.com/new-york-city/177-pacific-street-brooklyn-ybyzqla">177 Pacific Street</a> and includes 6 bedrooms, 9 baths, 4 interior parking spots, an indoor 20 person movie theater, a gym, children&apos;s play room, bar, wine cellar, a kitchen with a 15&apos; island, a 2600 square foot roof garden with a stream and outdoor kitchen, and an elevator to take you to every level. A ROOF STREAM, <em>what will the rich think of next?</em></p>

<p>According to the listing, the property was being renovated at the time it was on the market, so no photos were available (except for the one you see above). That&apos;s probably for the best. </p>

<p>As for 190 Bowery, the new owner, Aby Rosen, was recently the subject of an entertaining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063812/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/29/landlord-beaux-arts-on-the-bowery">New Yorker</a> &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; profile, which gets into the transition of the Maisels out of the building: </p>

<blockquote>Rosen, a walrusy white-haired fifty-five, greeted Joe, then turned to a visitor and described the ejection of the Maisels. After the sale, he said, with a German accent, &#x201C;we gave them six months to find a new home.&#x201D; When they turned over the keys, the building was still full of their junk: &#x201C;Penthouse and Hustler and Playboy magazines, everything catalogued, from 1956 to 1982,&#x201D; Rosen said. &#x201C;There were five thousand screwdrivers, all lined up.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Maisel denied it all.</p>
