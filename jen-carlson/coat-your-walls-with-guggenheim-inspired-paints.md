<p>If anyone knows paint color, it&apos;s the Guggenheim. The museum spent <em>forever</em> trying to decide on their new shade when they gave the joint a makeover back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152609/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/16/painting_the_gu.php">a few years back</a>. And prior to that, it came out that Wright originally wanted the museum to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152609/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/21/guggenheim_turns_50_years_young_tod.php">crimson red</a>! So naturally, they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152609/http://www.guggenheimcolorbyfpe.com/store/pc/home.asp">getting into the paint game</a> to make some extra cash. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152609/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/house-paints-from-the-guggenheim/">Artsbeat</a>, &quot;the museum has entered into a licensing agreement with Fine Paints of Europe... to create a set of 200 interior and exterior wall colors drawn from well-known paintings in the Guggenheim&#x2019;s collection and from wall colors that curators, artists and designers (including Frank Lloyd Wright himself) have used for exhibitions over several decades.&quot;</p>

<p>The paints range from $35 to $130 per can, and of course, you&apos;ll need to buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152609/http://www.guggenheimcolorbyfpe.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=107">this $150 fan deck</a> to help you determine if you want your bathroom in a Kandinsky hue, or more of a van Gogh vibe.</p>
