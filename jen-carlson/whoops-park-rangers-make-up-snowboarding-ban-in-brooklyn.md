title: Whoops: Park Rangers Make Up Snowboarding Ban in Brooklyn
---

	
										<p>The Parks Department may need a refresher course in their own rules and regulations. After one of the snowfalls in December, some park rangers tossed a few snowboarders out of Fort Greene Park, even though it&apos;s totally legal to snowboard there. The incident was captured on video, circulated around the internet, and now hits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406021702/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/01/19/2010-01-19_bizarre_snowboard_ban_parks_dept_says_it_goofed.html">the Daily News</a>. In the below video, the rangers say it&apos;s illegal to snowboard in city parks, but that they&apos;ll &quot;look the other way&quot; as long as no more &quot;ramps&quot; are built... and if they don&apos;t comply, they&apos;ll be on the receiving end of a $350 fine.</p>

<p>35-year-old Brian Paupaw, who was there teaching some local youth to board, told the paper, &quot;It was ridiculous. I&apos;ve been snowboarding in that park for five years. There&apos;s no rule against that.&quot; A spokesman for the Parks Department admitted that the rangers messed up, and they were reportedly &quot;forced to admit there are in fact no rules barring snowboarding in city parks.&quot;</p>
