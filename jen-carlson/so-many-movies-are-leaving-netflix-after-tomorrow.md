<p>This Wednesday, February 29th, a lot of great movies (and just as many terrible ones) will be disappearing from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200128/http://gothamist.com/tags/netflix">Netflix</a>. The company&apos;s contract with Starz has run out, and when they leave, they&apos;re taking all of their titles with them, both in DVD and streaming form. When Starz first announced the split last September, they exlained: </p>

<blockquote>This decision is a result of our strategy to protect the premium nature of our brand by preserving the appropriate pricing and packaging of our exclusive and highly valuable content. With our current studio rights and growing original programming presence, the network is in an excellent position to evaluate new opportunities and expand its overall business.</blockquote>

<p>Netflix CEO Reed Hastings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200128/http://allthingsd.com/20110601/netflix-ceo-200-million-to-renew-starz-deal-wouldnt-be-shocking/">insinuated</a> the contract renewal could have cost him around $200 million a year, six times more than the original contract from 2008. </p>

<p>So what kind of &quot;highly valuable content&quot; is Starz taking with them? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200128/http://movies.netflix.com/WiContentPage?pn=1&amp;csid=1">Click here</a> for all twenty-one pages of soon to be vanished content. Now if you&apos;ll excuse us, we have less than one day to rewatch <em>Beetlejuice</em>, <em>Toy Story 3</em>, <em>That Thing You Do!</em>, <em>Scarface</em>, <em>Teen Wolf</em>, <em>Rumble in the Bronx</em>, <em>Big</em>, <em>One Crazy Summer</em>, <em>The Secret of My Success</em>, and 1994&apos;s seminal hit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200128/http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/I_Downloaded_a_Ghost/60035563?trkid=1992265"><em>I Downloaded a Ghost</em></a>... okay, they aren&apos;t <em>all</em> winners, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200128/http://gizmodo.com/5888553/the-20">here are some more movies</a> you may want to watch before tomorrow.</p>
