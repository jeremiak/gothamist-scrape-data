<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151219181928/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/13/8.php">Yesterday</a> we heard the &quot;8&quot; which will create the &quot;2008&quot; sign that millions will see in person and on screen during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151219181928/http://abc.go.com/specials/newyearsrockineve.html">New Years Eve Rockin&apos; Eve</a> extravaganza...was reduced to take mass transit to Times Square. This number is a true New Yorker! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151219181928/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/12/14/2007-12-14_new_years_sign_part_off_to_times_square.html">The Daily News</a> has some quotes from its fellow straphangers and handlers:</p><blockquote>&quot;It&apos;s not every day you ride with an 8,&quot; said the 30-year-old from Rego Park, Queens. &quot;It&apos;s going to be the first thing I mention when I get to work.&quot; <p></p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s exciting,&quot; said Karl Kowalzik, 56, Landmark&apos;s project manager, who helped maneuver the numeral in and out of the trains. &quot;Who else could say they&apos;ve taken a No. 8 for New Year&apos;s on the subway? It&apos;s a first.&quot;</p></blockquote>It&apos;s hard enough to lug groceries on the subway, could you imagine carrying a 500-lb number? Not to mention one with 180 light bulbs that one probably doesn&apos;t want to shatter. The good news is that &quot;8&quot; made it to Times Square safe and sound, where it will be on display at the Information Center through the 19th.<p></p>
