<p>At this morning&apos;s grand reopening of Fairway in Red Hook, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153825/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/09/red_hook_fairway_wont_reopen_until.php">has been closed</a> since Hurricane Sandy hit last October, Mayor Bloomberg was presented with a portrait of himself by Fairway president Howie Glickberg. We&apos;ll have much more on the reopening ceremony coming up, but for now behold the airbrushed masterpiece&#x2014;arguably the star of the show: </p>

<p>The portrait sat with Bloomberg behind the podium for a bit&#x2014;along with the onion bagels he received&#x2014;before getting passed off to its own private Fairway handlers who were charged with making sure it went home with the Mayor... who does have his own room in City Hall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153825/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/mike_city_haul_HzrlJiLe38SNXsvV8a18JK">dedicated to fan art</a> (it&apos;s unclear if commissioned work from company presidents lands there though).</p>

<p>While the handlers didn&apos;t have much information on the portrait, the signature on it reads, in part: 90&#xB0;. Maybe s/he can give <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153825/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/11/kate_middletons_terrible_official_p.php#photo-1">Paul Emsley</a> some pointers.</p>
