Some choice quotes are sprinkled throughout:</p><ul><li>&#x201C;For a little while I only ate grapefruits for my lunch because they have a lot of nutrients and they got me through the day.&#x201D;</li><li>&#x201C;If I shop, I can&#x2019;t have a social life and I can&#x2019;t eat.&#x201D;</li><li>Before moving from San Francisco last fall, Ms. Werkheiser realized that paying salon prices for platinum tresses in New York would require cutting back on needs like food and shelter. &#x201C;So I went natural,&#x201D; said Ms. Werkheiser. &#x201C;I dyed it dark, a New York brunette.&#x201D;</li><li>&#x201C;I find in other cities guys are more apt to buy you drinks and expect nothing from it. Here, if they do buy you a drink, which is rare, you have to suffer through flirtations. It&#x2019;s true,&#x201D; she said, adding, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really cheesy.&#x201D;</li></ul>But who <em>hasn&apos;t</em> snuck flasks into bars, cut their own hair, coveted thy neighbor&#x2019;s salary, or subleted a walk-in closet in their New York lifetime? Some of the youngsters in the Times piece hope to laugh about this when they&apos;re rich and famous, so maybe the article will give them their 15 minutes. <p></p>
