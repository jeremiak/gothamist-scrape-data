<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913001559/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> made a surprise last-minute appearance on <em>Late Night With Jimmy Fallon</em>, where there happened to be no other musical guest scheduled for the night. What luck! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913001559/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/kanye-west-performs-bound-2-on-fallon-20130910">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913001559/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmyfallon">Fallon</a> let the appearance &quot;slip online last night a few hours before the show aired&quot; by Tweeting the &quot;surprise&quot; and totally unplanned drop-in. &quot;Ooops! Thought I was sending a DM!&quot;</p>

<p>The rapper performed his cut &quot;Bound 2&quot; for the first time ever in public, alongside Charlie Wilson and The Roots... all unrehearsed, of course, because this was a total surprise. No one knew it was coming! There was no publicity team and marketing machine working behind the scenes on this appearance, which as it happens would be televised and reach a vast audience of consumers. Kanye just felt like dropping by to say hello to his friend Jimmy, maybe performing a tune off his new album, whatever! This is just a thing that happens sometimes...</p>

<p>And here&apos;s the performance&#x2014;really not bad considering they had zero time to get it together!</p>
