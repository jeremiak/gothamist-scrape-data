										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="SMbuckleycasting0611.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122651im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SMbuckleycasting0611.jpg" width="325" height="338" class="image-right"> </span>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122651/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/jeff_buckley_to_be_immortalized_on.php">it was declared</a> to the world that Penn Badgley (<em>Gossip Girl</em>&apos;s Dan Humphrey) was cast to play the late musician Jeff Buckley in a biopic that has been in the works for six years.... but that&apos;s not really accurate. Here&apos;s what we learned today:</p>

<ul><li>Penn Badgley wasn&apos;t cast! Co-producer Orian Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122651/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/06/penn-badgley-reportedly-lands-lead-role-in-jeff-buckley-biopic.html">says</a>, &quot;Penn is not involved in the film at all. It&apos;s crazy how these stories get out.&quot; 
</li><li>Williams also says, &quot;There are some actors who make sense, but it&apos;s easier to believe when it&apos;s more of an unknown.&quot; So is Robert Pattinson really being considered still? That&apos;s unclear, though he seems to think he is.
</li><li>Badgley was cast for <em>a different</em> and unofficial Buckley film, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122651/http://www.movieweb.com/news/penn-badgley-joins-greetings-from-tim-buckley"><em>Greetings From Tim Buckley</em></a>. That&apos;s right, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122651/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/the_awful_truth/b248759_robert_pattinson_still_interested_in.html">there are two</a>! But only one has Buckley&apos;s mom on board, along with the musician&apos;s personal journals, photos and recordings.
</li><li>Turns out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122651/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/the_awful_truth/b248805_what_do_brad_pitt_jennifer_aniston_have.html#ixzz1Q74odBdA">Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt</a> were the only ones to get the rights from Buckley&apos;s mother, for their production company, Plan B. Pitt wanted to produce the film, but he doesn&apos;t seem to be involved in any Buckley productions.</li></ul>

<p>Are you more confused now than ever? All you need to know is that the official film will start rolling the cameras in New York and Tennessee this coming October, and as of right now no one has been cast to play Buckley. The film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122651/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/the_awful_truth/b248759_robert_pattinson_still_interested_in.html#ixzz1Q7AvuVvn">will cover</a> &quot;Jeff&apos;s life from his 20s to his death at age 30. It is the story of his youth, living in New York City and his last days in Memphis.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the film Badgley is starring in will have the actor playing Tim Buckley&apos;s son Jeff, and will focus on the days leading up to Jeff Buckley&apos;s 1991 performance at his father&apos;s tribute concert in St. Ann&apos;s Church in New York.</p>
