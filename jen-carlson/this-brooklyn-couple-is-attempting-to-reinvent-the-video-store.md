<p>The curator of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607195206/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/20/rerun.php">reRun Theater</a> in DUMBO, Aaron Hillis, has gone and purchased himself a video store in Cobble Hill, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607195206/http://www.indiegogo.com/vfb">Video Free Brooklyn</a>. Now he needs $50,000 to renovate the place, which will help to keep alive the video store... something that is very likely on some endangered list at this point. He seems to have some new ideas to revive the shop, noting, &quot;I want to reinvent the video store experience and make it fun again.&quot;</p>

<p>He&apos;s already behind the as-is counter (they opened their doors on June 1st), and when his vision becomes a reality he hopes to host screenings, readings and panels, and (along with his wife) hopes to create &quot;a haven for progressive-minded parents and cinephiles.&quot; </p>

<p>Check out his campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607195206/http://www.indiegogo.com/vfb">here</a>&#x2014;you&apos;ll see in the donation rewards section that he&apos;s already got the support of Oscilloscope Laboratories, Patton Oswalt, and Robert Downey Sr. (yes, Sr.).</p>
