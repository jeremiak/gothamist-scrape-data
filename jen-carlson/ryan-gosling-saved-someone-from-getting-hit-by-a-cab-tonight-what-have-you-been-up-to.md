Tonight, somewhere on 6th Avenue&#x2014;mere months (and months) after Ryan Gosling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081033/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/video_ryan_gosling_breaks_up_nyc_st.php">broke up a street fight</a> in Astor Place... in broad daylight... between two elderly men... over a piece of artwork (HERO)&#x2014;the actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081033/http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/1139287">reportedly</a> saved a woman&apos;s life as she was about to get hit by a cab.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081033/https://twitter.com/#!/PennyRed/">Laurie Penny</a>, a British writer visiting the States, was looking the wrong way when crossing the street and a cab nearly took her down. But Gosling swooped in and saved the day, shouting, &quot;Hey, watch out!&quot; as he grabbed her away from the cold clutches of the Grim Reaper. (Can we keep this man on subway track patrol?)</p>

<p>After any life and death experience, the natural thing to do is Tweet, so Penny transmitted the following message around 6:30 this evening: &quot;I literally, LITERALLY just got saved from a car by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081033/http://gothamist.com/tags/ryangosling">Ryan Gosling</a>. Literally. That actually just happened.&quot; And right now, Ryan Gosling is probably <em>literally</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081033/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/video_ryan_gosling_is_embarrassed_a.php">adorably blushing</a> from his latest good deed.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s all listen to this song together, as we write letters to whoever clears public art projects and implore them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081033/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/08/we_want_this_ryan_gosling_public_ar.php">make this tribute</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081033/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4gxQvEfjfg">a real human being, a real hero</a> <em>happen</em>...</p>

<p>And now, we sleep, where we&apos;ll dream of the above incident happening, but to us... and also in our version Ryan Gosling won&apos;t have a shirt on.</p>
