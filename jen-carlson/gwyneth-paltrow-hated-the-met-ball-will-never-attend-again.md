<p>GOOP newsletter author and actress we genuinely used to like, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101343/http://gothamist.com/tags/gwynethpaltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, has deemed the Met&apos;s annual Costume Institute Gala &quot;so un-fun&quot;! This criticism is about as punk as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101343/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/photos_the_lamest_dresses_at_the_me.php#photo-5">the pink dress</a> she wore to the punk-themed ball that was held at the museum earlier this week.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101343/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gwyneth-paltrow-never-going-to-met-ball-again-201395">Paltrow declared</a>, <strong>&quot;I&apos;m never going again. It was so un-fun. It was boiling. It was too crowded. I did not enjoy it at all.&quot;</strong> Would it have killed them to turn the music down? Why does everything have to be so loud? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101343/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LuCaIPxGpg">I&apos;m cold and there are wolves after me</a>. I&apos;ll be deep in the cold, cold ground <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101343/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoWc6WRHKEE">before I recognize Missourah</a>. And so on...</p>
