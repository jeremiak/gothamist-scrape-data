The one time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511041608/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=29&amp;entry_id=12604">Big Muppet on Campus</a> has been overshadowed by that fame whore Elmo. They claim the red muppet, who has less of a pot belly and a dumbed down version of Grover&apos;s schtick, has become what Al Roker is to Willard Scott. It&apos;s also noted that the other Sesame Street elders, like Big Bird, get more respect, with &quot;classy elder statesman&quot; roles.
