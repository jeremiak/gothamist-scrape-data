</div></div>					<p>Well, you can&apos;t really buy these houses, or rent them for that matter, but you can <em>visit</em> them! And that will just have to fulfill your fort-living fantasy. Environmental artist Patrick Dougherty has been at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden constructing these &quot;branchwork sculpture,&quot; and he&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140328/http://www.bbg.org/discover/gallery/dougherty/#/tabs-1">tracking the progress here</a>. The final, site-specific sculpture will be finished by August 21st and will stand over the next year... as long as the material it&apos;s made from&#x2014;all collected in Staten Island&apos;s Ocean Breeze Park&#x2014;doesn&apos;t fully decay throughout the seasons.</p>
