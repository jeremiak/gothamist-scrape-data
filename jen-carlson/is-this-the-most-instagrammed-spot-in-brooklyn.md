<p>If you stand on Washington Street in DUMBO, you will never be alone. The stretch between Plymouth and Front streets is often filled with people&#x2014;standing on cobblestone and surrounded by old brick buildings&#x2014;pointing their phones at the Manhattan Bridge. Or standing in front of a professional photographer. Or angling their selfie stick juuuuuust right. We don&apos;t have any data, but it&apos;s safe to say this is one of the, if not <em>the</em> most Instagrammed spot in all of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>And with good reason... first of all, it&apos;s located in the highly photogenic neighborhood of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031120758/https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/23023/">DUMBO</a>, and secondly, even if you walk by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031120758/https://www.google.com/maps/place/Washington+St,+Brooklyn,+NY+11201/@40.7033757,-73.9895682,3a,75y,356.18h,96.83t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sF0Mk1Uqha77Z6-uqXkxBcw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DF0Mk1Uqha77Z6-uqXkxBcw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D98.970749%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a315b54ac21:0x80a0361be81f5b07!8m2!3d40.7028578!4d-73.9896047">the spot</a> every day, it never gets old.</p>

<p>It has, however, gotten more crowded. Morning, afternoon, and evening you&apos;ll find the one to three block stretch dotted with people trying to capture the shot, which, if done correctly, features the Empire State Building right in the center. </p>

<p>On some recent visits to the area in the middle of the day during a work week, we spotted everything from impromptu selfies, to that couple at the :44-second mark that we hope were filming some sort of parody. Check the scene out in the above video... and here&apos;s how the spot looked in 1908, before Instagram or the Empire State Building.</p>
