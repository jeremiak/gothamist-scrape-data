<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114423/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> castmember J-WOWW, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114423/http://www.jwoww.com/clothing.php">designs tops</a> that leave nothing left to the imagination, is unsurprisingly the first to go the fully monty for a little bit of cash. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114423/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/01/26/2010-01-26_jersey_shore_star_jenni_jwoww_farley_nude_photos_being_shopped_to_media_outlets.html">the Daily News</a>, photos of Jenni Farley in her totally tanned birthday suit are being shopped around <em>right now</em>; the paper specifies, &quot;there are at least three nude photos&quot; which &quot;show Farley wearing a pair of boots, a skimpy wrap around her waist and nothing else.&quot; </p>

<p>In other <em>Jersey Shore</em> news, after word of the castmates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114423/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/23/jersey_shore_cast_wants_more_money.php">salary demands</a> for a second season got out, there were rumors that they were under consideration for replacement. &quot;The Situation&quot; recently addressed the, er, situation, by saying: &quot;As it comes to negotiating, we know that there will be a Season 2 and we hope MTV will have us back and I am pretty sure that is going to happen.&quot; Hmm... maybe they all better start shopping around their naked pics, just in case?</p>
