<p>Majora Carter, a 41-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130242/http://www.ssbx.org/">environmental activist</a> from the South Bronx, had tucked a small Tibetan flag up her sleeve, with the torch in the other. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130242/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/nyregion/11carter.html?_r=1&amp;ref=us&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> described her 200-meter run, which was cut short.</p><blockquote>Five seconds into her run down Van Ness Avenue, Ms. Carter pulled the Tibetan flag from her sleeve and began waving it. There she was, a mole at the head of the procession.<p></p>

<p>She waved the flag for roughly five seconds, until a Chinese guard saw her. He lunged at her. She dodged him. He lunged again and soon wrested the flag from her hand, saying, &#x201C;Sorry, I can&#x2019;t let you do this.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130242/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/04/10/2008-04-10_olympic_torch_bearer_from_bronx_in_tibet.html">The Daily News</a> quotes Carter, &quot;<strong>I was expressing my right as an American citizen using freedom of speech in support of people who don&apos;t have it.</strong> It just became really clear to me what was going on in Tibet and I wanted to do something. Apparently, I&apos;m not part of the Olympic torch-bearing entourage anymore.&quot; While that may be true, later at a pro-Tibet rally, she was welcomed like a rock star, as &quot;people bowed, hugged her, kissed her and cried.&quot;<p></p>

<p>However, another New Yorker in the torch run, a retired FDNY firefighter Richard Doran who wore his helmet in honor of the 343 FDNY members killed on 9/11, said this of Carter&apos;s act: &quot;I think it&apos;s disgusting, appalling. It violated every paper we signed about the sanctity of the event.&quot;  Coca-Cola, an Olympics sponsor which nominated Carter to carry the torch, is also unhappy with her actions.</p>
