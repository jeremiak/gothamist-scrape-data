                            <p><img alt="200709jayparkinson.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130811012845im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200709jayparkinson.jpg" width="369" height="292" class="right">We&apos;re really surprised no one thought of this sooner: vintage healthcare! Well, sort of. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130811012845/http://www.jayparkinsonmd.com/">Jay Parkinson</a> declares he is a &quot;new kind of physician,&quot; and he is. Revolutionary, in fact. Based out of Williamsburg, he&apos;s bringing healthcare to those who wouldn&apos;t normally be able to receive it without breaking the bank...giving the uninsured masses a reason to breathe a sigh of relief. He&apos;s also mixing this idea with an old one: house calls! </p>

<p>Back to the new edge he&apos;s bringing to the medicine game, though -- not only is his service inexpensive and for everyone, you can get checked out online! You see, Dr. Parkinson is a little more &quot;with it&quot; than your average MD, and he&apos;s making it easy for his patients. He&apos;ll discuss your problems with you over email, IM and video chat -- because who wants to leave their bed when they aren&apos;t feeling well? As an added bonus: this means no waiting rooms (unless, we suppose, he sets his IM status to &quot;away&quot;). </p>

<p>Sure, when he&apos;s not doling out meds and sitting bedside with an ailing patient...he&apos;s taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130811012845/http://www.darkshapesprowl.com/aspiring/aspiring1.html">nude photos of the ladies</a> (NSFW!) but that shouldn&apos;t creep you out at all. And hey, maybe you can get a new MySpace photo out of this house call if you ask nicely. </p>
