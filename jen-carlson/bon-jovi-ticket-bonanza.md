One fan declared of JBJ: &quot;Back in the day he was number one and he still is,&quot; while others were happy he was doing the show for free and giving back to his <em>other</em> hometown.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015324/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/07/bon_jovi_tickets_sell_out_in_u.html">on Staten Island</a> one man arrived at 7:40 a.m. and said: &quot;I...thought the line was for a big game. Security told me it was for Bon Jovi and to get on line.&quot; He lucked out and 2 of the 1500 tickets at the Richmond County Bank Ballpark went to him (the stadium&apos;s alloted stack vanished in 46 minutes). </p>

<p>All in all, 60,000 tickets were dispensed yesterday, with a maximum of two per person. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015324/http://www.silive.com/news/advance/photos/gallery.ssf?cgi-bin/view_gallery.cgi/silive/view_gallery.ata?g_id=5376">SI Live has a photo gallery</a> from the Island&apos;s giveaway; they also note that &quot;Lost Highway&quot; has been billed as a prelude to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game (taking place at Yankee Stadium on the 15th). </p>

<p>If you missed out, more tickets are schedule to be given out on July 11th at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015324/http://mlb.mlb.com/nyy/fan_forum/asg/fanfest_fun.jsp">DHL AllStar FanFest</a> held at the Javits Center, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015324/http://www.MLB.com/">MLB.com</a> will have more details. Not surprisingly, a lot of tickets have landed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015324/http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=bon+jovi+central+park&amp;minAsk=min&amp;maxAsk=max">on Craigslist</a> as well. For the Simon and Garfunkel show that took place on the Great Lawn in 1981, 400-750,000 people attended, however, the Parks Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015324/http://www.rncprotestrights.org/complaint-1118932004.html">has since claimed</a> it can only hold 80,000.</p>
