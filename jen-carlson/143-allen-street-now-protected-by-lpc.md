<p>The latest city building to get landmark designation from the LPC is a 180-year-old Federal-style row house at 143 Allen Street on the Lower East Side. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203946/http://thevillager.com/villager_356/landmarking.html">the Villager</a> it was built, along with five others, in 1830 by ship captain George Sutton.</p>

<p>Robert Tierney of the LPC said in a statement: &#x201C;This remarkable, intact house has survived not only the test of time, but also the radical transformation of the Lower East Side into a dense immigrant neighborhood that came to be defined by scores of tenement buildings. It&#x2019;s one of the few buildings remaining from the area&#x2019;s first major wave of urban development.&quot; </p>

<p>The other five houses were torn down long ago, but number 141 actually made it to the 1980s, when it was sold to a group of artists (but later demolished).</p>
