<p>While Lindsay Lohan and Woody Allen are no strangers, the duo have been mixing it up quite frequently as of late. In February the fallen starlet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174844/http://www.bestweekever.tv/2012-02-09/lindsay-lohan-officially-looks-worst-than-woody-allen/">was photographed</a> with Allen and his wife Soon-Yi Previn, and over the weekend the trio were out again, this time dining at the Upper East Side&apos;s Phillippe. And of course her mom Dina told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174844/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/new_york_oddest_couple_3t2bcUKeonKHLhFWLUPmvK#ixzz1uD7JEBgd">the NY Post</a>, &#x201C;He just believes in her talent, and they&#x2019;re really great friends.&quot;</p>

<p>So is LiLo the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174844/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/picture_scarlett_johansson_naked_an.php">new ScarJo</a>, serving as a muse to Allen for an upcoming project? (She&apos;s also been spotted out with Allen&apos;s first muse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174844/http://www.justjared.com/2012/01/03/lindsay-lohan-new-years-eve-with-diane-keaton/">Diane Keaton</a>.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174844/http://www.tmz.com/2012/05/06/lindsay-lohan-woody-allen-video/">TMZ thinks so</a>, and we feel pretty safe <em>even not confirming with Lohan herself</em> that she would jump at the chance to star in one of his films.</p>

<p>In the below video, TMZ&apos;s stalking crew asks Allen who paid for dinner, which makes the director laugh.</p>
