<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093523/http://www.murderink.com/">Murder Ink</a>, the &quot;the world&apos;s oldest mystery bookstore&quot; that offered everything from Tom Clancy to 50s pulp fiction, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093523/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070102/ap_on_en_ot/mystery_bookstore">has closed</a>.

</p><p>Current owner Jay Pearsall &quot;said he was paying $18,000 a month in rent for Murder Ink and another store, Ivy&apos;s Books &amp; Curiosities, and couldn&apos;t afford a 5 percent increase expected in March. Competition from huge bookstore chains and online sellers didn&apos;t help.&quot;</p>

<p>The author of a novel titled &quot;Murder Ink&quot;, Dilys Winn,  founded the shop in 1972 and the ownership has gone through a few changes since. In 1980, the shop inspired a television show called &quot;Murder Ink,&quot; starring Tovah Feldshuh (to play the owner of a bookshop specializing in mystery novels). The series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093523/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E1DA1238F935A3575AC0A965948260">failed</a>, however. And the shop, which was on Broadway between 92nd and 93rd streets, shut its doors for good yesterday.</p>
