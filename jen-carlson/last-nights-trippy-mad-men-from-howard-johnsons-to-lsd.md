title: Last Night's "Trippy" Mad Men: From Howard Johnson's To LSD
---

	
										<p>Last night&apos;s episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145634/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> didn&apos;t have any major historical news moments overshadowing it, or even serving as a backdrop, as the past few have. This time there were references serving as time markers, from the popularity of Howard Johnson&apos;s at the time, to the Cornel Wilde movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145634/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060736/"><em>The Naked Prey</em></a>... stop reading now if you don&apos;t want to have any close encounters with the basics of the episode.</p>
