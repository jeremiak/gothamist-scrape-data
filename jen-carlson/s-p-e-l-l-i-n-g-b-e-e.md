She captivated audiences world wide, and even had an Obey Giant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330141800/http://www.grrl.com/beccastat.html">sticker</a> of her own. We&apos;re thinking she may have also had a little something to do with inspiring this event.<br>
 <br>
Every other Monday for the past few months word mavens, twenty/thirty-something (we hate the word too) hipsters and perhaps Sealfon fans, have been flocking over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330141800/http://www.petescandystore.com/">Pete&apos;s Candy Store</a> for PBR and...spelling bee&apos;s! Tomorow night will be no different, except for that it&apos;s the FINALS. That&apos;s right, the Williamsburg Spelling Bee finals, where only one speller will reign victorious. Past winners have included a librarian, an SAT teacher, and an ESL instructor. </p>

<p>The bee is emceed by singer (and found of the bee) bobbyblue and spoken word performer Jennifer Dziura. The weekly competitors compete for a paid bar tab but tomorrow the stakes are raised. The winner will receive a cash prize, and prizes donated by neighborhoodies, The Strand, Jigsaw Gallery, ReadyMade Magazine, and the Brooklyn Museum. It just...got...interesting.  </p>

<p>Pete&apos;s Candy Store is located at 209 Lorimer Street in Williamsburg,<br>
Brooklyn, and also hosts Scrabble and trivia nights. Get there at 7:30pm for the lexical throwdown tomorrow night.  </p>
