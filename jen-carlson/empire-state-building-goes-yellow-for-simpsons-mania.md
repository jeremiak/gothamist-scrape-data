If you&apos;re out and about than you&apos;ll likely run into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231120/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117977861.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;loc=interstitialskip">Simpson-izing of Manhattan</a>! Too bad we don&apos;t have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231120/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_vs._the_Monorail">a monorail</a> here. </p>

<p>Earlier this year upon <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> release, we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231120/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/02/apurfect_pr_stu.php">7-11s transform into Kwik-E-Marts</a>, and today with the DVD hitting stores, we&apos;ll be getting a lot more than KrustyO&apos;s.</p><blockquote>Today&apos;s Simpsonfest is an all-day Fox affair in the heart of the city marking the hit toon&apos;s DVD release. Anyone in Midtown will find it difficult to miss the yellow-jacketed street teams, the &quot;Simpsons on Ice&quot; show at Bryant Park, the giant inflatable Homers and the Empire State Building lit up yellow in the landmark&apos;s first-ever movie tie-in.</blockquote>First ever movie tie-in? What was King Kong doing up there in 1983? That said, this promotion would be <em>a lot</em> cooler if they got a giant inflatable Homer scaling the building. In addition to the aforementioned there will also be 2,500 mega-donut balloons lining 42nd Street, and a Times Square street team will distribute yellow Santa hats. We wonder if Fox knows they&apos;re getting free plugs in Queens with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231120/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1088406545/in/set-72157594155730842">these Simpsons murals</a>.<p></p>

<p>If you feel like you&apos;ve been inundated with movie promos around town lately, you aren&apos;t alone -- many are wondering if Manhattan is becoming an important &quot;movie landscape&quot; both on <em>and</em> off-screen. Variety delves into the topic, saying &quot;It isn&apos;t that filmmaking in Gotham or the ad biz have only recently materialized. It&apos;s that the marriage of mass appeal and the ability of large-scale productions to be mounted here has turned Gotham into a reinvigorated production and promotional hotspot.&quot; We can&apos;t wait for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231120/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/20/new_cloverfield.php"><em>Cloverfield</em></a> promotions!   </p>
