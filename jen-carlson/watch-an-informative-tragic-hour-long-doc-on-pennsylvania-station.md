title: Watch An Informative & Tragic Hour Long Doc On Pennsylvania Station
---

	
										<p>That PBS documentary about Pennsylvania Station that we alerted you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040233/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/10/watch_the_beautiful_old_penn_statio.php">last week</a> is now available online, in full&#x2014;you can watch it below. The nearly hour long doc covers the entire life of the station, from its (at times) troublesome construction (which took place amongst terrifying unknowns), to its celebratory birth, and finally its destruction 53 years later. There are plenty interviews and old photos throughout, as well as rare clips of film showing people inside the station during its glory days.</p>
