										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="carriewriter0511.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231044432im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/carriewriter0511.jpg" width="365" height="240" class="image-right"> </span>Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231044432/http://the-frenemy.com/post/5366472538/carrie-bradshaw-math">The Frenemy</a>, a very angry young woman writes: &quot;I&#x2019;ve been out of college with a writing degree for almost a year now. <strong>I moved to NYC to pursue writing... but something&#x2019;s been bothering me. Carrie Bradshaw, you gotta be tripping balls to have us believe that you can sustain yourself that extravagantly on that one stupid-ass column. You lying bitch! It&#x2019;s a cruel joke! It hurts my feelings! You dream crushing, bone-crushing bitch.&quot; </strong> Stop trying to pretend that you can live in New York and have this overly successful life based on writing alone.&quot; (How can a pretend person pretend? The mind reels!)</p>

<p>The tirade against the television character continues, and she notes that Carrie (pre-book deal, and pre-making a lot per word at Vogue) probably made about $2,000/month (with an apartment that cost about $1,500/month, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231044432/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/10/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_top_5_worst.php?gallery0Pic=2#gallery">we learned yesterday</a>). Because why not try to prove your point against a fictional person with some fictional figures? In the end, she comes to the conclusion that Carrie is in $3,000,000,000,000 in debt, because &quot;writing pays nothing&quot; and Cosmos are expensive.</p>

<p>In real life, Sarah Jessica Parker has said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231044432/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/sjp_warns_futur.php">the city is pricey</a> but &quot;if you have the constitution and you manage to stick it out, it&apos;s well worth every obstacle and every stumbling block.&quot; Future Carries, do your research before handing over that security deposit.</p>
