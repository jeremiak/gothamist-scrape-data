<p>Don&apos;t let the 90% humidity fool you, it is Autumn. It is time for apple picking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022201/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/autumn_iteam_investigation.php">and radish licking</a>. And wouldn&apos;t it be nice if you could add outdoor movies to your Fall Activity List? Don&apos;t you want to wrap yourself up in a Pendleton blanket with your squash-scented boyfriend, push your feet into the grass, and watch a movie on a big outdoor screen, for free, in the city where anything is possible? </p>

<p>Or maybe nothing is possible and your dreams are dead like the fallen leaves.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022201/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/why_dont_we_have_outdoor_movies_in.php">Despite our pleas</a>, Outdoor Fall Movies are still not a thing, meaning the only chance you have to see a movie outdoors here is in the sweaty summertime, with hoards of others fighting for the same little piece of open lawn. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022201/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/watch_the_bryant_park_movie_lawn_ru.php">Doesn&apos;t this look fun</a>?</p>

<p>Imagine how more enjoyable it would be in September and October, when the thin-skinned are &quot;too cold&quot; to sit outside for 90 minutes. Fall is a magical time, when the outdoor spaces in NYC belong to those who can handle a light breeze. Sidewalk cafes, bar gardens... they&apos;re all yours, person who doesn&apos;t shiver when the temperature hovers around 60-degrees.</p>

<p>We reached out to the Brooklyn Bridge Park and Bryant Park Corporations, to remind them that they&apos;re missing out on this capital idea! These guys put on some of the city&apos;s best free summertime outdoor movie events, why not stretch it out for another month or so? The latter indulged us, and then ripped our autumn leaf encased hearts from our chests: </p><blockquote>&quot;Bryant Park does not offer outdoor films in the fall for a myriad of reasons. Chief of among these is that the lawn must be prepared for The Rink at Bank of America Winter Village.</blockquote>Thanks, Bank of America! They also mentioned something about &quot;cooler temperatures,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022201/http://www.weather.com/weather/monthly/l/USNY0176:1:US">we checked</a>, and the high in September was 93-degrees, and the lowest it will likely drop in October is 58, but for the most part, September temps have been near 80, and October promises to be in the 60s and 70s. Perfect climate for pumpkin spiced popcorn.<p></p>

<p>Now we have to have our annual <em>Love Story</em> viewing indoors, not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022201/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/29/real_rains_gonna_come.php">in the pouring rain</a>, as Hollywood&apos;s dramatic, emotionally manipulative overlords intended.</p>
