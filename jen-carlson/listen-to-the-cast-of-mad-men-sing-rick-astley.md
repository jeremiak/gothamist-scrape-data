<p>The original version of Rick Astley&apos;s 1987 hit song &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; is around 3 minutes and 30 seconds long. The below video is also around that length, which means that even though the creator, Richard Sandling, could have gotten the point across in a shortened version, he did the full thing&#x2014;perfectly and to completion. His efforts have not only given us the cast of <em>Mad Men</em> sing-talking Astley&apos;s song, but it has also given the classic hit a new life, just as inhabitants in the last corners of the earth were finally letting Rick Roll die peacefully.</p>
