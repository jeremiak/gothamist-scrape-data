<p>This potentially dangerous new app allows you to open tabs at local joints, making spending your money that much easier! Because when you pay with a cute little graphic on your iPhone it just feels like Monopoly money, right? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113622/https://squareup.com/cardcase">Card Case</a> allows you to find local places that accept the virtual payment, as well as access up-to-date menus and specials (there are even paperless receipts). Currently in New York you can use the app at Il Laboratorio Del Gelato, Rickshaw Dumplings and Cafe Grumpy (get the full list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113622/https://squareup.com/cardcase#new-york">here</a>). Things could get <em>real</em> ugly if bars start allowing iPhone tabs.
