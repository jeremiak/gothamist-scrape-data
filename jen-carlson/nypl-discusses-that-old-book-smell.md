<p>Mmm... old book smell: is there anything better? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180039/http://www.theworld.org/2010/04/14/the-sweet-smell-of-literature/">Here&apos;s a short piece</a> discussing the odor that iPads and Kindles will never be able to recreate. In it you&apos;ll hear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180039/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypl">the NYPL</a>&apos;s Thomas Lannon and Shelly Smith describe what they smell after sticking their noses in an old book, picking up hints of pockets, the inside of a purse, and onions! The smells differ from book to book, depending on paper quality and how the book has been stored; and the older the book is, the smellier it is (something about VOCs&#x2014;volatile organic compounds&#x2014;given off by paper as it degrades). </p>
