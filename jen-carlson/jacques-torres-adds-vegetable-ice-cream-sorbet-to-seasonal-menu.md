<p>Jacques Torres has brought out their summer ice cream offerings, and yesterday we got to sample the seasonal flavors, which include: Carrot &amp; Celery, Sweet Corn, and Port Wine ice creams, and a Cucumber Mint sorbet. While we all anticipated devouring the Sweet Corn flavor, Gothamist staffers came out with an unexpected favorite: the Cucumber Mint!</p>

<p>The <strong>Cucumber Mint</strong> sorbet (which is made with the whole cucumber, skin and seeds included) was a crowd pleaser, with one staffer suggesting we save some for a vodka-spiked slushee drink, and another declaring it to be &quot;super refreshing&quot; with a &quot;nice honeydew thing going for it.&quot; The <strong>Port Wine</strong> ice cream (made with real port from Kobrand) was unexpectedly good, as well... especially when mixed with the shop&apos;s famous Wicked flavor, which has a hint of gingerbread to it. Remember: don&apos;t ever be afraid to swirl around different flavors to make ice cream soup.</p>

<p>When asked about the <strong>Sweet Corn</strong> flavor, however, staffer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408214208/http://www.twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a> told us, the &quot;corn was too dead-on corn. When I eat corn ice cream, I want to be <em>reminded</em> of eating corn on the cob, not transported via time machine to a picnic table in 1990 with kernels in my mouth.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408214208/http://www.twitter.com/jenchung">Jen Chung</a> agrees, declaring the &quot;flavors were too close to what the vegetable actually was.  I think I would prefer like a vanilla with a sweet corn swirl, instead of full-on sweet corn.&quot; The <strong>Carrot Celery</strong> had similar but less harsh reviews, with Garth Johnston telling us, &quot;I&apos;m just not to into eating a mirepoix ice cream.&quot; (Yeah, we had to Google &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408214208/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix_(cuisine)">mirepoix</a>&quot; too.) However, we think if you paired one of these with cookies for an ice cream sandwich, it would cut the flavors nicely.</p>
