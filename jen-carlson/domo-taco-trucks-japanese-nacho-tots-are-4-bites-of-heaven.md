<p>Today we finally got a chance to try out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122129/http://www.domotaco.com/">Domo Taco</a>&apos;s Japanase Nacho Tots (just $4 for the portion pictured here). The tots (which Gothamist&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122129/http://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a> refers to as &quot;lonely bachelor food&quot;) are covered with nacho cheese, pico de gallo, okinomi sauce, Japanese mayo, nori and shaved bonito. </p>

<p>The flavors all mix together so well that none of the toppings really overpower the other, but the mayo definitely hits the tastebuds the most. And somehow under all of that, the tots manage to maintain a high crunch factor. Magnifique! </p>

<p>For something more substantial, the truck&#x2014;which serves a variety of $3 tacos and $8 taco bowls&#x2014;has a new item amongst their regular offerings, the kimchi falafel taco bowl. For $8, you get a hearty and fresh portion of four big, perfect falafels nestled on a bed of fluffy rice, asian black beans, edamame guacamole, pico de gallo, salsa verde, crema and pickled ginger. </p>
