<p>The 1970s were one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315031510/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/20_minutes_in_1970s_nyc.php#photo-1">NYC&apos;s toughest decades</a>&#x2014;and in the background of all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315031510/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/the_1970s_pamphlet_aimed_at_keeping.php">the crime</a>, the NYPD corruption, and the urban decay, was a growing graffiti scene. </p>

<p>In the below 25 minute mini-doc, created for British Television in 1976, you&apos;ll meet some of the young kids who tagged the city (and its subways, statues, monuments) with markers and spraypaint back then. Not all young people were looking to spread their name around, however&#x2014;one tells the BBC, &quot;I think it&apos;s really foolishness.. people have nothing better to do, so they go write on the walls. They should take them home. Write on your walls at home. It makes the city look very stupid.&quot;</p>

<p>Bonus: Great captures of 1970s Central Park&#x2014;which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315031510/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/1970s_central_park.php">flooded with music and joints back</a> then.</p>
