<p>Two people you don&apos;t personally know may have shared a kiss at a club in New York City on Monday night, and you&apos;re only finding out <em>now</em>. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144909/http://www.wpix.com/entertainment/sns-la-et-mg-chris-brown-rhanna-make-out-nyc,0,4847730.story">to reports</a>, Rihanna showed up at Griffin in the Meatpacking District shortly after Chris Brown&#x2014;one source says, &quot;She knew he was there.&quot; This is where the conflicting reports start coming in... one source says that Brown took his shirt off, while another says Rihanna pulled it off of him as the two &quot;began to kiss and dance closely.&quot;</p>

<p>Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144909/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/chris-ri-party-hot-rival-mad-em-article-1.1173239?localLinksEnabled=false">the Daily News</a>, the rag makes a not-so-classy nod to that time Brown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144909/http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/24/rihanna-photos-brutal-beating-chris-brown-attack-police-attack/">brutally abused Rihanna</a>, noting they may be &quot;headed for round two,&quot; and getting back together. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brown&apos;s girlfriend, model Karrueche Tran, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144909/https://twitter.com/karrueche">cryptically Tweeted</a> on Tuesday, &quot;There&apos;s a difference between a man and a boy. I prefer men.&quot; WHAT DOES IT MEAN? We turned to our own source, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144909/http://www.twitter.com/johndelsignore">John Del Signore</a>, for some insight. Del Signore stood near Rihanna at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144909/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/28/photos_inside_barclays_4040_club_wi.php#photo-2">the Barclays Center opening</a> last week (only separated by photographers, a velvet rope, and some bodyguards), and tells us, &quot;She seemed to be floating in a vague but alluring limbo between emaciated and ethereal.&quot; And you know what THAT means!</p>
