<p>A cottage is no longer a very familiar sight in NYC, but there are still some scattered around town, and a fair number of them can be found in South Brooklyn. Walk down Concord Street in Downtown Brooklyn (though some call this area Bridge Plaza), and you&apos;ll spot one with cherry red shutters and a white picket fence. To really pull you out of modern day reality there&apos;s even a 1970s electric car sitting in front. Nothing about this scene feels familiar. It looks like where a reclusive grandma would live in a Tim Burton movie&#x2014;a run down version of a previously picturesque dream.</p>

It almost feels like an art project or movie set, with its almost cartoonish rickety fence, warped roof, surreal vehicle, and bold accent color. </p>

<p>According to one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153845/http://www.realdirect.com/e/167.CONCORD-STREET.11201/">real estate site</a>, it was built in 1901, though that&apos;s up for debate&#x2014;Kevin Walsh of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153845/http://forgotten-ny.com/2007/04/albee-square-brooklyn/">ForgottenNY</a> placed the home&apos;s origins closer to 1762. Our digs through the Brooklyn Public Library and NYPL photo archives came up short on old information and photos, but here&apos;s a NYC Tax Photo from the 1980s, showing a more stripped down version of the home: </p>

<p>In 2014, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153845/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2014/12/10/home-sweet-home-concord-street-cutie-shutterbugs-favorite">The Brooklyn Eagle</a> talked to the owner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153845/http://www.brooklynartscouncil.org/artists/1128">Frank Didik</a>, but he didn&apos;t share the history of his home, which he purchased for $30K in 1985. He did note that the neighborhood &quot;was safer than the East Village,&quot; at that time, &quot;and much safer than Williamsburg.&quot; And the unusual electric car (which he said people can&apos;t even figure out how to steal) has been sitting there for decades as well&#x2014;he invented it. It&apos;s called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153845/http://www.didik.com/didik_ct.htm">the Didik Long Ranger</a> and was &quot;created from a modified <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153845/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citicar">CitiCar/Commutacar</a> of the 1970s... updated and capable of carrying 3 adults at speeds of up to 53 miles per hour.&quot;</p>
