title: New Years Eve: Send out '04 Below 14th
---

<p>Gothamist doesn&apos;t really like New Years Eve, it&apos;s overhyped and too expensive. So short of suggesting you just stay at home here&apos;s a little list of things you could do to ring in &apos;05. </p>

<p>We love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617113326/http://www.tonicnyc.com/index.cfm?&amp;sk=BD6A5FB1%2DD386%2D4373%2D8B78%2D1B2B34901821&amp;&amp;idPage=39&amp;idEvent=4881&amp;dStartDate=12_31_2004">Marc Ribot</a> and he&apos;ll be playing at Tonic as the ball drops.</p>

<p>There are still tickets left for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617113326/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1D00394EF20495A2?brand=&amp;artistid=773505&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1">Wilco, Flaming Lips and Sleater-Kinney</a> at MSG [we know, not below 14th]. As well as for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617113326/http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=nyc&amp;query=detail&amp;event=557175">Patti Smith</a> at Bowery.</p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s choice: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617113326/http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=nyc&amp;query=detail&amp;event=563036">Asobi Seksu, Other Passengers, The Winter Pageant, Levy, Stylofone, Autodrone</a> at Mercury Lounge. </p>

<p>For the glitter and white powder head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617113326/http://www.motherfuckernyc.com/index1.html">Motherfucker New Years Eve Ball 2005</a> with the Bravery (who play at 3am). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617113326/http://www.motherfuckernyc.com/invite.html">Print this out</a> for reduced admission, although you may want to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617113326/http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=nyc&amp;query=search&amp;category=misc&amp;search=motherfucker&amp;searchregion=nyc&amp;beginmonth=12&amp;beginday=12&amp;beginyear=2004&amp;endmonth=12&amp;endday=3&amp;endyear=2005&amp;sortorder=1">buy tickets in advance</a>.
