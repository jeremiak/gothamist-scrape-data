<p>Seth Meyers usually takes his parodies a bit further, stretching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503160921/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/14/seth_meyers_goes_full_sorkin_in_4-m.php">up to 4-minutes</a>, but he kept things simple with this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503160921/http://laist.com/tags/makingamurderer"><em>Making A Murderer</em></a> one. Perhaps it&apos;s just too difficult to LOL at a flawed judiciary system, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503160921/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kratz#Sexting_scandal">a DA</a> that sexts domestic abuse victims, and the corrupt police department of Manitowoc County. </p>

<p>Anyway, Meyers and a voice on the other end of the phone seem to be playing the role of Brendan Dassey and his mom Barb... or anyone on the show we&apos;ve heard via a recorded call, really.</p>

<p><em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em> had been on break for two weeks, but returned last night with this cold open... ya know?</p>
