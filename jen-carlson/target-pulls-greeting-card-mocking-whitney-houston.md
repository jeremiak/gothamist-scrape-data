<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="whitneycardtarget.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301034533im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/whitneycardtarget.jpeg" width="640" height="451" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Prior to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301034533/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/11/whitney_houston_has_died_at_age_48.php">Whitney Houston&apos;s death</a>, Target had a greeting card on their shelves that read: &quot;Next time you think of dating the bad boy, consider Whitney Houston. That&apos;s all I&apos;m going to say.&quot; <em>(Who even sends cards like this?)</em> The product remained on their shelves following the singer&apos;s death on February 11th, but according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301034533/http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/29/whitney-houston-greeting-card-target/">to TMZ</a>, they&apos;ve now pulled it. </p>

<p>A rep told the site, &quot;The card was in our stores prior to Ms. Houston&#x2019;s death. As soon as this was brought to our attention, we began the process of removing the card from all applicable stores.&quot; But was it <em>ever</em> really in good taste to sell a product referencing rumors of domestic abuse?</p>

<p>When it comes to Whitney products, let&apos;s keep it light&#x2014;like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301034533/http://www.etsy.com/listing/93332736/whitney-houston-and-michael-jackson?ref=sr_gallery_6&amp;sref=&amp;ga_search_submit=&amp;ga_search_query=whitney+houston&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_page=2&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_facet=">this Etsy seller</a> hawking drawings of the singer sitting atop a cloud in Heaven with Michael Jackson. You know, for example.</p>
