										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="rogerclarkbarneys1010.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071318im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/rogerclarkbarneys1010.jpg" width="300" height="273"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Get Roger Clark&apos;s look at Barney&apos;s!</span></i></div> Barneys Co-op has officially opened its doors in Brooklyn (and there&apos;s probably nothing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071318/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/park_slope_food_coop_vs_barneys_co-.php">Park Slope Food Coop</a> can do about it). NY1&apos;s Roger Clark was reporting from there earlier this morning, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071318/http://twitter.com/#!/patkiernan/status/27337999404">Pat Kiernan</a> Tweeted this photo of his co-worker after being done up by Barney&apos;s Creative Director Simon Doonan.  (Sadly, they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071318/http://twitter.com/#!/RogerClark41/status/27334032424">didn&apos;t let him keep the clothes</a>.)<p></p>

<p>Clark says there&apos;s &quot;definitely a trend&quot; of Manhattan stores headed to the borough, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071318/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/crossing_atlantic_fBMvlV51ogEYp0TE3EEGYK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> is wondering if this means Atlantic Avenue could become the next Fashion Avenue (the presence of the store may very well draw in more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071318/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/high_end_brooklyn.php">high end stores</a>).</p>

<p>One local told the paper, <strong>&quot;All of Atlantic Avenue used to be Middle Eastern restaurants. There didn&apos;t used to be so many fun, interesting things around.&quot;</strong> And Doonan says, &quot;The Co-op has always had a certain edgy sensibility. The fit with Brooklyn is a natural one.&quot; Not everyone is so excited, however&#x2014;one Brooklyn College student says he &quot;can&apos;t afford to even look&quot; at Barneys... but Doonan promises it won&apos;t make the neighborhood pretentious, saying, <strong>&quot;It&apos;s not like we&apos;re opening a Chanel.&quot;</strong>  Racked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071318/http://ny.racked.com/archives/2010/10/14/babies_and_simon_doonan_open_barneys_coop_on_atlantic_avenue.php&quot;">has more photographs</a>.</p>
