<p><img alt="0807concorde.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022640im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0807concorde.jpg" width="350" height="230" class="right">The supersonic Concorde jet that spent 30 years flying fiercely through the skies went unharmed <em>until</em> retiring in Brooklyn, where the president of the foundation that operates the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, Bill White, was charged with overseeing its care. After just two years in the borough, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022640/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/nyregion/07concorde.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports it got it&apos;s signature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022640/http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0052.shtml">needle-shaped nose</a> taken off by a truck.</p><blockquote>A Concorde that is owned by a British airline, was hit by a truck that was hauling equipment from a Jamaican music and soccer festival. The truck clipped the distinctive nose cone off the parked Anglo-French jet about 3 a.m. last Monday, prompting an impassioned uproar among the jet&#x2019;s band of enthusiasts.</blockquote>The nose, of course, is the most physically dominant part of the jet, and is what makes it distinctive from others; The Times notes that it can be lowered to 12.5 degrees to help with takeoffs and landings. Concorde fans have united and blamed New York for the carelessness; when the jet had to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022640/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/07/intrepid_sticki.php">leave the Intrepid</a>, White <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022640/http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:bKUJixChvTwJ:www.intrepidmuseum.org/content/pdf/ConcordePressRelease__6_1_5040.pdf+concorde+brooklyn+nose&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=us">housed it at Aviator Sports</a> at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn for $15K/month. <p></p>

<p>Whether it was carelessness or accidental, the big question now is: who will pay for the pricey nose job? The replacement part will have to come <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022640/http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/today/2004-04-15-sky_x.htm">from a collector</a>, and White says the Aviator Sports insurance policy will have to cover it (the complex doesn&apos;t seem to be certain about that). One thing <em>is</em> for certain, British Airways has laid down the law and wants the jet be fixed and returned to the pier by year&apos;s end -- a trip that will cost around $250K. Is the Intrepid, and everything it touches, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022640/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/06/the_intrepid_is.php">cursed</a>?
