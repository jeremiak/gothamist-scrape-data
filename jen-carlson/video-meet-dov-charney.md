										<p>Okay, so this isn&apos;t <em>the real</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519214952/http://gothamist.com/tags/dovcharney">Dov Charney</a>, but we&apos;re going to assume it&apos;s pretty close. The parody was written and directed by UCB&apos;s Todd Bieber&#x2014;be sure to watch the whole video for whispered lexical gems like, &quot;I want you to know that you can trust me, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>P.S. American Apparel really does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519214952/http://store.americanapparel.net/sharpief.html">sell Sharpies</a>. <em>Sexy</em> Sharpies that they call &quot;the Tom Selleck of fine point markers.&quot;</p>
