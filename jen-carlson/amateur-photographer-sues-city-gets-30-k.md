<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpZSmphZPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201821im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpZSmphZPM.jpg" width="313" height="161" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201821/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/16/mta_worker.php">About a year ago</a>, off-duty MTA worker Robert Taylor was handcuffed and locked in a holding cell after photographing an incoming train at the Freeman Street station in the Bronx. An officer allegedly told him photography isn&apos;t allowed, even though what he was doing was perfectly legal (MTA rules read, &quot;Photography, filming or video recording in any facility or conveyance is permitted&quot;). He refused to delete the photos he took, and was consequently charged with unauthorized photography, unreasonable voice/disorderly conduct and impeding traffic. </p>

<p>Robert says &quot;I wasn&apos;t being a jerk, but I was standing firm. I didn&apos;t curse at them or anything. I just said &apos;Well these are what the rules say.&apos; If anything he was being unreasonable to me. He put his hands on me and he shoves me.&quot; On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201821/mailto:http://www.subchat.com/read.asp?Id=897363">SubChat</a> this week he posted a note stating, &quot;sometimes you have to stand your ground, and if you don&apos;t, it opens up the doors for them to do whatever they want to you.&quot;</p>

<p>The summonses were dismissed and the NYPD eventually admitted their error, but Robert decided to hire a lawyer and sue the city. This resulted in a settlement which got him (and cost taxpayers) $30,000. Robert told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201821/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/investigative/100209-shutterbug-fights-nyc-subway-ticket">Fox 5 News</a>, &quot;It would be nice if it came out of those cops&apos; paychecks; it&apos;s unfortunate the taxpayer has to pay for cops who can&apos;t follow rules or comprehend rules. It&apos;s unfortunate the taxpayer has to suffer.&quot; If you think the NYPD has learned their lesson from this settlement, take into account that Robert&apos;s incident happened right after they settled another similar case for $31,000! (And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201821/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/19/arun_wilta_subway_project_1.php">another one for $15,000</a>.)</p>

<p>Perhaps they should reissue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201821/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/nypd_get_lesson_in_photography.php">that memo</a>... or put up signs underground stating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201821/http://www.stationstops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/nypd_photography_mta_operations_order.jpg">the rules of photography</a>. Interestingly enough, when Fox 5 was filming their story with Robert in the subway system, a transit cop came over and put his hand on the camera lens saying photography and video weren&apos;t permitted!</p>
