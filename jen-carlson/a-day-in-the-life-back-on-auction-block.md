<p>Earlier today Sotheby&apos;s announced they&apos;ll be putting the handwritten lyrics for the Beatles &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; on the auction block. Penned by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140656/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140656/http://www.1010wins.com/Sotheby-s-to-Auction-Off-Handwritten-Lennon-Lyrics/6927257">1010Wins</a> reports &quot;the double-sided sheet of paper features Lennon&apos;s edits and corrections in his own hand&#x2014;in black felt marker and blue ball point pen, with a few annotations in red ink.&quot; The lyrics include the line: &quot;I&apos;d love to turn you on,&quot; which got it banned by the BBC when it was released in 1967 because it was deemed a drug reference.</p>

<p>The valuable piece of papyrus will be up for grabs in New York on June 18th, and is expected to take in anywhere from $500-700K. However, in 2006 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140656/http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=USA&amp;screen=ashotheard">Bonhams</a> in New York held a sealed-bid auction for the lyrics but they didn&#x2019;t sell.</p>
