<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820192545/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/jngw2/pre911_ad_is_strangely_predictive/">Reddit users</a> have dug up what some believe is a pre-9/11 ad for osteoarthritis. It shows fragile bones inside of the Twin Towers, with a plane aimed at them. The ad copy reads: &quot;Everyone thinks that their joints are safe and strong until one day osteoarthritis collapses them.&quot; (With the word &quot;osteoarthritis&quot; written across the body of the plane.)</p>

<p>The ad appears to be real, but it&apos;s unclear when it came out. One Reddit poster notes, &quot;I remember seeing that a year or two after 9/11, checking the release date, then re-checking the release date again because it was so close to what happened I couldn&apos;t believe it came out about half a year prior. Maybe they discovered time travel and tried to warn us. It&apos;s the only logical explanation, clearly!&quot; However, other posters believe it came out after 9/11, one noting, that it&apos;s &quot;from India, and is very likely post 9/11.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe the ad team got the idea from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820192545/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/06/cookie_monster_meets_the_wtc.php">Cookie Monster</a>?
