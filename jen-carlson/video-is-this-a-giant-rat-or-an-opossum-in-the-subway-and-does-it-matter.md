<p>Disturbing footage of what what some believe is a giant mutant rat, like the ones we&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120315114116/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/brooklyn_man_stabs_giant_rat_with_p.php">in Brooklyn</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120315114116/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/giant_rat.php">the Bronx</a>, has popped up on YouTube. We&apos;ve contacted the uploader of the video (who compares the size of the rat to that of a cat) to find out more details and a location, but we don&apos;t believe this is a sign that our giant rat overlords are here. Rather, it&apos;s a sign that our giant opossum overlords are here. Because this is an opossum, right? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120315114116/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/and_heres_a_photo_of_an_opossum_rid.php">They love the subway</a>!</p>

<p>Either way, let this also serve as a reminder to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120315114116/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/14/mta_chief_go_ahead_stuff_your_faces.php">not eat in the subway system</a>.</p>
