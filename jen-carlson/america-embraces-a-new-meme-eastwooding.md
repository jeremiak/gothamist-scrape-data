And with that, he bestowed upon the nation the next great meme: Eastwooding. Like planking and Horsemaning before it, it&apos;s sure to be short-lived, so let&apos;s oversaturate the internet with it before the window closes. <p></p>

<p>Almost immediately after his speech, new Twitter accounts were born (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601153351/https://twitter.com/clintschair">Clint&apos;s Empty Chair</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601153351/https://twitter.com/invisibleobama">InvisibleObama</a>), and people started uploading their own photos featuring empty chairs with the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601153351/https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23eastwooding&amp;src=hash">#Eastwooding</a>. But we can do better, America... by 1 a.m. Buzzfeed, the king of culling the internet for this kind of thing, only had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601153351/http://www.buzzfeed.com/scott/eastwooding?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=buzzfeed">ten photos</a>, and (not to be an alarmist) <em>none of them were animated GIFS.</em> So, keep Eastwooding, nation... even the President himself has acknowledged the trend:</p>
