<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="php23KTvoAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190542im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php23KTvoAM.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Remember when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190542/http://gothamist.com/2005/03/23/museum_shows_for_banksy.php">in 2005</a>, Banksy snuck in to museums and illegally hung his own work (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190542/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkUbYBo5xgs">video!</a>)? Well, another artist has just done the same, catching up four years later&#x2014;but at least he hit a different museum: the Guggenheim (Banksy got the Met, MoMA, the Brooklyn Museum, and American Museum of Natural History). </p>

<p>Over the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190542/http://www.matbenote.com/">Mat Benote</a> walked in during normal business hours and hung one of his own pieces on the famous walls, something the artist describes as &quot;Fine Art Graffiti.&quot; He stated: <strong>&#x201C;I want to illustrate that graffiti can be a positive influence in a community when applied properly, and as an art form, has as much right to be displayed in a museum as any other form of art.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the Guggenheim to find out what happened to the work, and will update once we hear back. In the meantime, what say thee: vandalism or art?</p>
