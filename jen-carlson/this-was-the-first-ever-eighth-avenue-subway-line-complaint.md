<p>On September 10th, 1932 crowds gathered underground for the opening of the Independent Subway System (IND) along 8th Avenue in Manhattan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712161648/http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/09/10/100849529.html?zoom=16">The NY Times</a> reported on the opening, which occurred at 12:01 a.m. that morning, noting that there was no opening ceremony, but many turned up to ride the new trains. &quot;The public&apos;s nickels began dropping into the turnstiles of the 28 stations along the 12 mile route between Chambers Street and 207th Street,&quot; they wrote, &quot;with thousands of riders crowding into the commodious trains.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712161648/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/eighth-avenue-subway-opens-1932-article-1.2352197">The Daily News</a> was also there, reporting back that, &quot;Nobody got excited. There was neither cheering nor jeering. Trains ran precisely on schedule.&quot; But there was at least one complaint, which the Times called the &quot;first&quot; on the line. </p>

<p>This first complaint was registered at Chambers Street, where one &quot;indignant passenger declared he had to put two nickels in the turnstile before he could board a train. He argued for several minutes with the station agent, declared that it was &apos;a rotten subway&apos; and then made a mad dash for the train platform.&quot;</p>

<p>Others were unenthused about the new trains&#x2014;&#x201C;Shucks, it&#x2019;s just another subway!&#x201D; declared Robert F. Sisk. &#x201C;As subways go,&quot; Harry Keller told the News, &#x201C;it is fair to middling. You&#x2019;d think though, that on the opening day they&#x2019;d give away free lunch, orchids, cigars or toys for the kiddies.&#x201D; Since then, expectations have been managed to <em>way below</em> orchids.</p>
