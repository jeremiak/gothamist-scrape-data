<p>Kanye&apos;s getting a lot of publicity out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072747/http://laist.com/2016/06/25/kanye_famous_video.php">his latest music video</a>, a controversial piece paired with his equally controversial song &quot;Famous.&quot; The video features the naked bodies of twelve celebrities&#x2014;Kim, Kanye, Caitlyn Jenner, Amber Rose, Ray J, Chris Brown, Rihanna, Donald Trump, George Bush, Bill Cosby, Anna Wintour, and Taylor Swift&#x2014;all asleep in a giant bed together. Kanye won&apos;t say which, if any, are real, but they appear to be very lifelike wax figures. The scene was pulled from Sleepy Hollow, New York artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072747/http://www.vincent-desiderio.com/">Vincent Desiderio</a>&#x2019;s painting, titled &#x201C;Sleep,&quot; and he didn&apos;t find out about it until right before last week&apos;s video release.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072747/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/arts/music/kanye-west-vincent-desiderio-famous-sleep.html?_r=0">The NY Times</a> spoke the 60-year-old Desiderio, who misheard &quot;Kanye West&quot; for &quot;Conde Nast,&quot; when the call came in. That call was an invite from Kanye to come out to Los Angeles, where he met Kanye and his team for a personal screening of the video his work inspired&#x2014;&quot;I was almost in tears... we just hugged each other,&quot; he told the Times. Desiderio was not offered any money, but he says he would not have accepted it anyway.</p>

<p>He goes on to explain that &quot;Kanye saw things in [my painting] that I don&#x2019;t know how he could&#x2019;ve seen. Kanye is truly an artist... the way I understand him now is that he&#x2019;s much more like Andy Warhol... he&#x2019;s like an exploded internet version of Warhol... He&#x2019;s mirroring the times. His whole life is performance art.&quot; </p>

<p>When asked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072747/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/lena_dunham_kanye_west_taylor_swift_reaction.php">Lena Dunham&apos;s criticism</a> of the video, he disagreed with her, declaring: &quot;Art goes to dangerous places. It&#x2019;s like saying, &apos;Hitchcock, that guy must&#x2019;ve really loved killing women.&apos;&quot; Where Dunham saw &quot;the prone, unconscious, waxy bodies of famous women, twisted like they&apos;ve been drugged and chucked aside at a rager...&quot; Desiderio saw them as &quot;sleeping and vulnerable, like babies.&quot; </p>

<p>Dunham&apos;s reaction was likely rooted in the fact that her friend Taylor Swift is one of the bodies in the bed, and the song features these lyrics that Swift has publicly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072747/http://laist.com/2016/02/16/taylor_swift_grammys_speech.php">taken issue with</a>: &quot;I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex... I made that bitch famous.&quot; Just prior to the release of the video, a rep for Swift <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072747/http://www.gq.com/story/kim-kardashian-west-gq-cover-story">told GQ</a>, &quot;Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West and Kim Kardashian will not just leave her alone.&quot;</p>

<p>The video is only available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072747/https://famous.tidal.com/">on Tidal</a>, which you need to sign up (and pay) for.</p>
