<p>It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140447/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/23/foliage.php">a few weeks</a> since we&apos;ve checked in on the foliage situation, and after seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140447/http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/10/09/travel/escapes/20091009-foliage-slideshow_index.html">these hidden patches of color</a> at the NY Times, we got a little worried we might be missing out on the changes. So, we turned to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140447/http://www.bbg.org/">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a> horticulturists, who gave us these helpful tips if you can&apos;t make it out of town this season:</p>

<ul><li>The foliage is just starting to turn at BBG. In the Native Flora Garden, early-turning trees like the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) as well as the black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) are showing their first flush of vibrant color.
</li><li>There will be a lot of color in two or three weeks. The deep red hue of the sorrel tree (Oxydendrum arboreum) will be spectacular. Another visitor favorite is the rusty red of the euonymus shrub (Euonymus alatus &apos;Compactus&apos;) lining Magnolia Plaza. And outside my office window, the birches are turning a beautiful golden yellow.
</li><li>In a few weeks, the scarlet oaks will be blazing on Cherry Esplanade.  There are so many stunning areas in the Garden this time of year.  However, my favorite place will indeed be the Native Flora Garden, because exploring it feels like a walk in the woods.
 </li><li>I would also recommend the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, where the Japanese maples and many other plants create a veritable carnival of color.</li></ul>
Where&apos;s your favorite place in the city to peep the leaves?
