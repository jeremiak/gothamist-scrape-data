The ASPCA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227185727/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/aspca_offers_shamrock_horses_help.php">continues</a> to offer to place their remaining horses in homes; in a press release sent out yesterday, the organization stated: &#x201C;On June 7, Shamrock Stables in Manhattan officially closes and the fate of the New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227185727/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">carriage horses</a> remains in the balance. [We] reaffirm our offer and commitment to finding suitable homes for these horses.  Our primary concern is their welfare, and we stand ready to work with the City and other organizations that share our purpose to place these horses in environments where they will receive humane treatment.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The stable owners have insisted their intention is to stay in business, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227185727/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/at-long-last-stables-are-empty/">the NY Times</a> reports that they left behind bales of hay, and old trunk filled with horseshoes, and other odds and ends when they moved out of their West 45th Street home.</p>
