It&apos;ll air on Bravo in June, and is titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145155/http://www.bravotv.com/work-of-art"><em>Work of Art: The Next Great Artist</em></a>... because obviously it&apos;s through reality television that we&apos;ll find the next <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145155/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/13/kandinsky.php">Kandinsky</a> and Parker is an expert on art because she dated &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145155/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZB25FHkeTg">artist Aleksandr Pertrovsky</a>&quot; in season six of SATC? </p>

<p>Anyway, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145155/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/16/33_16_tt_brooklyn_museum_reality.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the winner will get $100K <em>and</em> a solo show at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145155/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynmuseum">Brooklyn Museum</a>&#x2014;but the cash-strapped institution isn&apos;t even getting paid to give up their wall space, says a spokeswoman there.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145155/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/04/sarah_jessica_parker_has_highb.html">NYMag</a>, when asked how they convinced the museum &quot;to go along with what&apos;s clearly considered to be a shenanigan,&quot; a judge on the show (and <em>New York</em> art critic) said, &#x201C;We just asked them. We didn&#x2019;t twist any arms and we didn&#x2019;t pay anyone off. Who knew it was that easy? You should all be asking for shows.&#x201D;</p>
