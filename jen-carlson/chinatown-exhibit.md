This weekend, while you are nursing your Cinco de Mayo hangover, why not check out some art? We totally hear it works just as good as any hangover pill. 

</p><p>An exhibit all about Chintown opens on May 6th, accurately called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141357/http://photographicnyc.com/agarn/garnmain.html">Chinatown (New York)</a>. Photographer Andrew Garn brings us a new view of the area by focusing in on the neighborhoods iconography. Bhudddas, sweat shops, garish neon lights hanging over the streets...it&apos;s all there. His tranparancies are mounted on to red laquered light boxes (red is the color of wealth!) - becoming an object of the culture, not just an outside view. <br>
