</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153717/http://gothamist.com/tags/trustocorp">TrustoCorp</a> is back with some new signage. Last we checked they were advising not to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153717/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/11/psa_dont_feed_the_hipsters.php">Feed the Hipsters</a>, and now they&apos;re sprinkling Brooklyn with some positive messages, for example: things get better, everything is fine, and most importantly the End of Days has been postponed! (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153717/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/24/saturday_rapture_was_invisible_judg.php">Which we knew</a>.) There is one bit of bad news, however, one sign announces the start of pigeon season, noting: &quot;Due to the recession, pigeons in this area have been re-zoned for consumption.&#x201D; Let us know if you spot any others around town... or if you have a good recipe for pigeon casserole.
