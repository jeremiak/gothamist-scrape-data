<span class="photo_caption">There&apos;s so much happening in this video, it&apos;s like a treasure hunt&#x2014;did you see the noodles?!</span></p>

<p>The Age of Aquarius is back! And you can get there if you&apos;re willing to wait on the G train. Over the weekend two people on their way to dinner boarded the subway at 21st Street and Nassau only to stumble upon this &quot;carnival of well-wishers&quot; donning &quot;feathers, hats and parasols.&quot; The group tried to recruit them, giving them the hard sell: &quot;We&apos;re gonna go to different places and there&apos;s performances... we&apos;re gonna act crazy.&quot; There is a <em>Hair</em> revival on Broadway right now and this is viral marketing for that, right?</p>
