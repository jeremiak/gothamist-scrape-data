<p>Martha Stewart always seemed like a pretty fun lady&#x2014;just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160717012015/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/16/video_martha_stewarts_visits_willia.php">watch this video</a> of her getting drunk in Williamsbug with some locals. Plus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160717012015/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/25/hipsters_say_martha_stewarts_jail_s.php">she knows about crafts</a> and good food and can make anything beautiful and perfect just by glancing at it. As if all of that wasn&apos;t enough, my dad was her plumber for a while (really) and always said she was very nice! So don&apos;t expect her Match.com profile to be up for long. That&apos;s right, Martha is on the market, and she&apos;s testing out this whole online dating thing.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160717012015/http://www.today.com/news/its-really-me-martha-stewart-unveils-her-match-com-profile-6C9676200">told Matt Lauer</a> this week that she is getting serious about looking for love. But what exactly is she looking for in a man?</p>

<blockquote>&quot;So while I&#x2019;m open to all kinds of people, and love to be surprised, here&#x2019;s what I know I appreciate in a man: Someone who&#x2019;s intelligent, established, and curious; and who relishes adventure and new experiences as much as I do. Someone who can teach me new things. A lover of animals, grandchildren, and the outdoors. Young at heart.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>While her profile lists her as being in New York, she notes, &quot;I travel frequently, so geography is but a detail.&quot; She had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160717012015/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/martha_you_ve_got_male_hZRBsoJlWw5MRezQtl9NoL">1,000 suitors in just hours</a> of going public with the profile, but is this all just extra publicity for her new book... which she plugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160717012015/http://www.match.com/profile/showprofile.aspx?lid=1000005&amp;TP=U&amp;Handle=TheGoodLongLife">in her profile</a> (&quot;After recently writing and publishing my new book, &apos;Living the Good Long Life&apos; I was reminded how central good relationships are to happiness and longevity&quot;)?</p>
