										<p>The all new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143746/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters"><em>Ghostbusters</em></a> has an all new trailer, the second one to be released. The Paul Feig-directed movie comes out July 15th, and stars Melissa McCarthy (Abby, a paranormal expert), Kristen Wiig (Erin, a particle physicist), Kate McKinnon (Jillian, a nuclear engineer), and Leslie Jones (Patty, NYC expert!). </p>

<p>The trailer has been released officially on Facebook and Twitter, but not YouTube yet (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143746/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/ghostbusters_3_trailer.php">the first trailer</a> was one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143746/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-is-disliked-movie-trailer-889114">most disliked videos in YouTube history</a>&#x2014;<em>ahem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143746/http://www.salon.com/2015/09/24/paul_feig_slams_sexist_ghostbusters_trolls_you_sht_on_all_your_former_heroes/">sexists trolls</a></em>&#x2014;though that&apos;s probably unrelated to this roll-out decision). Click play and get a good look at the new &apos;Busters, Slimer, Stay Puft, and Chris Hemsworth...</p>

<p>The trailer has now shown up on a few YouTube accounts: </p>
