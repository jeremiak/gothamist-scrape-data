Yep, while you were all enjoying your Pool Parties there was a hidden world underneath the concrete&#x2014;most notably, a tunnel system starting under the main arch. The LTV Squad was kind enough to let us use some of their photos, but be sure to check out their massive catalog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144509/http://ltvsquad.com/Blog/">here</a>&#x2014;and below is some video of what it&apos;s like in those underground tunnels.</p>
