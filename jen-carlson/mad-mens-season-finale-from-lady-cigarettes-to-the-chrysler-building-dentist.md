<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> ended the season with more a whimper than a bang... albeit, a gorgeously-shot bang with a lot left bubbling under the surface until the next (and final) season. Here are some historical points that were placed throughout the finale (including some spoilers!):</p>

<p><strong>ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2madmen0612finale.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2madmen0612finale.jpeg" width="640" height="451" class="image-none"> </span><br>
Alexis Bledel&apos;s character Beth Dawes is in the bell jar and her husband sends her to get electroshock therapy. By 1967 (it&apos;s March 1967 in this final episode) the use of this type of therapy was was on the decline, and had been since the 1950s (antidepressants, however, were on the incline). In the early &apos;90s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/02/us/health-the-quiet-comeback-of-electroshock-therapy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">The NY Times</a> sort of blamed Hollywood for putting the fear in people regarding the method: &quot;For Big Nurse in <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest</em>, it was a tool of terror, and, in the public mind, shock therapy has retained the tarnished image given it by Ken Kesey&apos;s novel: dangerous, inhumane and overused.&quot; Do you think Beth was at Bellevue, or the psych ward that Marilyn Monroe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/marilyn_monroes_time_at_payne_whitn.php#photo-1">went to in the 1960s</a>, at Payne Whitney Hospital?</p>

<p><strong>&quot;LADY CIGARETTE&quot;</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="vslims095.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/vslims095.jpeg" width="640" height="698" class="image-none"> </span><br>
Peggy&apos;s at her new job, and is given the new product from Philip Morris: &quot;a top secret ladies&apos; cigarette.&quot; She&apos;s given an unmarked white carton of cigarettes and told to, &quot;Smoke it, name it, sell it.&quot; These will eventually become Virginia Slims.</p>

<p><strong>DON AT THE DENTIST</strong><br>
It&apos;s a little worrisome that Don is falling apart in the episode, considering Matthew Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/matthew_weiner_already_knows_how_ma.php">previously mentioned</a> the final season (coming up next) of the series will show him as an old man (&quot;What I&apos;m looking for, and how I hope to end the show, is like... It&apos;s 2011. Don Draper would be 84 right now.). </p>

<p>In last night&apos;s season finale Don has what he calls &quot;a hot tooth,&quot; and Joan suggests he sees a dentist she knows&#x2014;&quot;I know a dentist he&apos;s at the steeple of the Chrysler Building. Even if he can&apos;t help you, you still get to see the view.&quot; Don didn&apos;t end up going to that dentist (you can see his view when he does go is of a brick facade), but there a dentist at the top of the Chrysler isn&apos;t unheard of&#x2014;in fact, the NY Times wrote about him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/garden/26mayor.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">in 2005</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BUTLER&apos;S SHOES</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="butlersshoesx05.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/butlersshoesx05.jpeg" width="640" height="416" class="image-none"> </span><br>
In earlier episodes we saw the team pitching Butler&apos;s Shoes a Cinderella-theme for their commercial. In the finale, Megan uses her connections (er, husband) to land the spot, which has changed to a Beauty and the Beast theme. There&apos;s not a ton of information online about the shoe company, but it did exist in the real world. It appears that they eventually liquidated and all of their stores became either a Sam &amp; Libby or Jones New York.</p>

<p>Don leaves the commercial shoot as the James Bond theme &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; plays (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145603/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/">the movie</a> didn&apos;t actually come out for a few more months, in June 1967)&#x2014;he eventually settles into a seat at a bar, and leaves us wondering if Mr. &amp; Mrs. Draper will still be together when we catch up with them next season...</p>
