<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120144631/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/video_new_years_eve_trailer_release.php"><em>New Year&apos;s Eve</em></a> and <em>Valentine&apos;s Day</em> are the Hallmark of Hollywood productions&#x2014;rom coms centered around holidays in which ensemble casts play out their microscopic plotlines which somehow generate lots and lots of manufactured <em>feelings</em>. They&apos;re totally manipulative! And lucrative. And now they&apos;ve got some competition from the folks at <em>30 Rock</em>, where on the show Jenna Maroney is starring in <em>Martin Luther King Day</em>. Check out the trailer, where you&apos;ll also spot: Nick Cannon, Emma Stone, Andy Samberg, Liam Neeson, Kristen Bell, R2D2, John Krasinski, Hugh Grant, and so many more. What, no Ashton Kutcher?</p>
