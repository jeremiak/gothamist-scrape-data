<p>Wondering what the straphangers of yore experienced during their summer commutes? The nostalgia trains and busses are coming back soon, giving you a chance to find out first hand. This time around you&apos;ll be able to take the Transit Museum&apos;s vintage fleet to the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Coney Island, and the Rockaways&#x2014;and a ticket on board will cost you 50 bucks (just around half the price of a monthly unlimited Metrocard in modern times). And no, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326002305/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/nostalgia_trains_return_tomorrow_wi.php">there&apos;s no air conditioning</a>.<br>
 <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326002305/http://www.nycharities.org/events/EventLevels.aspx?ETID=4996"><strong>On July 1st</strong></a>, Lo-V cars take passengers to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Brooklyn Museum of Art&#x2014;where you can catch the summer blossoms or check out the final week of the museum&apos;s Keith Haring.<br>
 <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326002305/http://www.nycharities.org/events/EventLevels.aspx?ETID=4994"><strong>On July 29th</strong></a>, the R1/9 cars of the Independent Subway System will make a trip to Coney Island, where you can soak up the sun and eat some hot dogs... or you&apos;ll have an option to stay on the vintage train for additional rides.<br>
 <br>
<strong>On August 12th</strong> they&apos;ll have their annual Combination Caper, which features both the R 1/9 cars and several vintage buses. &quot;After a spectacular rail ride over Jamaica Bay to Rockaway Park, guests may stroll to the local beach or ride one of the vintage buses to Gateway National Park.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you think one day future New Yorkers will gleefully ride our old, broken down C trains?</p>
