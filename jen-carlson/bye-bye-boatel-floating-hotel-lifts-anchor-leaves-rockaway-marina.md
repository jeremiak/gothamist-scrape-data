<p>When Boatel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711044403/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/a_visit_to_rockaways_floating_boate.php#photo-1">opened in 2011</a> it seemed like a cute enough idea: a bunch of old boats creating an artsy floating motel, just off the coast of that new media darling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711044403/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/boatel.php#comment-595646167">Rockaway</a>. But soon enough there were complaints about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711044403/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/boatel.php">the boats</a>, which don&apos;t have a/c, or comfortable sleeping quarters, or very much at all... <em>especially</em> if you&apos;re used to high thread count accommodations. One former guest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711044403/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/boatel.php#comment-595646167">declared</a>: &quot;This place is a dump. There&apos;s nothing cute about sweating like Typhoid Mary while bugs, drunk on your plasma, hover mockingly just above your head. On a scale of 1 to 10 i give the Boatel the finger.&quot;</p>

<p>Towards the end of the summer we heard rumors that Boatel was losing money, that staff was quitting and/or not getting paid, and that the whole endeavour had become a huge, well, clusterfuck. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711044403/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121017/far-rockaway/floating-artist-utopia-boatel-comes-end#ixzz29YtgNzJM">DNA Info</a> reports Marina 59&apos;s owner Ari Zablozki (who had donated the boats to Boatel) is pulling the boats from the water, but Boatel&apos;s organizer Angie Kang assures that her &quot;boats will then be ready for something new&quot;... though it&apos;s unclear what, and where. The last night of the current Boatel will be the night before Halloween.</p>

<p>As for Zablozki, he may be readying to create a new, shiny version of Boatel&#x2014;Kang says, &#x201C;He wants to create a place his mother would be comfortable staying.&quot; We&apos;ve reached out to her for more info, and will update when we hear back.<br>
