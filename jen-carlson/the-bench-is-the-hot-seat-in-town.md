Almost too ridiculous to report on, the Lower East Side <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144606/http://www.americanapparel.net/presscenter/dailyupdate/dailyUp.asp?d=35&amp;t=746">American Apparel</a> happens to have a hot spot outside of its windows which has become the &quot;epicenter of perhaps the hottest &apos;anti-scene&apos; scene on Saturday nights.&quot; Exactly the kind of thing you&apos;d expect to be forged outside of an American Apparel, it even has founders - including DJ Big Black Matt Goias, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144606/http://www.myspace.com/thebenchnyc">MySpace profile</a>.  </p>

<p>Of all the benches in all the world, how did this one become <em>The</em> Bench? After sending out a fake press release Rolling Stone called it a &#x201C;nightlife revolution&#x201D; and The New York Times described the scene as a &#x201C;classically handsome quartet of New York City hipster royalty has changed the way we will think of nightlife fabulousness (and park benches) forever.&#x201D; We have no comment, but we&apos;re sure you do...</p>
