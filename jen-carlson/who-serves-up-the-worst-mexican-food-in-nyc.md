Case in point: a couple of weekends ago we went to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510085102/http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobo-brooklyn">Lobo on Court Street</a> (as first timers) with some friends (<em>who should have known better</em>) for a meal after some light daydrinking, and it was so terrible that we still haven&apos;t been able to wash the memories from our palate.<p></p>

<p>We ordered a vegetarian mix plate which consisted of a few different items that arrived soaking in a pool of beans, and on its own special plate there was a hard circular taco shell topped with iceberg lettuce, orange shreds of pre-packaged cheese, and more beans. None of it was particularly warm. It cost $13, and a world of regret (how many calories were in this tasteless pile of mush?), but &quot;luckily&quot; the service was so bad that we only got to order two drinks during our hours there. One thing we&apos;ll say is that the outdoor garden <em>is lovely</em> (that, and the margaritas seem to keep this place going), even if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510085102/https://twitter.com/#!/jenist/status/193830249799237632">that squirrel</a> with patches of hair missing is allegedly always there (we call him Patchy).</p>

<p>We&apos;re probably never going to have the best Mexican food here, but it doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t avoid the worst of the worst. So, below please put your votes for the best and worst Mexican food joints in all five boroughs, and we&apos;ll compile a guide of where you won&apos;t get Lobo&apos;d. (P.S. chains like Taco Bell don&apos;t count!)</p>
