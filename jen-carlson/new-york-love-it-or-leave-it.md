										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpYxX44CPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417052524im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpYxX44CPM.jpg" width="124" height="117" class="image-right"> </span>With jobs getting cut, budgets on the chopping block and an economic crisis that has everyone tightening the pursestrings, you can be sure to expect many an article penned about New Yorkers fleeing their expensive rents for new out-of-city digs (there&apos;s at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417052524/http://gawker.com/5156658/daily-beast-editor-sends-worlds-worst-email">one writer</a> looking for such subjects <em>right now</em>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417052524/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/features/71760/i-had-to-leave-nyc">TONY</a> recently asked some deserters why they left New York after years of calling it home (marriage, bigger apartment, etc etc), and they all seem so...<em>happy</em>. While they&apos;re not living in their own versions of Galt&apos;s Gulch just yet, some are recreating New York in their new stomping grounds. One 26-year-old says she left the Astral in Greenpoint, which was infested with bedbugs and giant cockroaches, and moved into a palatial palace in Kansas City, where they even have Critical Mass, Bloody Mary brunches...and 3-bedroom apartments for $750 a month. Sigh.</p>
