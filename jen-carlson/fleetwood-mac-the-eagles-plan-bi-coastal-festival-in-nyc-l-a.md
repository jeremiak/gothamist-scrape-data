<p>Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles are planning two-day festivals in both New York and Los Angeles. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911102009/http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7709414/eagles-fleetwood-mac-festival-new-york-los-angeles">Billboard reports</a> that organizers of &quot;the Classic East and Classic West concerts&quot; hope to take over Citi Field and Dodgers Stadium this summer, and want the fests to become an annual event. </p>

<p>The headliners, at least for the inaugural event, will of course be Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles (who were both left off the classic rock fest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911102009/http://laist.com/tags/deserttrip">Desert Trip</a> lineup last year). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911102009/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/09/fleetwood_mac_today_show.php">Seeing Fleetwood Mac live</a> is a goddamn gift, and you may want to especially consider hitting up that L.A. show at Dodger Stadium:</p>

<p>And if you&apos;re cringing at the Eagles because of your distaste for &quot;Hotel California,&quot; please do yourself a favor and learn more about Linda Ronstadt&apos;s 1971 backing band by watching their documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911102009/https://www.netflix.com/title/70267553">on Netflix</a>.</p>

<p>There are no more major details at this time, but Billboard also notes that more artists will be announced in coming months, and that &quot;a number of big-time music companies are involved in the blockbuster concert concept including&#x200B; Azoff MSG Entertainment, Live Nation, the Oak View Group and CAA.&quot;</p>

<p>Not so fun fact, <em>Lorne</em>: both Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911102009/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/25/fleetwood_mac_snl_conspiracy.php">never musical guest on <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>.</p>
