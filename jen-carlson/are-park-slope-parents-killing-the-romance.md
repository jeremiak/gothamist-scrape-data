<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305034229/http://fullpermissionliving.blogspot.com/2009/09/heres-little-lol-piece-by-pl-written-up.html">Old man Loffredo</a> recently paid a visit to the neighborhood&apos;s fairly new establishment, Provini, where he was encountered with a great wine list and a healthy portion of the &quot;You&apos;ll never get to be an adult in Park Slope without tolerating my kids&quot; crowd. Not a very good pairing! Indeed, one toddler even broke a wine glass in his presence; behavior that garnered eye rolls from the waitstaff and should clearly be reserved for less fancy pants places. Take it to Chuck E. Cheese, stroller pushers!</p>

<p>It sounds like if it were up to the purveyors, the parental units and their glass-shattering spawn wouldn&apos;t be allowed near the establishment. Loffredo points out that &quot;Provini deliberately doesn&apos;t have high chairs, I was secretly told by a waitress, and there certainly isn&apos;t any room for strollers, but the exquisite wine list alone should keep kids out, don&apos;t you think? <strong>Not in Park Slope, where pathetic parents don&apos;t want to live with the choices they&apos;ve made, so they crash everyone else&apos;s party.</strong>&quot; <em>Burn.</em> Looks like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305034229/http://gothamist.com/tags/strollermafia">stroller mafia</a> just got itself a new villain!
