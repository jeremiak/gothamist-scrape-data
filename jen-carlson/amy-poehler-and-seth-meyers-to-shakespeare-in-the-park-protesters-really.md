<p>Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers reunited on Wednesday night to bring back their old beloved SNL Weekend Update segment &quot;Really?!?&quot; The treatment was tagged to the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170622201904/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakespeareinthepark">Shakespeare in the Park</a> drama, and specifically the nights when the controversial production of <em>Julius Caesar</em> was protested and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170622201904/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/19/caesar_protesters_central_park.php">interrupted by alt-right protesters</a>.  </p>

<p>Poehler declares at the top of the segment, &quot;Protesters, this is New York City. All you did by running on stage was give them an anecdote to tell at their fancy liberal cocktail parties! &apos;You know, I was at the Caesar that was interrupted.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Meyers&#x2014;who said he didn&apos;t think the production was offensive, &quot;but it was a little hacky&quot;&#x2014;discussed free speech, and noted that, &quot;A conservative pundit tweeted that he was going to hold a production of the Salem Witch Trials where Hillary was burned at the stake. Cool cool... except there is no play called the Salem Witch Trials. You&apos;re thinking of <em>The Crucible</em> by Arthur Miller, a play he wrote as an allegory about McCarthyism. There, now you have three things to Google.&#x201D; Poehler then added, &quot;Guess what, bro? You can&#x2019;t burn Hillary at the stake. She&#x2019;s already been burned twice. 2008 and 2016. My bitch is Teflon now!&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday it was reported that the Public Theater&apos;s director Oskar Eustis, as well as other Shakespeare companies across the country, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170622201904/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/21/public_theater_death_threats_shakespeare.php">have been receiving death threats</a> over the production, which features a Trump-like Julius Caesar&#x2014;long, red tie; yellowy hair; a propensity to Tweet; a Slavic wife&#x2014;who is assassinated as the play was written.</p>
