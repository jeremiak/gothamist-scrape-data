<blockquote>Petland Discounts, with nearly 100 outlets the NY Tri-State area, a privately owned pet store chain has signed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172746/http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/puppy_mills/facts/puppy_friendly_pet_stores.html">The Humane Society of the United States&apos;</a> puppy friendly pet store pledge, committing not to sell puppies, but instead support local animal adoption programs and provide literature that helps customers learn how to locate a reputable breeder.</blockquote>

<p>Petland&apos;s Amy Kimmel says they&apos;ll also provide savings on pet supplies for the animals adopted at their adoption events. The HSUS is applauding them, and the organization&apos;s Stephanie Shain clarifies that this is not part of the Petland chain&#x2014;she says, &quot;This company sets a positive example of corporate responsibility for other businesses to follow. Unlike the national Petland, Inc chain of pet stores that has been investigated by The HSUS and linked to puppy mills, the unaffiliated Petland Discounts chain has never sold puppies, supports animal shelters and pet adoption, and is part of the solution to the puppy mill problem.&#x201D; Petland Discounts has 62 locations in the five boroughs.</p>
