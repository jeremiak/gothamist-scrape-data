The project comes from NYC Parks and The Poetry Society of New York, who bill the typewriter as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223094525/http://www.subconsciousofthecity.com/">The Subconscious of the City</a>.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>Each booth is outfitted with a vintage typewriter, 100-foot long paper scroll, solar generator, hidden tablet, and a custom-built USB typewriter kit, which allows every written entry to be collected, stored, and posted online for users to read, share, and comment upon. Acting as a public, community diary, each scroll captures something of the sound, narrative, and nuance of a specific corner of the city. The Typewriter Project&#x2019;s mission is to investigate, document, and preserve the poetic subconscious of the city while providing a fun and interactive means for the public to engage with poetry.</blockquote>

<p>Photographer Scott Lynch dropped by and reports back, &quot;Most people put actual though into what they said, and one writer composed an epic, like 40-line poem that must have taken forever to pound out.&quot; Click through for a look at what others are outputting there&#x2014;&quot;to be free is to be rid of fear,&quot; one person typed. Another: &quot;Hello my name is Rosiland.. I am from the Lower East Side x20 years. I [am] happy for this throwback... to type from this manual typewriter.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;ll find the typewriter on south side of Tompkins Square Park near the Hare Krishna Tree&#x2014;hours of operation will be Monday-Friday, 3 to 8 p.m., and Saturday &amp; Sunday, noon to 8 p.m. The scrolls will be on display at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223094525/http://www.newyorkcitypoetryfestival.com/">The New York City Poetry Festival</a> on Governors Island on July 25th and 26th along with the booth itself.</p>
