<span class="photo_caption">Ray and Marnie at Joe&apos;s Shanghai, continuing to be the most interesting part of the show this season.</span></p>

<p>Last night on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a>, Hannah got a job in GQ&apos;s advertorial department, Adam got a call-back for an acting gig, Ray and Marnie continued to (be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/03/girls_3.php">the most interesting</a> and realistic part of the show this season, and) feed their budding relationship... with dumplings, while Shoshanna continued to be the most unrealistic character on television. And Jessa sold some woman a chic black dress for her baby. That&apos;s a lot of venturing outside of their apartments, so we got to see a little bit more of NYC (which the show has often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">depicted</a> in a very real way)&#x2014;and New Yorkers reacted on Twitter:</p>

<p>Joe&apos;s Shanghai&#x2014;where Marnie and Ray spar over lunch&#x2014;was depicted in a <em>too real</em> way, and now at least one local is worried about long waits... which is crazy because no one really goes and does all of the things that they see the characters on <em>Girls</em> do, <em>do they?</em> Anyway, the one that was on the show appeared to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/http://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2">the Chinatown storefront</a>, and you&apos;ll want to order the dumplings.</p>

<p>Hannah&apos;s advertorial job is at GQ, housed inside of 4 Times Square (aka the Conde Nast building). On the show there&apos;s a snack room, which includes free snacks of all kinds (and Hannah loves snacks you guys, do you think that was brought up enough during the episode?). The snack room, however, is not real... though each floor of that building does include at least one kitchen.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>FYI the GQ snack room isn&apos;t a thing, if only. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GIRLS&amp;src=hash">#GIRLS</a></p>&#x2014; Maddy Tabing (@madtab) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/https://twitter.com/madtab/statuses/432726373875351552">February 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>In that snack room there is Russ &amp; Daughters lox (a comment is made about how good it is), making Russ &amp; Daughters THE New York establishment to name drop or feature in your show (in 2012 it made a mouthwatering appearance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYvL7GcLxLA">on <em>Louie</em></a>).</p>

<p>Oh, and an unrelated &quot;fun fact&quot;&#x2014;Hannah&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214606/http://www.hbo.com/girls#/girls/episodes/03/26-free-snacks/interview.html">new coworker</a> was wearing her shirt from season one:</p>
