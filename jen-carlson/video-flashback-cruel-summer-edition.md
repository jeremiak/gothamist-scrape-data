title: Video Flashback: Cruel Summer Edition
---

	
										<p>The year is 1983, and English female pop group Bananarama has released their video for &quot;Cruel Summer,&quot; which has a New York City backdrop. Fire escapes, rooftop dance parties, this video has it all! And by all, we mean it has a small fraction of what this city has to offer. But that said, as you melt into the nostalgia, can you identify any of the areas in the video?</p>

<p>A few facts: <br>
</p><ul><li>The track was originally released in July 1983<br>
</li><li>Bananarama traveled to New York to make the supporting video, which cost about $15,000<br>
</li><li>And yes, they channel <em>The Dukes of Hazzard</em> at one point, with the cop chasing them</li></ul><p></p>
