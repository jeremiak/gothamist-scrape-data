What&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180248/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk">obelisk</a>, you ask? Think: Washington Monument. Ortega&apos;s &quot;stands on a grassy platform on wheels, as though it has been uprooted from a previous location and made portable.&quot; As such, the &quot;mobile landmark&quot; can move to commemorate any occasion in any location and offers a &quot;pragmatic yet wryly playful approach to a global society in which the balance of power is constantly in flux, and in which populations shift and drift from one place to another.&quot; After all, throughout history statues have been often been moved after victories as a symbol of triumph. </p>

<p>Made of fiberglass and plywood, Ortega&apos;s statue stands 20 feet tall. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180248/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/arts/design/18voge.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1179508506-yT9rMIKAeMPVqLY0EZSsLw">NY Times</a> has more on the artist, who until a few years ago was a political cartoonist. While it has been around the world for a couple of years, this is the first time his obelisk will be on view in the US.</p>

<p><em>Obelisco Transportable is on view through October 28th at 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, at the entrance to Central Park. Subways: N, R to Fifth Avenue; 4, 5, 6 to 59th St/Lexington Ave. The work is free to the public and is on view daily.</em></p><em>
