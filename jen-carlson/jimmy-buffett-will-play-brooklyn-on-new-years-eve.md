<p>Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band AND Huey Lewis AND the News will be taking the stage at Barclays Center this December 31st to ring in the new year. </p>

<p>If you only know Buffett for &quot;Margaritaville,&quot; that&apos;s fine, but look into this guy&apos;s history, which musically starts in New Orleans in the 1960s, when he was busking for change. You&apos;ll also find a nice mini-story on him in the Hunter S. Thompson documentary <em>Gonzo</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402182813/http://www.netflix.com/title/70084132">it&apos;s on Netflix</a>), when the writer escaped to Florida while going through a divorce. During that time Thompson lived with Buffett and bought a boat.</p>

<p>The press release points out that this will &quot;mark the first time Buffett has performed in New York City on New Year&#x2019;s Eve.&quot; At least one song will be aired on ABC, as Dick Clark&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Rockin&#x2019; Eve with Ryan Seacrest will do a live cut-in for a midnight performance. </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402182813/http://www.ticketmaster.com/jimmy-buffett-and-the-coral-reefer-brooklyn-new-york-12-31-2015/event/00004F2BB1C540E7?artistid=734667&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1&amp;tm_link=search_msg-0_00004F2BB1C540E7">get tickets here</a>. Here he is in 1977 at Aspen High School, playing with Glenn Frey and Steve Weisberg. You&apos;ll see Hunter S. Thompson take a seat, too: </p>
