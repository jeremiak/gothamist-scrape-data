<p>Sometimes you want to go out so that you can stay in. So that you can <em>be out</em> but while There also seclude yourself from others you don&apos;t know (and frankly, don&apos;t care to know). So that you can Instagram <em>being out</em> but while, let&apos;s be honest, not really being out. Because you are in a protective bubble. Literally. If this sounds like you, do read on...</p>

<p>The roof deck at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504072206/http://gothamist.com/tags/230fifth">230 FIFTH</a> now includes four transparent &quot;bubble tents resembling igloos and outfitted with heat, sofas, rugs, and TVs.&quot; Heat and plastic and alcohol... what could go wrong? Oh nevermind, the &quot;cutting-edge inflated shelters are made from crystal clear one millimeter thick PVC,&quot; which is &quot;impervious to wind, rain and snow.&quot; So it&apos;s totally safe, just like your apartment. And just like your apartment, it has all those aforementioned &quot;homey comforts.&quot; And just like you would in your apartment, you might as well wear pajamas because they give you a &quot;complimentary robe&quot; that&apos;s going to cover up your outfit anyway. And just like your apartment, the rent is too damn high. </p>

<p>Why are we going out again?</p>

<p>According to the press release, this &quot;cutting edge&quot; &quot;whimsical&quot; &quot;so completely unique&quot; experience will cost you (and up to 11 friends) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS (reservations and a minimum food/beverage expenditure required). For that kind of cash you get to stay in the plastic dome for &quot;up to 5 hours!&quot; Not a bad view though?</p>
