<p>So far we&apos;ve seen almost the entire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145049/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen">Sterling Cooper &amp; Partners</a> gang in the upcoming final season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145049/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/13/mad_men_teasers_decoded.php#photo-1">promo images</a>... except for Ms. Joan Harris. DID SHE DIE? Was she just waiting for Meadow to parallel park? Was she busy making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145049/http://gothamist.com/tags/truedetective">Devil Nets</a>? Was she chilling in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145049/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/13/true_detective_twin_peaks.php">the Black Lodge</a>?

Why is it so sunny? Are they all going to Heaven? Were they dead this whole time, or in some purgatory universe creating their own reality? Is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145049/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNwARV9tPUw">Sia&apos;s &quot;Breathe Me&quot;</a> playing?</p>
