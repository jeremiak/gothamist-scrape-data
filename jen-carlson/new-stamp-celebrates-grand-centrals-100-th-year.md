<p>Grand Central Terminal is entering its centennial year, and will officially turn 100 on February 2nd, 2013. To celebrate the landmark, the U.S. Postal Service is offering an Express Mail stamp, because nothing says 1913 like some good ol&apos; fashioned snail mail! </p>

<p>They say a release date has not yet been set, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025647/http://beyondtheperf.com/2013-preview/#stamp-grand-central">they note</a> that &quot;the stamp art [created by Dan Cosgrove and Phil Jordan] captures the grandeur of this architectural masterpiece with an illustration of the main concourse. Early morning sunlight streams through the 60-foot-tall windows, illuminating the people below. In the foreground, travelers gather near the station&#x2019;s round information booth topped with its four-sided clock. The edges of the terminal&#x2019;s famous sky ceiling can be seen at the top of the stamp art, its background of robin&#x2019;s egg blue decorated with a mural of constellations and figures of the Zodiac.&quot; </p>

<p>As you can tell by the slobs passing through the main concourse with their rolling suitcases, this is a current day image of the transit hub... but for some more old school images, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025647/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/16/14_photos_of_grand_central_from_bef.php#photo-1">check out our previous gallery</a> of photos taken of GCT from before your time.</p>
