title: Couple Struggle Over Puggle On Staten Island

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:191px; "> <img alt="phpbYMQoVPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311000907im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpbYMQoVPM.jpg" width="191" height="250"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Puggles are cute</span></i></div> A couple and their puggle can be just <em>so adorable</em> together... until the humans break up and the pup is left in the middle of a fido fued. 37-year-old Mark Granquist of Staten Island sued his ex-girlfriend Audrey Hesselberg last year when she wouldn&apos;t return their dog, named Benjamin. He said he simply wanted his &quot;buddy&quot; back, but Hesselberg said the dog was a gift from him to her while they were dating.<p></p>

<p>While Benjamin usually lived with Granquist, there were allegedly a few times Hesselberg would take the dog to her own home. The last time she did this she never returned with him, and broke off her three-year relationship with Granquist just days later! </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311000907/http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2010/07/ref_rules_puggle_was_gift_to_s.html">SI Live</a>, a judge just determined that Hesselberg is the established owner, after she proved that she cared for and fed Benjamin, on top of being the one who purchased his license and a microchip for identification. The poor guy is pictured on the site holding up his cell phone with a photo of his beloved puggle as the wallpaper :(</p>
