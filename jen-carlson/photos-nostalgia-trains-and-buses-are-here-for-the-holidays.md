</div></div>					<p>The MTA is bringing back their gorgeous old train cars and buses for the holiday season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090340/http://gothamist.com/tags/nostalgiatrain">once again</a>. The subways hit rails and streets last Sunday, and will continue to every Sunday (from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.) throughout the rest of December, bringing a little bit of romance back to mass transit... so please save your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090340/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/etiquette_week_subway.php#photo-1">bad etiquette</a> for the regular trains. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090340/http://new.mta.info/news-holidays-nostalgia-buses-new-york-city-transit/2013/11/14/mta-offer-holiday-season-nostalgia">the MTA</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;If you&#x2019;re looking for another great reason to ride the train on Sundays in December, try this: take a trip back into time onboard the 1930s-era Nostalgia Special, which will run along the M Subway Line Icon Line between Long Island City, Queens and Lower Manhattan during the first four Sundays in December.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Their Senior Vice President of the Department of Subways says, &#x201C;They aren&#x2019;t the first subway cars, but these R 1/9 cars served for five decades and are historically significant as the rolling stock that originally served the IND.&#x201D; The cars were in service from the 1930s to the 1970s, and feature ceiling fans, padded seats, and incandescent light bulbs, which were state-of-the-art when they first started running. </p>

<p>On the roads, they&apos;re offering bus customers along Manhattan&#x2019;s 42nd Street crosstown corridor (along the M42) a variety of their vintage fleet, with models that operated from the 1950s through the 1980s (these will run from 9 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday through Friday from December 2nd to 20th... unless it&apos;s snowing or raining).</p>
