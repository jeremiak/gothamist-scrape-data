We all stood around yelling obscenities at the management and throwing plastic cups at security. This lasted for about an hour until we were slowly corralled onto the street.&quot; The crowd eventually left what this tipster calls a &quot;rotten facist venue.&quot; Whoa there, let&apos;s fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012317/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2008/07/butthole_surfer_1.html">Brooklyn Vegan</a> the reports are coming in that &quot;<strong>Gibby walked over and punched him [the sound guy] and/or threw a bottle at him.</strong> Next thing you know security escorts Gibby off the stage mid-song.&quot; Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012317/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/tonyblog/?p=4681">TONY</a> has culled all of the accounts, including their own, and report that Haynes spent much of the set &quot;throwing silent hand gestures&#x2014;and eventually a not-so-silent middle finger&#x2014;toward the monitor engineer at the side of the stage, trying to get more sound. Finally, Haynes lurched over to the board and&#x2014;depending on which blogger you trust&#x2014;shoved the guy, threw a punch or tossed a beer bottle. From my perspective, Haynes shoved the guy, who took a swing back at him.&quot;</p>

<p>The ultimate inconclusive ending to everyone&apos;s story is that Haynes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012317/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003833406"><em>may or may not</em> have been arrested</a>, however <strong>the NYPD has just confirmed with us that no arrests were made at Webster Hall last night</strong>, this includes Gibby Haynes. So in the end, everyone got a 90-minute set and no one spent any time behind bars...though we&apos;re guessing Butthole Surfers won&apos;t be allowed to play at any more Bowery Presents venues in the near future, as the sound guy was allegedly one of their regulars.</p>
