<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://www.americangangster.net/">American Gangster</a></em> is set in 1960-70s New York and stars Russell Crowe as a detective working to take down a real-life heroin kingpin, Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington). Lucas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lucas_(criminal)">claimed</a> to gross $1M a day on 116th Street dealing drugs, which he got to the States by smuggling in the coffins of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War. Some are calling the flick the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://www.tomsgames.com/us/fringedrinking/2007/10/american_gangster_the_next_cri.html">next crime classic</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/arts/music/20jayz.html?hp">Jay-Z has even written a concept album</a> (of the same name) to accompany it. None of his songs are included in the soundtrack, however, in an effort to keep that &apos;60s and &apos;70s feel. </p>

<p>On the flip side of the big screen today is <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://www.beemovie.com/">Bee Movie</a></em>, which has been built up with an overactive ad campaign that has made us cringe at the very sound of Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s voice (we hate you, NBeeC!). This one&apos;s about a bee who graduates from college, befriends a Manhattan florist, sues humans for eating honey, yada yada yada. USA Today smashed the Dreamworks creation with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2007-11-01-bee-movie_N.htm">a D rating</a> (1/2 a star, out of 4), and we don&apos;t expect to see many sweet words poured onto this one.</p>

<p>Rotten Tomatoes shows an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_gangster/">average rating of 7.1/10</a> for <em>American Gangster</em>, with <em>Bee Movie</em> only getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175524/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bee_movie/">a 5.9</a> -- not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that.<br>
