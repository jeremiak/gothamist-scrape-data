<p>Remember that magical hour or so in 2009 when we all believed a young boy named Falcon Heene was floating around the U.S. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729110309/http://gothamist.com/tags/balloonboy">in a balloon</a> like he was a character in some wanderlusty Wes Anderson movie? Like all things that appear to be magical in this world, it was a sham, and the boy&apos;s father Richard Heene was sentenced to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729110309/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/23/balloon_boy_dad_sentenced_to_90_day.php">90 days in prison</a> after the world found out it was all a publicity stunt. But here in &apos;merica we bounce back from public shame and keep on truckin&apos;, so Richard has now got his boys out touring in a band that he&apos;s billing as the &quot;World&apos;s Youngest Metal Band.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729110309/http://www.heeneboyz.com/home.cfm">The Heene Boyz</a> are currently in NYC and and will be headlining Sullivan Hall on June 26th:</p>

<p>They may not be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729110309/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/videos_nycs_best_metal_band_is_a_bu.php">the best metal band in the world</a>, or even really the youngest, but they&apos;re not bad: they can work a crowd and they&apos;ve got some real energy! Anyway, can someone go and make sure they&apos;re getting proper meals and education and whatever 10-year-olds need?</p>
