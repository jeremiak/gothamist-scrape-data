title: Event Spotlight: Tsunami Benefits
---

	
										<p>Gothamist is happy that people are still raising money for the Tsunami victims, so we wanted to draw some attention to upcoming events. Tonight Halycon Records [located at 63 Pearl Street in DUMBO] is having the opening party for an arts show that will run through March 20th. 50+ artists will be selling their work for $100 and under. If you can&apos;t head over tonight for the open bar, deejays and collaborative painting project, then be sure to check it out in the next month. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103815/http://www.halcyonrecords.com/HardTimes/hardtimeseflyer.jpg">More information here</a>.</p>

<p>When Gothamist was a hippie we enjoyed bands like Phish, moe., Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood (who we still love) and all the other usual suspects. Tonight moe. will be holding a Tsunami benefit at Roseland Ballroom with special guests Trey Anastasio, John Medeski, Sam Bush and Ray Paczkowski. All the proceeds will be matched by the Dave Matthew Band. Aw, that&apos;s sweet. </p>
