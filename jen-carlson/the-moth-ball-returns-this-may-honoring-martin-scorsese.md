										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mothball0312.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013833im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mothball0312.jpeg" width="350" height="290" class="image-right"> </span>It&apos;s the most wonderful time of the year! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013833/http://www.themoth.org/">The Moth</a> is holding their annual gala on May 8th, and have just released some details. We look forward to this amazing event every year, and highly recommend buying tickets. </p>

<p>This year&apos;s Moth Ball will be hosted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013833/http://dev-video.usate.nbcudps.com/features/characters_unite/the-moth-simon-doonan/v1264455">by Simon Doonan</a>, and will honor Martin Scorsese, who will receive the 2012 Moth Storytelling Award. The Moth&#x2019;s Artistic Director, Catherine Burns, says, &quot;What is at the heart of every Martin Scorsese film? People talking to each other. His films are populated by characters who are defined by the specificity of the worlds they live in, and we understand their lives through the words they use. He is, above all, a master storyteller, who is known to be a great raconteur by those lucky enough to share a dinner table with him.&quot; On top of that, Al Sharpton will be on hand presenting a Moth scholarship to a NYC high school student, and NBC&apos;s Bonnie Hammer will also be honored. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013833/http://gothamist.com/tags/themoth">non-profit storytelling organization</a>&#x2014;which delivers a perfectly not-too-short, not-to-long podcast to our device each week&#x2014;is now in its 15th year, and just received a $750,000 MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions.<br>
 <br>
To attend the Ball (held at Capitale, 130 Bowery), you&apos;ll need to shell out some cash&#x2014;tickets are $195 to $350 (the latter includes dinner). But we can tell you it&apos;s well worth it, and you&apos;ll be enjoying top-shelf booze with your top-shelf storytelling all night. This year&apos;s theme is Storyville (expect some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013833/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyville">Red Light District</a> costume items laying around to throw on yourselves), and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013833/https://themoth.secure.force.com/ticket#sections_a0FU0000000CShDMAW">buy tickets here</a>. If you can&apos;t make it to that event, they&apos;ll be hosting their 1,000th show at the World Science Festival on May 31st. </p>
