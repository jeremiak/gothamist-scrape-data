</div></div>					<p>Even if you have a perfectly functional air conditioner, you probably shouldn&apos;t be over-using it right now on account of the whole imminent city-wide blackout you&apos;d be helping to cause, <em>right</em>? So how does one live without these little cooling dream machines? Here are some helpful tips we use, and a few from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172529/http://twitter.com/foodofthefuture">some friends</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172529/http://twitter.com/rcwellington">we know</a> who have chosen to exist <em>sans</em> A.C. for years&#x2014;they are destined to be a New York Times trend piece! Okay, here we go:<br>
</p><ul><li>Every once in a while, go stick your head in the freezer (seriously, this works!)<br>
</li><li>Apply cold water on feet/wrists (aka your pulse points).<br>
</li><li>For the hardcore: put an icepack by your bed to apply to pulse points.<br>
</li><li>Drinking a lot of cold beer (or, you know, cold anything)<br>
</li><li>Get a few fans, of the electric <em>and</em> paper folding variety (that way you&apos;ll be all set when your air conditioner-abusing friends take down the grid).<br>
</li><li>Put a sheet in the freezer before bed.<br>
</li><li>Or take a cold shower before going to bed. Bonus: it makes your hair really shiny. <br>
</li><li>If you get really desperate, draw a cold bath.<br>
</li><li> Keep in mind, any furniture that is upholstered with synthetic materials is a lot more comfortable if you put a sheet over it.<br>
</li><li>Try to create a cross breeze, and try not to dwell on how hot you are!<br>
</li><li>Turn off any unnecessary lights (especially overhead lights).<br>
</li><li>Wear natural fabrics.<br>
</li><li>Sweating cools your body. Spicy foods help for some reason as well.<br>
</li><li>Bring a Thermarest and camp out in your air conditioned office.<br>
</li><li>Movie-hop as late as possible at your local multiplex.<br>
</li><li>Quick, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172529/http://newyork.craigslist.org/stn/m4w/1827541494.html">start dating someone</a> with A.C.!<br>
</li></ul>And remember, you&apos;ll be saving energy, saving money, and probably losing weight since being so hot diminshes one&apos;s appetite. And as our aforementioned friends tell us, &quot;it&apos;s nice to live a little more in tune with the natural world.&quot;<p></p>
