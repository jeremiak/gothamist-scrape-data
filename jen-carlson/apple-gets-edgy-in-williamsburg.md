<p>Originally it was suspected that Brooklyn residents would be sinking their teeth into Apple on Atlantic Avenue near Clinton. Then someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301005032/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/17/an_apple_store.php#comment-1198950">claiming</a> to be &quot;Dana Hemphill, the Apple Northeastern Representative&quot; said the company was &quot;currently in negotiation to open our 1st retail location in Brooklyn, NY on Atlantic Avenue, not far from Court Street,&quot; mentioning it &quot;should up and running by the second quarter of 2008.&quot;</p>

<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301005032/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10102007/business/bklyn_gets_apple__barneys.htm">The Post</a> reports that Apple (and Barneys Co-op, for that matter) has been in discussions with residential property <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301005032/http://douglastondevelopment.com/projects/current/williamsburg.shtml">The Edge</a> in Williamsburg. The property will have 75,000 feet of retail space and is located along Kent Avenue spanning North 5th Street to North 7th Street. Is a Genius Bar in store for the &apos;Burg? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>For Manhattanite Mac users, there may be another shop coming your way as well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301005032/http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/10/10/fourth.apple.store.in.ny/">MacNN</a> reports: &quot;Apple may be re-investigating a corner retail location ranging between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet across from the Empire State Building. Development plans will cost up to $125 million, and city permits have already been issued to a firm which will set up scaffolding around the address as well as the adjacent addresses. Financial records reveal that Apple would be the sole tenant of a 27,900 square foot building with a lease lasting through January of 2022.&quot;</p>
