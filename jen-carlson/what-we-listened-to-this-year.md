<p>The NY Times&apos; David Gallagher linked to this chart earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051803/http://twitter.com/davidfg/status/6899140844">on Twitter</a>, which tracks the listening habits of music fans in New York City and compares them to <em>The World</em>. Unsurprisingly, we love Animal Collective way more than anyone else. Seriously, our love for that band is practically off the charts, as they say. In fact, how dare you even try to measure our love for Animal Collective, Last.fm. <em>How. Dare. You.</em> Other trends: we totally stopped listening to Britney in February, it was the summer of Grizzly Bear, and Lady Gaga who? We&apos;ll take Karen O, thankyouverymuch. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051803/http://bit.ly/6oXoFc">Grab a PDF of the chart here</a> &#x2014;&#xA0;did your iPod faves make it on there?</p>
