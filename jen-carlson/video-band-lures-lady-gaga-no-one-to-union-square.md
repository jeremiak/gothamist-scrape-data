title: Video: Band Lures Lady Gaga No One To Union Square
---

	
										<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> We&apos;re having a rare moment where we&apos;re actually going to praise <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115231814/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> for something. The Fame Monster caught wind of some Tweets a small New York band was directing at her, inviting her to see them perform her new single, &quot;Born This Way,&quot; in Union Square on Sunday. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115231814/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/03/_lady_gaga_just_made_an_indie.html#more">the Washington Post</a>, the band I Love Monsters doesn&apos;t personally know the performer, but that didn&apos;t stop them from relentlessly sending out notes &quot;to Lady Gaga and her biggest fans to get her attention.&quot; That kind of social media assault may make <em>them</em> look like tools, but it works for Lady Gaga&#x2014;who typically goes for more over-the-top publicity stunts. Check out the scene from Sunday in the video below:</p>

<p>The band isn&apos;t satisfied with just a Gaga drive-by though, they now have their eyes on an opening slot; lead singer Jonathan Tortora says: &quot;Maybe we can open up for Lady Gaga one day.&quot;</p>
