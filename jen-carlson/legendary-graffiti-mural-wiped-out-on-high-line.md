<p>Last year as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114210524/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">Friends of the High Line</a> prepared to open the old elevated tracks as a park, it became clear that the graffiti that had long adorned the area wasn&apos;t going to be a part of the new luxury landscape. As such, the mayor&apos;s office began painting over what they deemed eyesores last April, a project that has continued as street art fanboys wearily kept an eye on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114210524/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/high_line_graffiti_almost_all_rubbe.php">Revs/Cost mural</a> on 23rd Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114210524/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/24/high_line_cleaning_up_or_losing_cha.php">Last year</a>, Gothamist publisher Jake Dobkin declared: &quot;if they touch the Revs/Cost Mural... it&apos;s war.&quot; Which may explain why he&apos;s not in the office yet... over the weekend, that mural was erased. </p>

<p>At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114210524/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2010/02/revscost-vanishing.html">Vanishing NY</a>, they say with the mural&apos;s disappearance, we are simply left with &quot;pub-crawlers and tourists... revelers whooping off the rooftops of luxury hotels&quot;... and of course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114210524/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/28/standard_rear_window_view_on_the_hi.php">exhibitionism</a>.</p>
