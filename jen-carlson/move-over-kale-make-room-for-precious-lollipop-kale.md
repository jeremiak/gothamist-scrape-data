										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="adorablekale14.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033948im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/adorablekale14.jpg" width="350" height="350"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> AdorKALEble!</i></div> Move over &quot;lacinto&quot; and &quot;curly,&quot; there&apos;s a more exclusive kale primed to gentrify your section of the produce aisle: &quot;lollipop kale.&quot; <em>AdorKALEble</em>. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033948/http://www.grubstreet.com/2014/03/lollipop-kale-sprouts.html">Grub Street&apos;s Hugh Merwin</a> points out in an excellent profile on the hard-to-find (and hard-to-grow) green, it&apos;s a &quot;mythological-sounding cross between Russian red kale leaves and conventional Brussels sprouts.&quot; And it apparently tastes like the perfect combination of both. But where can YOU get it, when even specialty shops have a hard time tracking it down?<p></p>

<p>Lollipop kale, a hybrid created by Tozer Seeds in 2010, <em>is</em> out there, and sometimes goes by a different name: kale sprouts. Merwin says he tracked them down under their trade name (lollipop) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033948/http://saladsavoy.com/lollipops/">at Salad Savoy</a>, and was able to order a case to ship to Brooklyn, where all kale belongs. He also notes that Trader Joe&apos;s may be adding the product to their shelves soon. But for now, aside from hounding your local specialty vegetable shop or attempting an order with a California producer, you&apos;ll have to seek it out on restaurant menus... though no New York restaurants seem to offer it now, according to Merwin, maybe they will after this big <em>press push</em>.</p>

<p>And if not, at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033948/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">ramps season</a> is just around the corner.</p>
