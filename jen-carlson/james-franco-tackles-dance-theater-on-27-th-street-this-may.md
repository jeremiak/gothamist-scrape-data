<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="francothumbnail0411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926115952im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/francothumbnail0411.jpg" width="250" height="163" class="image-right"> </span>It has come to our attention that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926115952/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> is going to be making his dance-theater directorial debut right here in New York next month. The producer of the show, John Morrow, tells us the multi-media piece&#x2014;which Franco will be narrating live at every performance&#x2014;is called &quot;Collage,&quot; and features live dance, theater, music, and poetry. Since many of Franco&apos;s more off-beat projects can be confusing and mysterious until experienced first-hand, some others involved with the show have taken a few moments to further explain what you can expect. Below, they offer up these puzzle pieces:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;&apos;Collage&apos; is a mixed-media piece that uses sound and visuals to play with the idea of how different art mediums interact.  Using video, dance, poetry, theatre and music, we have created a performance that will be an engaging experience for the audience.&quot;&#x2014;John Morrow, producer

<p>&quot;The piece is so exhilarating because there are no boundaries to what we can create and play with.&quot;&#x2014;Nina Ljeti, actress</p>

<p>&quot;Ignoring conventional narrative storytelling, it&apos;s been an interesting process to re-contextualize my own work in conversation with the other separate mediums.  The overall piece has been a continuous exploration of how using disparate elements can create a cohesive idea.&quot;&#x2014;Chloe Kernaghan, choreographer</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Performances are being held May 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 at 11 p.m., and there will be an additional one on the 14th at half past the witching hour. These will all take place at Stella Adler studios, located at 31 West 27th Street. They are FREE, and seating is on a first come, first seated basis.</p>
