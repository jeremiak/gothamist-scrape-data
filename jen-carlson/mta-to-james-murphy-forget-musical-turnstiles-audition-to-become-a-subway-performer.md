Would they ever let Murphy institute his idea, even on a smaller scale (one turnstile)? What if it were funded like a public art project? Kevin Ortiz at the MTA told us: <p></p>

<blockquote>While the idea sounds good, we are already in the midst of moving toward a Tap and Ride fare payment system that we hope to implement in 2015.  

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Murphy should consider auditioning for our Music Under New York program.</p></blockquote> <p></p>

<p>Ball&apos;s in your court, Mr. Murphy. But you&apos;re gonna have some steep competition with some of New York City&apos;s longstanding subway performers:</p>
