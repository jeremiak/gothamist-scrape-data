<p>If eating meat by-products mixed with fat mixed with sodium nitrite just isn&apos;t your thing, that doesn&apos;t mean you have to miss out on the great July 4th tradition of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811213458/http://gothamist.com/tags/nathanshotdogeatingcontest">hot dog eating contest</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811213458/http://www.cowgirlsbaking.com/">Cowgirl&apos;s Baking</a> is offering up something for the vegan set, and are inviting people to come sign up for their very own vegan hot dog eating contest this weekend. They say it&apos;s taking place &quot;any time&quot; from July 2nd to the 5th, and ask &quot;How many vegan hot dogs can you eat?&quot; We&apos;ve reached out to the East Village spot for more details, and will update if we hear back... they do, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811213458/https://twitter.com/#!/cowgirlsbaking/status/86057798131134465">promise prizes</a>.</p>

<p>If eating mass quantities of any type of hot dog turns you off, stop by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811213458/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/new_restaurants_22.php?gallery0Pic=2">Asia Dog</a> for a single, more special dog (they serve up vegan ones as well).</p>
