										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="1209cooperpostoffice.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015214056im_/http://gothamist.com/1209cooperpostoffice.jpg" width="350" height="263" class="image-left"> </span>A trip to the post office just became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015214056/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/16/post_office_1.php">even more dreadful</a> than usual! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015214056/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/110249/-i-ny1-for-you---i--post-office-rats-take-big-bites-out-of-manhattan-packages">NY1 reports</a> that residents of Brevoort East in Greenwich Village are complaining about rodent bites in their packages coming from their local Cooper Station Post Office on 4th Avenue.</p>

<p>One woman had her Costa Rican coffee beans noshed on by the critters, and says &quot;twice it&#x2019;s happened that I&#x2019;ve gotten a call from the front desk to say that the package has arrived and has been eaten by rodents, with the beans even spilling out.&quot; They even claim there are often rat droppings inside of the packages. And just imagine how packages being sent out may be arriving at their destinations!</p>

<p>So what does the USPS have to say? In person, one unhappy customer says she was laughed at and told: <strong>&quot;This is nothing! Wait until the holidays. These guys love chocolate.&quot;</strong> In a statement to NY1, however, they took on a more serious tone, saying, &quot;We have a contract with a licensed pest control service to inspect and treat Cooper Station and post offices throughout the city on a regular basis. Records indicate, Cooper Station was last serviced on November 18th and no rodent activity was reported.&quot; Except they have been reported! Once the heat was on, the network says the pest control company was called in again.</p>
