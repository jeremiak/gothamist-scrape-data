<p>One witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200018/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/gall_of_the_wild_in_tribeca_hunt_paKYZfoh1h89hr1kRceooO">told the Post</a>,  &quot;I thought it was a little wolf...It looked scared,&quot; while another liked the show, &quot;It was funny how the cops couldn&apos;t catch him.&quot;</p>
