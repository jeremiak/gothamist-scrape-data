<p>We&apos;ve managed to escape this amazing fact about the filming of James Cameron&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004658/http://gothamist.com/tags/titanic"><em>TItanic</em></a> for sixteen full years, but today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004658/http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dmcm3/til_that_during_the_filming_of_titanic_an_angry/">one Redditor</a> saved us from going our entire lives without knowing about that time a disgruntled crew member put PCP in the lobster chowder. The story has appeared buried in other stories about the movie before, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004658/http://sabotagetimes.com/reportage/james-cameron-and-the-incredible-untold-story-behind-titanic/">one report</a> includes a bit of an oral history of those who experienced it:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A brush with particularly potent lobster chowder very nearly upset the entire production. No one&#x2019;s quite sure who spiked the post-shoot party main course with PCP, although fingers were pointed at two chefs Cameron had fired. The effect, however, was truly devastating: <strong>&apos;People started laughing out loud,&apos; remembers Bill Paxton, aka explorer Brock Lovett. &apos;Others started crying. It was total Bedlam. Just as I was starting to wonder what was happening, I started feeling weird.&apos; &apos;There were people rolling around, completely out of it,&apos;</strong> continues Lewis Abernathy who played one of Lovett&#x2019;s sidekicks. &apos;Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics. I thought it was food poisoning.&apos; A dodgy crustacean couldn&#x2019;t account for what James Cameron was experiencing, though. Bill Paxton: &apos;<strong>Jim had one eye completely red, like the Terminator&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;no pupil, no iris, just red.</strong> The other eye looked like he&#x2019;d been sniffing glue since the age of four.&apos; Fortunately, 24 hours later, Cameron and the other 80 crew members affected were released from hospital.&quot;</blockquote>
