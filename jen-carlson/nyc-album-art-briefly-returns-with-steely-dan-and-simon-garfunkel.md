<p>In 2007 we dusted off some album covers that featured city-centric artwork, in a series we called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092250/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycalbumart">NYC Album Art</a>... but it looks like we missed a couple! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092250/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2011/04/30/when-rock-album-covers-featured-new-york-city/">Ephemeral NY</a> has a list of more album art today, including Steely Dan&apos;s <em>Pretzel Logic</em> cover, and Simon and Garfunkel&apos;s first album.</p>

<p>The latter was shot around 1964 at the 53rd Street subway station (check out that trash can!). The site notes, &quot;Art Garfunkel has said that they took hundreds of shots on the platform before finally getting the right one.&quot; At a concert once, Simon explained, &quot;See how mad we look, how angry? We were there for about a half-hour, taking all these pictures. And after we finished them, we looked and right behind us in very clear print was: &apos;F*ck You&#x2019;... we immediately told Columbia Records that this was exactly what we wanted on the cover of the LP.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Over to Steely Dan&#x2014;their cover for <em>Pretzel Logic</em> was shot in 1974 just inside Central Park off of 5th Avenue. That&#x2019;s a real pretzel vendor, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092250/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/music/nyc_greatest_hits_6WkRrJ9VFgt4U6JF2MoQsK#ixzz1LEgDFqyF">the Post</a> has some more info on the photo shoot. Donald Fagen told them it was Walter Becker&apos;s idea to feature a New York photo on the album cover, saying, &#x201C;We were living out in LA, and I guess we were homesick.&quot; Photographer Raeanne Robinson photographed 13 pretzel vendors in one day, and Fagen says, &#x201C;That particular vendor had the joi de vivre we were after. And he was the most creative speller.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What other albums have featured New York City shots on their covers (<a href="&lt;a href=" http:="" gothamist.com="" tags="" nycalbumart"="">besides all of these</a>)?</p>
