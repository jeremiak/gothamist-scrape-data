<p>Last month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115830/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/21/tagging_couple_arrested.php">a Queens couple</a> was caught tagging international property, as well as plenty of surfaces in NYC. Now , <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115830/http://www.wnbc.com/news/17505440/detail.html?rss=ny&amp;psp=news">WNBC reports</a> that authorities said &quot;a resident of the Netherlands who came to New York as a &apos;graffiti tourist&apos; has been indicted on charges of spray painting a subway car and leading police on a dangerous chase.&quot; The chase occurred down the subway tracks! And the 23-year-old Robbert Boxem (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115830/http://www.flickr.com/photos/5ek/2426920540/">KRAE</a>) now faces charges of criminal mischief and reckless endangerment. Boxem was allegedly here for the international graffiti event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115830/http://wallstreetmeeting.de/?p=542">Meeting of Styles</a>.</p>
