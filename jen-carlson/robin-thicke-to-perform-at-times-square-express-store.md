<p>Remember how in the 1980s&#x2014;&apos;90s?&#x2014;you spent all that hard-earned afterschool job money on clothes from The Express&#x2014;The Limited?&#x2014;at the mall? That store is still around, and now lives in New York City&apos;s mall: Times Square (where it just soft-opened). Maybe everyone already knows this. Anyway, what you <em>may not know</em> is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040412/http://gothamist.com/tags/robinthicke">Robin Thicke</a> (who may or may not be a marketing robot created BY the Express) will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040412/http://ny.racked.com/archives/2014/03/10/welcome_express_to_times_square_with_a_robin_thicke_performance.php">performing there</a> on March 25th. It&apos;s perfect since the last time you shopped at the store his dad was on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040412/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088527/">a television show</a> you probably watched. And ladies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040412/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2577084/Robin-Thicke-tries-AGAIN-win-Paula-Patton-preaches-NYC-concert-never-giving-special-someone.html">he&apos;s siiiiiingle</a>.</p>
