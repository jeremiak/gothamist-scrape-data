</div></div>					<p>New York has embraced the shipping container, using it for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305053920/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/13/new_in_williamsburg_shipping_contai.php">housing</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305053920/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/06/brooklyn_bridge_park_pool.php">BQE barriers</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305053920/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/31/shipping_containers_now_being_used.php#photo-1">vending machines</a>, so why not a sauna? Look no further than to our friends to the North&#x2014;Castor Design Studio in Canada have created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305053920/http://castordesign.ca/#/furniture/sauna-box">The Sauna Box</a>, a self-contained sauna in an 8-foot, solar-powered shipping container. They note: &quot;The Sauna Box is completely self-sufficient, with solar power and a wood-fired stove. The box comes standard with iPod stereo, electric guitar hook-up, castor stool, magnetic truck light and bronze antlers. <em>How are these not all over Brooklyn?</em></p>

<p>The Sauna Box costs $41,000 a pop (keep in mind, that&apos;s <em>with the antlers</em>), but surely someone can DIY this model. If we&apos;re not invited to a sauna box foam party in a shipping container before Spring, Portland wins.
