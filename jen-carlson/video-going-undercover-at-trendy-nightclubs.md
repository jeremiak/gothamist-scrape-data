title: Video: Going Undercover at Trendy Nightclubs
---

	
										<p>There have been too many headlines penned about crimes against women in the city&apos;s clubs. Inside Edition has now gone undercover, placing hidden cameras inside what they dub the &quot;trendiest clubs&quot; here. Their investigation lasted a month, during which time they also surveyed women on their safety. They report back that &quot;42% of women surveyed have felt threatened by men inside or outside a bar or nightclub.&quot; The show obtained the below footage taken from Marquee&apos;s surveillance camera about five months ago, showing a female&apos;s limp body being dragged out of the club by a man, who kidnapped and raped her.</p>

<p>The man in the video is 39-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915002920/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/22/man_charged_with_rape_after_abducting_a_woman_from_marquee.php">Luis Zambrano</a>, who pleaded guilty to the charge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915002920/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/fiend_fesses_to_raping_passed_out_4J1F8ijTKBAOjXzTFK9U2K">earlier this month</a>. Lisa Friel, the Chief of the Manhattan District Attorney&apos;s Sex Crimes Unit, told the show, &quot;Zambrano is not unusual.  The fact that we have him on videotape is the unusual part. Not a week goes by that we don&apos;t get one of these cases coming into the unit to investigate.&quot; According to their study, &quot;13% said they woke up somewhere after a night of drinking at a club and had no idea how they got there.&quot; Read more on the disturbing report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915002920/http://www.insideedition.com/news.aspx?storyId=3398">here</a>, and think about staying in tonight, ladies.</p>
