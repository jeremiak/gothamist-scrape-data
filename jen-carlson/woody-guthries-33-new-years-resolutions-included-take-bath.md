<p>What was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521120544/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyguthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> hoping to change for himself in 1942? This is an unearthed list of his resolutions for that year, which include: Work more and better, take bath, shave, save dough, play and sing good, dance better, love everybody, and wake up and fight. By 1943, he was roaming the streets of New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521120544/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/flashback_when_woody_guthrie_roamed.php">with his Facist-Killing Machine</a> and a clean shave, so he definitely accomplished a few of these goals.
