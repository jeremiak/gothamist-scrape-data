										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phprnP43gPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414122752im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phprnP43gPM.jpg" width="350" height="262" class="image-left"> </span>Sure, proposing on the bustling pedestrian walkway of the Brooklyn Bridge <em>seems</em> picturesque, but perhaps being up there holding on to a tiny ring with your nervous, sweaty, about-to-propose hands isn&apos;t actually the best idea. One would-be-groom has learned that the hard way, and he showed up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414122752/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30011573/">on the <em>Today</em> show</a> earlier to tell his harrowing tale.</p>

<p>Don Walling got down on one knee in front of his fiancee-to-be, Gina Pellicani, but &quot;then the ring flew out of the box and fell to the roadway below.&quot; Whoops-a-daisy! Acting fast (and not so sensibly) he climbed down the bridge to get to the roadway, triggering a suicide jumper alert! Once he convinced the NYPD he wasn&apos;t looking to take the big dive, they helped stop traffic and he was actually able to retrieve the ring as his would-be-fiance and her family were watching (and filming) all along through the giant gaps in the walkway planks.</p>

<p>Could you imagine if she didn&apos;t say &quot;yes&quot;? The <em>Today</em> segment is after the jump, and it includes the footage the family filmed atop the bridge.</p>
