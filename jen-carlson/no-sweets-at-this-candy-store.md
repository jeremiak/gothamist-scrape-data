<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpbgPwu9PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140454im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpbgPwu9PM.jpg" width="130" height="97" class="image-right"> </span>For some reason the NY Times&apos; new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140454/http://fort-greene.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/at-a-local-candy-store-but-where-are-the-mars-bars/#more-623">Local blog</a> recently did some leg work to find out what exactly is behind the uninviting doors of the Putnam Candy Store, located at 10 Putnam Avenue and Grand in Brooklyn. Is anyone surprised that it&apos;s not candy? Their colorful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140454/http://putnamcandystore.lbu.com/">website</a> and promise of the sweet stuff on their sign aside, the appearance doesn&apos;t exactly scream Wonka, and even councilwoman Letitia James is suspicious. She told the blog, &#x201C;<strong>There&#x2019;s a lot of traffic, people going in and out. I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;d attribute that to &#x2014; a lot of people buying milk, or people buying something stronger.</strong> Grand and Putnam has been a challenge since I first got elected. It&#x2019;s improved greatly but we still have our challenges, and the candy store may be one of them.&#x201D; Meanwhile, locals declare they would never procure their lollipops from the place, and they suspect some illegal activity as well&#x2014;but the 88th precinct swears the shop is &#x201C;a legitimate business as far as we know.&#x201D; When the reporter knocked on the door, however, there only seemed to be some old men drinking beer, who quickly directed him to the bodega across the street.</p>
