<p>Someone is up to something! There aren&apos;t a lot of details, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150055/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tlg/2553483934.html">a Craigslist ad</a> reads: &quot;We&apos;re recreating important episodes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150055/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> using children ages 1-5.&quot; Smoking, drinking, affair-having babies. Actually, the poster clarifies, &quot;The actors don&apos;t need to be able to talk, as we&apos;re dubbing over the dialogue, but they do need to be able to hold a cup (of apple juice, not scotch). Bonus if they have their own suits.&quot; Well, this will be adorable... as long as they don&apos;t recreate the lawn mower scene.</p>

<p>We contacted the poster for more details, and will update when/if we hear back. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150055/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/mad-men-with-babies-coming-soon">Buzzfeed</a>]</p>
