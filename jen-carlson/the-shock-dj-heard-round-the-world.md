While there&apos;s been some high-profile stupid DJ behavior in the past  - Hot 97&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.gothamist.com/2005/01/24/hot_97_in_hot_water.php">Tsunami Song</a>, Opie &amp; Anthony <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/opieanthony1.html">broadcasting a couple having sex at St. Patrick&apos;s</a>, DJ Star asking listeners for information where a radio rival&apos;s young daughter goes to school <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/05/12/nypd_doesnt_lik.php">so he could ejaculate and pee on her</a> - the last week has been a doozy. </p>

<p>First <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/04/03/923.php">the 92.3 Doghouse DJs</a> called New York band A Brief Smile: &quot;faggots&quot; (amongst other things). Then last Wednesday Don Imus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/07/arts/television/07imus.htm?_r=1&amp;oref=login">called the Rutgers&apos; women &quot;nappy-headed hos&quot;</a> during his morning show (which airs to millions of listeners on more than 70 stations nationwide as well as the MSNBC television channel). The remark went something like this: </p><blockquote>&quot;That&apos;s some rough girls from Rutgers,&quot; Imus said. &quot;Man, they got tattoos ...&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;Some hardcore hos,&quot; said [producer Bernard] McGuirk.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s some nappy-headed hos there, I&apos;m going to tell you that,&quot; Imus said.</p></blockquote>After the furor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036713/">Imus apologized</a> saying, &#x201C;I want to take a moment to apologize for an insensitive and ill-conceived remark we made the other morning regarding the Rutgers women&#x2019;s basketball team. It was completely inappropriate, and we can understand why people were offended. Our characterization was thoughtless and stupid, and we are sorry.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Many are calling the apology &quot;too little, too late&quot;. Reverend Al Sharpton is among those not turning a deaf ear. He stated on Saturday, &quot;I accept his apology, just as I want his bosses to accept his resignation.&quot; He promised to picket Imus&apos;s New York radio home, WFAN-AM, unless Imus is gone within a week. CBS, which owns WFAN, the station that broadcasts Imus, and MSNBC say they are &quot;reviewing&quot; and &quot;monitoring&quot; the situation, but haven&apos;t made any moves to fire him.  And yesterday, Reverend Jesse Jackson said his Rainbow Push Coalition would picket outside the Chicago NBC affiliates.  However, Imus has been around forever - and is actually gaining new listeners.</p>

<p>According to the NY Times, last year he increased his (MSNBC) viewers by 100,000, for an average daily total of 358,000, per Nielsen estimates - and this is hardly the first time Imus has used racist or sexist slurs in his broadcast. In fact, in 2001 he took a pledge, guided by the Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, to refrain from making further racist comments on his program (he reportedly called Gwen Ifill &quot;a cleaning lady&quot; - though this morning he denied making the comment). Jackson also noted the sexist nature of Imus&apos;s words, &quot;Women ought to protest, and men who have a mother, daughter or wife ought to protest.&quot;  Interestingly, Imus recently criticized Katie Couric&apos;s performance on the CBS Evening News; while that&apos;s nothing new, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://newsbusters.org/node/11504">Imus said</a>, &quot;Doing little stupid chit-chat stuff on an idiotic morning show on NBC has nothing to do with sitting down and doing the news. That&apos;s big-boy television.&quot;  Which makes us think Couric should go out and interview the Rutgers women&apos;s basketball team.</p>

<p>Today, Imus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.amny.com/news/local/am-imus0409,0,1430093.story?coll=am-topheadlines">apologized again on his broadcast</a>.  From the AP:</p><blockquote>Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve learned: that you can&apos;t make fun of everybody, because some people don&apos;t deserve it,&quot; he said on his nationally syndicated radio show Monday morning. &quot;And because the climate on this program has been what it&apos;s been for 30 years doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s going to be what it&apos;s been for the next five years or whatever.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Imus said he was &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the remarks, in which he referred to the mostly black team as &quot;nappy-headed hos.&quot; He said he had made the comments in the course of &quot;trying to be funny,&quot; but he was not trying to excuse them.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m not a bad person. I&apos;m a good person, but I said a bad thing. But these young women deserve to know it was not said with malice,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote>He added that he was appearing on Al Sharpton&apos;s radio show and was grateful for that opportunity.  Is it too much to hope that Sharpton will rip him a couple new ones?<p></p>

<p>Imus&apos;s onetime sports-update announcer, Sid Rosenberg, was fired when he said about Kylie Minogue, who was fighting breast cancer, she &quot;ain&apos;t gonna be so beautiful when the bitch got a bald head and one titty.&quot;  And in 2004 Imus, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imus_Ranch">a ranch in New Mexico</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://gawker.com/news/media/don-imus-sued-for-being-a-paranoid-jackass-26540.php?mail2=true">fired his son&apos;s nanny</a> labeling her &quot;as dangerous and a &apos;terrorist,&apos;&quot; after she gave his son a cap gun to play with while on vacation there (the Brooklynite promptly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180506/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1130041imus1.html">sued</a>). </p>
