title: [UPDATED] Brooklyn Residents Win War Against Hollywood... For Now

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="francbk05123.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113649im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/francbk05123.jpeg" width="349" height="360"> <br> <i style=" width:349px; ;display:block">&quot;Get off my stoop James Franco!&quot; &#x2014; Someone, probably</i></div> In case there was ever any doubt that New Yorkers could really care less about seeing celebrities in the flesh, the amount of complaints about A-listers flooding to film in certain neighborhoods should just about prove it. The latest locals to win the war against film crews reside in DUMBO and Brooklyn Heights, where they&apos;ve actually been harping on Hollywood to put a halt to filming in the area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113649/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/18/dumbo_residents_still_being_held_ho.php">for over a year now</a>.<p></p>

<p>The Mayor&#x2019;s Office of Media and Entertainment finally put a temporary moratorium on productions in both areas last month, where these people have been suffering from sightings of famous Hollywood celebrities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113649/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/photo_daniel_radcliffe_as_allen_gin.php">like Daniel Radcliffe</a> <em>when all they want to do is enjoy the beautiful scenery in their affluent neighborhood and be able to find parking for their designer cars</em>. There&apos;s not even a support group they can go to! What&apos;s that famous quote... &quot;Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113649/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/19/dtg_dumbomovies_2012_05_11_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, &quot;production companies have not filmed any movies, television shows, or commercials in large parts of the historic neighborhoods since April 1st,&quot; though a small number of productions can shoot on Gold Street, between Plymouth and Front Street this spring (after all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113649/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/film_and_tv_productions_spent_over.php">show biz means big bucks</a>.) </p>

<p>The ban should be lifted in two months, at which point you&apos;ll once again have a chance to see good looking actors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113649/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/07/good_looking_actors_infiltrate_broo.php">loafing around on Brownstone stoops</a>&#x2014;c&apos;mon people, life could have thrown you bigger problems.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Chris Coffey, the Assistant Commissioner at the NYC Mayor&apos;s Office of Media &amp; Entertainment, tells us, &quot;Brooklyn is open for business, including Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo... while we balance the needs of residents, it is also our primary mission to get people to make their production in this City. Film and TV employs 130,000 New Yorkers. Those are real jobs for real New Yorkers. It generated $7.1 Billion for the City&#x2019;s economy in 2011 and we are going for even more this year.&quot; We asked if production had been pulled back at all, and we were told:</p><blockquote>&quot;There were blocks only in DUMBO which for 6-8 weeks-ish we avoided issuing any film/tv permits because of either construction, paving, or a lot of movies and television. We are always looking at neighborhoods for just that. As of April 1st, even those blocks are back in limited productions now.&quot;</blockquote> So you can go ahead and keep complaining, everyone.<p></p>
