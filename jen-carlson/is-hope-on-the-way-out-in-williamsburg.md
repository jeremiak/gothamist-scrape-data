title: Is Hope on the Way Out in Williamsburg?

										<p><img alt="php8PGBkDPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228001149im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php8PGBkDPM.jpg" width="350" height="262" class="left">Just when you thought hope was on the way, the NYPD comes to beat it out of you. Silly, silly cops--when will they learn that everything is caught on camera(phone)? Unsurprisingly, more and more video footage from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228001149/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/05/celebration_leads_to_arrests_in_wil.php">the Election Night arrests</a> on North 7th and Bedford in Williamsburg has found its way online. There&apos;s shoving with riot gear, excessive force, swearing, smashing of cameras and phones and a lot of pent up anger being taken out on celebratory Obama supporters (see below, and after the jump). </p>

<p>More information about those arrested is also coming out. We talked to one girl who was taken in for flipping a cop off; while she was given a ticket for disorderly conduct, her story has a bit of a happy ending. Forced to leave her bike behind as she was handcuffed, she just found it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228001149/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mis/906737150.html">on Craigslist</a> where the good samaritan offers to bring it back and writes &quot;I took your bike when the cop with it had no idea what to do with it.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ben Lord (who is shown being arrested in one of the videos), tells us, &quot;they tried pushing through a felony charge but it got dropped to a misdemeanor class A...plus three counts of disorderly conduct. They were going to let me out after about 4 hrs when I was just at the 94th, but then the cop came in complaining about his broken finger and I was put back in the cell.&quot; And allegedly an arresting officer was heard saying: &quot;Everyone&apos;s just pissed because our taxes are going to go up&quot; (one was even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228001149/http://ventriloquismnyc.wordpress.com/2008/11/06/calling-bullshit-on-the-obama-nypd-arrests/">wearing a McCain/Palin shirt</a> down in the precinct).</p>

<p>More after the jump, and you can let the 94th Precinct&apos;s Finest know how you feel about it all at their next monthly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228001149/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=10811">meeting on November 17th</a>.</p>
