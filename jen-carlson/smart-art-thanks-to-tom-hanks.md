<p>Say what you will about street art, or whatever this might be categorized under, but this should make even the most soulless grump in town crack a smile. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201346/http://urbanprankster.com/2009/07/tom-hanks-trash-can/">Urban Prankster</a> posted this image today, but it was actually taken at an unnamed NYC pizza joint back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201346/http://zoomdoggle.com/2009/01/quick-whats-your-favorite-thing-about-today-thanks/">in January</a>.
