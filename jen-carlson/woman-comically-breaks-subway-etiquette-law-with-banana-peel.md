<p>How about a round of applause for this self-absorbed straphanger and the delightful devil-may-care attitude plastered on her face on this morning&apos;s commute, during which she occupied coveted seating space with her baggage and food remnants. This still-life, depicting a Seriously Self-Important New York Businesswoman And Her Junk, seems almost <em>too </em>perfect, as if she curated the whole tableau last night as she was falling asleep...</p>

<p>&quot;No, no no, the bag&apos;s been done before! It needs something else. Something playful. Keep the bag, but... add this banana. No, JUST the peel. It&apos;s perfect... equal parts Groucho Marx and Giovanna Garzoni. Of course, the subtle slapstick will no doubt go over my fellow straphangers&apos; heads, and someone will take a photo and post it on the internet, creating my own cult of condemnation in the comments section... but this is the price I pay for my art.&quot;</p>

<p>Or maybe she&apos;s just consumed by her own selfishness and blissfully unaware that on this morning&apos;s uptown 5 train, commuters were standing as her banana peel rested peacefully on the last would-be open seat. The tipster who sent this photo in tells us:</p><blockquote>&quot;Saw this woman on the uptown 5 this morning at around 9:15 a.m. She had set up a cozy little corner for herself and was eating a banana... The banana was taking up the last open seat [and] leaving a smear of banana stuff all over for the next commuter to sit on.&quot;</blockquote>It doesn&apos;t come up often, but food smearing <em>is</em> one of the worst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124617/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette offenses</a>.<p></p>
