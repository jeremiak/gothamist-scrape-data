<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422014656/http://gothamist.com/tags/tacobell">Taco Bell</a>&apos;s breakfast menu won&apos;t be rolling out until next year, they have now introduced one of the items that will be on it: Cinnabon Delights. The perfect way to start off your day is with a pastry rolled in sugar and filled with frosting. Followed by a Red Bull and a couple smokes. </p>

<p>The Cinnabon Delights will be offered nationwide starting now&#x2014;and according to the press release they&apos;ll be available all day. So why stop at breakfast&#x2014;get four every hour and consume your way to an early coffin, because you can&apos;t beat this price: four will just cost you around $1.50 (260 calories, 15g fat, your happiness). This guy likes them enough: </p>
