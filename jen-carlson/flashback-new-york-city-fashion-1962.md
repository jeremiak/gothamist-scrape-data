</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ve looked back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420161524/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/09/flashback_7.php">1969</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420161524/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/flashback_8.php">1949</a> fashions spotted in New York City, and now here&apos;s a look at what women were wearing in 1962. This is around the <em>Mad Men</em> era, so you&apos;re probably familiar with the early &apos;60s style as seen on Joan Holloway and Betty Draper. These photos come from LIFE magazine, all taken in New York City in 1962, for a story they ran about stores introducing their &quot;line for line&quot; copies of Paris fashions.
