title: Videos: Spend An Hour In 1960s New York City
---

	
										<p>Last time around we traveled to the Upper West Side <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130070518/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/video_spend_an_hour_on_72nd_street.php">circa the early 1980s</a>, now let&apos;s check out the city in motion in the 1960s. Travel back in time to how New York looked around half a century ago&#x2014;the footage below shows everything from landmarks, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130070518/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/15/park_slope_plane.php">that plane crash over Park Slope</a>, to bohemian Greenwich Village, to the World&apos;s Fair. You&apos;ll also get some candid footage of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130070518/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/marilyn_monroes_time_at_payne_whitn.php#photo-1">Marilyn Monroe</a> in Manhattan. Did we mention a lion emerges from the subway in one of these clips? As one narrator declares: Nothing is humdrum in the city!</p>
