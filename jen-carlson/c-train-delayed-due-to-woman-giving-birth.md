Per station agent.&quot; It&apos;s just so much less frustrating when delays are caused by the miracle of life. The MTA confirms, noting on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164751/http://mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html">their site</a>, &quot;Due to someone requiring medical assistance at the Nostrand Avenue Station, Manhattan-bound trains are running on the express track between the Broadway Junction Station and the Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street Station. Expect delays.&quot; <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Word is the mom went into labor on the train but gave birth in a hospital.</p>
