<p>This morning&apos;s bacon may not have been your last, but it may have been <em>one of</em> the last times you&apos;ll so easily and cheaply land sizzling pork on your plate&#x2014;as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143211/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/25/global_bacon_shortage_is_now_unavoi.php">we heard earlier</a>, Britain&apos;s National Pig Association says &quot;a world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable.&quot; But fear not, THERE IS ALWAYS FAKE BACON, and it is 100% less fleshy and just as good. Seriously, in the world of fake grocery store meats, it&apos;s the bacon that really excels, and here are some that you should stock in your bacon bunker for when the End Of Days arrives.</p>

<p><strong>MORNINGSTAR VEGGIE BACON STRIPS:</strong> This is hands down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143211/http://www.morningstarfarms.com/morningstar-farms-veggie-bacon-strips.html">the best fake bacon</a> out there. You can microwave it, you can put it on a skillet... either way it comes out crispy! And it makes your kitchen smell like real bacon. (Note: the author of this post hasn&apos;t eaten real bacon for decades and probably doesn&apos;t know what it actually smells like.) You can always find this at Trader Joe&apos;s in the freezer section, and many smaller markets also carry it.</p>

<p><strong>LIGHTLIFE SMART BACON:</strong> It&apos;s no Morningstar, but it&apos;ll do in a pinch. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143211/http://www.lightlife.com/Vegan-Food-Vegetarian-Diet/Smart-Bacon">Lightlife</a> does most fake meat products well, and this is no exception. We would recommend cooking these up on a skillet until they get crispy, otherwise they&apos;ll just fall limp and be a little too Canadian-bacon-like (not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that). Drizzle a little wax from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143211/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/27/edible_bacon_fat_candle_is_in_town.php">that edible bacon candle</a> on top, and you&apos;re good to go.</p>

<p><strong>TEMPEH BACON:</strong> The texture is not at all bacon-like with tempeh, but some actually prefer that. These strips are also courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505143211/http://www.lightlife.com/Vegan-Food-Vegetarian-Diet/Organic-Smoky-Tempeh-Strips">Lightlife</a> (though other brands make them as well), who describe their Fakin&apos; Bacon product as having &quot;a rich, bold flavor [that] brings that smoky, savory flavor to sandwiches, salads, or baked as a main course.&quot; These really are best enjoyed on a vegetarian BLT.</p>

<p>And if you really want to go crazy raw vegan with this, try the <strong>COCONUT MEAT</strong> technique:</p>
