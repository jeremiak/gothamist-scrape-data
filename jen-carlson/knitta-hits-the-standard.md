<p>In honor of Fashion Week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194945/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/knitta_please_hits_montague_street.php">KnittaPlease</a> installed some of their crafty graffiti outside of the Standard Hotel. The knit pieces will remain there until the 17th, but when we first heard about this project we were sort of hoping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194945/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/20/magda_sayeg_knittaplease.php">Magda Sayeg</a> would be knitting coverups for the hotel&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194945/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/28/standard_rear_window_view_on_the_hi.php">naked guests</a>.
