<p>During last night&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200542/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/17/alec_baldwin_accuses_ny_post_photog.php">exclusive interview with Gothamist</a>, Alec Baldwin told us that the NY Post would be running a story this morning accusing him &quot;of using a racial epithet against&quot; one of their photographers. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200542/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/alec_fast_slur_ious_tzxXtwrX49oGHN1VaG08hM">lo and behold</a>, their EXCLUSIVE front page story declares: <strong>&quot;Alec&apos;s &apos;Race&apos; Rant. Black photog: Baldwin used racial slurs.&quot; </strong></p>

<p>The confrontation took place yesterday morning near Baldwin&apos;s home, while he was walking his dogs. Post reporter Tara Palmeri approached the actor for a comment about his wife being sued by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200542/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/17/grad_student_blames_alec_baldwins_w.php">one of her yoga students</a>. She reportedly recorded the confrontation, in which the actor allegedly tells her, &quot;I want you to choke to death,&quot; while grabbing her arm. The tabloid has a photo of Baldwin grabbing Palmeri&apos;s arm, in which the reporter is seen smiling like a starstruck fan. He then allegedly turned his attention to the photographer, G.N. Miller.</p>

<p>Last night, Baldwin, who has long battled paparazzi and various New York press outlets, told us: &quot;If you want to paint a picture of me that is a denigrating picture, I&apos;ve seen that. If you want to put words in my mouth... I&apos;ve certainly had my moments. But this is not one of them. <strong>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever uttered a racial epithet to someone in my lifetime</strong>.&quot; However, the tabloid claims he called Miller, their photographer&#x2014;who is &quot;a decorated retired detective with the NYPD&#x2019;s Organized Crime Control Bureau&quot;&#x2014; a &quot;crackhead,&quot; a &quot;coon,&quot; and &quot;drug dealer.&quot; The former comment was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200542/https://twitter.com/candicechoi/status/303505783004463106?uid=4283311&amp;iid=c4ad0f21-eb8b-4d10-826a-a2bbd1830939&amp;nid=27+234">allegedly in a Tweet</a> the actor later deleted, while other outbursts occurred on the street.</p>

<p>Miller says, &#x201C;He was saying some serious racist stuff. He said some choice words about my mother, and he was telling people in the street that I&#x2019;m a drug dealer.&quot; But this morning Baldwin reminds the masses that his foundation has donated to the Arthur Ashe Learning Center.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I find it ironic that my foundation&apos;s last grant was $50,000 to the Arthur Ashe Learning Center.</p>&#x2014; ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200542/https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/303516471814922240">February 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Both parties have filed harassment claims against each other&#x2014;however, unless someone can track down the &quot;dad pushing his child in a stroller&quot; that the Post claims Baldwin ran up to, the incident is purely he said-she said and will likely not go very far.</p>

<p>The NYPD press office declined to comment when we called this morning, and was unable to confirm if G.N. Miller is a former NYPD detective. We&apos;ve reached out to Baldwin and the NY Post for further comment, and will update when we hear back.</p>
