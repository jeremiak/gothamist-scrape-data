title: Video: No Wave Doc Resurrects Old East Village
---

<p>Celine Danhier&#x2019;s documentary <em>Blank City: The No Wave Years</em> focuses on the &apos;70s and &apos;80s underground No Wave movement, and its fixtures. In the trailer below you&apos;ll get a picture of what this mixture looks like, it includes John Waters, Jim Jarmusch, Blondie, Steve Buscemi, as well as some of the unofficial headquarters of the genre&#x2014;all in an East Village that would never <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706135040/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/local_comedy_venue_trying_to_turn_e.php">protest red curtains</a>. </p>

<p>Danhier says, &#x201C;New York was a very different and dangerous place to live then, like the Wild West. It was run-down and almost bankrupt. But from that, this amazing do-it-yourself attitude grew.&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706135040/http://blankcityfilm.com/">The doc&apos;s website</a> further explains, &quot;Blank City tells the long-overdue tale of a disparate crew of renegade filmmakers who emerged from an economically bankrupt and dangerous moment in New York history. In the late 1970&#x2032;s and mid 80&#x2032;s, when the city was still a wasteland of cheap rent and cheap drugs, these directors crafted daring works that would go on to profoundly influence the development of independent film as we know it today.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Steve Buscemi discussing the first feature film he was in, Eric Mitchell&#x2019;s <em>The Way It Is</em>, in the doc (which will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706135040/http://www.ifccenter.com/films/blank-city/">at the IFC Center</a> on April 6th):</p>
