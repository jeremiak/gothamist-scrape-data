<p>This rare piece of textile on display (starting today) at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524011923/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/spidersilk/?src=h_h">American Museum of Natural History</a> was made by one million wild <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524011923/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/arts/design/23spiders.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Golden Orb spiders</a> from Madagascar (they can grow up to the size of a human hand)! At least, they produced the silk for it. Nothing quite like spider silk to keep you warm in the winter&#x2014;Snuggie should get on that.</p>

<p>Some facts: It measures 11 feet by 4 feet and took four years to make using a painstaking technique developed more than 100 years ago. &quot;This unique textile draws on the legacy of a French missionary, Jacob Paul Cambou&#xE9;, who worked with spiders in Madagascar in the 1880s and 1890s. Previously, the only known spider-silk textile of note was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900, and it was subsequently lost.&quot;</p>
