<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151107233737/http://www.patinagroup.com/restaurant.php?restaurants_id=74">the Rink at Rockefeller Center</a> opened, signaling the start of ice skating season. There&apos;s nothing more iconic and innocent than taking a few spins on the famous patch of midtown ice, but this year a new package they&apos;re offering could ruin it for some.</p>

<p>Yesterday we received a press release alerting us to the &#x201C;VIP Express Skating&#x201D; pass, which will be available from November 16th through January 7th. While it&apos;s not quite the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151107233737/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2078149/Inside-Suris-5-000-ice-skating-adventure-Tom-Cruise-Katie-Holmes-splash-VIP-experience-year-old.html">Suri Cruise experience</a>, the $95 <em>per person</em> pass (skating rates currently start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151107233737/http://patinagroup.com/restaurants/74/menus/Ice-Rink-PRE-HOLIDAY-schedule.pdf">at $6.50</a>) gives guests VIP reservations, allowing them to &quot;<strong>bypass the line and enjoy admission, skate rental, hot cocoa, and a friendly skate concierge</strong>.&quot; But what about all those kids who want to take part in the magical experience whose parents can&apos;t afford it? They&apos;re just going to have to wait a little longer as the rich kids cut them in line.</p>

<p>A rep for Rock Center confirmed with us yesterday that &quot;this is the first year that guests can make VIP reservations all day.&quot; We failed to ask what a &quot;skate concierge&quot; is, but... we don&apos;t even want to know. (That said, we would probably pay that outrageous fee if we could get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151107233737/http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinyca/4278136860/">ride on the zamboni</a>.)<br>

We&apos;ll have a full guide of where else you can ice skate in NYC (including more details on Rock Center&apos;s other pricing and packages) coming up later today!</p>
