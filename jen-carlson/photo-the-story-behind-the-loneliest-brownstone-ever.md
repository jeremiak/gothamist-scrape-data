<p>About five years ago we came across <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514055758/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/10/flashback_last_brownstone_standing.php">a striking photo</a> of a brownstone on the Upper East Side... the last one standing, a field of rubble behind it. The photo, from the LIFE magazine archives, was accompanied by little information&#x2014;the caption simply read: &quot;Construction in NYC: land being cleared for 20 story building in East 60s&#x2014;still occupied brownstone is soon to go.&quot;</p>

<p>After a little digging we found out the photo, taken in 1959, was of a brownstone located at 215 East 68th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. Across the street where the numbers were even, there were 16 brownstones that got to stay&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514055758/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/realestate/06scap.html">the NY Times</a> once pointed out that they were &quot;built as a piece in 1881 [by] developer John D. Crimmins&#x2014;&apos;No more than six of them will look alike, and no monotony will spoil the aspect of this new row of houses.&apos;&quot; While those have survived (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514055758/https://www.google.com/maps/preview/@40.766646,-73.96117,3a,90y,211.4h,90.91t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sX8PuWfSbwupzFUX0CjBdKA!2e0!6m1!1e1?hl=en">to this day</a>), back on the north side the brownstones were being leveled for a new development. </p>

<p>The brownstone seen standing here was at one time the home of poet and writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514055758/http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/618">Stephen Vincent Benet</a>, according to this illustration at the Museum of the City of New York (dated 7 years after his death, however). </p>

<p>Additionally, the 1960 film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514055758/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68432/Bells-Are-Ringing/articles.html"><em>Bells Are Ringing</em></a> also has ties to the brownstone. The director, Vincente Minnelli, &quot;wanted some establishing shots of New York, including an exterior of the shabby building where Susanswerphone&apos;s basement headquarters was located. He was having no luck finding the right location, until he saw a picture in LIFE magazine of a lone brownstone standing in the middle of a razed block on East 68th Street.&quot; Below, you can see the building as seen in the film (at the 1:20 mark): </p>

<p>And around the 45-second mark here:</p>

<p>The building that took over the space contains around 600 rental units, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514055758/http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/4/prweb10597492.htm">was just given a facelift</a> last year&#x2014;&quot;the old, deteriorating white brick fa&#xE7;ade of the building has been removed and the entire building has been re-clad with terra cotta panels.&quot; And the circle of life continues...</p>

<p>(And no, this is not the <em>Batteries Not Included*</em> building&#x2014;you can learn more about THAT brownstone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514055758/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/batteries_not_included_building.php">right here</a>.)</p>
