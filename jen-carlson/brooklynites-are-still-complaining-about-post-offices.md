<p>New York&apos;s post offices offer terrible service, if you haven&apos;t heard. Old school haters have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225701/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/08/post_office.php">been complaining</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225701/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/16/post_office_1.php">for years</a>, but nothing has improved. In fact, things have probably only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225701/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/25/open_letter_to_the_usps_re_this_ful.php">gotten worse</a>. And according to this map, it looks like our glass is still half empty, Brooklyn, with only 3 post offices getting high ratings. Actually, maybe all this complaining <em>has</em> helped!
