<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414040502/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-fleetwood-mac-will-return-next-year-20110830"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, Lindsey Buckingham declared that next year, <strong>Fleetwood Mac will be &quot;doing something for sure. I wouldn&apos;t be shocked if it was a tour and possibly an album.</strong> We&apos;ll have to wait and see. Nothing is on the books right now. With Fleetwood Mac, there&apos;s a lot of landmines out there politically and it&apos;s hard to get everybody on the same page at the same time&#x2014;but I think this might be one of those years where everyone will want to do the same thing. Whatever that is.&quot; YES, as long as it&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414040502/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/gothamist_editors_debate_should_bre.php">collaborating with Bret Michaels</a>.</p>

<p>For now, Buckingham has his own solo album coming out on September 6th, and kicks off a tour this fall; Stevie Nicks is also currently touring her 2010 solo album (she&apos;s at Jones Beach this weekend). And word is the two may finally release their 1973 LP, recorded under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414040502/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Nicks">Buckingham Nicks</a> when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414040502/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609042/fleetwood-macs-stevie-nicks-talks-lindsey-buckingam.jhtml">were dating</a>, on CD&#x2014;he says they &quot;have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can&apos;t put any specifics on that.&quot; </p>

<p>Can we also give one-time <em>Rumours</em> B-side &quot;Silver Springs&quot; some more attention? Nicks actually told <em>Rolling Stone</em> two years ago (during the band&apos;s last tour) that the song &quot;was me realizing that Lindsey was going to haunt me for the rest of my life, and he has.&quot;</p>
