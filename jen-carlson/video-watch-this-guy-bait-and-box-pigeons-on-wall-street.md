<p>We just stumbled across this footage of a man baiting and trapping pigeons on Wall Street last week... you know, during our afternoon search for fresh pigeon videos. The uploader, who did an amazing job soundtracking the video with &quot;Free Bird,&quot; writes: &quot;The Crocodile Hunter has got nothing on The Pigeon Trapper, as he does a little food shopping on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.&quot; It&apos;s safe to say these pigeons are either being trained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032011/http://gothamist.com/tags/pigeonracing">to race</a>, or have been cooked up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032011/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/27/how-to_video_dont_worry_theres_alwa.php">squirrel style</a> by now... what do you think?</p>
