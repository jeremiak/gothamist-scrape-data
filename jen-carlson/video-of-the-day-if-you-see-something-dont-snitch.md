										<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525063627/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/04/20/camron_must_rea.php">previews of the segment</a> last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525063627/http://therapup.blogspot.com/2007/04/video-stop-snitchin-on-cbs-60-minutes.html">The Rap Up shares video</a> of Anderson Cooper&apos;s chat with Cam&apos;ron on 60 Minutes to discuss the &quot;no snitching&quot; rule prevalent in the rap community. Tupac, Notorious B.I.G. and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525063627/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/04/18/jam_master_jay.php">Jam Master Jay</a> are all examples of murders that have gone unsolved. More recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525063627/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/02/06/busta.php">Busta Rhymes bodyguard</a>, Israel Ramirez, was shot and killed at a video shoot; out of the 25 people believed to be present during the crime - no one has come forward. </p>

<p>Even Cam&apos;ron himself was shot twice, and won&apos;t say who did it. When Anderson asks him if there&apos;s ever a time when it&apos;s appropriate to talk to the police, Cam&apos;ron says, &quot;Sure. Say &apos;Hello, How ya feelin&apos;?&apos;&quot; That&apos;s it, because there&apos;s a strict &quot;no snitching&quot; rule that&apos;s become a cultural norm in some communities, which leads to worries that criminals can wield more power. Take a look:</p>

Part two can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525063627/http://videos.onsmash.com/v/qt5LK3cmSyLVwTcY">here</a>, and touches more upon the kids who look up to and listen to every word these rappers say. The kids, from a church-based organization, agree with Cam&apos;ron - saying it&apos;s a crime to snitch. In the end everyone seems to agree that in the music world, there are &quot;huge corporate profits&quot; resulting from all of this. Makes one seriously doubt that Russell Simmons will be able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525063627/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/04/24/russell_simmons.php">take offensive words out of hip hop lyrics</a>. 

</p><p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525063627/http://www.allhiphop.com/editorial/?ID=363">AllHipHop</a> has &quot;written &apos;21 Questions&apos; and situations in order to test the strength of the Harlemite&apos;s &apos;No snitching&apos; policy.&quot;<br>
