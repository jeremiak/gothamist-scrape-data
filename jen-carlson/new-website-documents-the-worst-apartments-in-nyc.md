<p>Last night we sat down with a friend at a sidewalk table for a single glass of wine and, even though we were about 3 feet away from a giant pile of garbage bags that had been sitting under the warming sun all day, we thought: <em>This is Heaven.</em> </p>

<p>And it is often with that mentality that we embrace whatever real estate options we have when trying to find a new place to live. No windows, but an extra large fire escape? Perfect! 6&apos; ceilings, but a walk-in closet? What luck! Carpeting that smells like cheese... but look at that view!</p>

<p>However, even with such a silver lining outlook, it can become mentally exhausting when you go to The Dark Side. You know, when your friends are all like <em>totally bragging</em> about their new sprinkler system that is going to water their lush, green lawn and you don&apos;t even have sunlight to keep your plants alive? When you are driven to such a dark place about the state of your life as a New Yorker, sacrificing a savings account to live in a basement with no windows and a hot plate you&apos;ve named Robbie who keeps you company at night, then visit this new Tumblr, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104223/http://theworstroom.tumblr.com/">The Worst Room</a>, and know you are not alone.</p>
