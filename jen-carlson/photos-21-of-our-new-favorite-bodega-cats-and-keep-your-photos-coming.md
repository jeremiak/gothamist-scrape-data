</div></div>					<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064425/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/call_for_photos_we_want_to_see_your.php">we asked you</a> to send in photos of your favorite bodega cats, and you delivered! Click through for some photos of the adorable guys and gals that keep our foodstuffs safe from evil rodents. We kept the descriptions vague to protect the innocent. </p>

<p>And please keep sending photos to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064425/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tips@gothamist.com</a>, hashtagging them #Gothamist and #BodegaCat on Instagram, or tagging them &quot;Gothamist&quot; and &quot;Bodega Cat&quot; on Flickr. We&apos;ll keep this series going <em>furrrrever</em>.</p>
