A reader sent in photos shortly after, and the building the incident took place in is actually at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164621/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=338+Berry+St+brooklyn+ny&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=Oa32Sr2AN4bg8Qb4nNXzCQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ8gEwAA&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=338+Berry+St,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11211&amp;ll=40.711833,-73.962879&amp;spn=0.004017,0.008926&amp;t=h&amp;z=17">338 Berry</a>, between South 4th and South 5th streets &#x2014; a former noodle factory converted into various multi-use spaces, including residential lofts. The victim was at a party in the building being hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164621/http://theuniformprojectblog.com/annoucements/announcing-our-6-month-anniversary-party">the Uniform Project</a>. After the fall he was in serious condition, unconscious and unresponsive. We&apos;ll update when we get more details.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The victim, a 34-year-old male, has died. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164621/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7106721&amp;rss=rss-wabc-article-7106721">ABC News</a> is reporting that he &quot;was trying to jump out of a broken elevator when a piece of his clothing caught on something. He then fell five stories, to the bottom of the shaft.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> The man who died was Gerhardt (Jerry) Fuchs, drummer for the bands The Juan Maclean and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164621/http://www.myspace.com/maseratirocks">Maserati</a> (and former drummer for !!!); the latter just recently ended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164621/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/09/mono_maserati_p.html">a tour</a>. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164621/http://www.chunklet.com/index.cfm?section=blogs&amp;ID=571">friend writes</a> that he is survived by his parents, two sisters, a brother, and &quot;an impressive canon of records on which he&apos;s performed, countless mouth-agape audiences in awe of his work, dozens of heart-crushed former bandmates, and an endless parade of true friends around the world.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE III:</strong> His bandmates in Maserati <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164621/http://twitter.com/MASERATI_BAND/status/5541138029">have written</a> that they, &quot;with overwhelming sadness, bid farewell to our drummer and dear friend Jerry Fuchs. Love you, bro.&quot;</p>
