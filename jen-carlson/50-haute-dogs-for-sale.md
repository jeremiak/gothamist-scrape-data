<p>&apos;Tis the season... for restaurants to come up with ridiculously overpriced menu items as a way to get press, or to make us feel bad about our finances, or whatever the reason may be to add a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504090357/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/07/save_room_for_d.php">$25,000 dessert</a> to the menu. The latest comes to us from the Roosevelt Hotel&apos;s Vander Bar, but it turns out it&apos;s for a good cause. They&apos;ll be selling their $50 &quot;Teddy&apos;s Haute Dog&quot; (named for Theodore Roosevelt) to benefit the less fortunate via City Harvest (well, <em>10%</em> goes to the organization). </p>

<p>If you&apos;re thinking that&apos;s about $49 too much for some meat slurry, we should point out that the &quot;dog&quot; isn&apos;t made from a pasty mixture of unidentifiable bits&#x2014;it&apos;s made of kobe beef. It will also contain foie gras shavings, balsamic onions, caviar aioli and is served on a brioche bun with black truffle fries. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504090357/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/69_hot_dog_debuts_at_ice_cream_shop.php">Earlier this year</a> Serendipity introduced &quot;the most expensive hot dog in the world&quot; (a $69 monstrosity served on a salted pretzel bun), so it looks like the Kobe-obsessed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504090357/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/01/the_81_burger.php">Old Homestead</a> needs to step up their game.</p>
