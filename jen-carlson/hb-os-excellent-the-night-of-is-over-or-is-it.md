<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164619/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/29/the_night_of.php">the magnificent miniseries <em>The Night Of</em></a> concluded with a 95-minute episode, wrapping things up in the case of Nasir &apos;Naz&apos; Khan, but leaving things open-ended enough for a second season to be tackled in a number of ways. (Spoilers ahead.)</p>

<p>The show is based off of the BBC&apos;s <em>Criminal Justice</em>, which featured a case like Khan&apos;s in the first season, and a totally separate case in the second. However, HBO&apos;s version left things where the story from season one could continue, or characters from it could walk into a new storyline. The network hasn&apos;t announced if the series (which was a passion project of the late James Gandolfini) will be renewed or canceled. We reached out this morning and were told, &quot;We do not have any sort of official comment.&quot; </p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164619/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbo-night-drama-season-2-915933?utm_source=twitter">Steven Zaillian said</a> at the TCA in July, &quot;We&apos;re thinking about it, you know.  And if we come up with something that we all feel is worthy of doing, we&apos;ll do it.  This was designed as a standalone piece.  That being said, there are ways of certainly, you know, kind of taking what it feels like and what it&apos;s about and doing another season on another subject.  So we&apos;re talking about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Like <em>True Detective</em> (and also like <em>Criminal Justice</em>), the show would likely come back with all new characters and a new case. However, there are some ways to bring these beloved characters over to a new season&#x2014;and that&apos;s something that should be considered given the audience&apos;s strong reaction to them, and how spectacularly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164619/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/19/true_detective_season_two_review.php">the second season of <em>True Detective</em></a> (and even the Serial podcast) flopped. </p>

<p>Some theories about how this could go:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2JOHNTSUBWAY.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164619im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2JOHNTSUBWAY.jpg" width="640" height="397" class="image-none"> </span><br>

<ul><li>Josh Kurp <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164619/http://uproxx.com/tv/the-night-of-season-2/2/">at Uproxx</a> is calling for a spin-off called <em>Box &amp; Weiss</em>, where the lawyer and former detective solve crimes together.
</li><li>Caitlin Gallagher at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164619/http://www.bustle.com/articles/180255-if-the-night-of-is-renewed-season-2-probably-wont-be-about-naz-andrea">Bustle speculated</a> that since <em>Criminal Justice</em> writer Peter Moffat &quot;is also credited as an executive producer on <em>The Night Of</em>... it makes sense that if <em>The Night Of</em> is renewed, it could possibly be based on <em>Criminal Justice</em>&apos;s Season 2 plot of a domestically-abused woman who is under investigation for killing her husband.&quot; The first season of <em>The Night Of</em> pulled heavily from the first season of <em>Criminal Justice</em>.
</li><li>At the conclusion of season one, we leave Naz lonely and with a pretty bad drug addiction, so the story could continue following him through this time, as Box and Weiss bring Andrea Cornish&apos;s true killer to justice.
</li><li>Freddy, played by Michael K. Williams, was another excellent character, though it seems difficult to bring him into a second season unless Naz stays in touch with him, or he&apos;s used by Box, Weiss, or John Stone for informational purposes.
</li><li>Stone (and his cat) should really be at the center of the second season&#x2014;John Turturro&apos;s eczema-suffering, subway ad lawyer character was given a shot at the big leagues through his dedication to Naz and his high-profile case, for which he delivered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164619/http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/John-Stone-Closing-Argument-Night-Finale-42296326">a spectacular closing argument</a>. (Maybe in the 2nd season he could bring Chandra Kapoor&apos;s career back to life, too.)</li></ul>
