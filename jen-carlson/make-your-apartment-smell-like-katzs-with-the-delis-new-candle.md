<p>Candles and perfumes that kind of smell like things that you want to eat are... confusing, but they sell, just like all that crap on the Urban Outfitters impulse purchase table. Do you <em>want</em> your home to smell like a White Castle? Hopefully not. But you occasionally enjoy a White Castle binge while nursing a hangover, and wouldn&apos;t it be just hilarious to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040301/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/white_castle_burger_scented_candles.php">buy a candle</a> that smells like their sliders and chicken rings? Same goes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040301/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/pizza_perfume.php">that pizza cologne</a>. And now Katz&apos;s Delicatessen is getting in on the scented candle game.</p>

<p>They&apos;re starting out with the Chocolate Egg Cream candle, which is selling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040301/http://katzsdelicatessen.com/shop/chocolate-egg-cream-scented-candle.html&apos;&gt;for $25&lt;/a&gt;&#x2014;they note that it will " transform="" any="" room="" into="" a="" delicious="" blast="" from="" the="" past."="" but="" where="" is="" our="" meat="" candle="" of="" future?="" as="" <a="">the Forward</a> points out, the deli&apos;s aroma seeps out to the sidewalk, and consists of &quot;corned beef brined in spices, pastrami dripping with fat, fried potato knishes and freshly sliced rye.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040301/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-bsf2x-aeE">Orgasm Candle joke</a>.
