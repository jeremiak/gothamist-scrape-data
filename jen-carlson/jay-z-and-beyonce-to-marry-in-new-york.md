The happy couple hasn&apos;t commented on the incident, but since the document is only valid for 60 days, time will tell. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923065911/http://www.cityclerknyc.com/MarriageBureau/index.htm?MarriageLicense.htm">the City Clerk&apos;s office</a>, getting married in New York City requires requires the couple to apply &quot;in person for a marriage license at any of our offices.&quot; So if not Manhattan, where will the two tie the knot?</p>

<p>Commissioner of the NBA, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923065911/http://smartenupnas.com/2007/01/22/jay-z-with-nba-commissioner-david-stern-at-the-soon-to-be-brooklyn-nets-press-confrence/">David Stern</a>, lives in Scarsdale -- so perhaps they were scoping out his property. But our guess is the Hamptons (even though the two only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923065911/http://www.portfolio.com/executives/spottings/2007/07/11/jay-zs-rental-home">rented there</a> last year).</p>
