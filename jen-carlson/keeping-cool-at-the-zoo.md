According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151321/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/28/2010-07-28_soaring_temps_leave_zoos_out_in_the_cold.html">the Daily News</a>, July&apos;s record temperatures have kept people away from the Bronx Zoo, as well as the Central Park, Queens and Prospect Park Zoos&#x2014;at the former, the WCS is projecting 275,000 visitors for July, which is a drop down from 400,000 last July. </p>

<p>Director of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151321/http://gothamist.com/tags/bronxzoo">The Bronx Zoo</a>, Jim Breheny, told the paper, &quot;We&apos;ve experienced, like the rest of New York, these record high temperatures, and I think it&apos;s dissuaded a lot of people from coming through the zoo. <strong>We want to remind people we have the great advantage of being located in the middle of this old hardwood forest.</strong> All our paths are shaded.&quot;</p>

<p>The zoo is now offering a 20% discount to visitors, young and old alike, to combat their losses. And the drop in attendance also means short lines&#x2014;so it might be a good time to finally check out those adorable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151321/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/04/confirmed_bronx_zoo_lion_cubs_are_a.php">lion cubs</a> (it&apos;s just to bad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151321/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/19/flashback_6.php">the old platypusary</a> isn&apos;t still around) or see bear cubs frolicking, as they are in this video:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, how are the animals faring in the heat? Up in Boston the zoo serves some of its animals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151321/http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2010/07/07/zoo_has_tricks_to_beat_this_beastly_heat/">frozen blood popsicles</a> to help cool them off&#x2014;but a rep from the Bronx Zoo told us that isn&apos;t the case here (he did note, however, &quot;we sometimes give some of the animals ice, but [they] have everything they need to keep themselves comfortable in all kinds of weather.&quot;</p>
