The first was a Kurt Vonnegut inspired chest on Sacket Street, and soon after the local, Noon Gourfain, announced to the paper that her next was an homage to Edgar Allan Poe&#x2014;let&apos;s hope she buries a fake beating heart in the soil! She explained, &#x201C;I like what he said about the descent into the maelstrom. I like the idea of linking a dead literary figure to composting.&#x201D; While vandals knocked over the Vonnegut, other residents are invited to be more productive in their contributions, for example: &quot;toss in shredded paper, banana peels, egg shells or other organic waste. The worms will do the rest.&quot; If you&apos;d like to do some of your own indoor composting, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120307234311/http://www.nyccompost.org/how/wormbin.html">here&apos;s a tip sheet</a> on how&#x2014;and if someone could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120307234311/http://www.oliverbishopyoung.co.uk/conversions.html">convert dumpsters into gardens</a> and swimming pools that would be super.</p>
