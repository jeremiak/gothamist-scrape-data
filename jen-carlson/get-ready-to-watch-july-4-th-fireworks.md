This is the largest display in America and takes a year to plan. This year&apos;s show will stretch wider than usual in a &quot;high definition&quot; format, choreographed to the New York Pops (simulcast on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www.wins.com/pages/627847.php?contentType=4&amp;contentId=648402">1010 WINS</a>, TV broadcast on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www.nbc.com/Movies_Specials_More/">NBC</a>). The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www.nydailynews.com/features/july4thfireworks/therocketman.html">has an interview with Gary Souza</a>, fireworks designer for the event; he says, &quot;We have a new orange that&#x2019;s really awesome. It&#x2019;s a golden-red color. We also have this silvery pixie dust that bursts into pink and chartreuse.  And look for the aqua jellyfish during the &apos;Pirates of the Caribbean&apos; song.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www.nysun.com/article/57656">The NY Sun</a> reports that this years display, which is always touted as having 55 times more fireworks than anyone else, will contain 40,000 shells. To give you some perspective, that&apos;s 1300 explosions in the first minute alone - the Sun reports that &quot;during an average 20-minute fireworks show in America, only 500 shells are fired.&quot;  </p>

<p>Traditionally, the best areas to view the fireworks are the FDR Drive from 14-42nd, Long Island City, the South Street Seaport, and the Brooklyn Promenade.   An interesting note:  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www1.macys.com/campaign/fireworks/publicViewing.jsp">Macy&apos;s website</a> shouts in capital letters that &quot;BATTERY PARK IS NOT RECOMMENDED AS A VIEWING SITE FOR THE MACY&apos;S 4TH OF JULY FIREWORKS&quot; - because this year, unlike years past, there&apos;s no fireworks barge near Liberty Island.  However, it turns out there&apos;s been some s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www.nj.com/news/jjournal/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1181714440231290.xml&amp;coll=3">erious drama between NYC and NJ over fireworks</a>, to the point where NJ officials were facing off against Macy&apos;s and the FDNY.  Anyway, there will be Jersey City-sponsored fireworks over Liberty Island starting at 9PM.  </p>

<p>The Macy&apos;s show starts at 9PM, but people start claiming areas to sit hours before.  We&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/01/fireworks_from.php">already mentioned</a> the Williamsburg waterfront as a new option for Brooklynites. About has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://manhattan.about.com/od/eventsandattractions/a/nycjulyfourth.htm">an informative list</a> for planning your night around the explosions, and AMNY has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-fourthbars0618,0,5216621.story">ideas for July 4th meals</a>.  Roosevelt Island also has some seating available, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123917/http://www.rioc.com/fireworks.htm">you have to pay for tickets</a>. </p>

<p>So where will you watch the sky light up on Wednesday? </p>
