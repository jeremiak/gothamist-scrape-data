Oh the times we&apos;ve shared. The television show is in its 40th year (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813102924/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/04/video_sesame_street_gets_pitched.php">here&apos;s the pitch</a>), and there&apos;s lots of celebrating going on. This coming Monday &quot;the City of New York will unveil a proclamation and announce a temporary street naming in honor of the program&#x2019;s permanence and everlasting impact on New York City&#x2019;s history and four generations of children across the country.&quot; Yep, Sesame Street is getting a street! The dedication will take place at noon at 64th and Columbus Avenue.<p></p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813102924/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/61744/">Daily Intel</a> has a slew of fun facts about the show. Did you know the subway station is inspired by the old station at 72nd Street and Broadway? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813102924/http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/articles/features/68839/sesame-street-style">Here&apos;s some more</a> about the set&apos;s inspiration by the man who created it &#x2014; when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813102924/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/visiting_sesame_street.php">we visited last year</a> we noticed nothing has really changed in all its decades.</p>

<p>If you want to join in on the fun, there&apos;s a Sesame Street special exhibit about to open at the Brooklyn Library&apos;s Central Libary (on November 14th). They&apos;ll have limited edition Elmo library cards, and say they&apos;ve collaborated with the Jim Henson Legacy for the three-month multi-faceted exhibit will include original Sesame Street materials from its 40-year history &#x2014; show scripts, sheet music, show props, photographs and more!</p>

<p>Oh and don&apos;t forget, Elmo loves you:</p>
