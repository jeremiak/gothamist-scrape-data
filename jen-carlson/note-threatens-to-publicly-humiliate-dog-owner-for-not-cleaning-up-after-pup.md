<p>These signs have been spotted all over Gramercy Park, where a tipster tells us they&apos;re &quot;taped on every flower bed along the southside&quot; (this one was hanging at 20th and Irving). The letter writer has penned a threatening note to the offender, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;To the person who doesn&apos;t clean up after your dog (including lifting him into the tree boxes). You give all of your fellow dog owners a bad name. It&apos;s against the law! So here&apos;s the deal. We know who are you are and where you live. Keep it up and your name will be plastered all around Gramercy Park.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Not cleaning up after your dog is worthy of a passive aggressive note, sure... but by adding a threat are these people giving <em>humans</em> a bad name? Just wait until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192554/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/03/dog_doo_dna_testing_comes_to_new_yo.php">DNA dog doo testing</a> comes to town... no one will be safe!</p>
