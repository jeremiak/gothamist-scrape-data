										<p>The summer of 1977 was host to a serial killer, a day-long <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161115190910/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/13/the_new_york_ci.php">blackout</a> and a crime rate around 75% higher than today&apos;s. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161115190910/http://www.nysun.com/article/59897">NY Sun</a> reports that &quot;politicians, police officers, and reporters are gathering together to remember that time and celebrate.&quot; John Jay College of Criminal Justice&apos;s Eugene O&apos;Donnell is the one holding the press conference today which will focus on the anniversary of the capture of David Berkowitz, aka the &quot; Son of Sam.&quot; </p>

<p>The celebration part of the event will place attention upon how far the city has come since that time. Think about it this way, during the Blackout of &apos;77 &quot;more than 1,600 stores were damaged, 3,776 people were arrested, and a congressional study estimated the damages as more than $300 million.&quot; During the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161115190910/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/15/the_new_york_city_blackout_edition.php">Blackout of &apos;03</a> people drank beer in the street.</p>
