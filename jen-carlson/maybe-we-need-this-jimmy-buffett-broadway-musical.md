title: Maybe We 'Need' This Jimmy Buffett Broadway Musical?
---

	
										<p>Recently I was rewatching some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706161029/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/24/best_nyc_30_rock_moments.php"><em>30 Rock</em> episodes</a>, most notably that one where Jenna Maroney rebrands as a chilled-out Jimmy Buffett-type, garnering herself a new Parrothead-esque fanbase (without all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706161029/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-xrPUvTso0">the racism</a>). Eventually, even Pete Hornberger joins them, and it is he who I most closely related to in this episode, as a broken, stressed-out human climbing down from his NYC office tower and shedding all of his stress out on the streets in a sea of frozen drinks and Hawaiian shirts. A needed, albeit brief, escape from the everyday... and maybe we all need to unwindulax a little? </p>

<p>Since Jimmy Buffett&apos;s retirement community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706161029/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jimmy-buffett-to-open-margaritaville-retirement-communities-w470492">isn&apos;t here yet</a>, we&apos;ll have to settle for this ridiculous musical, coming to NYC next March&#x2014;it&apos;s called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706161029/http://www.EscapeToMargaritavilleMusical.com/">Escape to Margarittaville</a>,&quot; and it looks like a cross between &quot;Jimmy Buffett on Ice&quot; and a slice-of-life Epcot exhibit dedicated to drinking on the beach.</p>

Tickets are now on sale, and this news came with a comment from Buffett himself, who declared: &quot;Going to Broadway is a dream come true, but to be coming to the Marquis is like having a great margarita with a tequila floater.&quot; [Pause for reaction and also kettledrum solo.] He added, &quot;If we are going to turn the island of Manhattan into Margaritaville, Times Square seems the perfect place to drop anchor... It&apos;s going to be a tropical season in New York. Fins Up!&quot;

<p>Try to abandon most of your life goals by then to make this a more immersive experience.</p>
