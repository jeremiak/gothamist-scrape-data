The hotel took down all of their online cheerleading that encouraged such behavior, and today they told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001219/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/08/25/2009-08-25_the_standard_hotel_vows_to_try_closing_curtains_on_guests_peep_show_for_high_lin.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;The hotel will make a concerted effort to remind guests of the transparency of the guest room windows,&quot; and noting &quot;the hotel has always been sensitive to the concerns of its friends and neighbors.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001219/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08252009/news/regionalnews/eyeful_tower__186393.htm">The NY Post</a> talked to some visitors of the park yesterday, who want the show to go on! One man told them, &quot;We saw two feet pressed against the glass in an apparent attempt to get better leverage. Our curiosity is piqued&#x2014;but it hasn&apos;t yet been satisfied. We&apos;ll come back.&quot; </p>
