<p>Today the city&apos;s Parks Department shared this photo on Twitter, asking: &quot;Have you seen our new city seal?&quot; The seal &quot;spent the morning resting&quot; with the Park Rangers at Rockaway Beach... <em>but then where did it go?</em> Our sources tell us, &quot;It pulled itself out of the water around Beach 72 in Rockaway. The Parks Department&apos;s Urban Park  Rangers contacted the Riverhead Foundation, marine animal experts, to observe the seal and aid if necessary.  Riverhead deemed the seal to be healthy and exhibiting normal behavior.&quot; It returned to the water at around 12:30 p.m. <br>
 <br>
It&apos;s not unusual to be spotting seals around this time of year... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204840/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/10/get_on_board_its_seal_season_in_nyc.php">it&apos;s seal season</a>! And it seems there are still seal watching tours will still happen, eventually: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204840/http://americanprincesscruises.com/seal_and_bird_watching.html">The American Princess</a> is safe and sound! All trips are postponed until we have rebuilt our Rockaway dock which was destroyed by Sandy. However, we are still in business!&quot; These tours typically run through mid-April.</p>
