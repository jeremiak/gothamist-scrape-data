<p>On February 3rd, 1954, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis performed at the Copacabana (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150204015652/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/01/copacabana.php">the original</a>, on East 60th Street). By this time, almost ten years into their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150204015652/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_and_Lewis">Martin &amp; Lewis</a> partnership, the comedy duo had already risen to success&#x2014;beyond the live performances they had radio shows and movie deals under their belts... and at the Copacabana they were raking in about $30,000 a week. Below, see their entire 45 minute set... about two years after this they ended their partnership and embarked on their solo careers&#x2014;their final show together was on this same Copacabana stage on July 24th, 1956.</p>

<p>And here they are three years earlier, at the New York Paramount on 44th Street, basking in their success:</p>
