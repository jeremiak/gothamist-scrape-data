                            <p><img alt="sohoartvendors.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002194908im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sohoartvendors.jpg" width="350" height="235" class="left"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002194908/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/30/police_harrassi.php">Last year</a> the police were hassling the art vendors in SoHo, something documented by Robert Lederman, president of A.R.T.I.S.T. (Artists&#x2019; Response to Illegal State Tactics). Around the same time, word of an Alan Gerson-proposed bill to &quot;deal with the problem&quot; was getting out, and now the City Council proposal has arrived, leaving the artists on the defense. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002194908/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11172008/news/regionalnews/soho_heave_ho_139138.htm">The NY Post</a> reports that &quot;The council last week began considering limiting the number of art vendors to two per block on pedestrian-packed sidewalks such as the stretch of West Broadway in the artist-saturated neighborhood.&quot; Gerson&apos;s concern is that some of the streets are too congested, while the artists fear their First Amendment-protected free speech, &quot;and the battle for our rights,&quot; hang in the balance. Not to mention their income.</p>

<p>They have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002194908/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvtFS2GCdDw">compiled a video</a> proposing that the BID (Business Improvement District) obstructs the sidewalks as well, with planters and trash cans, saying they &quot;violate every section of the proposed new vending laws.&quot; Lederman even points out that in 2004 Lieutenant Robert D&apos;Onofrio, commanding officer of the Manhattan South Peddler Task force, testified in Federal Court saying the planters were put up to obstruct the vendors.</p><blockquote>From pg 31 of the Federal Court transcript:<p></p>

<p><strong>THE COURT:</strong> And what is the point of the planters, if you know?</p>

<p><strong>Lt. D&apos;Onofrio:</strong> Well, my understanding is so the street vendors, will not put their carts or their tables on the sidewalk because they have to be at curb side.</p></blockquote>On Friday, the artists held a protest outside of City Hall, and are planning to keep protesting. They have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002194908/http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nycstreetartists/">a website</a> set up documenting their ongoing battle.<p></p>
