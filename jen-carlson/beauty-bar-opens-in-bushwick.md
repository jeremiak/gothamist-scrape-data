                            <p>Bushwick, you&apos;re getting so spoiled. First a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004557/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/19/mini_golf.php">mini golf course</a>, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004557/http://www.beautybar.com/">Beauty Bar</a> is opening in your &apos;hood. This weekend the shiny, new establishment will unlock its doors at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004557/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=921+broadway+brooklyn&amp;ll=40.698259,-73.936186&amp;spn=0.008281,0.017338&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">921 Broadway</a>, many subway stops away from its East 14th Street location. They&apos;ll host two free parties for the grand opening, Friday and Saturday, which will include a ton of deejays, bands, and an open vodka bar each night from 9 to 10 p.m. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004557/http://www.greenshoelace.com/beautybar/">RSVP here</a>). As for the space, it has 600 more square footage than the Manhattan one, a possible garden in its future, and fixtures from a Lancaster, Pennsylvania beauty salon that the owner purchased for $1,500. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004557/http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/sneak-peek-beauty-bar-brooklyn/Content?oid=1182158">The L</a> has some more photos, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004557/http://nymag.com/daily/food/2009/05/beauty_bar_bushwick.html">Grub Street</a> reports they&apos;ll also be serving up cheaper drinks ($3 to $5 beers, $5 to $7 mixed drinks), and &#x201C;retro finger foods.&quot;</p>

<p>By the way, Bushwick, you also have your very own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004557/http://everygirlssecret.com/2009/05/bushwick-the-board-game/">board game</a> now&#x2014;sadly it&apos;s more drinking game than Monopoly, sure would be fun to buy up all those vacant lots!</p>
