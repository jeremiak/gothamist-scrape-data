<p>Inspired by this very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110312032628/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">Flashback</a> series (<em>aw</em>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110312032628/http://twitter.com/#!/untappedcities/status/45957527506124801">Untapped Cities</a> took a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110312032628/http://newyork.untappedcities.com/2011/03/10/central-park-west-over-the-years/">Central Park West</a> over the years, and amongst their visuals is this amazing photo of a pretty rural, tree-speckled Upper West Side. They note the wooden structures, carpenter shop sign, and St. Paul the Apostle church, which was built between 1876 and 1884. </p>

<p>This photo, taken in 1890, is actually from a book titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110312032628/http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Illustrated-Ric-Burns/dp/0679454829"><em>New York: An Illustrated History</em></a>, which notes the viewpoint is looking south from Central Park West and 72nd Street.</p>
