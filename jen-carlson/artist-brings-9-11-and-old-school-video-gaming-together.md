<p>Brooklyn-based artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022233/http://anthonysneed.com/">Anthony Michael Sneed</a> is having a pop-up show at ARTJAIL <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022233/http://artlog.com/events/68631-anthony-michael-sneed-hell-for">this Thursday</a> (from 7 to 10 p.m.), before heading to LA where his work was hand-selected by Shepard Fairey to be part of a West Coast exhibit. At this week&apos;s hometown exhibition, titled Hell For Hire, he introduces innocent, childlike Legos and 1980s 8-bit aesthetics to the evils of the world... like the KKK, and 9/11.
