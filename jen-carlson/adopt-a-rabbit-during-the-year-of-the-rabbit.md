<p>At this year&apos;s 12th Annual Lunar New Year Parade &amp; Festival (held on February 6 in Chinatown), the Mayor&#x2019;s Alliance for NYC&#x2019;s Animals will have some furry bunnies for participants to adopt. This is their 5th Annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407121245/http://www.ILoveNYCPets.org/">I Love NYC Pets</a> Month, and since it&apos;s the Year of the Rabbit, they&apos;ll have a &quot;van filled with a dozen adorable, adoptable rabbits.&quot; The whole van thing sounds kind of depressing, but hopefully these little guys and gals will find loving, non-vehicular homes as a result.<br>
 <br>
You&apos;ll have to go to the Animal Care &amp; Control of NYC, located at 326 East 110th Street (between 1st and 2nd Aves), to adopt the rabbits however. There, rabbit experts will be on hand to provide information on caring for the critters, which they say make great house pets.</p>
