The rule would also demand working toilets and that after 2 hours passengers be provided with food and water.</p>

<p>Well, that rule went into effect today. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164723/http://www.1010wins.com/Some-Relief-For-Passengers/6927156">1010Wins</a>, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood turned down requests for temporary exemptions, which 5 airlines had asked for. The rule will only apply to domestic flights, and airlines are expected to report their own violations. If they don&apos;t, you can be certain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164723/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/16/virgin_america.php">passengers will</a>!</p>

<p>If an aircraft does go over the 3 hour limit without returning to the gate, they face a fine of up to $27,500 per passenger.</p>
