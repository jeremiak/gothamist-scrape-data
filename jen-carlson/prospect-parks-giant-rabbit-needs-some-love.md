<p>Yesterday (just in time for Easter!) the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311030752/http://www.zandavisitor.com/newsarticle-3225-Herbie_the_Giant_Flemish_Rabbit_is_Looking_for_WCS_Prospect_Park_Zoo_Visitors_Willing_to_Pet_Him">Prospect Park Zoo alerted</a> potential visitors that their 3-year-old Flemish giant rabbit&#x2014;Herbie, who weights in at 18 lbs&#x2014;is available for petting! They note: &quot;zoo-goers can greet Herbie and touch other animals at the Live Animal Encounters program held every Saturday and Sunday at 12:30, 1:00, 2:30, 3:00 p.m.&quot; Surprisingly, this big guy is a full 10 lbs lighter than some others of his kind!</p>
