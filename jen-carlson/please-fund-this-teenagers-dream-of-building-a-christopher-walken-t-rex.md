<p>We just glanced this sketch while scrolling through Facebook and halted to a full-stop. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004728/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=454518494622256&amp;set=a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784&amp;type=1">HONY posted</a> an email from the kid behind it, who explained, &quot;I am a sixteen year old from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. I am building a 13 foot T Rex with Christopher Walken&apos;s head and I was wondering if you would be willing to help me gain publicity for my project.&quot; Done AND done.</p>

<p>He (Ethan) is looking for $750 to make this happen, and explains on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004728/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/christopher-walken-rex">Indiegogo campaign&apos;s page</a>, &quot;I have always been interested in artistic pursuits. I was inspired to design and build this piece after watching the movie <em>Queen of Versailes</em> [ed. note: that documentary is on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004728/http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Queen_of_Versailles/70229267?locale=en-US">Netflix</a> and you should really watch it]. I saw how rich those kids were, and their lack of creation with all that money. I decided if I could get that much money I would make something great. The Walken Rex was originally thought of by a friend of mine, we are not completely sure where he got the idea from, but it seemed like the perfect thing to build.&quot; We look forward promoting the Kickstarter for a Dennis Hopper Velociraptor and watching the two fight in the viral video of the summer. </p>
