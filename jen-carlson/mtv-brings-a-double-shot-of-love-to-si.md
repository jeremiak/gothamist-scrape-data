Their latest spokeswoman is yet another tanned up, curse-word spewin&apos; <strike>young</strike> lady from the borough called Rosemarie, a contestant on MTV&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062754/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/series.jhtml">A Double Shot at Love with the Ikki Twins</a>.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062754/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/01/cursing_staten_islanders_take.html">SI Live</a> has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062754/http://www.silive.com/entertainment/tvfilm/index.ssf/2009/01/staten_island_gets_a_bad_wrap.html">a recap</a> from the most recent episode, which brings the twins to meet the family. &quot;Rosemarie&apos;s mom was shocked when her daughter showed up at home with not one but two scantily clad women, saying that she was competing to win their affection. <strong>Apparently, the fact that Rosemarie is bisexual was news to her mother.</strong>&quot; We&apos;re guessing the go-go dancer (pictured) isn&apos;t so much bisexual as she is a fame ho, which is perhaps what Rosemarie&apos;s cousin&apos;s outburst was really about. That&apos;s right, her cuz ToniAnn is a <em>bona fide lesbian</em>, and caused a scene when the cameras showed up. </p>

<p>In the end (spoiler alert!), Rosemarie was eliminated when the twins realized she spent more time with her dog than with them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062754/http://www.mtv.com/videos/a-double-shot-at-love-ep-6-episode-highlights/1602640/playlist.jhtml#id=1602640">Watch the clip here</a> (SI gets its close-up around the 2 minute mark). Also, it seems that Rosemarie is ashamed of her own borough, as she stated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611062754/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10576">in her bio</a> that she&apos;s from Brooklyn&#x2014;though to be fair, that <em>does</em> sound better paired up with &quot;bombastic.&quot;</p>
