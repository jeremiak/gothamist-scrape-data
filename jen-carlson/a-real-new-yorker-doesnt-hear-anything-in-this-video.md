title: A Real New Yorker Doesn't Hear Anything In This Video
---

	
										<p>The uploader of the below video, who we feel safe describing as &quot;weak,&quot; explained it as: &quot;One Minute of the Sounds that Drove Me from NYC.&quot; Sounds, <em>plural. </em>How many sounds do you hear?</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130324if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9AdtC3qtuk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>We&apos;ll concede that the one person leaning on their horn is creating a pretty grating noise, but aside from that this is like white noise to most New Yorkers. Soothing, almost, especially without any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130324/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/09/the_90-second_louie_scene_that.php">garbage trucks</a> getting in on the symphony. </p>

<p>At the one year mark in NYC these sounds may drive you mad, maybe even make you leave town altogether; by five years in these sounds will elicit a hearty SIGH; by ten years in a shrug; but once you hit the 30+ mark, you don&apos;t even hear a thing... at that point, it&apos;s the silence that will truly drive you mad.</p>
