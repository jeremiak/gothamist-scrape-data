										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="DRCLAW0810.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724014049im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/DRCLAW0810.jpg" width="250" height="180"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Dr. Claw</span></i></div> During our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724014049/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php?gallery0Pic=11#gallery">lobster roll quest</a>, we included a not-so-legit purveyor of rolls: Dr. Claw&#x2014;the underground lobster roll dealer in Greenpoint. Well, seems the Department of Health isn&apos;t really a fan of the Claw, otherwise known as &quot;The Lobstah Pushah,&quot; who runs a delivery service out of his apartment, and earlier this week they shut him down.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724014049/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/34/wb_drclawcuffed_2010_08_27_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the big bad DoH came knockin&apos; at his door yesterday afternoon and threatened to put him in jail if he didn&apos;t stop serving his mouth-watering, buttery lobster rolls (no word on if they confiscated the remaining goods). More specifically, the notice he returned home to said he must &quot;immediately close and cease and desist from operating any food service establishment at these premises.&quot; That doesn&apos;t mean he can&apos;t operate from <em>another</em> location, however&#x2014;say, something like that vehicle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724014049/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuhHPQxS2nQ">Happy Harry Hard-on</a> was forced to broadcast from when the Feds found out where he was running his pirate radio station from? </p>

<p>Until he&apos;s back in business, his customers&#x2014;who he clears via Facebook&#x2014;will have to ride out the rest of summer without his services. Or not? Allegedly in an email to them, he promised he&apos;d be &quot;conducting business as best he can from his jail cell until further notice.&quot;</p>
