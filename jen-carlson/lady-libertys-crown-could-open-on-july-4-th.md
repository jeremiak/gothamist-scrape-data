Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141054/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/03/24/2009-03-24_statue_of_liberty_will_open_for_the_publ.html">the Daily News</a> reports that, according to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar (who visited the crown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141054/http://www.doi.gov/photos/salazar/01262009/index.html">in January</a>), the grand reopening could take place on America&apos;s 233rd birthday. <p></p>

<p>Representative Anthony Weiner, who has long been fighting for the reopening but whose efforts were continuously blocked by the Bush administration, said, &quot;I can&apos;t think of a better birthday present for our nation. Reopening the crown of Lady Liberty will restore a quintessential New York and American experience.&quot; </p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect it to be <em>exactly</em> like the old days, however, Salazar said that they may implement &quot;a ticketing or lottery system to allow small groups of people to enter the crown at specific times.&quot; This will likely take care of the safety concerns of sending large groups up the narrow 168-step double-helix <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141054/http://www.doi.gov/news/09_News_Releases/012309.html">spiral staircase</a>, but there are still security concerns&#x2014;a report assessing them is expected by April 15th.</p>
