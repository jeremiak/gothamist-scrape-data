<p>Recently Zach Galifianakis got all Don Draper on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522014214/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/16/were_betty_drapers_breasts_photosho.php">January Jones</a>, putting the actress in her place after an awkward encounter. He talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522014214/http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/films/the-hangover-part-ii-interview#image-rotator-3">the Shortlist</a> about the one and only Ms. Betty Draper, who recently called the actor &quot;the most naturally funny man she&apos;d ever met.&quot; So, about that meeting... Galifianakis recalls:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;She and I were very rude to each other. It was crazy. I was at a party&#x2014;I&#x2019;d never met her&#x2014;and she was like, &apos;Come sit down.&apos; So I sit at her table and talk for ten minutes, and she goes, &apos;I think it&#x2019;s time for you to leave now.&apos; So I say, &apos;<strong>January, you are an actress in a show and everybody&#x2019;s going to forget about you in a few years, so fucking be nice</strong>,&apos; and I got up and left. And she thinks that&#x2019;s funny?&quot; </blockquote>

<p>And when asked if he would do a sex scene with her, he replied, &quot;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to. I&#x2019;d hate it.&quot; Don Draper says, &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>Though Galifianakis goes on to say that &quot;I&#x2019;ve only had to do a few of those things where you have to kiss and stuff. It&#x2019;s so embarrassing.&quot;</p>
