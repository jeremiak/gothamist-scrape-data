Why not! He&apos;s already accomplished everything else, from being a student of not just <em>life</em> but also almost every educational institute in America, to teaching a course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926121743/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/james_franco_101.php">about <em>himself</em></a> over on the West Coast, to soap opera acting, to mastering the art of the passive-aggressive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926121743/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1368893/James-Francos-Twitter-feud-Bruce-Vilanch-panned-Oscars-performance.html">Tweet and delete</a>. Everyone can learn something from this guy! And now 12 lucky students will be able to, so long as they can fork over the $46,000 annual tuition at the school, and hide their <em>real intentions</em> for taking the class (you know who you are).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926121743/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/wood_hunk_YjWxmpeJ0EsAUwL0suivLJ">the NY Post</a>, Franco will teach a third-year course on directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, which focuses on adapting poetry into short films. Chair of the graduate film program, John Tintori, says, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s here to teach because he really knows something about directing that he can share with our students. He&#x2019;s incredibly prolific, and that comes from a real work ethic&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s another thing to impart to our students.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At least one student isn&apos;t impressed, telling the paper, &#x201C;I find it absolutely ridiculous and silly to sign up just because he&#x2019;s James Franco. I imagine in the first year, it&#x2019;ll be a lot of people just there for the name, [but] I don&#x2019;t want to go and learn what I can learn from <em>Us Weekly</em>.&#x201D; Your loss, sweetheart. Guess this is a good time to announce that we&apos;re going to be pursuing our lifelong dream of learning how to adapt poetry into film.</p>
