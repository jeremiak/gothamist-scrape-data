										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="fdnycal1210.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152027im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/fdnycal1210.jpg" width="250" height="194" class="image-right"> </span>The FDNY&apos;s annual &quot;beefcake&quot; calendar is back, ladies (and gents). While the presses were stopped back in 2008 after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152027/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/04/fdnys_calendar.php">a nude video</a> of one firefighter showed up on a gay porn site, the incident didn&apos;t stop New York&apos;s Bravest from posing again. And with a new year ahead, it seems they&apos;ve found a new charity they just had to help out: the FDNY! The calendar has always raised money for charity, but the FDNY has never taken money for themselves, but according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152027/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pinup_charities_burned_KpAHFfWbMrLvnSzmYXP5gK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, money <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152027/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/18/bloomberg_announces_thousands_of_jo.php">is tight</a> and they could really use the estimated $300,000 earned from their Calendar of Heroes. Why not?</p>

<p>The money would pay for new gear, but fire officials aren&apos;t ruling out spreading the wealth. The paper says they insist they &quot;have not made a final decision about how the nonprofit FDNY Foundation will disburse the proceeds.&quot; (This decision seems to be for the 2012 calendar, and not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152027/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/18/video_shirtless_firefighters.php">2011 one</a>.)</p>

<p>One firefighter, nicknamed &quot;The Gift,&quot; told the paper &quot;it&apos;s a shame&quot; the money needs to be used for new equipment, adding, &quot;It&apos;s a good moneymaker and a lot of fun.&quot; Maybe everyone who suffered from budget cuts should consider a calendar&#x2014;surely a Sexy Librarians of the NYPL would sell.</p>
