<p>More people get arrested for misdemeanor pot possession in our city than in any other U.S. city (the figure comes to about <strong>97 arrests per day</strong>).   The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804214718/http://www.nyclu.org/node/1736">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> released the report this week, which they based on government stats, interviews with those arrested for holding pot, their lawyers, and law enforcement officials. </p><blockquote>The report said the stop-and-frisk policy allows the police to make misdemeanor arrests, which produce higher crime-fighting statistics, rather than simply write them up as violations, which carry penalties similar to traffic infractions.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;<strong>The penalty for having seven-eighths of an ounce of marijuana or less in your pocket is the same as that for riding a bicycle on the sidewalk</strong>,&#x201D; said an author of the report, Prof. Harry G. Levine, a sociologist at Queens College. </p>

<p>But in fact, instead of a $100 fine and a violation charge, police are coaxing people to bring the marijuana into public view by requesting that they hand over anything they are &#x201C;not supposed to have,&#x201D; the report says. It then becomes &#x201C;burning or open to public view&#x201D; and therefore a misdemeanor.</p></blockquote>That isn&apos;t all, the reports are also showing that the NYPD are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804214718/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0818,weeding-out-blacks-and-latinos,427158,2.html"><em>weeding out</em> Blacks and Latinos</a>, with more than half those arrested being black, and 31% being Hispanic. <p></p>
