										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="radioheadcolbert09211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214431im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/radioheadcolbert09211.jpg" width="640" height="407" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Whoever decided to pair up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214431/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/radiohead_to_appear_on_the_colbert.php">Radiohead with Stephen Colbert</a>: bravo. Last night the band took over the show, performing songs and discussing global warming (Colbert asks, &quot;Did you guys come here on an ox cart?&quot;). During an interview in the Dr. Pepper Flavor Zone, the two discussed the band&apos;s anti-corporate belief system:<br>
</p><blockquote><strong>Stephen Colbert:</strong> Tonight, we&apos;re sponsored by Dr. Pepper. We didn&apos;t talk about that, and I apologize, because, I should have checked to see if that was the official soft drink of Radiohead. And it&apos;s not, and that&apos;s on me and I apologize. Would you say it&apos;s out of the question?<br>
<strong>Thom Yorke:</strong> I think so, it tastes like that stuff you get in the dentist and spit out.<br>
<strong>Colbert:</strong> Well, Thom, he is a doctor.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214431/http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/mon-september-26-2011-radiohead">enjoy some songs</a> (including a sure-to-be hit off their upcoming Christmas album)... and some Axe body spray ads. But first, a warning to those who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214431/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/did_you_score_radiohead_tickets_or.php">didn&apos;t get tickets</a> to their shows this week: according to the 4 out of 5 Gothamist staffers currently huddled under their desks rocking back and forth, these videos may make you weep.</p>
