<p>When we first announced that we would be hosting a night at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/http://bkbazaar.com/">Brooklyn Night Bazaar</a> on December 22nd (the day after the world ended... right now... we made it!), we weren&apos;t allowed to tell you who the headliner was for reasons of vital national security... but now we&apos;ve been given clearance. Here we go: tonight (Saturday) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/https://www.matadorrecords.com/fucked_up/">Fucked Up</a> will be headlining our show, following a bunch of other great acts (who you can read about below). If the screamcore sounds of Fucked Up have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/http://www.spin.com/articles/one-fucked-year-spins-best-2011-issue">somehow managed to escape your radar</a>, look no further than Stereogum, who declared their 2011 album <em>David Comes To Life</em> to be a great contendor for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/http://stereogum.com/1192682/top-10-rock-operas-that-deserve-a-stage-adaptation/franchises/listomania/attachment/fuckedup/">a hardcore rock opera adaptation</a>... and who doesn&apos;t want to see that?</p>

<p>Joining Fucked Up will be plenty of other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/brooklyn_bazaar.php#photo-1">live music, food, drink, and vendors</a>, as well as some downtime music provided by DJ Mikey Palms (Chances With Wolves). As always, the event takes place from 6 p.m. to midnight (avoid the line by getting there EARLY), at 45 North 5th Street in Williamsburg, and it&apos;s FREE. The rest of the lineup includes:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/https://soundcloud.com/tinyvictories">TINY VICTORIES</a></strong>: NPR says this band&apos;s songs are &quot;full of smart, catchy electro-pop hooks with subversive production details to keep listeners guessing. There&apos;s real depth to Greg Walter&apos;s voice, as well as a natural, organic feel to the music.&quot; </p>

 <br>
<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/http://danfriel.com/">DAN FRIEL</a></strong> (ex-Parts and Labor) creates sounds that have been described as &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;wonderful,&quot; and Pitchfork gets specific, calling his music &quot;a heaving mass of static beats, monolithic distortion, and bending, diving tones.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="www.facebook.com/deadstarsmusic"><strong>DEAD STARS</strong></a> &quot;play melodic alt-rock and shoegaze straight from the early-&#x2018;90s,&quot; says Fuse... so obviously we love them.</p>

<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234901/http://www.reverbnation.com/screaminrebelangels">SCREAMIN&apos; REBEL ANGELS</a></strong> features a feisty redhead (Laura Rebel Angel) who is described as the product of what would happen &quot;if Screamin&apos; Jay Hawkins and Ruth Brown had a baby raised by Wanda Jackson in a John Waters film, that hell kitten would be Laura Rebel Angel.&quot;</p>
