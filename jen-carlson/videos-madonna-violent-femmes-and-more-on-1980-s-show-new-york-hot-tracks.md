<p>From 1983 through 1989, the syndicated music television series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630021635/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1117447/"><em>New York Hot Tracks</em></a> ran on TV sets all over the U.S., delivering performances from David Bowie, Run-DMC, Madonna, Beastie Boys, Tina Turner, and everyone else you listened to on your Walkman. The weekly show ran 90 minutes long and was originally hosted by WKTU DJ Carlos DeJesus (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630021635/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/tv-film/1098863/carlos-de-jesus-legendary-disco-dance-radio-dj-dies">RIP</a>), who introduced videos and talked to musicians from different New York locations (mostly nightclubs). Later it was hosted by <em>All My Children</em> stars Debbi Morgan and Darnell Williams, and in the end it was hosted by actor Gene Anthony Ray.</p>
