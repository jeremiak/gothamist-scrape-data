Peter King (R-Long Island) has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114818/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h414/show">introduced a bill</a> that would require camera phones to &quot;make a sound&quot; when taking a picture (which may actually make some reluctant to snap a shot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114818/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/22/cameraphone_cap.php">an underground perv</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114818/http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/01/new-bill-asks-f.html">Wired</a> is reporting that &quot;The move is part of the &apos;Camera Phone Predator Alert Act&apos; and the idea is to ensure privacy and safety of the public, especially children,&quot; something that Japan has already required of their snap-happy citizens. They note that the bill likely won&apos;t pass in its current form, and if it does clicktones will be the new ringtones. But will they be loud enough to alert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114818/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/22/asleep_on_the_subway.php">sleepy subway riders</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114818/http://althouse.blogspot.com/2009/01/requiring-digital-cameras-and-camera.html">Some</a> call it out for being another anti-camera scheme, and ask, &quot;why not require every man to wear a bell around his neck...in case he might sneak up on a child?&quot;</p>
