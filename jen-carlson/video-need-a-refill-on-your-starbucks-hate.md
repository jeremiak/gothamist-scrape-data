title: Video: Need A Refill On Your Starbucks Hate?
---

<p>Every complaint you&apos;ve ever had about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134045/http://gothamist.com/tags/starbucks">Starbucks</a>, now delivered to you by these young gentlemen, who trash the company for <em>everything</em>&#x2014;from selling CDs (&quot;What, are people coming in here with Discmans?&quot;) to misspelled names (&quot;J-O-H-N, same way it&apos;s been spelled since the Bible&quot;) to the taste (&quot;It&apos;s literally two ingredients: water and coffee. You know that expression, &apos;He could fuck up a cup of coffee?&apos; That&apos;s you Starbucks, you are he.&quot;). And <em>so on</em>. Though can we just all agree that they deliver great seasonal drinks... even if they do contain most of your daily caloric intake?</p>
