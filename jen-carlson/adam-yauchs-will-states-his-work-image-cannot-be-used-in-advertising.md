In his will, which was filed in Manhattan Surrogate Court on Tuesday, the Beastie Boy stated that &quot;his image, music and any art he created could not be used for advertising,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180253/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120809/new-york-city/late-beastie-boy-adam-yauchs-will-says-dont-use-his-music-ads#ixzz23393wYs1">DNA Info</a>.<p></p>

<p>The will also states that his fortune of $6.4 million goes to his wife, Dechen Yauch, and their 13-year-old daughter, Losel. Dechen now also has the sole right to sell and manage his artistic property. On top of being an integral part of the Beastie Boys, Yauch had also started an independent film distribution company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180253/http://www.oscilloscope.net/">Oscilloscope Laboratories</a>, with David Fenkel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180253/http://nymag.com/movies/features/47964/">years before</a> his untimely death.</p>

<p>A good example of what happens when you don&apos;t take precautions like Yauch did can be seen in the case of Kurt Cobain, whose image has shown up everywhere, from Converse to Guitar Hero&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180253/http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=126724">though it&apos;s unclear</a> if Courtney Love has been signing off on these deals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, The Beastie Boys are fighting the makers of Monster energy drink <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180253/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/beasties_fight_for_copyright_xNUuJJFcgyqRSFtUEkCgtK#ixzz233gzZ2xu">in a Manhattan courtroom</a>, after the corporation allegedly stole their songs to use for promotional reasons. It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180253/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooky_Puss">Cooky Puss all over again</a>! </p>
