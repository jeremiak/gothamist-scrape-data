<p>Yesterday the vegan doughnut guys behind Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503230312/http://gothamist.com/tags/dunwelldoughnuts">Dun-Well Doughnuts</a> started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503230312/https://twitter.com/DunWellDoughnut/status/311885964110884865">offering up</a> a new treat: avocado chocolate mousse filled doughnuts. <em>Say what?</em></p>

<p>Dun-Well&apos;s Christopher Hollowell tells us, &quot;Avocados are a superfood! But beyond that they are a fatty rich and creamy dream for any young epicurean. At Dun-Well we strive to toe the line between the familiar and the curious.To some the combination of an avocado and chocolate may seem a bit at odds but to me it seemed like a perfect combination for a decedent mousse. And the moment we placed it inside a fluffy doughnut topped with confectinary sugar... well, it was heaven.&quot; Here&apos;s the recipe Hollowell used:<br>
 </p><ul><li>4 Cups avacados<br>
</li><li>2/3 Cups coco powder<br>
</li><li>1 Cup Confectionary sugar<br>
</li><li>2 Tbsp Vanilla<br>
</li><li>pinch of salt<br>
</li><li>and about 1/4 Cup melted dark chocolate</li></ul><br>
We got to test these out and it&apos;s important to note you will not taste the avocado flavor, which is a good thing. Overall the filling was pretty rich and had a mostly chocolate flavor to it... but for the hardcore chocolate and dairy lover it may be lacking, as it&apos;s missing the creamy element often associated with doughnut fillings like this. And the outer doughnut itself was superb, as always&#x2014;Dun-Well has really perfected the non-cake-based vegan doughnut like no one else (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503230312/http://gothamist.com/tags/cinnamonsnail">Cinnamon Snail</a> is <em>just about</em> on par).<p></p>

<p>So will avocado-based desserts be turning up on menus more often? They have made it into sweets before, but most often in the form of an ice cream or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503230312/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/02/where-to-find-avocado-shakes-nyc-manhattan-vietnamese.html">milkshake</a>. As long as a ton of sugar isn&apos;t dumped into the mix, avocado-bases are better for you than the typical dessert fare&#x2014;to echo Hollowell&apos;s earlier superfood sentiment, they&apos;re good for promoting heart health, preventing inflammation, regulating blood sugar levels, fighting cancer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503230312/http://withstyleandgraceblog.com/2012/02/02/vegan-chocolate-avocado-pudding-for-health-nuts/">and more</a>.</p>
