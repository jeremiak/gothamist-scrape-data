<p>Did anyone <em>really</em> believe that the Improv Everywhere troupe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316054048/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/01/extreme_pranking_no_underwear_subwa.php">rode the subway naked</a>? The video was posted <em>on April Fools Day</em>, but it seemed like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316054048/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/subway-nudity-possibly-o-k-with-everyone/">the NY Times</a> may have fallen for it... they even called the cops! The gullible Grey Lady was told by an NYPD spokesperson that no laws was broken, and they confirm, saying: &quot;We checked, and sure enough, the definition of &apos;exposure of a person,&apos; a violation under section 245.01 of the state&#x2019;s penal code&quot; (heh) &quot;states that the law does not apply to any person entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment.&quot; Alas, as we pointed out yesterday, the pranksters were all wearing nude-colored undies. And underwear fetishists (if you even exist) take note: IE head Charlie Todd says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316054048/http://improveverywhere.com/2010/04/02/no-underwear-april-fools/">an uncensored video</a> will be made available soon.</p>
