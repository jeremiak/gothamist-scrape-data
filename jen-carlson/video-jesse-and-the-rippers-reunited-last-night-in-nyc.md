<p>As we excitedly took note of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822104349/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/john_stamos_is_getting_his_full_hou.php">earlier this week</a>, John Stamos got his <em>Full House</em> band, Jesse and the Rippers, back together. WHO EVEN KNOWS WHY. But it all happened last night on <em>Late Night</em>&#x2014;Jimmy Fallon introduced them saying, &quot;They&apos;re a great band out of San Francisco. In 1992 their single &apos;Forever&apos;  became a #1 in Japan [and] tonight they&apos;re reuniting for one night only.&quot; They proceeded to play a medley of their hits, as well as the <em>Full House</em> theme song... and Lori Loughlin showed up! Life is so weird and confusing&#x2014;enjoy it:</p>
