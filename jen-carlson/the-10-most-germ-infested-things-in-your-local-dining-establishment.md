<p>The latest reminder comes from an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162716/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/10-germiest-places-restaurant-hint-bathroom/story?id=17728078#.ULOSDeOe_b_">ABC News</a> report that declares we&apos;re sitting on E. coli and squeezing lemon-soaked human fecal matter into our iced teas whenever we dine out. You know, <em>probably</em>. The report lists off the top ten germ-infested surfaces in restaurants around the country&#x2014;though they only swabbed ten surfaces in ten restaurants in three states. </p>

<p>1. Seats<br>
2. Menus<br>
3. Lemon wedges<br>
4. Salt and pepper shakers<br>
5. Tables<br>
6. Rims of glasses<br>
7. Bathroom door knobs<br>
8. Bathroom faucets<br>
9. Ketchup bottles<br>
10. Salad bar tongs</p>

<p>For more on germ-laced garnishes, revisit the <em>Today</em> show&apos;s eye-opening 2008 report: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162716/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23355862/ns/today-today_health/t/stop-poop-your-lemon/#.ULOTBeOe_b8">&quot;Stop! Is that poop on your lemon?&quot;</a></p>
