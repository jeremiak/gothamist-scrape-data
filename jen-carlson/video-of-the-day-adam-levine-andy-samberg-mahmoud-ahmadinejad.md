										<p>SNL is back! Not sure if the exclamation point is necessary, but their 33rd season kicked off this past weekend with some good stuff. LeBron James was host and Kanye West was the musical guest -- West actually showed up in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060524/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbi9oHWGGWo">a good sketch</a>, though oddly enough not this musical one. The below is a ballad to the President of Iran called &quot;Iran So Far&quot; delivered by Andy Samberg and Maroon 5&apos;s Adam Levine. &quot;You can&apos;t deny there&apos;s something between us. I know you say there&apos;s no gays in Iran, but you&apos;re in New York now, baby!&quot; </p>
