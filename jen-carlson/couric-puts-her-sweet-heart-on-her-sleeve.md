<p><img alt="2007_07_artscouric.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629084802im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_07_artscouric.jpg" width="150" height="195" class="left">New York magazine has a big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629084802/http://nymag.com/news/features/34452/">cover feature on Katie Couric</a>, aka America&apos;s Sweetheart...at least, she used to be. The feature by Joe Hagan is at times a Couric confessional, complaint-fest, and call to arms (literally - she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629084802/http://nymag.com/news/features/34452/index6.html">apparently &quot;slapped&quot; a news editor on the arm</a> for using the word &quot;sputum&quot;) that looks at the much ballyhooed move from the Today show to the storied news ground of CBS where her evening news program is in third place.</p>

<p>One big admission Couric makes is that the job didn&apos;t end up being something she&apos;d necessarily take today. With an original goal of creating something between &quot;The Naked News, a British TV show in which beautiful women undress as they read the headlines&quot; and &#x201C;two boring people behind a desk,&#x201D; Couric and Co. had a lot of creative room to work with, so what happened? </p>

<p>Along with the hype, there was some internal CBS grumbling. CBS veteran correspondents took pay cuts to pay for her salary, over-budgeted segment shoots and her entourage (who were brought over from NBC), all of which also took up the precious news budget.  And though Couric tried to usher in a new evening news format, the network ended up alienating their audience instead of adding more new viewers, the program went back to a traditional format.  When asked what regrets she may have about leaving her perch at NBC, she tells NYMag:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I still believe I did the right thing, in my heart,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I would always regret not taking it. There are no guarantees, I knew that going in. I didn&#x2019;t think I was going to take the evening news world by storm, and if I gave anyone that impression, I&#x2019;m embarrassed. I thought I had done something for a while, this genre could use a little shot in the arm, maybe I could revitalize it somewhat. I had no delusions that this was a growing enterprise. I mean, I&#x2019;m not an idiot &#x2026; I think that&#x2019;s why some of this pettiness and sort of gleeful evisceration of me doesn&#x2019;t cut as much as you might think or even I might have thought. My expectations were never so high that if I wasn&#x2019;t No. 1 it would be devastating to me.&#x201D;</blockquote>However, Couric plans to continue to try to charm her way in to the evening news audiences hearts. And she&apos;s not leaving any time soon, as she&apos;s &quot;looking to the 2008 election cycle as an opportunity to build her reputation as the network&#x2019;s authoritative voice.&quot;  If she can&apos;t prove herself there, we look forward to the inevitable Barbara Walters hour long cry-fest with America&apos;s fallen sweetheart.<p></p>
