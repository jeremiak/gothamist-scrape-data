<p>Lena Dunham has just &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175454/https://twitter.com/lenadunham/status/403908639037333504">parked the trailer</a>&quot; for the new season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175454/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>GIRLS</em></a>, and you can re-enter the world of the self-obsessed twenty-somethings below. </p>

<p>Thankfully it looks like we&apos;ll be departing the dark world of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175454/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/girls_gone_obsessive_compulsive.php">OCD Hannah</a> from last season, but otherwise everything looks pretty much the same! Marnie&apos;s being <em>so Marnie</em>, Jessa is... there-ish, Shoshanna is still just a ridiculous caricature of herself. And Charlie seems to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175454/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/04/boy_leaves_girls.php">left not with a bang</a> but a whimper (classic millennial male). Also, Hannah has entered Cubicle Life at what looks like a glossy magazine and it seems to be really crushing her struggling writer soul.</p>

<p>The third season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175454/http://hbowatch.com/girls-season-3-premiere-date-confirmed/">premieres on HBO</a> on Sunday, January 12th at 10 p.m. (they&apos;ll be running two episodes back-to-back).</p>
