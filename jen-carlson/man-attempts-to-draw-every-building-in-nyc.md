title: Man Attempts To Draw Every Building In NYC
---

	
										<p>Australian-born and New York-based illustrator James Gulliver Hancock is attempting to draw every building in New York City (just as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021053248/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/10/drawing_every_p.php">Jason Polan</a> is attempting to draw very <em>person</em>). His ambitious project is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021053248/http://allthebuildingsinnewyork.blogspot.com/">Through All the Buildings in New York</a>, and maybe if we stop building for a while he can catch up! Below check out the artist discussing this (and other) project(s). Want your building <em>now</em>, it&apos;ll only cost you $200, and for that you get &quot;hand painted acrylic and ink on wood of the New York building of your choice.&quot;</p>
