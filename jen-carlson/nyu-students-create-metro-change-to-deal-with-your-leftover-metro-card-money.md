<p>You know those MetroCards that have a random, unusable amount of money left on them, that are destined to burn a hole in your pocket? If you take all the leftover money on those things, it adds up to $52 million a year. So why not have a kiosk that allows you to donate your card&apos;s leftover funds into one central fund, which is then donated to charity? That&apos;s the idea behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192758/http://blog.metrochange.org/">MetroChange</a>.</p>

<p>The physical card would be taken for recycling, and the money on it would go to charity. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192758/http://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2011/metrochange/">The creators</a> (students of NYU&apos;s Interactive Communications Program) they have researched how to make this happen (in nerd-speak: &quot;There is a kiosk with Arduino, ethernet shield, LCD screen, IR transmitter and receiver, and magstripe reader&quot;), and that each person donating would be able to choose on the kiosk which charity to donate to.</p>

<p>You can go through their testing process <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192758/http://blog.metrochange.org/">right here</a>, where they conclude, &quot;We&#x2019;re continuing this project&#x2014;we hope to find more ways of eating into these odd problems with the MetroCard system upstream. After that we&#x2019;ll devise ways of using any remaining value that is left on cards in a more productive way.&quot; We&apos;ve reached out to the MTA, who may have something to say about all this, and will update when we hear back.</p>
