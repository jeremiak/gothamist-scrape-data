Touted as America&apos;s largest architect and design event, OHNY opens usually locked doors throughout New York City each October (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081609/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/31/open_house.php">sometimes Spring</a>). </p>

<p>Discover new nooks in each of the five boroughs through special talks, tours, performances and workshops. The weekend is free and this year has over 300 sites and programs open for participation. </p>

<p>Some picks: A 19th Century row house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081609/http://www.ohny.org/weekend/listing_results.cfm?borough=&amp;b_type=&amp;neighborhood=&amp;keyword=carroll">in Carroll Gardens</a> (pictured), an MTA substation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081609/http://www.ohny.org/weekend/listing_results.cfm?borough=&amp;b_type=&amp;neighborhood=&amp;keyword=mta">in Brooklyn</a> and some old theaters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081609/http://www.ohny.org/programs/listing_results.cfm?mystartrow=76&amp;realstartrow=76&amp;action=simple&amp;q=saturday">in Park Slope</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081609/http://www.ohny.org/weekend/listing_results.cfm?borough=&amp;b_type=&amp;neighborhood=&amp;keyword=green-wood">Green-Wood Cemetery</a> is definitely worth a visit if you haven&apos;t already been there. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081609/http://www.ohny.org/programs/listing_results.cfm?keyword=World&apos;s%20Fair%20Architecture%20Walking%20Tour">World&apos;s Fair Architecture Walking Tour</a> is a must since some of the structures there were put on the endangered list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302081609/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/07/endangered_monu.php">earlier this year</a>. </p>
