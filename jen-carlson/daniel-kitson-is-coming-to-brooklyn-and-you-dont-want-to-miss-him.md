                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="SMkitsond1013.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072226im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SMkitsond1013.jpg" width="350" height="293" class="image-right"> </span>In 2006, back when we were hosting comedy nights (should we bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072226/http://gothamist.com/tags/laughablehype">Laughable Hype</a> back?), we asked comedian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072226/http://gothamist.com/tags/eugenemirman">Eugene Mirman</a> for help filling a slot on a show. He wrote us: &quot;I have a comedian friend who is visiting from England who is very funny. His name is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072226/http://gothamist.com/tags/danielkitson">Daniel Kitson</a>.&quot; When Mirman tells you someone is &quot;very funny,&quot; that&apos;s all you need to know&#x2014;but Kitson blew any expectations out of the water. He was on another level, immediately gripping the audience and bringing them into his unique world&#x2014;it was a hypnotizing spiral of storytelling and incisive comedy.</p>

<p><em>So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072226/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/28/laughable_hype_4.php">the night turned out very well</a></em>, and since then we&apos;ve seen Kitson just about every time he&apos;s returned to the States, most recently at his solo show at St. Ann&apos;s Warehouse last year, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072226/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/08/theater_review_daniel_kitsons_its_a.php"><em>It&apos;s Always Right Now, Until It&apos;s Later</em></a>. And now he&apos;ll return to that theater next month, with another run of solo shows from November 22nd through December 21st. This one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072226/http://www.stannswarehouse.org/current_season.php?show_id=88">is called <em>Analog.Ue</em></a>, and tickets are currently on sale. You&apos;ll want to buy one.</p>
