<p>Prepare for your Instagram feed to be filled with sun porn&#x2014;tonight is the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303132339/http://gothamist.com/tags/manhattanhenge">Manhattanhenge</a> of the year, and it looks as though it may be ruined by rain and an overcast sky. But there are three more coming up soon&#x2014;astrophysicist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303132339/http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium/resources/manhattanhenge">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> has posted this year&apos;s schedule, which goes like this:</p>

<p><strong>Half Sun on the Grid</strong><br>
May 28 8:16 P.M. EDT<br>
July 13 8:24 P.M. EDT</p>

<p><strong> Full Sun on the Grid</strong><br>
May 29 8:15 P.M. EDT<br>
July 12 8:23 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, deGrasse Tyson (the director of the Hayden Planetarium in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History) founded the event, which happens four times a year when the setting sun aligns precisely with the Manhattan street grid, &quot;illuminating both the north and south sides of every cross street of the borough&apos;s grid.&quot;</p>

<p>deGrasse has pointed out that future civilizations may think our grid has &quot;astronomical significance, just as we have found for the pre-historic circle of large vertical rocks known as Stonehenge. For Stonehenge, the special day is the summer solstice, when the Sun rises in perfect alignment with several of the stones, signaling the change of season.&quot; Though he adds that our days happen to correspond with Memorial Day and Baseball&apos;s All Star break, so &quot;future anthropologists might conclude that, via the Sun, the people who called themselves Americans worshiped War and Baseball.&quot;</p>
