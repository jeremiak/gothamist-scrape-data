At the time VanRy said he would likely just pay the fine, but after all the attention he&apos;s now pleading not-guilty at a November court appearance.</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I think this is a real gray area. I don&#x2019;t think I was doing anything wrong.&#x201D; He questioned the notion that his stoop is considered a &#x201C;public place&#x201D; as defined by the law. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s one of those laws that a lot of people know it&#x2019;s there, but how heavily it should be enforced is a question.&quot;</blockquote>The gray area comes partially from Mayor Bloomberg himself, who stated that uncorking a bottle of wine for a concert in the park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302220119/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/17/barefoot_and_boozing_in_the_park.php">is a-okay</a> by him, not to mention he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302220119/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05232008/news/regionalnews/mikes_illegal_drink_112133.htm">photographed this past May</a> drinking a glass of wine at Brooklyn Bridge Park!<p></p>

<p>Currently, &quot;the city&#x2019;s open-container law prohibits anyone from drinking an alcoholic beverage, or possessing and intending to drink from an open container containing an alcoholic beverage, in any public place. The law defines a public place as one &apos;to which the public or a substantial group of persons has access, including, but not limited to,&apos; a sidewalk, street or park.&quot; If one is caught drinking in public without a permit (at a blockparty, etc) then that person faces a fine of $25 or five days behind bars.</p>
