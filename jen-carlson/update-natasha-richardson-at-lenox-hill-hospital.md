<p>Reiterating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03172009/news/worldnews/natasha_richardson_is_brain_dead_160027.htm">the Post&apos;s earlier report</a>, a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/03/17/2009-03-17_actress_natasha_richardson_who_suffered_.html">tells the Daily News</a> that Richardson &quot;is brain dead,&quot; adding that she had &quot;been on life support since [Tuesday] morning.&quot; On Monday, Richardson had fallen during a private skiing lesson on a beginner trail (pictured) in Quebec.  Though she appeared fine afterwards, some say she could have suffered from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509586,00.html">&quot;talk and die syndrome&quot;</a>, which a doctor described as when a person seems okay but is suffering from an epidural hemorrhage, where blood rapidly collects between the skull and brain. The resort <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Natasha-Richardson-near-death-after-ski-accident-41340947.html">released a statement</a> saying Richardson declined to see a doctor after her fall but complained of a headache an hour later and was taken away in an ambulance.</p>

<p>Richardson, along with her husband Liam Neeson and their two sons, has a home in Manhattan as well as one in upstate New York. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/603508">A reporter</a> witnessed Neeson at her side as she was boarded on to the plane in Canada, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/theater/18richardson.html?em">the NY Times</a> reports that at that time she was &quot;heavily wrapped in blankets with tubes around her face.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20266327,00.html">According to People</a>, &quot;friends and family members gathered for a vigil in New York to be with Richardson.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094553/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/the_awful_truth/b104857_friends_of_natasha_richardson_mourning.html">E! Online</a> has reported from unnamed sources, said to be friends of the actresses, that &quot;her <em>body</em>&quot; was flown back to New York, and &quot;They would not put her on a plane with the air pressure changes if she had brain swelling and was still alive.&quot;  The Canadian hospital said that Richardson&apos;s family was expected to release a statement today.  </p>
