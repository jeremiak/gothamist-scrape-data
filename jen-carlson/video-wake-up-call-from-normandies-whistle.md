<p>Earlier this year an exhibit called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015044214/http://www.southstreetseaportmuseum.org/normandie/normandieindex.html">DECODENCE: Legendary Interiors and Illustrious Travelers Aboard the SS Normandie</a> opened at the South Street Seaport Museum (it will run through next January), and yesterday the 600-lb. whistle was blasted to commemorate the 75th anniversary of SS Normandie&#x2019;s arrival in New York Harbor. We&apos;re gonna make it our new ringtone.
