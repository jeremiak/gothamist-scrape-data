Local activists rallied for the dig and hope they&apos;ll be able to unearth Revolutionary War artifacts at the site, even though there was some uncertainty if it really was an outpost from the 1776 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325181504/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/26/post_129.php">Battle of Brooklyn</a>. <p></p>

<p>One Community Board 9 member was confident it was, and told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325181504/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/06/10/2010-06-10_street_a_war_zone_dig_in_crown_hts_to_hunt_for_1776_artifacts.html#ixzz0qUFEUPfe">the Daily News</a>, &quot;This is not your average street. There&apos;s more than meets the eye.&quot;</p>

<p>Not everyone is up for the historical dig, however, and one mom on a nearby street asked, &quot;How is it going to help me? My children are young and they&apos;re going to run around. It could be dangerous.&quot; Artifacts, schmartifacts!</p>

<p>While it&apos;s uncertain if any artifacts will be uncovered, one study showed that the road was guarded by around 800 American soldiers at one point, so the hope is a dig will show what camp life was like for the troops.</p>
