										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bjoelmsg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173705im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bjoelmsg.jpg" width="300" height="199" class="image-right"> </span>Madison Square Garden has announced that they&apos;ve acquired <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173705/http://gothamist.com/tags/billyjoel">Billy Joel</a>, his piano, and presumably his soul (or what&apos;s left of it) today, in what appears to be a desperate ploy to distract the public from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173705/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/03/this_week_in_knicks_knicks_hit_rock.php">how shitty the Knicks are</a>.</p>

<p>According to a press release from MSG, Joel will become their first-ever music franchise, and is joining the New York Knicks, Rangers and Liberty. <em>They even made him a logo</em>. As part of his contract, Joel will be performing one show a month, &quot;as long as there is demand,&quot; starting January 27th, 2014 (the first not sold out show is on May 9th, and tickets go on sale December 7th).</p>

<p>James Dolan, executive chairman of MSG, declared, &#x201C;This new partnership will ensure that someone who has been such an important figure in our past, will also be a major part of our future&quot; NO MATTER WHAT.</p>

<p>Joel released a statement, saying: &#x201C;Performing at Madison Square Garden is a thrilling experience. I&#x2019;ve played different venues all over the world, but there&#x2019;s no place like coming home to the Garden. Since my first show in 1978, I&#x2019;ve always looked forward to the energy of the crowd. I&#x2019;m honored to be joining the Madison Square Garden family and look forward to taking the stage of the newly transformed Garden to create many more memorable nights...&quot; forever and ever, until I die, they own me.</p>
