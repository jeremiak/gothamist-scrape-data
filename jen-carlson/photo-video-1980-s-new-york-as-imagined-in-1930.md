<p>In the 1930s, people had a much different vision for what the 1980s would look like for New York City. This image is from the New York Public Library archives, and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010111/http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&amp;strucID=778118&amp;imageID=1517079&amp;word=1980&amp;s=1&amp;notword=&amp;d=&amp;c=&amp;f=&amp;k=0&amp;lWord=&amp;lField=&amp;sScope=&amp;sLevel=&amp;sLabel=&amp;total=106&amp;num=60&amp;imgs=20&amp;pNum=&amp;pos=75">captioned</a>: &quot;New York in 1980 as imagined in a new talking picture&quot; (from 1930). Just look at how clean everything is! Nothing like the real &apos;80s, which looked a bit more... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010111/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php#photo-1">apocalyptic</a>. </p>

<p>So what do we have going on here? It looks like the sub-streets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010111/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/20/2level_streets.php">which we&apos;ve seen before</a>, have been worked into the rendering. Even with some skyscrapers in the background, it doesn&apos;t really <em>look</em> like New York City, however. In fact, it looks like a lot of the elements of castle architecture have been included here, sort of like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010111/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/how_new_yorkers_in_1900_pictured_ma.php">this vision of the city in 1999</a>, drawn up by a man in 1900.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the NYPL for more information on this image, and will update when we hear back. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This is from a 1930s film called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010111/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Imagine"><em>Just Imagine</em></a>, which is &quot;best known for its art direction and special effects in its portrayal of New York City in an imagined 1980.&quot; It&apos;s never officially been released on DVD or VHS, but here&apos;s a look:</p>
