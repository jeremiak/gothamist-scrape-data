<p>In an exhibit opening up this October, the NY-Historical Society will shine the bat signal on New York City&apos;s superheroes. Or rather: Gotham&apos;s superheroes. Either way, they all have ties to NYC, dating back to the 1930s, as the exhibit aims to explore &quot;the deeply-rooted New York origins of the six major DC and Marvel superhero titles.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Since their introduction in the late 1930s, superheroes have been powerful role models, inspirational and enviable. Based on mythological archetypes, they reflect, respond to, and offer ways to navigate the twists and turns of modern life. Comic books are a great American art form, a cultural phenomenon born in New York City that now extends around the globe. Superheroes in Gotham will tell the story of the birth of comic book superheroes in New York City; the leap of comic book superheroes from the page into radio, television, and film; the role of fandom, including the yearly mega event known as New York Comic Con; and the ways in which comic book superheroes, created in the late 1930s through the 1960s, have inspired and influenced the work of contemporary comic book artists, cartoonists, and painters in New York City.</blockquote>
