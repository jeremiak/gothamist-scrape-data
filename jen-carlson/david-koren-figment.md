The three day free, non-profit, participatory art celebration is a collaborative effort mainly organized by David Koren and a fleet of volunteers. This week Koren told us about what one can expect on the island this year, the importance of Governors Island, and the mini-golf course they&apos;ve set up called City of Dreams (named after the Talking Heads song) which he just nearly told David Byrne about.</em></p>

<p><strong>How many years has the Figment festival been around for now?</strong> 2008 is FIGMENT&#x2019;s second year. We started it in 2007, and thought we&#x2019;d be able to get 200-500 people to come out to FIGMENT. We had 2,800 people there. This year, we&#x2019;re expecting many more.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it called Figment?</strong> The name comes from Andy Warhol. He once commented that he&#x2019;d like his tombstone to have only one word on it: &#x201C;Figment.&#x201D; Though Warhol never got his wish (he has a traditional grave marker), we hope that this event can build a bridge between the incredible history of the arts in New York, while pointing the way to the future, and helping New York to remain the center of the art world.</p>

<p><strong>Can you describe the 3-day affair?</strong> I can try, but since FIGMENT is a participatory arts event, I don&#x2019;t actually know what&#x2019;s going to happen. The audience gets involved with the art and it changes. So, anything is possible at FIGMENT. But here&apos;s the basic idea: We have over 200 registered art projects all over Governors Island, plus a lot of smaller art projects and interactive activities and experiences that will undoubtedly just show up. Since our focus is on participation, we encourage people to bring projects and activities with them. (We can&#x2019;t give placement or provide any resources for projects that just show up, however.) We&apos;ll have a City of Dreams minigolf course, a 9-hole course that has been designed by 9 teams of artists, and it opens on Friday for the public to play for free all summer. Artist Douglas Hart is doing a sound installation in Castle Williams called &#x201C;Am I the One?&#x201D; That&apos;s just two of the the many events. And there will be many activities for kids, including crafts and costuming, and the Brooklyn Children&#x2019;s Museum and the American Museum of Natural History are participating. There will be lots of interactive sculpture and other activities, and we have a full series of lectures.</p>
