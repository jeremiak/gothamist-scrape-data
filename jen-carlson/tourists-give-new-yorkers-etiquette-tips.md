<p>We&apos;ve seen what some New Yorkers have to say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030336/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/new_yorkers_give_tourists_etiquette.php">about tourist etiquette</a>, but what about the other way around? The tourists put lots of money into our city&apos;s pockets, so we might as well hear them out. We&apos;ve rounded up some former NYC tourists, from Amsterdam to New Jersey and beyond&#x2014;and they have a few etiquette tips (and observations) of their own:<br>
</p><ul><li>Don&apos;t walk so fast!  <br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t roll your eyes at me when I pronounce &quot;Houston&quot; Street like the city in Texas.<br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t say I&apos;m stupid for calling the subways by colors.<br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t tell me I&apos;m dumb for eating at the Olive Garden&#x2014;I love breadsticks!<br>
</li><li>Slow down! There is always such a rush at the restaurants... as soon as somebody is done with eating they take away the plate, even if other people at the table are still eating. <br>
</li><li>At least make eye contact while &#x201C;clinking glasses&#x201D;!<br>
</li><li>Stop talking about how you live in the greatest city in the world.  We get it.<br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t cycle so fast in the bike lane on the Brooklyn Bridge while I am trying to capture the skyline.<br>
</li><li>My advice would be, like here in Amsterdam, be proud of your city not only towards your neighbor but also to outsiders&#x2014;just to show your hospitality. Allow us to ask for directions as we will do the same for you when you come over. <br>
</li><li>Explain to us why the tipping in restaurants etc is the way it is in stead of getting angry if we tip less than you are used to.<br>
</li><li>Say thank you if someone holds the door open for you. Also, while we&apos;re on the subject, if you see me struggling with my bags and my coffee maybe wait the extra five seconds to hold the door open for me. I will even thank you for it!<br>
</li><li>Tell me where to buy counterfeit purses.<br>
</li><li>Give me correct directions... New Yorkers have too much pride, if you ask for directions and they don&apos;t really know the answer, they will make something up rather than saying, &quot;Sorry, I&apos;m not sure.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Got all that? Now here are some further observations about how we act&#x2014;take a nice long look in the mirror, New York City:</p>

<ul><li>My experience with New Yorkers is that they differ from each area. If you&apos;re walking downtown for instance everyone is really in a work mode and not very accessible. The same applies on 5th Avenue. A lot of people walking around with their headsets on just as if they want to say: &quot;not listening and don&apos;t ask me anything.&quot;
</li><li>People will make any excuse to have a drink with any meal in New York&#x2014;from happy hours to brunches.
</li><li>New Yorkers are very exact on how you handle escalators.  If you&apos;re standing the entire time you get in the line on the right side of the escalator, leaving a clear open isle on the left side so people can walk up faster.</li></ul>

<p>Think we can all get along now, or do we need to make more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030336/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">tourist lanes</a>?</p>
