His writers have only been putting pen to paper for their picket signs, and even though he returned to his late night desk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165959/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/03/video_of_the_da_146.php">earlier this month</a> -- he&apos;s been a one-man show, lacking his trusty troupe of scribes. Alone and living in a world of reruns, he&apos;s been unloading in his <strike>diary</strike> strike journal.</p>

<p>In EW&apos;s latest issue, which hit newsstands today, they dive into the mind of the bearded late night host, peeking at the pages of his papyrus pal. It&apos;s not pretty, from day one the fear of shows losing their freshness sets in, leaving Conan to turn to the dark side of television: unscripted reality. The horror!</p><blockquote>DAY 1<br>
I am alive, but there is no writing for television and motion pictures. I stumble about my apartment &#x2014; a stranger in a strange land. Gathering my wits, I take stock of my meager supplies: four original episodes of House, a handful of fresh 30 Rocks, and two Heroes, which I fear have gone bad. I cannot survive long &#x2014; panic sets in.<p></p>

<p>DAY 12<br>
Tragedy! A power surge fries my DVR, destroying my meager larder of scripted shows. With little to sustain me, I am forced to subsist entirely on Reality Television. I gorge myself on marathons of The Real Housewives of Orange County and Flavor of Love, then collapse in a wretched heap. If this is living, I welcome death.</p>

<p>DAY 51<br>
I am now surviving completely on Game Shows. I have lost weight, my hands tremble uncontrollably, but I am certain that Briefcase Twenty-Two holds the million dollars. I scream at my television, but that stupid Physical Therapist from Tarzana cannot hear me. Seriously &#x2014; what is wrong with that bitch?</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165959/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20172074,00.html">Read more here</a>, but be warned, it gets even darker as Conan finds out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165959/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/07/golden_globes_f.php">Golden Globes</a> are canceled, leaving us all to live in a world that does not congratulate itself.<p></p>
