The nickname for the architectural atrocity (more officially referred to as the &quot;balconet&quot;) comes from its appearance in Shakespeare&apos;s <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em>. Fittingly, it&apos;s basically nothing more than a glorified suicide ledge. Aside from teasing the apartment&apos;s inhabitant with a small taste of outdoor space, what is the point of having one of these?</p>

<p>For the unfamiliar, or those lacking enough hate in their hearts for these things, the Juliet Balcony is essentially as good as a mirage, giving one the <em>feeling</em> that there is usable outdoor space in an apartment, but not actually delivering any. This style of balcony often provides just a few inches of floor protruding from one&apos;s apartment, which could drive any inhabitant mad&#x2014;<em>Lady Macbeth-levels mad</em>&#x2014;wondering why the architect didn&apos;t just add a few more inches, or ideally: feet. A more generous one may allow for a small potted plant, but typically you&apos;re lucky if your big toe can enjoy a breeze while resting upon its shallow platform.</p>

<p>So why all this hate for a balcony style that&apos;s been around forever and isn&apos;t actually hurting anyone? These pasted-on decorations are being used on many of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204057/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=210+south+1st+st+brooklyn&amp;ll=40.712907,-73.958952&amp;spn=0.006067,0.012918&amp;sll=40.712704,-73.959071&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,249.08,,0,-23.47&amp;cbll=40.712866,-73.958848&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=210+S+1st+St,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11211&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;panoid=jphfZS_wda7tL5RgXzy82g">the newer &quot;luxury&quot;-style apartments</a> around the city, they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204057/http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/aap?srchType=A&amp;zoomToPosting=&amp;query=juliet+balcony&amp;minAsk=&amp;maxAsk=&amp;bedrooms=&amp;hasPic=1">all over</a> the rental market, and even appear in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204057/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/22/first_look_inside_the_citys_new_mic.php#photo-1">the new micro-apartment renderings</a>. So we&apos;re here with a plea: architects, please bring these balconies to their timeless end.</p>
