<p>First, what is a dosa? &quot;Dosas have been a staple item in south Indian cuisine for centuries and are popular throughout all of India. The savory pancake is eaten for breakfast, dinner, or even as a snack item. Dosas are usually considered appropriate for vegetarians and individuals with wheat allergies or gluten intolerance. They may also appeal to the health conscious, as they are usually high in carbohydrates and low in calories and fat,&quot; says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810134806/http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-dosa.htm">The Internet</a>.</p>

<p>Second, where do you get the best dosa in New York City? Sure, you could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810134806/http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Best+Dosas&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY">check in with those hacks at Yelp</a>, but why do that when you can just click play and let Rostam Batmanglij (Vampire Weekend), Vijay Iyer (Vijay Iyer Trio), Ashok Kondabolu (Das Racist), Alan Palomo (Neon Indian), Amrit Singh (Stereogum), Himanshu Suri (Das Racist), and Anand Wilder (Yeasayer) tell you.</p>

<p>This group got together last year to film their hunt for the best dosa in the city, so stay tuned for what&apos;s sure to be this spring&apos;s blockbuster hit: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810134806/http://dosahunt.com/">DOSA HUNT</a>. We&apos;re holding out for the IMAX 3-D release, but it should be available at a computer monitor near you this spring... and this morning, they released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810134806/http://dosahunt.tumblr.com/post/17605682070/dosa-hunt-trailer">the trailer</a>:</p>
