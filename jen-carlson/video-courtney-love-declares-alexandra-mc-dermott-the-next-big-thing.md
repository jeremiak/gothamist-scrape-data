title: Video: Courtney Love Declares Alexandra McDermott The Next Big Thing
---

	
										<p>At press time, 17-year-old Alexandra McDermott of Portland, Oregon has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033639/http://www.youtube.com/user/mellymcdable">16 subscribers</a> to her YouTube Channel, 189 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033639/https://twitter.com/AlexandraMcDerm">followers on Twitter</a>, and  just over 5,000 views on the below video, which she uploaded in January. But Courtney Love just found her, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033639/https://twitter.com/Courtney/">Tweeted</a>, &quot;This girl is gonna be huge!&quot; </p>

<p>Yes, sadly, Perez Hilton (who has tried to put his stamp on bands and musicians before) has also come on board, but hopefully Alexandra will escape his grasp on the way to the limelight. Check out her cover of &quot;Big Jet Plane&quot; below. It really is gorgeous (and Miss McDermott is also an expert at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033639/http://rookiemag.com/2011/10/diy-bitchface/">the bitchface</a>!)</p>
