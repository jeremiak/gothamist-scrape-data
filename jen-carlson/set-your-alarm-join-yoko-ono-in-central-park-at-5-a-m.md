<span class="photo_caption">Yoko Ono <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151700/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/13/photo_yoko_ono_constructs_the_imagi.php">constructing the Imagine mosaic</a> in Central Park.</span></p>

<p>This just in! Tomorrow morning, Tuesday June 21st from 5 a.m .to 8 a.m., you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151700/http://imaginepeace.com/archives/15215">join Yoko Ono</a> in Central Park to celebrate the summer solstice. Everyone &quot;will meet at Columbus Circle starting at 5 a.m. Bring any musical instrument or just your voice, and we will send you to a secluded part of the park to play the note of your choice to the accompaniment of birds. At 8 a.m. we will all return to Columbus Circle for hot green tea.&quot; The sheet music is below, and if you go, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151700/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos... although, this is meant to be meditative, so maybe you should leave your gadgets tucked away just this once.</p>
