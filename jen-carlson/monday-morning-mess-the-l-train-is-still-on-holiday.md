<p>If you take the L train then you probably already know that it&apos;s not really working so well this morning. Since at least 6:30 a.m., the line has been experiencing extensive delays. The MTA is currently alerting customers to expect delays <em>in both directions</em>, or to seek an alternate route, specifically advising &quot;to take the A or J train service at the Broadway Junction Station.&quot; However, the A/C/E is also experiencing delays due to signal problems, as is the F, and the 4/5/6&#x2014;though the L seems to be the most severely effected.</p>

<p>The MTA&apos;s site says the delays are due to system wide signal problems, which our contact there confirmed this morning. And it seems the countdown clocks aren&apos;t up to speed either, Leah Linder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183625/https://twitter.com/#!/ThisisLeahL/status/141159439565729792">Tweeted</a> this photo a little bit after 9 a.m., saying, &#x201C;20 minutes later, the L Train sign is still telling lies&#x201D;</p>

<p>Welcome back, everyone!</p>
