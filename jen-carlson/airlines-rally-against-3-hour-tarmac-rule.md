										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="airplanerunway.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164740im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/airplanerunway.jpg" width="350" height="214" class="image-right"> </span>The longest runway at JFK Airport is officially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164740/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/jfk_runway.php">closed for four months</a>, and airlines are rallying against the new rule banning 3+ hour tarmac delays during the runway&apos;s rehab. JetBlue, Delta and American Airlines are asking that the rule, part of a new airline passengers&apos; bill of rights, be lifted until construction is complete; as of April 29th they could face fines up to $27,500 per passenger if they keep the plane on the tarmac for too long.</p>

<p>Kate Hanni of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164740/http://flyersrights.org/">Flyersrights.org</a> told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164740/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/airline_evasive_flying_RxiztKIU2TlqhtNlWgCOLK">the Post</a>, &quot;They [airlines] are going to try to do anything to ensure this rule actually never goes into effect.&quot; She has filed papers opposing their requests.</p>

<p>If the rule were currently in effect, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164740/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/16/virgin_america.php">Virgin America</a> would be facing up to $3.5 million in fines after one of their flights was grounded on the tarmac for nearly 7 hours this weekend (due to high winds). Passengers say the airline never announced a portable staircase that would have allowed them to exit the plane and enter the terminal during the wait, which would have been one way to avoid a fine.</p>
