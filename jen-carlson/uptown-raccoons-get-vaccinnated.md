Well, they&apos;re still there&#x2014;however, the city plans to vaccinate all Upper Manhattan raccoons against rabies so that we don&apos;t get some sort of <em>I Am Legend</em>/<em>Cujo</em> hybrid scenario on our hands. </p>

<p>They announced the vaccination program today and say they&apos;ve documented over three dozen rabid raccoons in the area since December (during the time, one human and one dog have been bit). That is a lot! To get an idea of how this compares to other years and other boroughs, here&apos;s a chart they provided us with:</p>

<p>The trap-vaccinate-release process will be a collaborative effort involving the Health Department, the Parks Department, the Central Park Conservancy and the US Department of Agriculture&#x2014;who are all hoping to contain the outbreak. They began humanely trapping the raccoons in Central Park, Riverside Park and Morningside Park today&#x2014;with traps being set up in remote areas (though you may want to keep your eye on off-leash pets, and children for that matter.)</p>

<p>This may seem like common sense, but since one person tried to nurse a sick raccoon back to health and was bitten recently, it&apos;s worth mentioning: avoid rabid raccoons! If you see one, call 311, and if one attacks you or your pet, call 911 and/or the Animal Bite Unit. Simple as that.
