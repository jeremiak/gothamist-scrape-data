										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="WINDOWSJONES.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224302im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/WINDOWSJONES.jpg" width="350" height="259" class="image-left"> </span>First Norah Jones got criticized for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224302/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/17/norah_jones_joins_brooklyn.php">nouveau-Tuscany vibe</a> in the kitchen of her new Cobble Hill home&#x2014;now the songstress is moving right along with her renovation and allegedly sweet-talked the LPC into letting her have a little bit more light. Beautiful, warm, embracing light. Sounds innocent enough, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224302/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/neighbors_bash_norah_window_in_brick_jYuf3MMZy0GNU0pAD9fiEI">the NY Post</a> reports that &quot;neighbors don&#x2019;t want a window into her soul &#x2014; or home.&quot;</p>

<p>Basically, Jones purchased the Brooklyn brownstone for $4.99 million earlier this year, and now wants to add &quot;10 double-hung windows to the side brick wall.&quot; Neighbors charge that the change would make her home inconsistent with the Greek revival architecture, noting that &quot;breaking this precedent is wrong.&quot; Good luck with <em>that</em> fight, neighbors &#x2014; mainstream, chart-topping, Top 40 adult contemporary artists have <em>never</em> tried to fit in.</p>

<p><em>But wait</em>, Jones allegedly told her opponents in an email: &quot;With respect to the Cobble Hill Association, my windows went through the approvals process with Landmarks and are not out of character with the neighborhood.&quot; She added that her goal was to keep Cobble Hill &quot;beautiful and peaceful.&quot; And on that note, the locals are picking up their torches and threatening they&apos;ll block the construction by filing a lawsuit saying it&#x2019;s a safety hazard.</p>
