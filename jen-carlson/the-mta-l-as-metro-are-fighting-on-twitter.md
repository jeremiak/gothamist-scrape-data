<p>The Los Angeles Metro has been picking fights with mass transit systems this week, since there&apos;s probably nothing else to do when no one uses your system. </p>

<p>Last night they took on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152422/https://twitter.com/metrolosangeles/status/649081601544970240">San Francisco&apos;s Muni</a>, and now they&apos;re mixin&apos; it up with the MTA! </p>

<p>The LA Dodgers will soon be in town to play an Important Baseball Game or two against the Mets (they will play each other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152422/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/27/ya_gotta_believe_mets_clinch_nl_eas.php">in the National League Division Series</a>), and they&apos;ve asked the MTA to clean up the train cars. But at least we <em>have</em> trains running to CitiField&#x2014;out in LA, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152422/http://nypost.com/2015/09/30/why-la-should-feel-silly-for-starting-baseball-twitter-feud/">no train to Dodgers Stadium</a>, giving everyone plenty of time to sit in traffic after the game and meditate on Loss. </p>

<p>Anyway, here are two major U.S. city mass transit systems fighting with GIFs on Twitter, ft. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016152422/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">#PizzaRat</a>.</p>
