title: Indie Night School & Fringe Benefits @ Mo Pitkins
---

<p>A few months ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112745/http://indienightschool.blogspot.com/">Indie Night School</a> asked us to be a panelist, we obliged and promptly discovered our near paralyzing stagefright. Because of this we feel we owe them, ergo, tonight Fringe Benefits and Indie Night School are putting together a Katrina Benefit at Mo Pitkins (you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112745/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/07/25/mo_pitkins_house_of_satisfaction.php">Jimmy Fallon&apos;s bar</a>). We&apos;re really exited to be a mere audience member for this one!</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112745/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2005_10_artswwoz.gif"><img alt="2005_10_artswwoz.gif" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112745im_/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2005_10_artswwoz-thumb.gif" width="400" height="53"></a></p><p>
All proceeds from this event will go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112745/http://www.wwoz.org/">WWOZ</a> New Orleans, &quot;a listener-supported, volunteer-operated radio station, located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The station broadcasts live from the famed New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival annually, and their award-winning programming can be heard on radio stations around the country. WWOZ keeps the music and heritage of the Crescent City alive and loud. Due to hurricane Katrina they signed off on August 27th at midnight. WWOZ&apos;s Internet Broadcast is currently operating through WFMU.&quot;

</p><p>The benefit tonight will consist of two parts, first Indie Night School will hold a special session on the topic of &quot;When Every Second Counts: How to Organize a Successful Benefit Concert ASAP.&quot;  The event will gather together local organizers and, by allowing them to chat with experienced figures in the music industry, learn more about the process of throwing a successful benefit with little lead-time.</p>

<p>Speakers confirmed include Adam Shore [Vice Records, Experienced Benefit Producer], Todd P [Indie Promoter Extraordinare, heralded as the &quot;One-Man Scenemaker&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630112745/http://www.timeoutny.com/features/504/504.toddp.html">in a full-page profile in Time Out NY </a>Profile], Alex Colletti [producer of MTV&apos;s &quot;Unplugged&quot;], Sam Kinken [Ron Delsener Presents/Irving Plaza], Marni Wandner [Brooklyn Responds/Double Blind Music], Mike Blaxill [Music For America/Bands Against Bush]</p>
