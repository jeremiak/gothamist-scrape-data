CBGB will soon be closed, and as an homage - SNL ran a short this past weekend. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203004928/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/10/09/snl_on_cbgb.php">we mentioned before</a>, it was as a part of their New York Stories segements. 

</p><p>Whether the parody is funny or just sad, one must appreciate Fred Armisen portraying Lou Reed. </p>
