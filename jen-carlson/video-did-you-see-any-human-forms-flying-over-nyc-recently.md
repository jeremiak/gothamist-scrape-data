<p>Sometimes viral marketing campaigns can be pretty awesome, even if they go a little unnoticed. For example, we haven&apos;t received any tips from New Yorkers who saw people flying over the city recently... but <em>it happened</em>, and now there&apos;s video. This campaign is courtesy of the movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141024073515/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/"><em>Chronicle</em></a>, due out next month, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141024073515/http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/30/flying-people-spotted-over-new-york-city-film-at-nine/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">TechCrunch</a> the masterminds behind it have been flying these human-like &quot;kites&quot; over New York and New Jersey for the past couple of weeks. They explain:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Since the three main characters of the movie have the ability to fly, we came up with the idea of staging a few &#x201C;flying people&#x201D; sightings around NYC. We achieved that illusion by having 3 custom-made aircraft (which were shaped like human beings) fly above designated areas in NYC and NJ.&#x201D;</blockquote>
