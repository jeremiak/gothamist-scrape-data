<p>Former NYU professor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023857/http://nytheatreintensives.tumblr.com/post/4392331519/faculty-profile-jose-angel-santana">Jos&#xE9; Angel Santana</a> (also pictured) claims he was fired from the university after giving super famous actor, professional student, and fellow NYU professor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023857/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> a &quot;D&quot; in his &#x201C;Directing the Actor II&#x201D; class. The low grade came after Franco missed 12 of the 14 classes while filming <em>127 Hours</em>. Santana wants his job back, and has now filed a lawsuit against NYU in Manhattan Supreme Court.</p>

<p>After Santana filed the grade, he says he was publicly ridiculed by Franco, and tells  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023857/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/the_franco_cut_kIRVk4WuVdydz59WZ4I5tL">the NY Post</a>, &#x201C;<strong>The school has bent over backwards to create a Franco-friendly environment</strong>, that&#x2019;s for sure. The university has done everything in its power to curry favor with James Franco.&#x201D; Last year Franco talked about the grade, telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023857/http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/09/23/james-franco-got-a-d-in-nyu-acting-class">Showbiz411.com</a>, &#x201C;I did the work... I did well in everything else.&#x201D; And whatever, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023857/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/james_franco_graduates_again.php">he graduated</a> <em>and</em> got nominated for an Oscar for the movie he missed class for... but Santana is still out of a job, and NYU is not commenting on the incident thus far.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another one of Franco&apos;s professors, who gave him a good grade, was hired to write and direct <em>William Vincent</em>, which stars Franco and was featured at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival. Santana says, &#x201C;In my opinion, they&#x2019;ve turned the NYU graduate film degree into swag for James Franco&#x2019;s purposes, a possession, something you can buy.&quot; Take note, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023857/http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/2011/12/uh-might-want-to-be-wary-of-james-franco/">University of Houston</a> profs.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s more of the interview, where Franco talks about Santana as a teacher (&quot;He&apos;s a funny guy... he&apos;s a decent guy.&quot;):</p>
