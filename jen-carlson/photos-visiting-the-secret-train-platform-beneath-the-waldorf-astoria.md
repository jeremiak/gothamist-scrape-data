</div></div>					<p>Over the weekend we had a chance to visit the long-abandoned Waldorf-Astoria train platform, which allowed VIPs to enter the hotel in a more private manner&#x2014;most famously it was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, possibly to hide the fact that he was in a wheelchair suffering from polio. The mysterious track, known as Track 61, still houses the train car and private elevator, which were both large enough for FDR&apos;s armor-plated Pierce Arrow car. Legend has it that the car would drive off the train, onto the platform and straight into the elevator, which would lead to the hotel&apos;s garage. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122253/http://trainjotting.com/2007/02/27/ask-engine-bob-the-secret-platform/">Trainjotting</a> has some more history regarding the platform, known as Track 61, and notes that the quest for it &quot;has become a holy grail for many urban explorers.&quot; </p>

<p>Some fun facts regarding the timeline of the tracks: It was first used by General Pershing in 1938, and less than 30 years after that, in 1965, it was the venue for a party thrown by Andy Warhol (fittingly called The Underground Party). </p>

<p>Click through for a look yourself. This space will likely never be open to the public... unless you&apos;re a squatter&#x2014;&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122253/http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/gct61.html">by 1978</a>, the platform was known as one of the many places in Grand Central Terminal where squatters lived.&quot; However, current construction on the new LIRR extension has probably taken care of that (though despite the construction, MTA spokesperson Dan Brucker tells us the train car will remain).</p>
