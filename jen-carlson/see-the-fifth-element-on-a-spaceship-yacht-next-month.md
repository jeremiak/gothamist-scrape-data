<p>The people behind the insanely detailed screening events <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428132229/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/come_celebrate_patrick_batemans_27t.php">for <em>American Psycho</em></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428132229/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/05/derelicte_fashion_show.php"><em>Zoolander</em></a>, and more are about to outdo themselves. On August 27th, BBQ Films will bring their next movie event to the Hudson River&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428132229/http://bbqfilmsfhlostonholiday.splashthat.com/">screening <em>The Fifth Element</em> on a yacht</a> disguised as the luxury space liner Fhloston Paradise.

<p>Organizers tell us: &quot;The evening cruise will feature a screening of the movie, a themed performance from musical act &#x201C;a place both wonderful and strange&#x201D;, a Paradise photo booth, and some of Jean Paul Gaultier&#x2019;s timeless fashions from the film. All guests are invited to attend in their futuristic finest, as they&#x2019;ll be treated to a very special intermission.&quot; With your ticket (which will cost no more than $45) you&apos;ll also receive a complimentary themed cocktail.</p>

<p>Tickets for the event will be released the week of the 22nd, but you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428132229/http://bbqfilmsfhlostonholiday.splashthat.com/">sign up here now</a>!</p>
