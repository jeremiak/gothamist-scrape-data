					<p>The asking price on this New Paltz dome home has been steadily plummeting over the past year-and-a-half, from $1.2 million in March of 2014 to its current price of $899K. The nearly 3,000-square-foot dome looks like a UFO crafted by Paul Bunyan, and on top of normal house stuff&#x2014;3 bedrooms, library, 2.5 baths, 40&apos; curved cedar deck, open living area&#x2014;it ROTATES. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605052013/http://www.elliman.com/other/116-canaan-road-new-paltz-zorkqhb">the listing</a>, &quot;This environmentally constructed Dome can be rotated by a remote control utilizing Passive Solar Energy.&quot; This allows you to look out over the 28-acres of land from every possible angle.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605052013/http://www.domespace.com/en/">Domespace home</a> was built 15 years ago for Manhattanite Shiva Vencat, who used it as a vacation home. Vencat ran into some obstacles during the lengthy building process, and now with selling it. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605052013/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/nyregion/a-tough-sell-a-round-home-in-a-square-housing-market.html">the NY Times</a>, dome homes have been on the decline for various reasons, namely: money.</p>

<blockquote>David B. South, head of the Monolithic Dome Institute and a builder of dome houses, schools and athletic facilities of his own design, said his Texas-based company was erecting as many as 100 homes a year until regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act took effect, forcing banks to look harder at the marketability of the homes they were underwriting. &#x201C;Now it&#x2019;s eight to 10 a year if we&#x2019;re lucky,&#x201D; Mr. South said.</blockquote>
