<p>As far as tunnels go, the Park Avenue one is tops&#x2014;it doesn&apos;t spit you out in New Jersey, and it doesn&apos;t surround you with the crushing weight of tons of water, <em>which is a scary horrifying thing for some people</em>. But the Park Avenue Tunnel&#x2014;which runs from 33rd Street to 40th Street&#x2014;is about to get even better: as part of Summer Streets it will be closed off to traffic, allowing pedestrians to walk through a wonderland of sound and light.</p>

<p>On August 3rd, 10th, and 17th, between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., the tunnel will be transformed through an interactive light and sound installation by artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. His &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621005046/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/downloads/pdf/2013-summer-streets-voice-tunnel-fact-sheet.pdf">Voice Tunnel</a>&#x201D; will take over the 1,400 foot long space with 150 loudspeakers and 300 theatrical spotlights &quot;that produce glimmering arches of light along the tunnel&#x2019;s walls and ceiling. Participants will be able to influence the intensity of each light by speaking into a special intercom at the tunnel&#x2019;s center that records their voice and loops it. At any given time, the tunnel is illuminated by the voices of the past 75 participants.&quot; You won&apos;t even miss the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621005046/http://gothamist.com/tags/rainroom">Rain Room</a>.</p>
