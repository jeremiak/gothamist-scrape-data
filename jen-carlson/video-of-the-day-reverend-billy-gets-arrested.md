Saturday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811083110/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/30/reverend_billy.php">we posted about Reverend Billy getting arrested</a> during Friday night&apos;s Critical Mass as he recited the First Amendment. The above is a video of how it went down. Each police officer involved is identified by the cameraman, and at the end you&apos;ll see Lt Daniel Albano, &quot;one of the main architects of the recent NYPD crackdown on civil rights.&quot; That night Reverend Billy was in jail for 20 hours, and charged with harassment of a public official. 

</p><p>This afternoon, back in Union Square, Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir, Bill Dipaolo of Time&apos;s Up! and Norman Siegel (civil rights attorney) showed the video and made a public announcement requesting that the charges be dropped, while also discussing the ongoing harassment of cyclists and their supporters. Reverend Billy and his choir then sang the First Amendment in the very place where he was arrested.</p>
