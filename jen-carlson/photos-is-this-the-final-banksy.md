<p><strong>UPDATE, 10:55 a.m.:</strong> The new Banksy piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203632/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/new_banksy_is_in_queens.php">is in Long Island City, Queens</a>.</p>

<p>Did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203632/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> already drop his final piece? Are we not getting a Halloween bumper boat adorned with clever commentary floating down the East River like we imagined? Is this the way the month of Banksy ends: not with a bang but a whimper? This piece was spotted at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203632/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=greenwich+and+edgar&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.707385,-74.013841&amp;spn=0.013078,0.026436&amp;sll=40.707147,-74.013932&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,81.48,,0,-10.75&amp;cbll=40.707472,-74.013806&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=Greenwich+St+%26+Edgar+St,+New+York,+10006&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;panoid=Wk54y1QUaEmsXXTT5WeeWg">Edgar and Greenwich</a> in the Financial District this morning, and a few people have already sent it our way. Today marks the last day of Banksy&apos;s month-long, open-air residency, so if this is his, <em>this is it</em>. We&apos;ll update when we have more information, but this area is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203632/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/08/photos_the_nypds_new_ultimate_domai.php#photo-1">highly monitored</a> by NYPD cameras, so whoever did this was likely caught on tape. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203632/http://instagram.com/p/gIj9WNr7wG/">Luna Park</a>, who knows her street art, also spotted it and gave it the #BanksyNY hashtag:</p>

<p>We&apos;re also getting emails about another piece that could be a Banksy, which we&apos;re going to check out. Could it be there are Banksy treats all over the city on this Halloween day?!</p>
