Those little suckers did not make a peep all night. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, I&#x2019;d like to ensure every child within the borders of Park Slope gets their own iPad, pronto!&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>The paper notes there are plenty of kid-friendly apps, and a touch screen that a 2-year-old can figure out. The developer of the Infant Arcade series, Edwin Iskander of Jersey City, says his 2-year-old <em>and</em> 7-month-old love the apps!</p>

<p>But beware, the Post likens iPad-happy parental units to Betty Draper, whose parenting skills consist of chain smoking and telling the kids to sit in front of the television&#x2014;and one parent recently told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007235152/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/fashion/17TODDLERS.html?_r=1&amp;ref=fashion">the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t let our toddler touch our iPhones... it takes away from creative play.&#x201D; However, iPads are more interactive than, say, a mid-century television program, and earlier this year Babble&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007235152/http://blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/2010/06/09/ipads-and-toddlers-meant-for-each-other/">Strollerderby blog</a> declared &quot;the iPad is perfectly poised to become the must-have item to entertain&#x2014;and even educate&#x2014;bored kids.&quot; Yep, it&apos;s all fun and games until you realize this is the generation that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007235152/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/plotsummary">Gattaca</a> happens to.</p>
