										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="vegantag.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170837im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/vegantag.jpg" width="124" height="68" class="image-right"> </span>Anyone have a spare block of extra firm tofu, a nail file, and a soft spot for graffiti gal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170837/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/21/utah.php">UTAH</a>? She&apos;s currently doing time on Riker&apos;s Island, and allegedly she can&apos;t get her hands on any vegan grub. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170837/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/06/rikers-forces-graffiti-writer-to-eat-like-a-bird/">Animal</a> reports that after a friend visited her there, he reported back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170837/http://twitter.com/CLAWmoney/status/2121851515">via Twitter</a>, saying: <strong>&#x201C;She said it&#x2019;s not so bad, like a ghetto sleepaway camp. Suave shamps. She is starving b/c she is vegan. No tempeh on the island apparently.&#x201D;</strong> The Department of Corrections directs inmates with special dietary needs to a nutritionist, who can issue an ID card for vegan meal procurement. Of course, it&apos;s actually easier to send a lawsuit-threatening letter than to go through this process successfully. And that is exactly what UTAH had to do in order to get soy milk and peanut butter.</p>
