<p>The city is filled with grating sounds that will harsh your mellow vibe, and the most unwelcoming of noises can be found in the subway system. Remember when an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222053007/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/20/commuters_subjected_to_children_pra.php">army of 50 children practiced their recorders</a> on your subway commute into work that morning? Or that lady <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222053007/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/17/annoying_subway_noise.php">playing Candy Crush</a> with the sound on? GoDAMMIT you just want to listen to Ira Glass whisper sweet knowledge into your ear as you stave off this hangover. </p>
