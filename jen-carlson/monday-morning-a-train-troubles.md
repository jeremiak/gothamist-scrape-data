As early as 10 minutes ago it&apos;s been reported that service from Queens into Brooklyn is &quot;SUSPENDED DUE TO A BROKEN RAIL ALONG THE LINE.&quot; Yikes! However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122238/http://mta.info/alert/alertnyct.htm">the MTA</a> is saying there are only &quot;residual delays&quot; due to an earlier incident. Has anyone experienced a headache this morning on the line? We&apos;ll update as more information comes in.</p>
