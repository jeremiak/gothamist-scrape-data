<p>David Lynch is obsessed with coffee&#x2014;forget about his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822133654/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-lynch/coffee_b_1216532.html">20 cup a day habit</a> (which he had for some time), he also created his own signature blend, called the David Lynch Signature Cup Coffee. We saw one commercial for the caffeinated blends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822133654/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/david_lynch_has_his_own_coffee_fish.php">not too long ago</a>, and now he&apos;s wrapped shooting on a new one. It&apos;s very Lynch... but we&apos;re still holding out for a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822133654/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN7k-KjE8wI">fish in the percolator</a>&quot; ad.</p>
