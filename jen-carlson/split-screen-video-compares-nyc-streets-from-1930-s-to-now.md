---

	
										<p>A new video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613171340/http://video.newyorker.com/watch/eighty-years-of-new-york-city-then-and-now"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> delivers 9 minutes of then-and-now action, with a split-screen feature that puts the olden days right next to the present day. The side-by-side comparisons feature the Brooklyn Bridge, Fifth Avenue, Central Park, Midtown, and more, driving you from the 1930s through today. </p>

<p>If you didn&apos;t see the area you were hoping to, you can make your own then &amp; now image <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613171340/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/5th_avenue_then_and_now.php">with the NYPL&apos;s feature</a> that juxtaposes a 1911 wide angle photo with a Google Street View image.</p>
