The doc has also led to concert cancelations&#x2014;Heart, Willie Nelson, and Barenaked Ladies all canceled their upcoming shows at the Orlando park. And at this year&apos;s Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217055241/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/28/video_12-year-old_jumps_barricade_t.php">a 12-year-old jumped the barricades in protest</a> of the SeaWorld float.<p></p>

<p>In an open letter to SeaWorld president Jim Atchison, Jett wrote: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I was surprised and upset to see on YouTube that SeaWorld used &apos;I Love Rock &apos;n Roll&apos; as the opening music for its cruel and abusive &apos;Shamu Rocks&apos; show. I&apos;m among the millions who saw <em>Blackfish</em> and am sickened that my music was blasted without my permission at sound-sensitive marine mammals. These intelligent and feeling creatures communicate by sonar and are driven crazy in the tiny tanks in which they are confined. If I don&apos;t receive written confirmation that SeaWorld will cease and desist from using any Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts music, I will be forced to take further action, and you&apos;ll find me among the PETA protesters outside your parks.
 
SeaWorld&apos;s reliance on cruelty and captivity for commerce has been widely exposed. I hope you&apos;ll take the respectable path and release the captive orcas to coastal sanctuaries so that they can live out their lives with other orcas in nature. This move would show that your company is truly family-friendly.

You can see the use of the song in the video below. And Jett isn&apos;t the first to call them out on using a song&#x2014;last year Tommy Lee prohibited them from using M&#xF6;tley Cr&#xFC;e songs in the same show.
