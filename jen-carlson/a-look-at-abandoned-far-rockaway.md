</div></div>					<p>Far Rockaway has gotten a Mad Max treatment over the years. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144555/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2009/06/far-rockaway-abandoned-bungalows.html">Nate Kensinger</a> has some amazing shots of the eastern edge of Queens, which &quot;was once a flourishing summer community. Today, its landscape is like the half-abandoned city of Buffalo, with vast empty lots and a large number of abandoned homes. In 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144555/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/realestate/27livi.html">according to the NY Times</a>, the Far Rockaway&apos;s city council representative called his district &apos;ground zero&apos; of the subprime mortgage crisis.&quot; It&apos;s hard to picture the beach bungalows before they were boarded up, in their old time glory when the area was dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144555/http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/development-destroying-far-rockaway-bungalows">The New Hamptons</a>. Maybe the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144555/http://www.preserve.org/bungalow/">Beachside Bungalow Preservation Association</a> can bring them back to life.</p>
