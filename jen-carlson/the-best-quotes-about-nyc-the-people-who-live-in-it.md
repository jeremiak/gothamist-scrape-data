<p>There are a lot of wonderful quotes about New York City, but there are also two things to remember about these quotes:</p>

<p>1. For every lovely thing said about this city, an equally disparaging thing has been said, and very often by the same person.</p>

<p>2. The best ones are from a long, long time ago.</p>

<p>Still, even the oldest ring true today, and they are nice to read when it&apos;s 110 degrees and humid and you are writing out your rent check because the 1st is soon, any day now, and you forgot, and that&apos;s too much money for your glorified dorm room but that&apos;s the price you pay to live in New York City. And you know what? It&apos;s still worth it.</p>

<p>Read the below often and when needed.</p>
