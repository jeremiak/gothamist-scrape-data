                            <p><img alt="0806HERPES.JPG" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831062541im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0806HERPES.JPG" width="350" height="135" class="right">Time to break out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831062541/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/condoms/condoms.shtml">subway condoms</a>! The Health Department reported yesterday that &quot;more than a fourth of adult New Yorkers are infected with Herpes Simplex Virus-2, the virus that causes genital herpes.&quot;  For contrast, the national average for genital herpes infection is 19%. </p>

<p>The virus has no cure, lasts <em>forever</em>, and those infected are more susceptible to the HIV virus. The Health Department also finds &quot;among New Yorkers, the rate is higher among women than men (36% versus 19%), higher among blacks than whites (49% versus 14%), and higher among men who have sex with men than those who don&#x2019;t (32% versus 18%).&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. Julia Schillinger, lead author of the study, noted that &quot;Genital herpes alone will not cause serious problems for most people. But some people will have painful genital sores.&quot; And since many don&apos;t show symptoms, it&apos;s advised that you check out the information provided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831062541/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/pr2008/pr039-08.shtml">by the Department of Health</a>, before becoming a statistic. </p>

<p>On top of the Herpes scare, the Health Department says they received more than 65,000 reports of sexually transmitted infections in 2007 (including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and infectious syphilis) -- which is above the national average. Surely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831062541/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">the Gowanus Canal harboring gonorrhea</a> has not helped these figures go down. So before you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831062541/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/13/nyc_wants_you_t_1.php">&quot;get some, NYC&quot;</a> -- get some condoms first. </p>
