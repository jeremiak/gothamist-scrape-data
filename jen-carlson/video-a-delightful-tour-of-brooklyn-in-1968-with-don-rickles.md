                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpJT6M5kAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083409im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpJT6M5kAM.jpg" width="350" height="259" class="image-left"> </span>In 1968 a short segment hosted by Don Rickles aired on NBC during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083409/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Music_Hall">Kraft Music Hall</a> program, and aimed to introduce the audience to Brooklyn. The whole thing seems to be filmed near the NBC Brooklyn Studios (JC Studios) at 1268 East 14th Street in Midwood, with an opening shot on the elevated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083409/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_M_(BMT_Brighton_Line)">Avenue M</a> platform. There&apos;s a lot of classic rimshot-worthy Rickles humor, as he walks around the neighborhood encountering different locals, kids playing stickball, an NYPD officer, and enjoys a Brooklyn classic, the hot dog... for this was the borough before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083409/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/mayonnaise_store_opens_in_brooklyn.php">artisanal mayo</a> was A Thing.</p>

<p>Rickles begins by telling viewers, &quot;Brooklyn is more than a borough, it&apos;s a way of life. More successful actors and artists and writers have come from Brooklyn than anyplace in the world... from Jimmy Durante to Mae West and Walt Whitman... and they went to Manhattan and worked hard 24 hours a day. They were willing to do anything... just so they didn&apos;t have to take the subway home.&quot; Not quite up to the cheerleading standards of former Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, but check it out:</p>
