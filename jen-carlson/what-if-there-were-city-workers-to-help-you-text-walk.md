<p>Nothing is more infuriating than coming into contact or even being anywhere in the vicinity of someone who is walking and texting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144710/http://gothamist.com/tags/textingzombies">Texting zombies</a> don&apos;t just walk into things and people, they also have an inconsistent pace, making it maddening to walk behind them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144710/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/texting_zombies.php">They are just terrible</a>. But we&apos;re probably all guilty of becoming one at some point. What if there were Seeing Eye People to help out with this problem? Below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144710/http://improveverywhere.com/2013/04/30/seeing-eye-people/">Improv Everywhere</a> explores the idea, which consists of a human leash. They explain:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We posed as city workers providing a ridiculous solution to the &apos;texting and walking&apos; epidemic in New York. Our team of 60 participants divided into two groups: Half were &apos;Seeing Eye People&apos; wearing orange vests, and half were individuals texting and walking, connected to the Seeing Eye People via leashes. The Seeing Eye People claimed to be part of a Department of Transportation pilot program.&quot;</blockquote>
