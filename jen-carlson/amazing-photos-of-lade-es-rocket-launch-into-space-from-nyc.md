<p>Last night NASA&apos;s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (who we just call LADEE) launched in to space aboard the Minotaur V rocket from a launch pad in Virginia. The event could be seen by many on the East Coast... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214122207/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/05/well_be_able_to_see_a_rocket_in_the.php">even those of us here in light polluted New York City</a>.  Former NASA photographer Ben Cooper took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214122207/http://www.launchphotography.com/LADEE.html">an amazing photo</a> from the Top of the Rock, which he noted is &quot;about 200 miles north of the launch pad.&quot; Clear skies, full hearts, can&apos;t lose!</p>

<p>According to an update overnight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214122207/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ladee/main/index.html#.UisZFGTuUdg">from NASA</a>, they&apos;ll be completing a spacecraft checkout over the next few days, but things are looking good and &quot;LADEE is on its way to arrive at the moon in 30 days, then enter lunar orbit.&quot; Here&apos;s their footage of the launch:</p>

<p>LADEE is a robotic mission that will orbit the moon and &quot;provide unprecedented information about the environment around the moon and give scientists a better understanding of other planetary bodies in our solar system and beyond.&quot;</p>
