<p>This team of designers wants to design your apartment for you for free, and all they&apos;ll need in return is to be able to live in your apartment for one year. Real estate blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601081233/http://www.elegran.com/edge/2013/04/get-your-nyc-apartment-designed-for-free">Elegran is reporting</a> that Design-Apart, a group of Italian artisans and designers, are &quot;looking for someone to <strong>loan them an empty apartment preferably in the Downtown Manhattan area (which has at least 2,000-3,000 square feet of space) for a period of 12 months</strong>, during which they will convert the apartment into a living showroom.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="designapat0513.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601081233im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/designapat0513.jpg" width="640" height="203" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601081233/http://design-apart.com/">Diego Paccagnella</a> says they&apos;ll furnish your pad with &quot;Italian bespoke design&quot; and then showcase the finished product as an example to potential clients&#x2014;&#x201C;Clients get an opportunity to not just see the products, but they will also get an idea of what it means to live in a well-designed environment.&quot;</p>

<p>After the 12 months, you&apos;ll get your apartment back, and you get to keep everything they&apos;ve brought into it. They have budgeted up to $500,000 for the project, thought it&apos;s unclear how much will go towards physical goods, and how much will go towards paying workers, keggers, and weekend-long orgies on your new Tempur-pedic.
