Did you see them? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140927204943/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2009/11/nyc-gets-mobbed-by-lloyd-doblers/1">USA Today</a> reports that the self-dubbed &quot;Mobler&quot; hit up Penn Station, NYU, Union Square and landed in Times Square to meet up with a band called the Lloyd Dobler Effect, who sang &quot;In Your Eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>This was for the 20th Anniversary release of <em>Say Anything</em> on Blu-Ray, even though Dobler himself famously declared that, &quot;I don&apos;t want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.&quot; Whatever, we would like to see this happen every day (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140927204943/http://www.youtube.com/user/sayanything20th">more videos here</a>):</p>
