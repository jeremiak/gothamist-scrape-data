<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023163418/http://newsroom.aaos.org/media-resources/news/distracted-walking-a-serious-issue-for-you-not-me.htm">new study</a> says that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023163418/http://gothamist.com/tags/textingwhilewalking">distracted walkers</a>, or &quot;digital deadwalkers,&quot; are on the rise around us. Maybe you are one? Maybe you aren&apos;t ready to admit you are? The study, released by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), finds that 78% of U.S. adults believe that distracted walking is a &#x201C;serious&#x201D; issue, and only 29% believe they are part of the problem. </p>

<p>Some more numbers from the survey:<br>
</p><ul><li>90 percent say they see walkers talking on the phone (and 37 percent admit doing so themselves)<br>
</li><li>88 percent are engaging in conversation (vs. 75 percent themselves)<br>
</li><li>88 percent are listening to music (vs. 34 percent themselves)<br>
</li><li>85 percent are using a smartphone (vs. 28 percent themselves)<br>
</li><li>64 percent are generally &#x201C;zoning out,&#x201D; or not focused on walking (vs. 38 percent themselves)<br>
</li><li>31 percent say distracted walking is &#x201C;something I&#x2019;m likely to do&quot;<br>
</li><li>22 percent think distracted walking is &#x201C;funny&#x201D;</li></ul><p></p>

<p>This isn&apos;t just an annoyance&#x2014;like when you are stuck behind someone who is sloppily sidewalk slaloming like a drunk child who just woke up from a nap&#x2014;it&apos;s also dangerous. Alan Hilibrand, MD, AAOS spokesperson, referenced a 2013 study regarding this: &quot;Emergency department hospital visits for injuries involving distracted pedestrians on cell phones more than doubled between 2004 and 2010.&quot; </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, most of these Snapchatting zombies are usually millennials, and most victims are older women&#x2014;&quot;Distracted walking is most common among millennials aged 18 to 34, but women 55 and older are most likely to suffer serious injuries, including broken bones.&quot; A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023163418/http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/its-not-just-drivers-being-driven-to-distraction/?smid=fb-nytwell&amp;smtyp=cur">NY Times writer</a> who wrote about the survey noted, &quot;My friends of a certain age are frankly scared that they will be knocked down and injured by a distracted walker.&quot;</p>

<p>Frankly, we&apos;re much more scared of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023163418/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/20/man_pregnant_woman_struck_by_separa.php">distracted drivers</a> than oblivious pedestrians&#x2014;everyone needs to pay more attention out on the streets of NYC, but the ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023163418/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/suv_driver_kills_30-yr-old_woman_on.php">operating big, deadly machines</a> bear a much greater responsibility, because the consequences of their inattentiveness are so grave.</p>
