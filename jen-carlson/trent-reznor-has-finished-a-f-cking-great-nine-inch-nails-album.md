<p>Late yesterday Trent Reznor announced that he&apos;s been &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144146/http://nineinchnails.tumblr.com/post/51585462200/ive-been-less-than-honest-about-what-ive-really">less than honest</a>&quot; with us about what he&apos;s been working on, and has in fact secretly recorded an entirely new full-length <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144146/http://gothamist.com/tags/nineinchnails">Nine Inch Nails</a> album, which he has deemed to be &quot;fucking great.&quot; Reznor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144146/http://www.factmag.com/2013/05/28/nine-inch-nails-to-release-new-album-this-year/">told Fact</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I&apos;ve been less than honest about what I&#x2019;ve really been up to lately. For the last year I&#x2019;ve been secretly working non-stop with Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder on a new, full-length Nine Inch Nails record, which I am happy to say is finished and frankly fucking great. This is the real impetus and motivation behind the decision to assemble a new band and tour again. My forays into film, HTDA and other projects really stimulated me creatively and I decided to focus that energy on taking Nine Inch Nails to a new place. Here we go!&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This isn&apos;t entirely surprising since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607144146/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/nine_inch_nails_returns_revisit_the.php">earlier this year</a> he announced that the band (with a new lineup) would return for a tour, but it&apos;s very exciting nonetheless. And if you want to know more about why I think this is so exciting and amazing and important, and about how life-changing hearing Nine Inch Nails for the first time was when I was a teenager, and all the <em>feelings</em> I had about Mud Reznor at Woodstock &apos;94... please subscribe to my personal newsletter.</p>
