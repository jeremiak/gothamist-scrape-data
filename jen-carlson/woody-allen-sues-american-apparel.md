<p>Last year Woody Allen kicked off the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/24/seen_on_the_cor_2.php">scantily clad</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/26/at_allen_and_ho.php">teen models</a> usually draped over American Apparel billboards, and seemingly made himself the new face of Dov Charney&apos;s clothing empire. In both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://la.curbed.com/archives/2007/05/woody_allen_on.php">LA</a> and NYC, his image (taken from Annie Hall) hung above city streets along with Yiddish writing paired up with their logo. </p>

<p>Now it&apos;s being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/04/01/woody-allen-sues-american-apparel-for-misappropriation/?mod=WSJBlog">reported that</a> Allen (despite his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9712/24/woody.weds">fondness of young ladies</a>) filed suit against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/business/media/01woody.html?ref=business">the clothier</a> for $10 million in Manhattan federal court yesterday; American Apparel never got permission to use the director&apos;s image (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/26/_as_we_heard_la.php">sounds familiar</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016210116/http://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSN3143294520080401">The trademark suit states</a> that the company used his &#x201C;image and identity in total disregard of his rights to privacy and publicity, his exclusive property rights and his personal rights,&quot; and that &quot;Allen does not engage in the commercial endorsement of products or services in the United States.&quot;</p>
