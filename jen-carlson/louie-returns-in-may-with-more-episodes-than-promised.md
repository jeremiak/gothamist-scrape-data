<p>Way back in 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231937/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> told the NY Times he would not bring his FX show <em>Louie</em> back for another season until 2014, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231937/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/09/louis_cks_show_wont_be_on_again_unt.php">explaining</a>, &#x201C;I want the show to keep getting better. That&#x2019;s my goal, and I don&#x2019;t want it to be making the doughnuts. I want it to keep being something that comes from somewhere fun and important, and I want it to stay funny. It&#x2019;s a luxury that I asked for, which is more time to create Season 4.&#x201D; Time passed, and more time passed, Louis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231937/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/04/photo_louis_cks_yacht_gets_stuck_in.php">bought a yacht,</a> and then this afternoon it was announced that the series would return on May 5th at 10 p.m. And someone&apos;s been hard at work: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Louie, season 4, on FX, May 5. FX ordered 13 episodes, Louis CK delivered 14.</p>&#x2014; Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231937/https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/statuses/444201832504893440">March 13, 2014</a></blockquote>

Multi-episode arcs, &quot;other stories that, it&apos;s just gonna piss you off,&quot; and... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231937/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/louie_louis_ck_photos.php">Louie goes to a diner</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231937/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/fx-sets-louie-season-4-premiere-for-may">Alan Sepinwall</a>, &quot;FX will air two episodes each Monday night at 10 and 10:30 p.m.&quot; We&apos;re just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231937/https://twitter.com/johndelsignore/status/443397453870792704">glad it&apos;s not being released binge-watching style</a>.</p>
