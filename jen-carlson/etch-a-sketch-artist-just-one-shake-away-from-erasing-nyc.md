</div></div>					<p>Self-proclaimed etch-a-sketch enthusiast and artist, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160807214929/http://bryanetch.blogspot.com/">Bryan Lee Madden</a>, is recreating cities on his etch-a-sketches, which sounds very dangerous! Just one shake and the whole thing could be in ruins. </p>

<p>He told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160807214929/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/03/amazing_etch_a.php">Village Voice</a>, &quot;The landscape and landmarks of New York have been my preferred subject in my work; I&apos;ve done pocket etches of the Empire State Building, Brooklyn Bridge, and Central Park, in addition to my full-sized Bronx/Upper Manhattan landscape.&quot; That last one is still around, he says he&apos;s kept it level for years so as not to be erased. </p>

<p>So is this guy an etch-a-sketch hoarder with tons of the unusual canvases around his home, sitting level, or does he shake most of his work away after photographing it? Either way, we won&apos;t judge, because these are pretty freakin&apos; cool.</p>
