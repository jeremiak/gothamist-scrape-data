<p>Williamsburg and Greenpoint haven&apos;t changed <em>so much</em> that there&apos;s not a few young creatives loafing about mid-afternoon on a Tuesday looking for something to do, right? To those people, we tell you to get to Warsaw (the Polish National Home you saw The Decemberists at that time) by 3 p.m. today. Noah Baumbach is there shooting a performance of a &quot;fictionalized band featuring members of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308041953/http://gothamist.com/tags/dirtyprojectors">Dirty Projectors</a>.&quot; And we&apos;re told if you&apos;re interested in joining in as part of the audience (and to &quot;drink free beer&quot;), please email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308041953/mailto:march5cast@gmail.com">march5cast@gmail.com</a> for details. </p>

<p>Dirty Projectors&apos; songstress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308041953/https://twitter.com/Amber_Coffman">Amber Coffman</a> sent us the above photo from the set this afternoon, saying she can&apos;t give away too many details, but &quot;we&apos;re having a lot of fun and learning some things!&quot;</p>

<p>The band released an EP (<em>About to Die</em>) and an LP (<em>Swing Lo Magellan</em>) last year, but it&apos;s unclear what song this video will be for.</p>
