										<p>While simultaneously seeking out new talent, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161141/http://www.wnyc.org/streetshots">WNYC</a> is exploring the art of street photography through the eyes of six diverse photographers in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161141/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/26/street.php">Street Shots series</a>. One of them, 61-year-old Bruce Gilden, is more of a character than some of his subjects. He&apos;s been taking photos of strangers on the streets of Manhattan for decades, and he&apos;s becoming a little bored with the homogeneity of the passersby. See how his &quot;in your face&quot; approach goes over with his subjects:</p>

<p>After the jump check out Jamel Shabazz, who documented the emerging hip-hop scene in the early &apos;80s.  You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161141/http://www.wnyc.org/streetshots">view the rest here</a>, including one on our own Jake Dobkin, and his work at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161141/http://Bluejake.com/">Bluejake</a>.</p>
