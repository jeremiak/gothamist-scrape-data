										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mredhorses.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231201726im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mredhorses.jpg" width="300" height="234" class="image-right"> </span>The ASPCA issued a statement yesterday afternoon offering to find homes for the carriage horses being evicted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231201726/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/carriage_horses_8.php">from Shamrock Stables</a>, which is being shuttered by the city in order to make way for residential and retail development. In it they said:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;The imminent closing of Shamrock Stables in Manhattan presents an opportunity to New York City, the carriage horse owners and those who favor the humane treatment of animals. The ASPCA, in partnership with NY-CLASS, has made an offer to Shamrock Stables and the City government to find homes for these horses, taking them off the streets and placing them in environments that have their best interests at heart. This option puts the welfare of the horses first and prevents them from being auctioned off to work farms or where the possibility for exploitation and inhumane treatment is high.&quot;</blockquote>This afternoon they told us they had still not heard from Shamrock, but it looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231201726/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/an-offer-for-stables-horses-but-not-the-stable/">the NY Times</a> has! Owner Ian McKeever told them, &#x201C;our intention is to stay in business.&quot; And a spokeswoman for the stable said, &quot;This is like someone losing their job, and the first thing they offer as a solution is taking your children. The children aren&#x2019;t for sale and neither are the horses.&quot;<p></p>
