---

	
										<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214627/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> and her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214627/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a> returned to HBO for a third season (and a fourth season is on the way, it was announced last week). Two episodes aired back-to-back to start things off, and we had this <em>really cool plan</em> on how to cover the first night of its return, but if fell apart... so plan B is GIFS. Kids love GIFS. Here is basically what happened:</p>

<p>Adam remains the most amazing character on the show, even if men like him probably don&apos;t really exist?<br>

<p>They used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214627/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/25/m5.php">that Maroon5 song we love</a>!<br>

<p>Jessa hasn&apos;t changed.<br>

<p>HBO has also made each episode available in full on YouTube (watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214627/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgJtd6hBeRc">Season 3, Episode 1 here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214627/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRhMrMVyaPw">Episode 2 here</a>). The show is back to form after a weird, darker season 2, and it seems like they are mostly glazing over those plot lines&#x2014;Hannah&apos;s OCD is under control and barely mentioned, Charlie&apos;s absence is as mysterious as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214627/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(1970_film)#.22Ali_MacGraw.27s_Disease.22">Ali McGraw&apos;s disease</a> in <em>Love Story</em>, etc. </p>

<p>Next week you&apos;ll get to go to Hannah&apos;s 25th birthday party at Matchless in Greenpoint, where they must have maxed out their music licensing budget&#x2014;just a few of the songs from that episode: Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians &quot;What I Am,&quot; Kings Of Convenience &quot;I&apos;d Rather Dance With You,&quot; New Order &quot;Age of Consent,&quot; The Velvet Underground &quot;Rock &amp; Roll,&quot; The Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Today,&quot; and LMFAO &quot;I&apos;m Sexy And I Know It,&quot; as well as a song from Rent.</p>
