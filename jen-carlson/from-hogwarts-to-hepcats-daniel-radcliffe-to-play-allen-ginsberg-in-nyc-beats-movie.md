<span class="photo_caption">This may be happening.</span></p>

<p>Can Daniel Radcliffe, fresh off a decade-long Harry Potter run, really pull off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302152405/http://www.out.com/entertainment/movies/2011/11/29/daniel-radcliffe-play-allen-ginsberg">playing Allen Ginsberg</a>? He&apos;s the latest actor to be cast as the Beat icon, in a movie coming out next year called <em>Kill Your Darlings</em>. The movie has actually been in development for a couple of years, and originally Jesse Eisenberg was rumored to be playing Ginsberg. </p>

<p>This latest feature (how many movies are there on these guys now?) will focus on the relationship between Ginsberg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302152405/http://gothamist.com/tags/jackkerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, and Lucien Carr (who introduced the other two while at Columbia University). Carr also murdered David Kammerer, a man who was either his lover or obsessed with him, and Kerouac helped him dispose of his belongings in Morningside Heights. Though it&apos;s unclear if this will be covered in the movie, as the story involves William S. Burroughs as well&#x2014;he is the first person Carr confessed to, and who advised he turn himself in&#x2014;and there has been no word of Burroughs being portrayed in this film.</p>

<p>As for the others: Captain America Chris Evans was rumored to be cast as Kerouac, and Ben Whishaw as Carr&#x2014;though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302152405/http://www.slashfilm.com/daniel-radcliffe-play-allen-ginsberg-kill-darlings/">/Film</a> reports today that those two may have dropped off the casting list. </p>

<p>Fun fact: other actors who have portrayed Ginsberg include Hank Azaria, David Cross, John Turturro, Ron Livingston and most recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302152405/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/18/will_franco_make_a_good_ginsberg.php">James Franco</a>. But we prefer footage of the original:</p>

<p>And don&apos;t forget, Kerouac&apos;s <em>On The Road</em> will be coming to the big screen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302152405/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/07/on_the_road_1.php">next year</a> too, featuring Kristen Stewart, Kirsten Dunst, and other Young Hollywood stars acting out the scroll.</p>
