<p>There&apos;s a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711140440/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/24/sad_rat_in_sidewalk_forever.php">sad rat</a> in town: A giant 3-foot-long rat met its maker at the Marcy Houses recently, when Housing Authority worker Jose Rivera stabbed it multiple times with a pitchfork. The 48-year-old says he believes there are at least two more on the loose out there, which he spotted when filling a rat hole last week. </p>

<p>An expert at the Wildlife Conservation Society told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711140440/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/25/2011-08-25_giant_rat_killed_by_pitchfork_in_marcy_houses_is_believed_to_be_.html#ixzz1W4n93Ry1">the Daily News</a>&#x2014;who caught wind of the story from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711140440/http://blackandbrownnews.com/front/3104201_story.php">Black and Brown News</a>&#x2014;it is likely a Gambian pouched rat, and was probably someone&apos;s escaped or discarded pet. The head of the Marcy Houses Tenant Association says these giant rats have been spotted over the past six years; and one resident told BBN that eight big rats were recently killed in one day.</p>

<p>Tenants believe the rats have been breeding with Norway rats in the area, and are &quot;spawning a super-breed of rodents&quot; that &quot;gang up on the cats.&quot; Though zoo experts say that is unlikely, who cares, because these things exist! But at least they <em>probably</em> can&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711140440/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/28/rat_emerges_from_toilet_to_terrify.php">crawl up our toilets</a>?</p>
