<p>Soon, clowns may only exist in your nightmares, under your bed, and in the back of your closet, clutching a knife and hiding amongst all those stuffed animals... just waiting for the right moment. There is a national clown shortage coming our way, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121092939/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/exclusive-national-clown-shortage-approaching-article-1.1616801">a Daily News <em>exclusive</em></a>. The tabloid reports that younger generations just aren&apos;t interested in running away with the circus, and memberships at clown organizations have been on the decline for a decade.  </p>

<p>Glen Kohlberger, Clowns of America International President, told the paper, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s happening is attrition. The older clowns are passing away.&#x201D; :( :( :( :( And with less youthful talent in the pool, there&apos;s not always someone to replace retired and... dead clowns. Kohlberger added that the younger generation &quot;go on to high school and college and clowning isn&#x2019;t cool anymore... [it&apos;s] then put on the back burner until their late 40s and early 50s.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe we&apos;re better off though?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Clown and filmmaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121092939/http://gothamist.com/tags/jeffseal">Jeff Seal</a> tells us, &quot;There are still a lot of younger people becoming clowns, they&apos;re just not joining the Clowns of America International. It&apos;s more of a generational thing I think.  It&apos;s like joining the Shiners club or something like that.  Also, maybe it has to do with the weakening of American labor unions in general (just kidding not kidding).  Plus, there&apos;s a lot of clowns coming out of China who will work for really cheap.&quot;</p>
