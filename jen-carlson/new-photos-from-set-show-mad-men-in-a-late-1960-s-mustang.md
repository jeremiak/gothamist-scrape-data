So far <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025103/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/mad_men_is_filming_what_clues_are_i.php">photos from the set</a> have indicated that we won&apos;t be too far into the future (though showrunner Matthew Weiner has hinted that by the time the series <em>ends</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025103/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/matthew_weiner_already_knows_how_ma.php">we will be</a>)&#x2014;for now it looks like we&apos;ll remain in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025103/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/mad_men_teaser_pics.php#photo-1">the same decade</a> we last saw Don Draper &amp; Co. These new photos, taken yesterday on the set in Los Angeles show one big timestamp: a Ford Mustang. We asked some car experts about what year this model is, and here&apos;s what they told us: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I believe it is a 1966 as indicated by the three parallel horizontal chrome pieces on the quarter panel behind the door. The &apos;65 simply had a single vertical piece without the horiztonals.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Since last season ended in 1967, we&apos;re guessing we&apos;ll still be in that year upon the show&apos;s return <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025103/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/mad_men_returns_april_7th.php">on April 7th</a>, and maybe the ad men will have landed a Ford campaign.</p>

<p>When Matthew Weiner discussed the upcoming season, he noted that it&apos;s all &quot;about Don,&quot; and that the two-hour premiere &quot;is its own story and hopefully it foreshadows the rest of the season,&quot; adding, &quot;You should know what happened at the end of last season before you see the episode. The whole season is in reference to last season.&#x201D; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025103/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/12/the_final_scenes_of_mad_men_seasons.php#photo-5">last season ends</a> with Don leaving Megan at a commercial shoot he landed for her and sitting at a bar alone, where a woman approaches him and asks, &quot;Are you alone?&quot; as Nancy Sinatra&apos;s theme song to <em>You Only Live Twice</em> (a 1967 James Bond film) plays in the background. The first teaser for the upcoming season, released this week... is titled &quot;Affair&quot;:</p>
