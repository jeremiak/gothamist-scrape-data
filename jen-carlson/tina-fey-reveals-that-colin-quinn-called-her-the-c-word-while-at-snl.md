<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510132852/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF3TpDjfIj4">season 1, episode 14</a> of <em>30 Rock</em>, Liz Lemon is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510132852/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Word">the c-word</a> by <em>TGS</em> writer J. D. Lutz, which she is rightfully outraged by. She then warns the staff that using that &quot;horrible word&quot; will result in job termination. It has been long known that the incident in the show was inspired by one of Tina Fey&apos;s experiences in real life, but until now there were no details regarding who called her that, or during what show. </p>

<p>Today Fey told Howard Stern it was Colin Quinn, back when she was a writer for <em>SNL</em>&#x2014;at the time, Colin Quinn was a Weekend Update anchor. </p>

<p>She told Stern, &quot;I love him so much. I was trying to help him with a show that he was working on, and I think his anxiety about the writing of the show spilled over. It was very random. I was like, &#x2018;What?!&#x2019; He left me a message and he said that. I couldn&#x2019;t even guess why. Usually, if someone calls you that, you&#x2019;re like, &#x2018;I know what I did.&apos; I asked Colin to be on <em>30 Rock</em> like three times after that, and he turned us down every time. I saw him on <em>Girls</em> and was like, &apos;He&apos;s dead to me.&apos;&quot; But the two have since made up, Fey says&#x2014;&quot;We&apos;ve since reconnected, at the SNL 40th, actually, and we&apos;re good.&quot; </p>
