<p>Recently we discovered that people who have never visited New York City have very strong ideas about what New York City is like... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004638/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/what_do_tourists_learn_from_nyc-bas.php">based on the teevee</a>, mostly. Well, on a recent trip to New Orleans we discovered that this <em>really is a thing</em>. One local told us that all he knows about the big city is what he&apos;s seen in movies, and he and his friends just <em>assume</em> that&apos;s what it&apos;s like. Then we ran into this dig on our menu while enjoying a late night meal at Clover Grill (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004638/http://www.clovergrill.com/">recommended</a>!). </p>

<p>Right there under the Battered Chicken Fried Steak, two eggs, grits and toast it reads: <strong>&quot;If you are not served in 5 minutes, relax, it may be another 5.  This is not New York City.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>It&apos;s true, even after just 10 minutes <em>while in vacation mode</em>, we began to wonder what was taking so long. And we suppose we had it coming, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004638/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">that tourist lane</a> bit and all. Related: everyone from the south loves grits. And fried things. Which is probably why they are all so slow.*</p>

<p><span class="photo_caption">*We kid, because we envy you&#x2014;please teach us your relaxing ways, south.</span></p>
