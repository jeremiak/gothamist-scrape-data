<span class="photo_caption">They had been eyeing a &quot;highly interesting new channel called MTV.&quot; (RTE)</span></p>

<p>MTV launched here in 1981, and a few years later Ireland&apos;s answer to music television came along in the form of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT-USA">MT-USA</a>. That&apos;s: Music Television USA. Irish radio deejay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Hanley">Vincent Haley</a> was the show&apos;s host, and would film from all over New York City, broadcasting straight back to Ireland for three hours every Sunday.</p>

<p>Below you&apos;ll find one episode filmed around Central Park (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201951/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/06/central_park_1980s_photos.php">looked much different in the 1980s</a>). Hanley tells the audience, &quot;New Yorkers don&apos;t come to Central Park to get away from it all, it&apos;s not a place to escape to, people come here to be right smack in the middle of everything... concerts, barbecues, soccer, marathons, you name it and it happens here.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s another, filmed outside of U2&apos;s Radio City Music Hall concert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201951/http://www.u2gigs.com/show981.html">in 1984</a>&#x2014;Haley found two fans &quot;who paid, get this... $75 from ticket scalpers&quot; to get in (tickets had a $16 face value). That&apos;s around $171 now, on a $36 ticket.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201951/http://www.rte.ie/archives/2014/0219/505138-mt-usa-irelands-first-music-video-programme/">RTE</a> (where it was broadcast), the show&apos;s official launch was February 19th, 1984, and Hanley, along with his producer Conor McAnally, &quot;had been inspired by MTV and the growing popularity of music videos to create a weekly program of their own showcasing all the latest videos.&quot; The show ran for three seasons, and ended in 1987 when Haley died.</p>

<p>Prior to launching, Haley is quoted as saying, &quot;I don&apos;t think the draw was just America. New York, New York, that&apos;s where I wanted to be. I think I was looking for breathing space.&quot;</p>
