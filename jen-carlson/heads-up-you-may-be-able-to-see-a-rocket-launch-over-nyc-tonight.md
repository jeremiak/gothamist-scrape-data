<p>In September the LADEE rocket launched over the East Coast and, shockingly, we were actually able to see it from New York City&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112850/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/amazing_photos_of_ladees_rocket_lau.php">some amazing photos followed</a>. If you missed out then, don&apos;t let it happen again: tonight another rocket will launch, and should be visible from Maine to Florida. </p>

<p>The latest launch is for the Minotaur, which will set a record by putting 29 satellites into orbit. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112850/http://www.space.com/23627-rocket-launch-visible-east-coast-tuesday.html">Space.com</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;NASA and the U.S. military will launch a record payload of 29 satellites from a Virginia spaceport Tuesday night (Nov. 19) on a mission that could create a spectacular sight for skywatchers along the U.S. East Coast, weather permitting. The U.S. Air Force launch will send an Orbital Sciences Minotaur 1 rocket into orbit from NASA&apos;s Wallops Flight Facility and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, Va., sometime during a two-hour launch window that opens Tuesday night at 7:30 p.m. EST. The nighttime launch could light up the sky for millions of observers along a wide swath of the Eastern Seaboard.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>But will you be able to clearly and artfully capture it on your Instagram? This remains unclear.</p>
