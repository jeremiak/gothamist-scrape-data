Artists and those who just wanted to help came together, many of them as strangers, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025900/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/27/billboards.php">create something new</a> where there were once illegal advertisements. Though many of those spots were reclaimed by ads the next day, the project was still successful on some scale. This week he told us about that day, and the overall goal for projects like these.</em><p></p>

<p><strong>What is your goal with the Public Ad Campaign?</strong> To help create and environment where citizens of New York City feel empowered to interact with their shared public spaces, both physically and mentally. In doing so I hope PublicAdCampaign can help people to develop strong physical ties with their environment and to develop a sense of responsibility for the space in which they live.</p>

<p><strong>How did this past Saturday go?</strong> Incredibly. It was the largest anti public advertising street happening I have ever been a part of.</p>

<p><strong>Was it disappointing, or expected, to see the public canvases go back to advertisements within a day?</strong> Very Expected. Often work over public advertising lasts anywhere from 3hrs to a week depending on what kind of advertising venue you are working with, and where in the city that ad is located. Outdoor advertising companies have a vested interest in keeping their spaces clean and free of other content.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have another large scale project coming up?</strong> Many participants expressed an interest in doing something like this again and I share those sentiments.</p>

<p><strong>If you could pull off any project in NYC what would it be?</strong> I&#x2019;d uproot Manhattan from its bedrock and sail it on the seven seas. I don&#x2019;t know. Everything I think of is topped by a grander and more elegant scheme. That question is unending.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you favorite artists right now?</strong> I just collaborated with a large number of artists on this project and there is no reason to play favorites. My aesthetic choices are unimportant in light of what everyone did for the NYSAT project. The best art is about making the world move and every last participant in this project was pushing.</p>
