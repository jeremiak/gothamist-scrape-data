<p>The muse for Yves Saint Laurent inspired as much as she collected, and prior to her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529231040/http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/socialdiary/2005/07_06_05/socialdiary07_06_05.php">death in 2005</a>, the 74 year old filled several rooms of her Park Avenue home with her couture collection. Last year, this same collection <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529231040/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId=%7BA71352F9-E74A-4805-92B6-A73C3F557E4B%7D">was exhibited</a> at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with 200 pieces becoming part of the museum&apos;s permanent collection.</p>

<p>What happened to the rest? There was a lot leftover, and the items were spread out over museums, charities, and Christie&apos;s. The latter (where her memorial service was held) is planning a Kempner sale in the future. For now, 25 cartons of clothes are at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Thrift Shop (she raised $75 million for them throughout her living years), but they won&apos;t be there for long. Tomorrow it all goes on sale: accessories, clothes, couture and designer goods you won&apos;t find in your regular thrift shop. Items from Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Emilio Pucci will all be sold off at &quot;reasonable&quot; prices. Expect to see some designers duking it out with fashionistas and common folk - and we&apos;re guessing that since Kempner famously said, &quot;I loathe fat people,&quot; that all the sizes will be pretty dainty!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529231040/http://www.nysun.com/article/56336">The Sun</a> reports that &quot;in preparation for the sale, the store&apos;s manager, Anita Askienazy, sifted through bins of clothing earlier this week, pulling out items including a fur-lined sweater by the designer Bill Blass; a floor-length silk evening gown by Givenchy, and a bright red, ribbed satin clutch with a bejeweled clasp by Valentino.&quot; The entire process of unpacking, oohing and ahhing lasted months, however. If you want to see what was in all those boxes, and possibly purchase a piece yourself, give the sale a shot. Doors open at 10am (expect long lines and women in Chanel throwing right hooks). </p>
