<p>Last year we looked at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312021041/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/are_there_really_any_bad_bagel_orde.php">bad bagel orders</a>, which included one New Yorker&apos;s order of whitefish on a cinnamon raisin bagel. To each their own, but there are <em>some</em> orders that should get people banished to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312021041/http://www.lendersbagels.com/">Lender&apos;s Land</a>. Today Youngna Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312021041/http://twitter.com/#!/youngna/status/102018336761712640">overheard <em>this</em></a> while at La Bagel Delight in DUMBO:</p>

<blockquote>Whole wheat everything, 1/2 toasted dark, 1/2 light, scooped, tofu cream cheese, tomato de-seeded, sliced into 4.</blockquote>

<p><em>Not okay.</em> Please don&apos;t turn bagels into the next half-caf soy latte.</p>
