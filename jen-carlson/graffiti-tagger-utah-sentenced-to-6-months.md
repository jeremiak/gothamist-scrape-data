The damages in those boroughs caused by her tags is estimated to be around $35,000 (of a $100,000 bill of damages she&apos;s racked up worldwide), and she will be paying back just $10,000 of that as part of a plea deal. Her boyfriend and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191114/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/21/tagging_couple_arrested.php">partner in crime</a>, Jim Clay Harper, still has charges pending against him. And perhaps one day, upon their release, they&apos;ll have a nice, civilized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191114/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/20/vandal_squad.php">chat in a book store</a> with the vandal squad.</p>
