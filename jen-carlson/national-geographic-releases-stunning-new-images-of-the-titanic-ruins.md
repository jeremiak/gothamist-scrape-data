<p>With the Titanic&apos;s 100 anniversary coming up in April, everyone is trying to find new ways to mark the historic tragedy. The History Channel is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210653/https://twitter.com/#!/TitanicRealTime">&quot;live&quot;-Tweeting</a> the doomed voyage, as well as offering up new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210653/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/titanic_1.php">sonar mapping of the wreckage</a>, Groupon is offering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210653/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/13/the_titanic_crash_will_be_live_twee.php">a Titanic vacation package</a> (yes, really), and people are recreating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210653/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/the_last_meal_served_on_the_titanic.php">the last meal</a>. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210653/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/04/titanic/sides-text">National Geographic</a> has released some stunning images of the ship for their April issue.</p>

<p>The never-before-seen photos, taken two years ago, provide a new detailed look at the ruins as they are now. The images come from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who went around the ship in three state-of-the-art robotic vehicles taking hundreds of images per second&#x2014;later they were stitched together. An archaeologist there told NatGeo, &#x201C;In the past, trying to understand Titanic was like trying to understand Manhattan at midnight in a rainstorm&#x2014;with a flashlight. Now we have a site that can be understood and measured, with definite things to tell us.&quot;</p>
