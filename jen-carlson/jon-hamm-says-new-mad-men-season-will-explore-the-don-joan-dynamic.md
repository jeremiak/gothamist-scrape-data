<p>Would you want to see a Don Draper and Joan Harris (n&#xE9;e Holloway) romantic plotline happen on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170252/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>? Jon Hamm&apos;s recent comments about the upcoming season suggest some more screen time between the two, however, it <em>sounds</em> like it&apos;ll be strictly platonic. </p>

<p>Hamm talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170252/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-02-16/jon-hamm-drops-plot-hints-about-mad-men%27s-next-series">Radio Times</a> recently, saying, &quot;The Don/Joan dynamic is something that we do explore, and don&apos;t take this the wrong way, but we do explore as the show goes on. They have worked together for a long time, they know one another very well and I&apos;ll leave it at that.&quot;</p>

<p>When we last left Draper he had just popped the big question to his secretary Megan, and he spoke to that in the interview as well, saying: &#x201C;[Anna&apos;s death] may have caused some tectonic shift in Don, maybe one of the reasons we saw the proposal. It&apos;s not a mistake that he gives Megan Anna&apos;s ring, he did not give that to Betty, but I think that there is hope.&quot; Meanwhile, Joan found out she was pregnant (with Roger&apos;s child, who she slept with while her husband was deployed). </p>

<p>See how the mid-century drama plays out when the show returns on March 25th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170252/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/mad_men_5th_season_premiere_will_be.php">with a two hour premiere</a>, and Hamm says they will be back for at least another three seasons.</p>
