<p>A Brooklyn born and raised woman, currently living in Atlanta, created a miniature version of a New York City brownstone as a way to cope with homesickness (and make some cash!). She writes:</p>

<blockquote>I made the Brownstone from scratch pouring over pictures of New York Brownstones and using Google Earth to see the house I lived in as a child.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn. I missed home, so what better way to bring New York to Atlanta than with one of its most iconic architectural structures&#x2014;the Brownstone.  The New York inspired Brownstone is 36 inches high and 30 inches wide.  It boasts three floors and a basement. The front lights work and are powered by a simple watch battery. Six potted plants, a miniature wooden table, and a clay basket with rocks accompany the house for decor. The roof is color-textured so that you can add a patio set. The roof-top adds another floor by adding another element to decorate. The basement resembles an unfinished basement.</blockquote> 

<p>She also calls her work, &quot;a great fixer-upper!&quot; Which is perhaps why it got no bids during her eBay auction. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020429/http://cgi.ebay.com/Brownstone-Doll-House-Wooden-3-Floors-and-bsmt-/110723934215?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item19c7a92807#ht_500wt_1351">The price was set</a> at a whopping $2,900. Unsurprisingly, the commenters over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020429/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2011/08/closing-bell-a-brownstone-for-play/">Brownstoner</a> have a lot to say, one noting, &quot;Not impressed. No subdivided rooms, might as well be a Philly Trinity and unauthentic color. Basically a gut renovation.&quot;</p>
