<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="jerseyitaly0511.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045036im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jerseyitaly0511.jpg" width="365" height="294" class="image-right"> </span>The Italians are preparing for the invasion of Snooki &amp; Co., who will be filming their next season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045036/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> in Italy soon. The mayor of Florence has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045036/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/italy_lays_down_the_law_for_jersey.php">given the cast</a> a list of strict rules, and now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045036/http://www.ldminstitute.com/">Istituto Lorenzo de&apos; Medici</a> has warned its students that they should avoid the cast at all costs when they come to film at the school. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045036/http://www.tmz.com/2011/05/05/italian-university-jersey-shore-lorenzo-demedici-college-university-school-shooting-taping-italy/">to TMZ</a>, a letter to those residing in a student housing building that the cast will use, reads: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Dear Students,

<p>Our Housing dept. has informed us that starting May 9th there will be shootings inside the 2nd floor apartment of your building.  </p>

<p>We advise you to NOT sign any paper, let anyone in, and keep us informed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The school has allegedly also offered &quot;alternative housing&quot; nearby for those who want to avoid run-ins with The Sitaution, <em>and</em> offered refunds to those who want to leave all together!</p>

<p>And while we&apos;re here, we might as well report that The Situation is the latest to ink a deal for a spin-off show on MTV. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045036/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663234/the-situation-jersey-shore-spinoff.jhtml">He says</a>, &quot;I&apos;m excited to continue my relationship with MTV, which has been home for me for the last couple of years. I&apos;m really grateful for all the support from my fans. Hopefully, there will be plenty more situations in the future.&quot; In related news... looks like he&apos;s still finding ways to work the word &quot;situation&quot; into every sentence.</p>
