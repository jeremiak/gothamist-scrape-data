<p>Where are we on that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115916/http://dcist.com/2014/02/virginia_senator_mark_warner_also_t.php">deportation petition</a>? When Justin Bieber flew in to town for the Super Bowl last Friday the little Canadian hellion added some more notches to his Championship Douchebag Belt. Early reports that day suggested Bieber was flying high on a pot plane, and was met by authorities at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115916/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/flying-high-exclusive-inside-story-biebers-pot-plane-n22056">NBC News</a> is filling in the blanks, through an official report of the incident.</p>

<p>The pilots of the leased jet&#x2014;which carried Bieber, his father, and ten friends&#x2014;had to wear oxygen masks so they wouldn&apos;t get high. The report reads: &#x201C;The captain of the flight stated that he warned the passengers, including Bieber, on several occasions to stop smoking marijuana.&quot; When the flight landed, there was still marijuana smoke in the cabin, witnessed by New York/New Jersey Port Authority Police Department, DEA, and Customs and Border Patrol agents. <em>And that&apos;s not even all of it.</em></p>

<p>The report continues, citing more bad behavior: &quot;The captain also stated he needed to request that the passengers stop their harassing behavior toward the flight attendant and after several warnings asked the flight attendant to stay with him near the cockpit to avoid any further abuse.&#x201D; Fingers are pointed directly at Bieber and his father here, who were reportedly &quot;extremely abusive&quot; to a flight attendant.</p>

<p>When questioned at the airport, Bieber admitted to smoking pot and drinking alcohol. Drug-sniffing dogs did not find any unsmoked weed on the jet... but that just means they burned through it all. No members of the crew filed charges.</p>

<p>This was just the latest in a string of incidents starring Bieber. In just two months he has been arrested for DUI <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115916/http://laist.com/2014/01/31/justin_bieber_wasnt_driving_fast_en.php">in Miami</a>, and assaulting a driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115916/http://laist.com/2014/01/29/justin_bieber_to_turn_himself_in_to.php">in Toronto</a>. And you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115916/http://laist.com/2014/01/14/police_raid_justin_biebers_home_ove.php">that whole egg thing</a>. This has led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115916/http://dcist.com/2014/02/virginia_senator_mark_warner_also_t.php">actual U.S. Senators</a> coming forward to offer their support in deporting the 19-year-old.</p>
