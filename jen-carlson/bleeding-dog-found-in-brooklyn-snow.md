<p>Another snowfall, another abandoned dog. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144422/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/lets_save_this_cute_puppy_today.php">Earlier this month</a> a pit bull was tied to the Williamsburg Bridge and left in the snow (presumably by its owners); luckily, it has now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144422/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/18/penelope_the_pit_bull.php">found a home</a>. We just received an email regarding <em>another</em> dog discovered in the snow in Brooklyn. An employee of 3rd Ward sent along the above photo and tells us: </p>

<blockquote>This morning we found a small chihuahua abandoned and bleeding in front of our work. We are contacting shelters but having a hard time getting her in somewhere.</blockquote>

<p>Do you know this dog, or can you help? Contact Allison at awall(at)3rdward(dot)com&#x2014;she tells us they&apos;ll be taking her to a shelter at 6 p.m. tonight, but the dog will be there all day.</p>
