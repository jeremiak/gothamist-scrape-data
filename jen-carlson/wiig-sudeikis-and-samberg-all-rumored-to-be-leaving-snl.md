<p>According to a couple of sources that spoke to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172608/http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kristen-wiig-andy-samberg-jason-sudeikis-to-leave-saturday-night-live-201244">Us Weekly</a>, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172608/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl">Saturday Night Live</a></em> is about to lose some major players. Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg and Jason Sudeikis are all rumored to be leaving at the end of the season&#x2014;an insider told them, &quot;It will be a huge blow to the show.&quot; But really... it&apos;s about time, no? Wiig is too big for the show now post-<em>Bridesmaids</em>, Sudeikis has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172608/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0837177/">doing just fine</a> outside of studio 8H, and Andy Samberg has been there since the beginning of time! We will miss Samberg&apos;s Digital Shorts... but we&apos;re not really going to miss Wiig&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172608/http://www.hulu.com/watch/53463/saturday-night-live-gilly">Gilly character</a>.</p>

<p>Recently the show hired <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172608/http://sfist.com/2012/03/29/snl_hires_first_openly_lesbian_play.php">the show&apos;s first open lesbian</a>, Kate McKinnon, and now we can definitely expect more new cast announcements before next season. And we hear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172608/http://theweek.com/article/index/226373/is-chevy-chase-quitting-community">Chevy Chase</a> may be looking for work...</p>
