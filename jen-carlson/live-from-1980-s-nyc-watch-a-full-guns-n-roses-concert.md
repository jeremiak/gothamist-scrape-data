<p>Guns n&apos; Roses has released a short video that seems to confirm the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/guns-n-roses-confirm-north-american-tour-20160325">21 cities</a> they&apos;ll be hitting during their North American tour this summer. No dates are provided, and the band&apos;s lineup still hasn&apos;t been announced, and no matter what these shows will never occur in 1980s New York City, so what&apos;s even the point, man.  </p>

<p>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/07/videos_guns_n_roses_brooklyn.php">skeptically approach</a> Axl &amp; Co&apos;s dive back into touring life, let&apos;s go back in time. Nostalgia is great. You should live in the past. Never think of the future. It&apos;s safer that way. Here&apos;s the band&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/30/guns_n_roses_1.php">Live at the Ritz</a>&quot; concert, filmed for MTV in 1988 at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/27/the_ritz.php">now shuttered venue</a>.</p>

<p>And now a question you should all be asking yourselves in regards to everything in life: <em>Will the millennials care?</em> Here is a Slack conversation I had with Office Millennial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://twitter.com/bfishbfish">Rebecca Fishbein</a>: </p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Can you give me a comment on Guns n&apos; Roses?<br>
<strong>Rebecca:</strong> they are a band you have all made me listen to<br>
<strong>Me:</strong> What do millennials think of Guns n&apos; Roses?<br>
<strong>Rebecca:</strong> probably most millennials like guns n&#x2019; roses but to me they are now just a reminder of the torture i&#x2019;ve received at the hands of my non-millennial colleagues<br>
<strong>Me:</strong> So you would not go to a Guns n&apos; Roses concert?<br>
<strong>Rebecca:</strong> no i would not<br>
<strong>Me:</strong> Would you watch one on your phone?<br>
<strong>Rebecca:</strong> 0 percent<br>
<strong>Me:</strong> This seems unfair to Guns n&apos; Roses<br>
<strong>Rebecca:</strong> i&#x2019;m sure most millennials like and/or tolerate guns n&#x2019; roses but personally i do not like them except for that one song that is okay<br>
<strong>Me:</strong> Which one? There are so many HITS<br>
<strong>Rebecca:</strong> That one with the child</p>

<p>Based on this conversation, we can assess that Guns n&apos; Roses may get some millennial interest in their tour, as long as not every millennial has been subjected in a negative way to the band, as Ms. Fishbein has. And even more hopeful: the millennials probably have no idea who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/guns-n-roses-rumor-izzy-stradlin-to-take-limited-role-in-reunion/">Izzy Stradlin</a> is, so they won&apos;t care if there&apos;s or not anyway.</p>
