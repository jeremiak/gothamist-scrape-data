                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:225px; "> <img alt="bugsbunnypark.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054930im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bugsbunnypark.jpg" width="225" height="307"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Original photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054930/http://www.flickr.com/photos/7734937@N07/2956414235/">bryan306&apos;s flickr</a></span></i></div> When&apos;s the last time you saw a rabbit in Central Park? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054930/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/04/01/2010-04-01_wheres_the_wabbits_last_bunny_sighted_4_yrs_ago.html">the Daily News</a>, you&apos;d be a liar if you said anytime after 2006. The paper reports that the last wild rabbit was spotted around four years ago in the north end of the park; since then, real rabbits have become as mythical as the Easter Bunny.<p></p>

<p>The Central Park Conservancy&apos;s Regina Alvarez has no idea what happened to the population, saying, &quot;It&apos;s a mystery. We just don&apos;t know what happened... but we haven&apos;t seen any.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054930/http://gothamist.com/tags/baldeagle">bald eagles</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054930/http://gothamist.com/tags/coyote">coyotes</a>, feral cats, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054930/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/08/raccoons.php">rabid raccoons</a> in the area have something to do with it? One vet tech professor at LaGuardia Community College points the finger at the latter, saying, &quot;Raccoons not only kill rabbits but they often carry a roundworm that can be lethal to the rabbit population. The roundworm is found in the raccoons&apos; feces, and rabbits are very susceptible because they are meticulous groomers. They are always licking their feet to stay clean.&quot; While animal-on-animal crime is the likely culprit, doesn&apos;t hurt to check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054930/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/01/liquor_store_puts_bunnies_and_chick.php">liquor stores</a> for wild Eastern cottontails!</p>

<p>On that note, Alvarez added, &quot;Every year after Easter, we find little white domestic rabbits dropped off at the park from people who got them as gifts and probably didn&apos;t know how much work went into caring for a rabbit. We have them removed and dropped off at an animal shelter. It isn&apos;t good for the rabbits&#x2014;or the park.&quot;</p>
