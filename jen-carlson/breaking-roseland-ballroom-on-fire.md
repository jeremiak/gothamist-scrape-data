<p>At about 10:40 p.m. we received word of a 2nd Alarm at 239 West 52nd Street and 8th Avenue, better known as Roseland Ballroom. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103747/http://www.thebravest.com/manhattan/manhattan.htm">live scanner feed</a> confirmed, and according to reports we&apos;re getting over the newswire Con Ed has been requested to the scene. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103747/http://twitter.com/#!/NYScanner/status/45328977103040512">NYScanner</a> Twitter described the fire as &quot;heavy,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103747/http://twitter.com/#!/EmergencyStream/status/45329260088537090">EmergencyStream</a> says it&apos;s on the mezzanine level. </p>

<p>One woman nearby Tweeted: &quot;Big fire at the Roseland ballroom across the street! So many fire trucks... the street is all lit up!&quot; There were no shows scheduled at the venue tonight. We&apos;ll update when we have more information.</p>
