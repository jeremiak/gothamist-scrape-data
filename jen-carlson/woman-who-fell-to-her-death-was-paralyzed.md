Her husband, Danny Gregory, wrote a book called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211161400/http://gothamist.com/2004/01/27/everyday_matters.php"><em>Everyday Matters</em></a> in 2003, after his wife lost the use of her legs in a subway accident. At the time, he wrote: &quot;Two years before I started drawing, my wife was run over by a subway train. Sounds really terrible, I know. But, well, this book is about how art and New York City saved my life.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211161400/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/19/2010-03-19_paralyzed_mom_in_death_plunge.html">the Daily News</a>, cops say she managed to vault herself off the 8th floor balcony, and they believe it was &quot;no accident.&quot; And while she was still breathing when they got to her on a 2nd floor terrace, she died soon after at St. Vincent&apos;s hospital.</p>

<p>A friend of the family&apos;s told the paper that her husband isn&apos;t ready to call it a suicide, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t know how she could get over the railing. She&apos;s handicapped. She&apos;s in a wheelchair.&quot;</p>
