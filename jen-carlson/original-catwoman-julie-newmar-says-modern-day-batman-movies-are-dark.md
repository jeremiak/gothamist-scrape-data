<p>The original Catwoman, Julie Newmar, has spoken out about the latest reboots of the Batman story. Newmar was part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161303/http://laist.com/2012/07/18/rare_photos_life_behind_the_scenes.php">original television series</a>, which was probably the most campy version, and on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161303/http://omg.yahoo.com/yo-show/meet-batman-s-original-catwoman-30113001.html">Yahoo&apos;s Yo Show</a> the sassy 78-year-old actress says Nolan&apos;s version is &quot;dark.&quot; She added, &quot;I think we had so much fun in the &#x2018;60s, 1966 to 1968. And then Vietnam came and things sort of got darker and darker and darker.&quot;</p>

<p>When pushed to pick to pick a favorite Catwoman, aside from her own, Newmar simply says, &quot;I do admire Michelle Pfeiffer as an actress,&quot; and notes that she hasn&apos;t seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161303/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/05/introducing_anne_hathaway_as_catwom.php">Anne Hathaway&apos;s version</a> yet. But perhaps the latest Catwomen are a little too tough for Newmar&apos;s taste&#x2014;she recalls that her &quot;Catwoman would just kind of sit there in the fight scenes and she just sort of file her nails... She couldn&apos;t be bothered with all that nonsense.&quot; And what about Batman? &quot;I think [Adam West] fit the part better than anyone.&quot;</p>
