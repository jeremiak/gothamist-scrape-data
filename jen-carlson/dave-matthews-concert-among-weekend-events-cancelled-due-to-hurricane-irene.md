<p>In case you were still planning on trying to do anything but stay dry in your apartment on Sunday, it&apos;s probably been cancelled. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144813/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">Thanks, Irene</a>!) Mayor Bloomberg has officially revoked all permits for outdoor events on Sunday, and cancellations are piling up for events on Saturday, too. </p>

<p>First up, the Dave Matthews Band Caravan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144813/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/thousands_of_dave_matthews_band_fan.php">on Governors Island</a> will only happen today; both Saturday and Sunday have been postponed. The DMB folk have updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144813/http://www.dmbcaravan.com/governors-island/">their website</a> noting:</p>

<blockquote>Ticket holders for Saturday and Sunday are invited to attend the Friday event at Governors Island. The Governor of New York has issued a state of emergency, therefore the DMB Caravan events on Saturday, August 27th and Sunday, August 28th have been postponed. We will announce the new Caravan Governors Island dates as soon as they have been confirmed. We will continue to post updates at DMBCaravan.com as they are confirmed.</blockquote>

<p>Other cancellations include Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144813/http://www.brooklynflea.com/smorgasburg/">Smorgasburg</a>, the Battle of Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144813/http://theoldstonehouse.org/calendar/">Sunday events</a>, The Metropolitan Opera&apos;s first two screenings in its outdoor opera film festival in Lincoln Center Plaza, the Afro-Punk Festival, and all of Sunday&apos;s FringeNYC shows, to name a few. Before heading out to anything this weekend, please check ahead to make sure the event is still going on.</p>
