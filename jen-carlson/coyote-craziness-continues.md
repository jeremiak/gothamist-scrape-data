<p>Parks Department&apos;s Press Officer, Cristina DeLuca, told us this morning: &quot;We know of four coyotes that have traveled into Manhattan in the last decade, and one or more have been reported in recent weeks in various parts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152725/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/central_park_coyote_on_the_loose.php">of Central Park</a>.  While coyotes are top predators, they prey primarily on small animals such as mice and birds. However, like other animals successfully living in or near urban areas, coyotes are opportunistic omnivores; they will scavenge a meal (trash, compost, dead animals, vegetation) if necessary.&quot; Trash and rat control? Yes please!</p>

<p>But she goes on to say that if you come into contact with one of these fellas, you should call 311 immediately. The city plans to eventually capture the coyotes; currently the protocol for doing so is being put together by several agencies including the DEP.</p>

<p>Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152725/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/coyotes_roaming_manhattan_yAm8a3Yl2ZdmClz3C28CPN">the NY Post</a>, Dr. Paul Curtis (coyote expert!) tells the paper that, &quot;The peak of breeding is right around this time of year. The young animals get kicked out of the home because their parents are preparing to breed. They&apos;re pushing themselves into the city, and what they found in the city is that life isn&apos;t so bad.&quot; And tomorrow they&apos;ll probably love frolicking around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152725/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/09/school_already_canceled_tomorrow_fo.php">in the snow</a>!</p>
