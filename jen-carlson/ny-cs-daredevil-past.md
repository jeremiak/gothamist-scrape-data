Unsurprisingly, many of them flocked to the city, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134330/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-day_racing#The_two-man_race">Madison Square Garden</a> to the Brooklyn Bridge. One of particular interest is Sig Smith, who once walked around the crown of the Statue of Liberty, blindfolded!</p><blockquote>Everybody has heard of the Statue of Liberty, though not many people realize what a huge object it is. They say that a man can crawl out of the statue&#x2019;s eye. If he should slip through that eye he would drop to certain death at the base, more than 150 feet below.<p></p>

<p>Yet Sig Smith, the man who earns his corned-beef-and by pursuing the profession of daredevil, mounted up to the top there. And blindfolded, with his eyes bandaged against the possibility of seeing a thing, he walked around on the prongs of the crown with all the carelessness of a child skipping rope.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134330/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/03/vallone_says_no.php">Peter Vallone, Jr.</a> certainly wouldn&apos;t stand for <em>that</em> today. The magazine also noted the famous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134330/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Brodie_(bridge_jumper)">Steve Brodie jump</a> from the Brooklyn Bridge (which may or may not have been a hoax), and Patrick Gerrity&apos;s walk across the bridge on the first strand of cable while it was still under construction.<p></p>
