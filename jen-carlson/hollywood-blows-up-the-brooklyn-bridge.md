Warner Bros. spent around $5,000,000 for a 6 night shoot in New York, after getting approval from 14 government agencies, with hundreds of extras, including 160 members of the National Guard in full combat gear. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520035513/http://movies.ign.com/objects/771/771901.html">The plot</a>: &quot;Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable, and man-made. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and maybe the world. Mutant victims of the plague&#x2014;The Infected&#x2014;lurk in the shadows&#x2026;watching Neville&#x2019;s every move&#x2026;waiting for him to make a fatal mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>And the trailer is now out, attached to the release of Ocean&apos;s 13.  See the Brooklyn Bridge blow up in the clip below. Other locations in New York you can expect to see in the movie: Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg, Tribeca, the Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral. Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520035513/http://imdb.com/List?endings=on&amp;&amp;locations=Brooklyn%20Bridge,%20New%20York%20City,%20New%20York,%20USA&amp;&amp;heading=18;with+locations+including;Brooklyn%20Bridge,%20New%20York%20City,%20New%20York,%20USA">a list</a> of other movies that have filmed on the Brooklyn Bridge. </p>
