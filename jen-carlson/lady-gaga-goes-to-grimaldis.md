<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="gagamaldis.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151959im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gagamaldis.jpg" width="225" height="228" class="image-left"> </span>Following the lead <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151959/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/michelle_obama_grimaldis_better_tha.php">of the First Lady</a>, Lady Gaga headed to DUMBO to get a late dinner at Grimaldi&apos;s pizza last night. Allegedly! </p>

<p>Reader Jane Kratochvil writes in: &quot;I live across the street and was having a pizza with my sister... The restaurant was less than half full at 10:30 p.m. when Gaga walked in and ordered the pizza herself at the takeout counter (she was with a friend).  She was wearing a leotard and ripped fishnets with a gold lame jacket.  She had on snakeskin, platform, stiletto ankle boots.  No information on what kind of pizza she ordered...&quot; but we bet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151959/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/lady_gaga_distracts_from_scandal_wi.php">there was meat</a> on it! </p>

<p>After placing the order she &quot;slowly waltzed back out to her SUV and waited for her pizza.&quot; Twitter adds fire to the rumor, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151959/http://search.twitter.com/search?q=gaga+grimaldis">several people posting</a> about spotting the pop star. Yet no one got a photo? We&apos;ll put a call in when the pizza joint opens later today to see if they can confirm... and to possibly place an order.</p>
