<p>The bloggers over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310120957/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/19/video_of_the_da_88.php">at the Hotel Chelsea</a> have been keeping an eye on the new management of their ever-changing home, and most recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310120957/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2008/12/as-you-can-see-from-these-photos-the-hotel-management-presently-led-by-vice-president-david-elder-general-manager-andrew-t.html">noted</a> some falsified DOB construction permits obtained &quot;in a move designed to sidestep requirement for certificate of non-harassment.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310120957/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2008/12/in-case-anyone-wondered-what-we-were-talking-about-in-our-previous-post-about-the-chelsea-hotel-management-falsifying-constru.html">Today</a> they&apos;ve got photographic proof of the construction, and Bob Dylan fans: cover your eyes. The singer&apos;s former residence at the hotel, room #211, &quot;where he lived in the 60s, writing &apos;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,&apos; and so many other great songs from his Blond on Blond album&quot; is being destroyed! The room had pretty much stayed the same since Dylan was inhabiting it, something The Man and their sledgehammers are changing fast. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310120957/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/17/a_conversation.php">Stanley Bard</a> would surely object.</p>
