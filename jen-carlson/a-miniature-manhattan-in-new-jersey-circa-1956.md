</div></div><p>In the 1950s, a 23-year-old Guy Miller set out to build a model of Manhattan, a dream he had since he was a young boy. His project was funded by the inspirational speaker that motivated him to follow through with his dream, Anthony Norvell, and in 1956 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130234/http://books.google.com/books?id=p0wEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">LIFE magazine</a> documented his progress. At the time they took these photos, he had completed Midtown Manhattan, as well as the Wall Street area&#x2014;&quot;complete with every office building, brownstone, bar and grill.&quot; The model was &quot;on a cliff in Union City, New Jersey.&quot;</p>

<p>The structures were made of paper and glass, with a scale of 1/2 inch to a floor. The magazine estimated he had another three years ahead of him before he&apos;d finish the 62,000 buildings he aimed to.</p>

<p>The model was seen by many, in the windows of Gimbels and Saks, and at exhibitions, like one on Coney Island in 1956, where he recalled, &quot;a baby got lost for two hours in the model, and turned up on 8th Avenue... atop the Port Authority.&quot; That anecdote was told in 1974, when Miller gained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130234/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19741111&amp;id=NHY0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TI0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5475,1993463">some press</a> after having to collect his model, which at the time was being stored in the basement of a Queens shoe shop. His model being evicted, and being strapped on cash himself, he was trying to get the city to save his creation.</p>

<p>So there&apos;s the mystery... where is it now?</p>
