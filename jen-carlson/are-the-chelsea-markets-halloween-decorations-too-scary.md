</div></div><p>The Chelsea Market has their annual Halloween decorations up, and not everyone is happy about it. This year&apos;s display shows gruesome scenes featuring zombie babies chewing on body parts and red-eyed demon children, which some parents find too traumatizing for kids. (But this is the same stuff they had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120207084652/http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinyca/5139972618/">last year</a>!) One 34-year-old mom told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120207084652/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/chelsea-market-halloween-display-raises-hackles-as-well-as-the-dead/?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;seid=auto">CityRoom</a>, &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s completely inappropriate to have a zombie baby chewing on a human hand and a zombie child that&#x2019;s the same age as my child.&quot; But what do the kids think? At least three kids, aged 4 to 8 years old, all thought that the display was, and we quote, &quot;Cool!&quot;</p>

<p>Not every parent is so concerned, either&#x2014;NY1 anchor and father himself, Pat Kiernan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120207084652/http://twitter.com/#!/patkiernan/status/129563012171436032">works in the building</a>, and told us this morning, &quot;I&apos;m a parent and it didn&apos;t even cross my mind that the decorations were a problem. Parents who are more cautious than me might have to find somewhere else to buy artisanal chocolate milk until November 1st, when it should be safe to return.&quot;</p>

<p>Click through to judge for yourself&#x2014;is this stuff any scarier than the sword-swinging drunken pirates found in Disney World&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120207084652/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTQ5eWBlApY">Pirates of the Caribbean ride</a>?</p>
