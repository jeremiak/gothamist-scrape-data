Seems even developers took this warning to heart, as one just removed 211 bodies from a graveyard that&apos;s in the way of their sweet new luxury condos. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221544/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04252008/news/regionalnews/grave_insult_108034.htm">The NY Post</a> reports:</p><blockquote>A Brooklyn church yesterday cleared out the remains of 211 corpses that had been buried for more than a century in an adjacent crypt to help pave the way for a controversial luxury condo complex.<p></p>

<p>The 109-year-old United Methodist Church in Bay Ridge is under contract to sell its church and grounds along Fourth Avenue for $9.75 million to developer Abe Batech, who wants to replace it with a six- to seven-story condo project.</p></blockquote>Demolition is slated to be done by the end of May, but protesters are now up in arms over the eerie excavation. The 211 old &quot;residents&quot; of the address have been moved to Cypress Hills Cemetery; but will any future residents dare sign a lease on what&apos;s certain to be a haunted condo? <p></p>
