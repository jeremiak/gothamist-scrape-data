<p>If you head to your greenmarket around this time you&apos;ll probably notice an abundance of fresh cut eucalyptus branches (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516072849/http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=koala+eucalyptus&amp;oq=koala+euc&amp;gs_l=youtube.3.0.0j0i5.2424.4118.0.5134.9.8.0.1.1.0.138.616.7j1.8.0...0.0...1ac.1.-d42XQKnG6c">koala food</a>). We picked some up yesterday, and found this neat tip that ran in Body+Soul magazine (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516072849/http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/eucalyptus-in-the-shower-45774">Apartment Therapy</a>) a few years ago. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Try hanging a bundle of eucalyptus from your shower curtain rod. &apos;The heat and steam help to activate the herb&apos;s essential oils which can ease congestion...&apos; Hang a bundle with natural garden twine (more moisture-resistant than cotton twine) on the shower rod, away from the spray of the water. Enjoy the scent for a few weeks as you take a hot shower.&quot;</blockquote> 

<p>Even if you aren&apos;t congested, it looks pretty and smells nice! And since large bundles cost just a few bucks, you&apos;ll definitely have enough from just one bunch to put in a vase <em>and</em> in the shower. This is almost better than that time we learned about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516072849/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/tip_preserve_your_herbs_in_olive_oi.php">freezing herbs in olive oil</a>.</p>
