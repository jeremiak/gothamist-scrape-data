You may have already heard one of his songs, &quot;Stop the Train,&quot; in the film Julie &amp; Julia.</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>The two talented siblings chatted with each other recently and let us eavesdrop. Listen in below as they discuss nearly visiting Neverland Ranch, their favorite plays, concerts, and of course, a creepy primate house in Spokane.</em></p>

<p><strong>Henry:</strong> Maaaaaamie....?<br>
<strong>Mamie:</strong>  Eh hem. Yes? You ready to play hard ball?<br>
<strong>H:</strong> I&apos;m keeping you honest.<br>
<strong>M:</strong> Go ahead.<br>
<strong>H:</strong> Maybe we should put a time limit on this?<br>
<strong>M:</strong> Like for each question? Like jeopardy? Or to the whole thing so we can get on with our lives? I for one have nothing to do&#x2014;it&apos;s this or online shopping...<br>
<strong>H:</strong> I meant for the whole thing so we can keep our questions focused...<br>
<strong>M:</strong> Okay.<br>
<strong>H:</strong> What are you shopping for?<br>
<strong>M:</strong> Jewelry. Because I know it will fit. I should also note that I am listening to your record. I&apos;m calling it a &quot;record&quot; because that&apos;s classy...<br>
<strong>H:</strong> Is it good music to shop to?<br>
<strong>M:</strong> Yeah. Sure.<br>
<strong>H:</strong> So what is our time limit again?<br>
<strong>M:</strong> I don&apos;t know. What do you want it to be? 20 minutes?<br>
<strong>H:</strong> That&apos;s good. So, did you go see a movie yesterday?<br>
<strong>M:</strong> I did. <em>The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife</em>. Ugh. Stupid movie made me cry. Mediocre AND manipulative.<br>
<strong>H:</strong> Like Top 40 pop music.<br>
<strong>M:</strong> Totally. It Coldplay-ed me<br>
<strong>H:</strong> Nice one.<br>
<strong>M:</strong> Thank you. Print it.</p>
