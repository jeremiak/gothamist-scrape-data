The lunch menu for the midday meal served on April 14th,1912 is now up on the auction block in the UK, and is expected to sell for $157,960 USD. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120222211336/http://rt.com/art-and-culture/news/titanic-memorabilia-auction-menu-crash-day-867/">The menu</a> was on the table of Dr. Washington Dodge, a banker from San Francisco who was traveling with his wife and son. The entire family survived the tragic crash, and his wife Ruth had the menu from that afternoon, placing it in her handbag. It has been in the family since, and is one of the rarest pieces of Titanic memorabilia.</p>

<p>The menu, adorned with the White Star Line logo, offered up 40 choices, including eggs Argenteuil, chicken, beef, grilled mutton chops, eight kinds of cheese, Norwegian anchovies, chicken a la Maryland, corned beef, vegetables, dumplings, and more. The third class passengers had a much different offering, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120222211336/http://titanicstation.blogspot.com/2007/02/third-class.html">see here</a>&#x2014;their choices were limited to bread &amp; butter, potatoes, Quaker oats, corned beef and cabbage, currant buns, pickles and cheese, and peaches and rice.</p>
