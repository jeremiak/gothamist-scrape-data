<p>We didn&apos;t think this needed to be pointed out, but here we are: Please avoid biking on the Brooklyn-Queens EXPRESSWAY... especially without a helmet, especially during rush hour, especially in the middle of the lanes, and especially while intoxicated! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163135/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/101q1p/yes_this_guy_is_riding_his_bicycle_on_the_bqe/">A Redditor posted</a> the above photo last night, adding:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I&apos;ll elaborate a little bit, was driving home from work today around 6:15 p.m. and saw this guy, almost couldn&apos;t believe my eyes but then I remembered I was in Brooklyn. He was all wobbly and probably drunk.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>He called the cops, but we haven&apos;t received any alerts regarding a drunk cyclist on the BQE, so it would seem that somehow this guy made it out unscathed&#x2014;but not everyone is so lucky, last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163135/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/26/police_identify_man_killed_while_ri.php">a man was killed</a> while pulling the same stunt. Stick to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163135/http://gothamist.com/tags/bikelanes">bike lanes</a>!</p>
