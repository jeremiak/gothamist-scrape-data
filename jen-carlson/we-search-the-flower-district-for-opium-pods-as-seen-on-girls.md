<p>Last night the second episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123113/http://gothamist.com/tags/hbogirls"><em>Girls</em></a> aired, but we&apos;re going to revisit the pilot again, particularly the scenes where Hannah and her friends drink some opium pod tea, with pods procured from New York&apos;s very own Flower District. Today we wandered over there and found out a few things worth knowing before trying to make the tea on your own:</p><ul><li>Rule #1 of opium pods: do not call them opium pods. When asking for them in the Flower District, you should call them poppy pods. Be cool. Don&apos;t bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123113/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_tea#Legality">the law</a> down on everyone. <br>
</li><li>Purchasing these dried pods is legal, it&apos;s when you extract the opium that things get sketchy.<br>
</li><li>The people at Jamali told us they haven&apos;t carried them in three years because they &quot;attract the wrong kind of people.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Rule #2 of opium pods: do not try to smoke the pods.<br>
</li><li>Fun fact: these can also be used in flower arrangements, as the woman at Dry Nature told us, she likes them for arrangements because they are large and good for filler purposes.<br>
</li><li>Price points: each pod will cost you 3 bucks, and it seems that most people brew batches of tea with 3 to 5 pods.<br>
</li><li>They make a fun noise when you shake them, so we expect them to hit the underground Brooklyn indie psychedelic scene as a valid instrument, any day now.<br>
</li><li>It will taste like <em>twigs</em>, not Twix, the candy bar.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Poppy tea, when brewed under certain conditions, offers up a narcotic, and possibly hallucinogenic, high; the walls of the dried pods contain small amounts of opiate alkaloids, mainly morphine (but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123113/http://poppyseedtea.com/">be warned</a>, the morphine content can vary a great deal). </p>

<p>One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123113/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/fake_weed_taste_test.php">experimental Gothamist staffer</a> tells us, &quot;I&apos;ve had it, and it just makes you dizzy. REAL opium is the way to go. Or smoke dope instead.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123113/http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=17405">others</a> have sworn by it, noting &quot;the best way to enjoy a decent opium high, is through dried poppy pods. I find it is preferable and much more euphoric to grind up the pods (I use 3-5 pods). The affect is on par, for me, with a large dose of codene, or a pair of vicodin.&quot;</p>

<p>In <em>Girls</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123113/http://youtu.be/OrQfvq9RfM0#t=1m57s">video</a>), the character brewing the tea informs the rest, &quot;I&apos;m making a little brew... a tea of opium pods. This stuff is pretty mild, this is much milder than the stuff you smoke. It&apos;s legal, I got it down at the Flower District, you can just go down there and buy the pods.&quot; After Hannah drinks the tea she suffers an overdramatic reaction to it in front of her parents, resulting in her dad screaming at her mother: &quot;I don&apos;t need to Google that, it&apos;s tantamount to smoking banana peels for chrissakes.&quot; Still, we&apos;re gonna play it safe and stick with Betty Crocker&apos;s recipe for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123113/http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/almond-poppy-tea-cookies/95d4a85b-25c0-41e4-9279-1aafc309a79a">almond poppy tea cookies</a>.</p>
