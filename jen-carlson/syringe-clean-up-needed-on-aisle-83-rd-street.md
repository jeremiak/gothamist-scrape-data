<p>Last year (dirty! uncapped!) syringes were spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141320/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/yikes_needles_spotted_at_prospect_p.php">in Prospect Park</a>, which took the Department of Sanitation and the NYPD quite some time to clean up. Earlier today a reader sent us this photo from East 83rd Street between Park and Lexington avenues, where syringes were spotted once again, this time <em>on ice</em>; she tells us 311 gave her a 5 to 7 day turnaround estimate on cleaning them up. </p>

<p>We called 311 ourselves and were connected to a specialist who filed a report; she told us she couldn&apos;t give a time frame on when this public safety hazard would be cleaned up, but did tell us it was a priority since they are loose and uncapped. If anyone strolls by, let us know if they&apos;re still there! (And watch your step.)</p>
