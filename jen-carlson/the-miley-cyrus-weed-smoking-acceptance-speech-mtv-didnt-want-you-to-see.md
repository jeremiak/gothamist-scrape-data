<p>Last night at MTV&apos;s European Music Awards Show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083719/http://gothamist.com/tags/mileycyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> smoked a joint on stage during her acceptance speech. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083719/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnun_9UhzSA">Shock me shock me shock me with that deviant behavior</a>! To be fair, the award show was held in Amsterdam, so this was probably the least shocking thing Miley could have done. But since the show aired on MTV in the U.S., the network awkwardly cut the moment out, making her whole acceptance speech seem odd and unfinished. </p>

<p>MTV has no comment on the incident, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083719/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717187/miley-cyrus-marijuana-weed-amsterdam-ema.jhtml">their own website</a> did report on it.</p>
