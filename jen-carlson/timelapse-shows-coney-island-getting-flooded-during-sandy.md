<p>Last week we posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092410/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/31/5_awesome_timelapse_videos_of_hurri.php">a few timelapse videos</a> showing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092410/http://gothamist.com/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> hitting New York City, and the latest comes from Coney Island, one of the areas designated Zone A. The uploader says the video shows &quot;the view outside my bedroom window in Coney Island on the night of October 29th, 2012. It shows the rising flood water from Hurricane Sandy as it made landfall. You can see many cars seeking shelter in the nearby parking lot which is higher above ground. But the water rose high enough to total all the vehicles you see in this video.&quot;</p>

<p>At the end of the video itself, he notes that power went out at 7:53 p.m.&#x2014;&quot;It became too dark outside for the webcam to record anything. The flood kept rising until approximately 9 p.m., when the water was highest and covered cars up to the roofs.&quot;</p>
