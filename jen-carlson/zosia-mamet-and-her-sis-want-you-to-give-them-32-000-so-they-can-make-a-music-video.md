<span class="photo_caption">&quot;Less Bunyan-y, more cabin-y!&quot;</span></p>

<p>The sisters Mamet, that&apos;d be Zosia (GIRLS star) and Clara (not on GIRLS), have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075358/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/512169314/the-cabin-sisters-zosia-and-clara-mamet">launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> to either troll everyone or to <em>actually</em> &quot;introduce [the world to] their unique brand of folk via body percussion, banjo and harmonies.&quot; To do this, they need a not-exactly-cheap music video made. <em>Standards, you understand</em>. And that is why they are asking for THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. Did they think they were emailing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075358/http://davidmamet.com/">their dad</a> when they filled out this form?</p>

<p>They explain: &quot;This music video for &apos;Bleak Love&apos; is our chance to realize through the visual artistry of some very talented people the universal feeling of un-requited love. Visually the video will bounce from opulence to sparseness, French Baroque to a simple, timeless and heartbroken. We are hoping to capture something everyone has felt at some point in their lives.&quot; This sounds like a great use of $32,000.</p>

<p>Listen, one time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075358/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/zosia_mamet.php">we talked to Zosia Mamet</a> on the phone and she was surprisingly nice! So she is probably a very nice person and, you know, just trying to make a music video with her sis and all... but why does she need to ask for donations? As she and her sister confusingly explain on the funding page, &quot;The universe has given us both an opportunity to make a living in our young adult lives as creative people and it is one of the greatest privledges [<em>sic</em>] a person could ask for, the ability to do what you love. This has become another opportunity for that privledge [<em>sic</em>]. Being in the entertainment industry has its lesser known downsides, like being taken out of the town your family lives in or the demanding schedules that prevent attendance at family functions. We are, despite our wonderful jobs at GIRLS and NEIGHBORS, just sisters.&quot; What?</p>

<p>Sure, the Mamet sisters have the right to struggle just like the rest of us, even if they were born into &quot;privledge,&quot; but they&apos;re already successful, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075358/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/kevin_smith_says_no_to_kickstarter.php">Kevin Smith recently pointed out</a> so perfectly, these celeb-Kickstarters are &quot;not fair to real indie filmmakers who need the help. I&apos;ve GOT access to money now&#x2014;so I should use that money and not suck any loot out of the crowd-funding marketplace that might otherwise go to some first-timer who can really use it.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyway, their Kickstarter is failing tremendously, with just 5 backers and $201 raised. Maybe if they cut bangs it will help. People love quirky songstress/actress hybrids with bangs.</p>
