<p>You just purchased a condo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150210025249/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/01/fireworks_from.php">in Williamsburg</a> with a sick rooftop terrace overlooking the East River, but don&apos;t send out that 4th of July firework-watching party Evite to your friends just yet: They&apos;re being moved to the Hudson River this year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150210025249/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/10/thankgiving_day_parade_moves_to_6th.php">Macy&apos;s sure loves change</a>. </p>

<p>The move is likely just for one year, however, and it&apos;s &quot;<strong>to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson&#x2019;s voyage to what would become New York.</strong>&quot; Six barges will be set up between 24th and 50th streets as the New York Pops provide the live soundtrack beyond the sonic backdrop of the big bangs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150210025249/http://www.newyorkology.com/archives/2009/05/macys_4th_of_ju.php">NewYorkology</a> notes that &quot;Macy&#x2019;s Fireworks debuted in 1958 on the Hudson and actually held a special event in 1959 to mark the 350th Anniversary of the Henry Hudson voyage.&quot;</p>
