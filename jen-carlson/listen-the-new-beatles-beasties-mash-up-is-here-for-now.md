<p>If you weren&apos;t sure what to listen to while clicking through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618041120/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/lets_not_forget_that_mike_d_has_bee.php">that slideshow</a> of Mike D&apos;s sweet Brooklyn brownstone&#x2014;all day, endlessly, forever, while crying&#x2014;a new Beastles mash-up album has dropped just in time. <em>Some people are still into mash-ups okay?</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618041120/http://twitter.com/yenbakas">Ben</a>: Remember when mash-ups were a big thing? 2004, amirite. What a year.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618041120/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen</a>: it&apos;s still my favorite music genre.</p>

<p>The Beastles are a fictional band created by Bob Cronin, aka dj BC, and if you somehow didn&apos;t put it together yet, he mashes up the music of both The Beatles and The Beastie Boys&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618041120/http://rottenmonkey.com/poop/entertainment/beatlesbeasties-mash-up-artist-returns-with-ill-submarine/#sthash.8cZpeSnD.dpbs">isn&apos;t exactly legal</a>. The latest is called <me>Ill Submarine, and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618041120/http://www.thebeastles.com/">download it here</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130618041120/https://soundcloud.com/ill-submarine">just click play</a>&#x2014;but you may want to do it before it gets pulled:</me></p>
