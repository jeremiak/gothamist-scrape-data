<p><img alt="DUPREBLACKBOOK.JPG" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/DUPREBLACKBOOK.JPG" width="350" height="246" class="right">Ashley Dupr&#xE9; has become a &quot;don&apos;t&quot; in the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/03/how_to_be_a_scandalite_dont_fo.html">of scandalites</a> for not parlaying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/14/the_biggest_med.php">her 15 minutes</a> into some cold hard cash. NY Mag reports on her quick decline, saying that even market analysts &quot;are now scolding the governor&apos;s hooker for not taking full financial advantage.&quot; Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/3/ashley_alexandra_dupre_not_rich_yet_probably_won_t_ever_be">Silicon Alley</a> reported yesterday that while there&apos;s still a possibility of a &quot;low six-figure&quot; offer from Georgi Vodka in the works, what&apos;s-her-name&apos;s story is going stale; seems her shelf life was about two weeks. </p>

<p>If that doesn&apos;t pan out, all she got out of this was a few million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://www.myspace.com/ninavenetta">MySpace</a> hits, and it seems even before the bust she wasn&apos;t getting paid as much as originally reported. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://gawker.com/5004527/not-5000-per-hour-more-like-750">Gawker</a> points out that Spitzer wasn&apos;t throwing down $5K for an hour with Miss Dupr&#xE9; (&quot;Kristen&quot;), rather a 4-hour session set him back around $3K, meaning her fee was around $750/hour (at least 10% went directly to bookers). </p>

<p>In more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://gothamist.com/tags/hookergate">Hookergate</a> news, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03262008/news/regionalnews/eliots_black_books_103562.htm">The NY Post</a> is reporting that the bookers for the high-class service, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://gothamist.com/tags/Emperors%20Club">Emperor&apos;s Club</a>, are ready to let the world see what&apos;s in their little blackbooks (or at least the feds, as a part of their plea negotiations). This means that &quot;the defendants would have to rat out everyone involved with the international brothel.&quot;  Currently, 62-year-old ringleader Mark Brener remains in custody without bail, while his mistress and No. 2 in the business, 23-year-old Cecil Suwal, was released on March 18th -- leading some to believe she may be joining &quot;Team America&quot;. Surely this will all have something to do with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170426/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/26/east_side_madam.php">the latest prostitution ring scandal</a>, a business whose black book also contains prominent political names.  </p>
