<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="karparot0910a.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174552im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/karparot0910a.jpg" width="250" height="251" class="image-left"> </span>The annual chicken sacrificing ritual known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174552/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/annual_chicken_sacrificing_ritual_g.php">kaparot</a> that takes place around this time of year (near Yom Kippur) always gets the demonstrators out. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174552/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/kosher_guy_fowls_out_xR9CXrudSFsC5KAVtbzUcJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, the ASPCA is the latest to step up to the protest plate, and a Brooklyn man says they all but forced him to stop the tradition at his place of business yesterday. </p>

<p>He told the paper that his seasonal Satmar Kapparos Center, run out of a parking lot at 12th Avenue and 48th Street, was visited by the organization, and according to him: &quot;They asked me what I was feeding [the birds]. I said challah and water. They said, &apos;No, you have to feed them grain.&apos;&quot; Not too much arm twisting there, but then they allegedly threatened to bring in the Health Department. </p>

<p>The ASPCA tells the story differently, however, and told the paper that they &quot;visited the center to investigate a cruelty complaint and found no violation of laws. The man decided to remove the chickens on his own.&quot;</p>
