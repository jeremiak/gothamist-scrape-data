</div></div><p><em>Last month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308080716/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/show_us_your_apartment.php">we asked</a> to see your apartments. New Yorkers, including us, are voyeuristic creatures (admit it), and who doesn&apos;t love to see how their neighbors are living... even if it can lead to pangs of jealousy. Below is our second installment&#x2014;and in case you missed last week&apos;s, about the woman who paid $500 total for two East Village apartments, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120308080716/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/apartment_voyeurism_the_woman_who_p.php#photo-1">click here</a> (it&apos;ll only hurt a little).</em></p>

<p>This week we leave Manhattan for Brooklyn, right off the Montrose L stop in East Williamsburg. This is where 23-year-old Lacie (a preschool teacher), her boyfriend, and their friend live. She tells us, &quot;Last August it was Craigslist time, I was looking for any apartment. No qualifications, no standards, just a place to live. All we needed was a place to house myself, my friend, my boyfriend, a 4-pound poodle, and a black cat. </p>

<p>I found a cheap railroad apartment, nothing special... but the landlord and I got to talking, and I started asking a million questions, like, &apos;Do you own any other properties?&apos; He told me, &apos;As of 30 minutes ago a tenant told me she was leaving. I have to tell you, the place is unusual and interesting. It&apos;s a cottage house behind this apartment building.&quot;</p>

<p>The freestanding house has a porch, a yard, two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. Lacie says, &quot;The place is tiny but has charm. I mean, we live in a goddamn cottage! We have a fire pit in the front yard. My landlord told me when he bought the property, a 90 year old man lived in the cottage and used to plant watermelons in between the cobblestones in the front yard.&quot;</p>

<p>The rent is $2000, which is split between 3 people.</p>
