<p>Did you know that freewheelin&apos; sex club Plato&apos;s Retreat had <em>rules</em>? (Many revolved around the mats!) Anyway, the sex club, which was housed inside the basement of the Ansonia Hotel on West 73rd Street, was a members-only type joint that (according to the above sign) did not allow threesomes, drugs, alcohol (!), or smoking on the sex mats! They did, however, declare that &quot;The pleasure and the fun will keep you feeling young&quot; in this amazing commercial.</p>
