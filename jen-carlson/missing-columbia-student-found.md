The 25-year-old Toby Cohen had allegedly left his girlfriend&apos;s apartment this past Sunday night, took $200 out of an ATM and headed back to his Washington Heights home. He then left his wallet and medication for &quot;a life-threatening medical condition&quot; in his apartment. After two frantic days, a friend of Cohen&apos;s just told us some good news -- Cohen has been found healthy, and his family is currently picking him up. No other details have come out yet, but it&apos;s nice to hear the story didn&apos;t end tragically. </p>
