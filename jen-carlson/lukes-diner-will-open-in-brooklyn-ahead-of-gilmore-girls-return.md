<p><em>Gilmore Girls</em> is briefly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171105005540/http://laist.com/tags/gilmoregirls">returning this year</a>, thanks to Netflix, and in celebration of its comeback (and &quot;of the 16th Gilmoreversary&quot;), there will be promotional stunts. Up first: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171105005540/http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Luke&apos;s_Diner">Luke&apos;s Diner</a> is coming to a coffee shop near you. </p>

<p>Luke&apos;s Diner is, of course, owned by the fictional Luke Danes, whose gruff exterior and <em>seemingly</em> contemplative soul you probably liked when the show first aired, but by now realize what an awful human he was. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171105005540/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/luke_danes_sucks_face_it.php">Really! THE WORST.</a> KEEP READING FOR FURTHER PROOF.</p>

<p>Anyway, Netflix will bring Luke&apos;s Diner to the following locations on October 5th:<br>
</p><ul><li>The Bean at 101 Bedford Ave<br>
</li><li>Sir D&#x2019;s Lounge at 837 Union St<br>
</li><li>Brooklyn Roasting Company at 200 Flushing Ave</li></ul><p></p>

<p>What will be happening there? They say you&apos;ll be able to &quot;enjoy a free cup of Luke&apos;s coffee from 7 a.m. to noon (or while supplies last) and other special touches from the show and surprises from Netflix.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171105005540/http://www.townofstarshollow.org/lukes">More details here</a>... just remember: no cell phones, and no breastfeeding. To quote Luke himself, &quot;In the old days a woman would never consider doing that in public, she would find a barn or a cave. I just can&apos;t stand here and let the lactating continue.&quot;</p>
