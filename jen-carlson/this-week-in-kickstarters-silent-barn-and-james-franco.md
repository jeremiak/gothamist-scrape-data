<span class="photo_caption">Who would you rather (financially support): Silent Barn or James Franco?</span></p>

<p>The artistic director of PS 122 has teamed up with Praxis and none other than Mr. James Franco to launch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111174720/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/praxis/museum-of-non-visible-art-praxis-and-james-franco?ref=video">a Kickstarter campaign</a> to financially support a museum that houses <em>imaginary objects</em>. It is called the Non-Visible Museum and you can buy fake things in it for real money&#x2014;in other words, you&apos;ll receive a card describing a piece of artwork that doesn&apos;t actually exist. How much do paper cards go for these days? The team is looking to raise $5,000 (but are already up to over $13,000!). </p>

<p>Moving along to an artistic group that actually needs money in order to survive, we revisit Silent Barn. Over the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111174720/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/silent_barn_robbed.php">they had $15,000 of equipment stolen</a>, and their space violently trashed. They just launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111174720/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1008830584/rebuilding-the-silent-barn">a Kickstarter</a>, where they&apos;ve set their goal at $40,000 (so far they&apos;ve reached $12,450). Their new plan includes rebuilding the space, including safety and security, and even adding a garden.</p>
