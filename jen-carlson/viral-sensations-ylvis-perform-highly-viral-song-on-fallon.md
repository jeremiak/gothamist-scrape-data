<p>The lifespan of a YouTube sensation isn&apos;t very long, so thankfully Jimmy Fallon got Norwegian electro pop sensations Ylvis to come by the studio last night. In a crushing blow to what we believed to be reality, these guys are actually a comedy duo, making their original offering less magical and special, <em>but</em> they still delivered a more compelling performance than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131013011532/http://laist.com/2013/10/10/videos_kanye_west_tells_jimmy_kimme.php">Kanye on Kimmel</a>. </p>

<p>Watch them perform their hit &quot;What Does the Fox Say?&quot; for the first time (<em>but definitely not the last we will see this a hundred more times</em>) on late night television here:</p>

<p>If you someohow escaped seeing the original video, here it is&#x2014;it was truley something to behold and treasure when we thought it was a sincere dance track:</p>
