<p>State Senator Daniel Squadron and Assemblyman Brian Kavanagh made their statement known on Sunday, while standing in front of a Lower East Side supermarket, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151114050702/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gGJWadpqD35jsB74HNVWKOR5tjhAD9HTFS6O0">the AP</a>. The recall they were responding to was huge&#x2014;more than a half billion eggs&#x2014;and Kavanagh told the crowd, &quot;The massive outbreaks of food-borne illness in recent months leave no doubt that our food safety system is failing us, threatening everyone&apos;s well-being and sometimes costing people&apos;s lives.&quot;</p>

<p>Vaccinations would cost less than a penny per dozen eggs, and would affect 5 billion eggs sold in New York State each year; it could allegedly eliminate an average of 142,000 egg-related salmonella cases in the U.S. each year. While the FDA has instituted new safety rules for eggs over the past month, they do not require vaccination, and Squadron stated, &quot;If the FDA is unwilling to take the lead, we should start here in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>If their bill gets approval from the state Senate and Assembly, <em>and</em> Governor Paterson signs it, it would take a few months before farmers would be required to vaccinate their hens.</p>
