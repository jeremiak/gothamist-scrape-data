<p>A nearly 3-minute long trailer for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404153149/http://gothamist.com/tags/zoolander"><em>Zoolander 2</em></a> has been unleashed, and it&apos;s been about 15 years since we last saw Derek Zoolander and Hansel McDonald, who are now &quot;old&quot; and &quot;lame.&quot; The trailer reveals that the two former runway competitors will be teaming up with Penelope Cruz to find out who is trying to assassinate the world&apos;s most beautiful people. Amongst those being targeted are Justin Bieber, Usher, Miley Cyrus, and Demi Lovato&#x2014;the trailer shows the Biebs taking a final selfie before his eternal sleep.</p>

<p>The movie won&apos;t be hitting theaters until February 12th, so prepare yourself for months of promotion filled with Zoolanderisms, and Instagram feeds riddled with Blue Steel selfies now that the phrase is pop culture relevant again.</p>
