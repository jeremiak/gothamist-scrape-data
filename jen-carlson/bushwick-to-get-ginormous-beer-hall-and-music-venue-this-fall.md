										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="danbro0212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208083048im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/danbro0212.jpeg" width="640" height="417" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Beer halls are like the cupcakes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208083048/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/sht_diners_say_stop_opening_boutiqu.php">and meatballs</a> of drinking establishments: so trendy right now! And soon a new one will be coming to Bushwick, housed inside the 4,000-square-foot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208083048/http://danbrostudios.com/">Danbro Studios</a> building, and sporting an 11,000-square-foot outdoor garden&#x2014;making it the city&apos;s biggest beer garden to date. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208083048/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120214/williamsburg-greenpoint-bushwick/massive-beer-hall-brings-suds-back-old-brewery-at-danbro-studios#ixzz1mMrWaQ8R">DNAInfo</a>, the joint&#x2014;which will be called The Well&#x2014;is being opened up by Joshua Richholt, who told them, &#x201C;If we&#x2019;re going to have a very large selection of beers [250 different bottled beers with 60 more on tap], why not have the biggest in the city?&#x201D; The plan is to offer beer from every New York State brewery. They&apos;ll also be hosting food and beer pairings, classes, and a farmer&apos;s market. And the space is fitting, as a former 19th Century brewery&#x2014;it&apos;s located at 260 Meserole Street, conveniently less than two blocks from the Montrose L stop.</p>

<p>As if all that wasn&apos;t enough, Richholt will also be opening The Wick in the same location, a 75,000-square-foot music venue (he&apos;s already got some practice rooms and an instrument shop in there). Both spots should be opened by the fall, if all goes according to plan.<br>
