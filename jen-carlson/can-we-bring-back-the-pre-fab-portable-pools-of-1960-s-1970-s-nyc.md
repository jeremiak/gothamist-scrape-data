<p>In 1966, the NYC Parks Department rolled out, sometimes literally, a set of portable pools for sweating city residents. The mini-pools were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145834/https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/pools">an interim solution</a>, &quot;a pilot program under the Lindsay administration&quot; that all started with &quot;two pre-engineered, pre-fabricated 20&apos; x 40&apos; aluminum or steel above-ground pools with 6&apos; wide attached wooden decks,&quot; according to the Parks Dept. The pools were for kids under 14-years-old, and were fairly shallow at 3&#xBD; feet. </p>

<p>They cost $25,000 each to build, and were meant to be a little cool-off center for underserved neighborhoods. They traveled all over the five boroughs, and were easy to transport. In just a few years, by 1972, there were 72 of them. </p>

<p>Then, during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145834/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/07/nyregion/august-heckscher-83-dies-advocate-for-parks-and-arts.html">the Heckscher administration</a>, swimmobiles were introduced. While the portable pools were phased out with the addition of more permanent structures, these seemed to last into the 1980s. In 1987, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145834/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/01/nyregion/about-new-york-a-swimming-pool-stops-in-brooklyn-like-a-ufo.html">the NY Times</a> talked to 12-year-old Williams Ricks in Brooklyn, who was enjoying a new swim mobile&#x2014;he told them, &quot;My friend Raymond isn&apos;t here today, and he&apos;ll never, ever believe this. It&apos;s like a U.F.O.&quot; The trucks would be parked in the streets all day, before rolling back out at night.</p>

<p>While the Parks Department hasn&apos;t answered our inquiry about the possibility of the swimmobiles returning, a few years ago some luxury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145834/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/02/photos_first_dip_in_summer_streets.php">dumpster pools</a> surfaced as part of the DOT&apos;s Summer Streets initiative.
