<p>Is a Queens carousel going to get a new lease on life? Probably not, but it <em>is</em> going to have a starring role in <em>The Sitter</em>, a new movie with Jonah Hill currently filming around New York. The movie is said to be a loose remake of the 1987 movie <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em>, and a publicist involved told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413003314/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/11/03/2010-11-03_turn_for_the_better_shut_carousel_lands_film_role.html">the Daily News</a> that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413003314/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=12049">Forest Park Carousel</a> is &quot;a major set piece for us.&quot; The 100-year-old city-owned carousel has been sitting dormant for two years as the Parks Department tries to find an operator to run it. Until that day, residents say they&apos;re excited it &quot;will be showcased in a Hollywood film.&quot; Great, but can we all agree that any kind of remake of the near-perfect classic <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em> is a bad idea?</p>
