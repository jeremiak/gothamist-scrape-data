The actor joined the band for an odd performance of their new single &quot;Diane Young,&quot; which Buscemi performed alone with a megaphone.</p>

<p>The band, along with Buscemi, also handed out chocolate eggs and marched with a banner that read: &quot;Vampire Weekend x Steve Buscemi.&quot; <em>But why?</em> Recently&#x2014;and also dangerously close to April Fools Day&#x2014;the band tweeted that Chris Baio discovered he is &quot;a distant cousin of actor Steve Buscemi&quot;:</p>
