<p>There are many songs dedicated to New York City, the most wonderful metropolitan muse, but very few directly dedicated to the Native New Yorker. And the most well-known is, honestly, not very good. Native New Yorkers deserve a better theme song, or at least an updated one.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, Sandy Linzer and Denny Randell wrote &quot;Native New Yorker&quot; for Frankie Valli, which he released on his 1977 album <em>Lady Put The Lights Out</em>. His version is the most awful version of this song, partially due to the fact that it is exactly 2 minutes and 57 seconds too long. </p>

<p>When Odyssey took the song for a spin later that year, they trimmed it down and upped the disco factor&#x2014;perfect for an era powdered in cocaine. The cover became their first hit. If you&apos;ve heard this song, you&apos;ve likely heard Odyssey&apos;s version. At the time it was featured in <em>Eyes of Laura Mars</em> and on an episode of <em>Good Times</em>, a couple decades later it turned up in the feature film <em>54</em>, and more recently it&apos;s been in commercials for Jimmy Fallon&apos;s <em>Tonight Show</em>, and the soundtrack for <em>The Nanny Diaries</em>.</p>

<p>Esther Phillips also took a shot, in 1978, before we hit a decade of zero &quot;Native New Yorker&quot; covers in the 1980s.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, it was back. The group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172028/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(band)">Black Box</a> released their own version of the song around 1997, complete with a video showing a little native New Yorker wandering around the streets alone:</p>

<p>The video&apos;s imagery was <em>sort of</em> fitting to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172028/http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7745">the lyrics of the song</a>, which note that natives should not have some sort of doe-eyed, Broadway musical view of love (or, presumably, life)&#x2014;&quot;It&apos;s a song about disillusionment that captures the downside of the self-reliant New York lifestyle.&quot; You&apos;re on your own, and as the song says: &quot;you should know the score by now, you&apos;re a native New Yorker.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s difficult tracking down any critical reception this song and its covers received, but people on Twitter sure love it: </p>

<p>It&apos;s worth pointing out that no one who ever performed the song professionally was a native New Yorker, though at least one of the original writers was (before he moved to Maryland).</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172028/https://play.google.com/music/preview/Txemrt4p26ieec6z3p2apfasqa4?lyrics=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=lyrics&amp;pcampaignid=kp-lyrics&amp;u=0#">the lyrics</a>: </p>

<p>&quot;Native New Yorker&quot;</p>

<p><em>New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh</em></p><em>

<p>Runnin&apos; pretty, New York City girl<br>
Twenty-five, thirty-five<br>
Hello, baby, New York City girl</p>

<p>You grew up ridin&apos; the subways, running with people<br>
Up in Harlem, down on Broadway<br>
You&apos;re no tramp, but you&apos;re no lady, talkin&apos; that street talk<br>
You&apos;re the heart and soul of New York City</p>

<p>And love, love is just a passing word<br>
It&apos;s the thought you had in a taxi cab that got left on the curb<br>
When he dropped you off and he stated firm</p>

<p>Oh, oh, oh [Oh, oh, oh]<br>
You&apos;re a native New Yorker<br>
You should know the score by now [You should know by now]<br>
You&apos;re a native New Yorker</p>

<p>New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh</p>

<p>Music plays, everyone&apos;s dancin&apos; closer and closer<br>
Makin&apos; friends and findin&apos; lovers<br>
There you are lost in the shadows, searchin&apos; for someone [Searchin&apos; for<br>
someone]<br>
To set you free from New York City</p>

<p>And, whoa, where did all those yesterdays go<br>
When you still believed love could really be like a Broadway show<br>
You are the star, win the applause</p>

<p>Oh, oh, oh [Oh, oh, oh]<br>
You&apos;re a native New Yorker<br>
No one opens the door<br>
For a native New Yorker</p>

<p>Native, native, native New Yorker</p>

<p>Where did all those yesterdays go<br>
When you still believed love could really be like a Broadway show<br>
You are the star</p>

<p>You&apos;re a native New Yorker<br>
You should know the score by now<br>
You&apos;re a native New Yorker</p>

<p>You should know the score, you should know the score by now<br>
You&apos;re a native New Yorker, oh, oh, oh<br>
[Native, native, native new Yorker]<br>
You&apos;re a native New Yorker</p>

<p>Whoa, oh, ho, ho, you&apos;re a native New Yorker<br>
You should know the score<br>
[Native, native, native new Yorker]<br>
You&apos;re a native New Yorker</p>

</em><p><em>What you waitin&apos; for, no one opens the door<br>
[You&apos;re a native New Yorker]<br>
For a native, for a native New Yorker</em></p>
