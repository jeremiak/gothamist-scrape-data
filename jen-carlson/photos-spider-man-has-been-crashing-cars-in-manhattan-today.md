<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103425/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1872181/"><em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</em></a>, coming out next year&#x2014;a full decade after <em>Spider-Man 2</em>&#x2014;has been filming around New York City under the name <em>London Calling</em> for a few weeks now. Today the cast and crew dropped into the Flatiron to film a scene that involves a sedan smashing into the top of a yellow cab (kudos for not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103425/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/green_screen_nyc.php#photo-1">using a green screen</a>). A tipster told us this morning:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They closed Eisenberg&apos;s for three days to film inside of it. I happen to be so lucky as to work above Eisenberg&apos;s, at 173 Fifth Avenue. THEY&apos;RE DROPPING A CAR FROM A CRANE. No sight of Andrew Garfield or Emma Stone yet.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The real action started just before 3 p.m., when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103425/https://twitter.com/JoeHubrich">one onlooker</a> snapped these shots of the car being dropped onto the cab, Tweeting: &quot;this was so loud that my dog freaked out when the top car fell.&quot; As for the Eisenberg&apos;s backdrop, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103425/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/03/04/15-photos-from-the-set-of-the-amazing-spider-man-2-in-nyc/">one fan</a> has noted that this is where Mary Jane Watson (played by Shailene Woodley) is a waitress in the upcoming movie... so don&apos;t expect to see Emma Stone around there today.</p>
