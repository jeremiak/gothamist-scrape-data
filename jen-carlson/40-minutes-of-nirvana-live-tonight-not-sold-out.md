                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="NIRVANASNL0813.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034937im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/NIRVANASNL0813.jpg" width="640" height="440" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Tonight at 10 p.m., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034937/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/15/nycs_new_movie_mecca_williamsburg.php#photo-5">Williamsburg&apos;s Spectacle Theater</a> will screen 40-minutes of rare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034937/http://gothamist.com/tags/nirvana">Nirvana</a> footage. They describe the project&#x2014;named after the B-side to &quot;Pennyroyal Tea,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034937/http://www.spectacletheater.com/remix-to-cognition/#hate"><em>I Hate Myself And I Want To Die</em></a>&#x2014;as a biographical story of the band &quot;through the media detritus left in Kurt Cobain&apos;s wake.&quot; The narrative-compilation was created out of &quot;lost interviews, rabid fan tributes, insensitive true-crime shows, crushing live footage, and even Kurt&#x2019;s long-lost 1984 homemade horror film, <em>Horror Movies</em>.&quot; Here&apos;s the trailer from when they tried this out last year:</p>

<p>Later this year <em>In Utero</em> will turn 20 years old, and <em>Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!</em> (the VHS that you made your parents watch so they&apos;d &quot;get&quot; you) will turn 19:</p>
