<p>Sometimes you just want to map out your walk to Trader Joe&apos;s and see exactly what it will be like before actually doing it yourself IRL... but the street view journey isn&apos;t a very smooth one. So much clicking and accidental zooms! But now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114521/http://hyperlapse.tllabs.io/">Hyperlapse</a> is here. The web app will create a motion control time-lapse using Google Street View imagery, allowing for a smooth cyber ride. Soon we won&apos;t have to go outside at all! Take a tutorial below, and go back and forth on the Manhattan Bridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114521/http://hyperlapse.tllabs.io/#40.71416000000001,-73.99464,40.706719106495115,-74.01160506788938,40.70447,-73.98914000000002,7.207500000000021,79.15625">right here</a>.</p>
