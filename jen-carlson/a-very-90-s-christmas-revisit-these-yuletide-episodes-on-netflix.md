<p>Remember the Christmas episodes of television shows past? <em>Remember when Robert Downey, Jr. was Ally McBeal&apos;s boyfriend?</em> The 1990s brought many great yuletide moments to the small screen, and you can revisit most of them on Netflix. Call your friends up on your Zack Morris phone and invite them over for a night of Kevin Arnold, Angela Chase, and Fox Mulder&#x2014;you can scroll down for our favorite Christmas episodes... though, sadly, <em>Seinfeld</em> isn&apos;t on Netflix so the list is lacking in Festivus action.</p>
