<p>Note to maudlin, post-punk, goth-rockers, it&apos;s time to bust out the black eyeliner: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062641/http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/167985/9">The Cure is coming to town</a> (and they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062641/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP7cb290f5e67942fabe88c57bbf6aaec8.html">just got nominated</a> to the Rock n&apos; Roll Hall of Fame). And they&apos;re bringing original keyboardist Roger O&apos;Donnell with them (he was fired in 2005, but on September 11th of this year he announced he rejoined the band). They&apos;ll be setting up shop at Beacon Theater on November 25th, 26th, and 27th&#x2014;playing their first three albums in full (they&apos;re also doing this iin London and LA). Tickets go on sale on Halloween, at 10 a.m. While we wait... check out Robert Smith in a Rangers jersey during a Radio City Music Hall show in 1996.</p>
