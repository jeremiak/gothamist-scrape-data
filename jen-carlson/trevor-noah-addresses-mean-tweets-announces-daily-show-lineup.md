<p>Trevor Noah, one of the many men in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223232039/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/15/trevor_noah_titans_take.php">the all-male world</a> of late night television will take his seat at <em>The Daily Show</em> next week. Comedy Central just announced his first round of guests, who will begin to file in on September 28th, and look there&apos;s one woman included! From their press release:</p>

<ul><li>September 28: actor/comedian Kevin Hart, &quot;What Now? Tour&quot;
</li><li>September 29: Whitney Wolfe, founder and CEO of Bumble
</li><li>September 30: Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ), Republican Presidential Candidate
</li><li>October 1: musician Ryan Adams, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223232039/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/21/welcome_to_1989_ryan_adams.php">1989</a>&quot;</li></ul>

<p>The musician&apos;s PR team also set out a press release announcing the appearance: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;In the wake of Ryan Adams&#x2019; full album cover of Taylor Swift&apos;s <em>1989</em> rising to #2 on the iTunes chart, it has been confirmed that Ryan will be the first ever musical guest on Trevor Noah&#x2019;s premiere week hosting <em>The Daily Show</em>. Ryan will be the sole guest on the October 1 broadcast.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Back to Noah, who, let&apos;s not forget, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223232039/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/31/daily_show_trevor_nooooah.php">was kind of a jerk on Twitter</a> in the past&#x2014;he addressed this in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223232039/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/arts/television/trevor-noah-daily-show-jon-stewart.html">a NY Times interview</a> this week:</p>

<blockquote>To clean up your social media, what are you cleaning? When we hired the new correspondents at the show, they asked me, &#x201C;Have we checked their social media?&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;This is a good exercise: You go through every single tweet and tell me what you think we should get rid of.&#x201D; And people came back to me: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, is this offensive? Is this not offensive? Is this bad?&#x201D; Exactly. You do not know what may or may not offend somebody. People go, &#x201C;Trevor, you should clean your tweets.&#x201D; I go, I cleaned my life &#x2014; I tried to grow as a human being. Someone goes, &#x201C;Yeah, but you wrote this in 2009.&#x201D; I go, well, thank God I didn&#x2019;t write it in 2015. That to me is progress.</blockquote>The tweets mostly targeted Jews and women and Jewish women, and continued for years past 2009.
