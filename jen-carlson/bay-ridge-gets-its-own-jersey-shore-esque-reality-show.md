<p>Snooki &amp; Co. have gotten a little <em>too</em> mainstream, so it&apos;s time to get back to the roots of scripted reality television, with some fresh meat. The latest in the attempt to recreate the &quot;magic&quot; of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224234417/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> comes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224234417/http://features.oxygen.com/outloud/blog/entertainment/oxygens-so-new-series-brooklyn-11223-in-the-new-york-post">from the Oxygen network</a>, who are pointing their cameras at a group of girls from Bay Ridge. The show will be called <em>Brooklyn 11223</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224234417/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/it_klyn_shore_AbtrBI1OwJRVqTD7NBTgpO#ixzz1mxppnbiQ">the NY Post</a> reports that it will follow a &quot;once tightknit group of girls from the Brooklyn &#x2019;hood [who] are still at each other&#x2019;s throats over an alleged heinous act of betrayal years ago.&quot; Spoiler: there will probably be hair pulling.</p>

<p>The show will start airing on March 26th, and will feature feisty ladies like Christie Maria Livoti, a 23-year-old &quot;who is as tough as the R train.&quot; Apparently some guy named Joey Lynn did her wrong, and now her and her pals keep running into him on 4th Avenue. The loose theme of the show is &quot;betrayal,&quot; and producer Michael Hirschorn says that it really brings out &#x201C;The Bay Ridgeness [of the characters].&quot;</p>

<p>Will it do better than the Brighton Beach answer to <em>Jersey Shore</em>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224234417/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/24/video_brighton_beach_the_brooklyn_r.php"><em>Russian Dolls</em></a>?</p>
