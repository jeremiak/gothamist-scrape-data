title: Watch Hanksy & Co Take Over This Abandoned East Village Building
---

	
										<p>In December, street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064017/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a> held a &quot;building destruction party&quot; inside of an abandoned brownstone in the East Village, which himself and other artists temporarily, and illegally, took over. Later that month, via a word of mouth invitation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064017/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/11/photos_inside_an_abandoned_east_vil.php">another party was held</a> so that others could see the work of the 40+ artists inside&#x2014;the show was called Surplus Candy, and it was one-night-only. Below, you can watch how it all came together:</p>

<p>Hanksy, who was just the subject of a fancy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064017/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/nyregion/a-parodist-who-calls-himself-hanksy.html">NY Times profile</a>, tells us he&apos;ll be &quot;crisscrossing the lower 48 for the next six months or so. Making jumps from city to city. Then closing out 2014 with two very large NYC-centric projects.&quot; So if you missed this one, there&apos;s more to come...</p>
