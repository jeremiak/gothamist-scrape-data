<p>Since Zosia and Clara Mamet practically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082846/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/icymi_zosia_mamets_kickstarter_proj.php"><em>lost money</em></a> on their Kickstarter campaign, which aimed to raise <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082846/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/the_best_one_tip_we_have_for_zosia.php">$32,000 to make one music video</a> for their band, The Cabin Sisters, they&apos;re slumming it in the city&apos;s small venues. Where they are probably making a lot more money than your friend&apos;s band. Over the weekend the girls played two shows, one at Pianos on the LES, and the other at Grand Victory in Williamsburg. Here&apos;s what you missed:</p>

<p>We planned on attending last night&apos;s Pianos show, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082846/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/15/photos_massive_trayvon_martin_rally.php">something more important came up</a>. So here are the thoughts we had after watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082846/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2013/07/watch-zosia-mamet-of-girls-play-with-some-fake-boobs/">Bedford + Bowery&apos;s video</a> from Saturday night&apos;s Williamsburg show. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082846/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen Carlson</a>: I feel like this drummer is super bad<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082846/http://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a>:  Drummer actually ain&apos;t that bad, I think the singing is milquetoast and mealy. Like, of COURSE this is what it would sound like.<br>
Jen:  Yeah, a very &quot;Rich Bored Manhattan Girls Go To Family&apos;s Cabin In The Woods For A Weekend, Find Thrift Store&quot; sound.<br>
Chris: I didn&apos;t hear a single note come out of that fucking banjo either. IT&apos;S A PROP.<br>
Jen: In the other video she&apos;s not even using it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082846/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake</a>:  Just being sad doesn&apos;t make you Nico. Oh girl&#x2014;hot pants on a tall stool?  More like Cameltoe sisters, amiright?<br>
Jen: Would you go see them live?<br>
Jake:  Listen, if I want to see an actress in hotpants get down with a banjo, I&apos;ve got Jenny Lewis.<br>
