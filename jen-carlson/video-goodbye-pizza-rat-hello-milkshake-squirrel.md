<p>Now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918130507/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">#PizzaRat</a> has skyrocketed to international fame, NYC&apos;s lesser-known creatures are trying to hitch their wagon to a viral star. After all, in just 24 hours #PizzaRat has gotten a book deal, dated a Kardashian, written a Goodbye To All That essay, and moved to Hollywood, where he&apos;s set to make his directorial debut on the adaptation of his forthcoming memoir (June, 2016). </p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to recreate the success of #PizzaRat, but godammit if Milkshake Squirrel isn&apos;t giving it his best shot. </p>

<p>Check this guy out, he&apos;s more excited than a junkie who just uncovered a trash stash. You&apos;ll be disappointed he doesn&apos;t use the straw, but trust us, it all pays off when he dives into the cup head first. </p>
