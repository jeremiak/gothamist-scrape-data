<p>A former cabbie (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016162903/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/11/eavesdrop_on_these_cab_conversation.php">this guy again</a>) who is trying to promote his book got back behind the wheel recently and has just released a &quot;shock video&quot; that shows him picking up passengers who are unaware there&apos;s A GODDAMN GIANT SNAKE IN THE CAB. Hahahaha LOL got ophidiophobia? Too late cab&apos;s already moving you can&apos;t escape. </p>

<p>Jimmy Failla&apos;s book publicist insists this is no hoax&#x2014;we were told, &quot;The snake was real and nothing was scripted. Jimmy said they got releases from everyone afterward.&quot; Thankfully, Failla doesn&apos;t drive a cab full time anymore, but &quot;occasionally will get behind the wheel every now and then &apos;for fun.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Watch below as he has &quot;fun&quot; surprising New Yorkers with a 14-foot Burmese python, which slinks into the backseat of the moving cab with them&#x2014;as the press release puts it, &quot;screams and panic attacks ensue.&quot; Hilarious.</p>
