He therefore does what every other normal dumpee would do: he goes to New York and sets up house in the abandoned building opposite his ex-girlfriend\'s apartment, intent on winning her back and waiting until she decides to leave her current lover.\" Meg Ryan\'s character quickly joins him and rom com hilarity ensues (or not). Even when Meg Ryan isn\'t playing a rich lady she scores an amazing loft! Albeit, a fixer-upper.\r\n\<p\>\r\n\<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rxrkoapzNU8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\>\<\/iframe\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_6'] = photo;</script>
