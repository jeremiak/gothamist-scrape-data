<p>It&apos;s hot, it&apos;s summer, it&apos;s a Friday... that means you&apos;ll likely be seeing plenty of news outlets testing out the &quot;frying an egg on the sidewalk&quot; schtick today, and you <em>might</em> even spot a &quot;sunny side up&quot; pun. We chose to stay indoors because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713050305/http://www.billnye.com/so-hot-you-could-fry-an-egg/">Bill Nye</a> the Science Guy says this process could take about 22 minutes at 130 degrees, but we did venture over to YouTube for some visuals&#x2014;check it out: an egg frying under the sun, <em>and it only took 120 minutes.</em></p>

<p>If you try this, leave the bacon inside... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713050305/http://republicofbacon.com/2011/07/22/can-bacon-be-cooked-on-the-sidewalk/">it&apos;ll only get dried out</a> under the sun.</p>
