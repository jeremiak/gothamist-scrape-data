<p>Can everyone go and give Gus the polar bear a little love this week? The Central Park Zoo bear lost the love of his life, Ida, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424013413/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/04/ida_the_central_park_polar_bear_die.php">last week</a>, and he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424013413/http://gothamist.com/2003/03/24/gus_the_formerly_depressed_polar_bear.php">already been depressed</a> enough in the past, being dubbed the &quot;bipolar bear.&quot; Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424013413/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/after-24-years-suddenly-alone-at-the-central-park-zoo/">CityRoom</a> reports that Gus is all alone, and and expert tells them, &#x201C;For any animal that forms a close bond with another one, there would be some sense of loss.&#x201D; Ida was his companion for 24 years.</p>

<p>So far, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society, Gus seems to be doing just fine, but they&apos;re keeping a close eye on him. One vet says, &#x201C;We really have to see how this goes.&#x201D; So far he&apos;s done everything from swim laps, drift in the water, and sit silently, not touching his toys. </p>

<p>As for Ida&apos;s remains, they plan to cremate her, keeping some tissue samples to study. As for Gus, maybe some more presents could help:</p>
