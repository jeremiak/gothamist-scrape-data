<p>Usually the animal activists are the ones tossing the red paint, but last night a woman&apos;s home was targeted, allegedly because she&apos;s the founding member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727092016/http://endchickensaskaporos.com/">Alliance to End Chickens as Kaporos</a> (which is the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727092016/http://gothamist.com/tags/kaparot">chicken sacrificing ritual</a> performed around Yom Kippur). Rina Deych told us:</p>

<blockquote>I have our banner hanging on the second floor of my 3-family house in Brooklyn.  When my son came home at 11:30 this evening (11/13/2010),  he woke me up to inform me that someone had splattered red paint all over our front door and porch. Although we suspected it was anger at our banner, we weren&apos;t sure until, while giving a police report, we noticed that someone had painted our sign with a roller. 

<p>Freedom of speech is legal.  Destruction of private property is not. This act of vandalism is particularly troubling&#x2014;especially since it was clearly done by so-called religious people.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Deych has called the Shomrim, who &quot;said they could probably not help.&quot; While the paint doesn&apos;t seem to be <em>that</em> plentiful, she also noted that she and her son are asthmatic &quot;and these fumes are detrimental to us and to our rescued animals.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Deych tells us there were &quot;at least two quarts of paint&quot; used in the attack; below is some video she took of the damage:</p>
