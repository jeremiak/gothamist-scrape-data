The 11-story tower at the corner of Broadway and 49th Street has been churning out the hits since the early 1930s, becoming familiar stomping grounds for many music industry bigwigs and <em>still</em> housing the office of Mr. Paul Simon. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050320/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brill_hittin_high_5F6hRqVdWdcEBtVmcNAoQL">the NY Post</a>, there&apos;s even a &quot;Brill Building Sound, named for the stream of pop hits of the late 1950s and 1960s written by an army of songwriters crammed into the building.&quot; Some fun facts: Elvis&apos;s hits &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; were written there, and Jay-Z and Alicia Keys&apos; &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot; was recorded there. Back in the day, it served as an all-access pass to the music industry. You could write a song, shop it, and record it all without stepping outside.</p>

<p>The LPC&apos;s Robert Tierney said, &quot;This legendary building is as closely linked to American music as Hollywood is to film. It&apos;s also a standout because it&apos;s one of the few art deco buildings ever constructed in Times Square.&quot;</p>
