<p>Soon the artwork of Thom Yorke, Jay-Z, and others will be looming over New York City, as the non-profit organization Word Above The Street has signed the two on to help transform water tanks in New York City. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120223223030/http://www.galleristny.com/2012/02/jay-z-ed-ruscha-and-thom-yorke-to-design-water-tanks-in-new-york/">GalleristNY</a>, the 12-week project will take on 300 of New York&#x2019;s water towers, turning them all into public artworks. From the project&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120223223030/https://www.facebook.com/TheWaterTankProject">Facebook page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Grounded in the inspirational power of public art, The Water Tank Project will inspire millions of people to be more responsible with water in their daily lives. Carefully selected rooftop water tanks across the city will be temporarily wrapped with original artwork on the subject of water. Celebrating the talents of established artists, emerging artists and even New York City school students, The Water Tank Project will reshape the city skyline.</blockquote>
