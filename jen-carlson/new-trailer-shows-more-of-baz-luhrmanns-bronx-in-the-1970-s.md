<p>Our first look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025112443/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/05/baz_luhrmann_netflix.php">Baz Luhrmann&apos;s</a> take on the Bronx in 1977 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025112443/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/1970s_bronx_by_baz.php">was pretty music-centric</a>, which is fitting given it takes place during the days between disco&apos;s death knell and the birth of hip-hop. But in this new trailer for his upcoming Netflix series, <em>The Get Down</em>, we get a better look at the characters and their storylines. The series aims to show the birth of hip-hop, as &quot;a mythic saga of how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025112443/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/20_minutes_in_1970s_nyc.php#photo-1">New York at the brink of bankruptcy</a> gave birth to a new art form,&quot; and will do so through a cast of characters including two South Bronx high schoolers and Grandmaster Flash. </p>

<p>The first six episodes of the show come out August 12th (with more rolling out next year), and it already looks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025112443/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/16/vinyl_history_scorsese.php">better than <em>Vinyl</em></a>.</p>
