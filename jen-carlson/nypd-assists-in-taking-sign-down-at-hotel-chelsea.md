Tenant Arthur Nash had it hanging outside of his room, but at approximately 8:45 a.m. the &quot;kinda-sorta manager Arnold Tamasar&quot; took it down as a police officer and a security guard stood by. They report that &quot;the cop&#x2019;s explanation for allowing the sign&#x2019;s removal was that only the owners of a building are allowed to hang signs on the fa&#xE7;ade. This is open to debate, and in fact it was being discussed with various city agencies. The cop further stated that, since Arthur didn&#x2019;t have a door to the balcony (like many residents, he climbs through his window), he was not allowed go onto the balcony at all.&quot; Did the NYPD have a right to assist the hotel management in what the residents are calling &quot;a suppression of Nash&#x2019;s first amendment rights&quot;?</p>
