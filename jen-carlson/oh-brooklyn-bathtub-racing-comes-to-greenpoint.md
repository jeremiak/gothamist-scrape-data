<p>This seems a lot more entertaining/dangerous than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171615/http://gothamist.com/tags/idiotarod">Idiotarod</a>. This Saturday the Greenpoint Lions invite you to McGolrick Park for an early morning bathtub race! Their flyer, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171615/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/greenpoint-goodness/?p=66658">Miss Heather</a>, describes the event:</p>

<blockquote>Cast iron bathtubs mounted to frames with casters (wheels). Each bathtub team (three members) has two members in the tub steering with plungers and pushed by the third member. With only two tubs raced at a time, the competition is fierce, and the tossing of water balloons and the use of water pistols is used against the opposing tub.</blockquote>

<p>Don&apos;t have a bathtub? Surely you can find one on the street.</p>
