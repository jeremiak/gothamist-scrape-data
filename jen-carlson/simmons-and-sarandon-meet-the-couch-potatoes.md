<p>To kick off the weekend, Richard Simmons visited the team of folks participating in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050701/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/02/movie_watching_marathon.php">movie-watching marathon</a> (check out Crazy Legs Conti!). Simmons served up some &quot;heart-healthy energy foods&quot; and taught them how to do exercises while seated in their lounge chairs. Since Thursday the eight contestants have been slackin&apos; off and watching flicks in an attempt to break a world record, and take home some cash.</p>

<p>So far, 50 or so movies have been watched, and several competitors have been cut...including New York&apos;s very own couch potato. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050701/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/10/05/2008-10-05_new_york_citys_best_couch_potato_default.html">The Daily News</a> reports &quot;Jerry Cavallaro, 20, of Staten Island was bounced from a movie-watching championship in Times Square Sunday morning after he looked away from the screen.&quot; For those who hold out until Tuesday, the final movie, <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>, will be delivered by Susan Sarandon herself! </p>
