title: Photos: These Jail Cells Are Nicer Than Your Apartment
---

	
										<p>In Germany, photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317060217/http://www.juergenchill.com/photography/zellen/about_zellen.htm">Juergen Chill</a> has captured aerial views of modern day cells in the country, which all look like they came out of an IKEA catalog. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317060217/http://www.juergenchill.com/photography/zellen/z_02.htm">are those ripe, plump tomatoes</a> across from the flat screen TV? Meanwhile, over in Norway, you get shipped to an island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317060217/http://www.takepart.com/photos/worlds-most-luxurious-prisons/bastoy-prison-norway">to work on your tan</a> while serving out your time. What we&apos;re saying is, sometimes jail cells are nicer than our cozy, quaint, charming little apartments that we&apos;re working our asses off to pay the rent on here in New York. Below, a short visual history:</p>

<p>Al Capone served out time &quot;in relative luxury on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317060217/http://www.easternstate.org/visit/regular-season/history-artist-installations/al-capones-cell">Eastern State</a>&apos;s &apos;Park Avenue.&apos; His cell had oriental rugs, fine furniture, and a cabinet radio.&quot; His charming living space also had a skylight, and would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317060217/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/443175115539644416">likely rent for</a> around $1,800/month in Brooklyn today.</p>

<p>This photo shows actress Bebe Daniels in her cell in 1921, when she spent nine days locked up inside of the old Orange County Jail in Santa Ana for speeding. (As noted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317060217/http://www.ocsheriffmuseum.com/bebe.html">the Orange County Sheriff&apos;s Museum</a>, this may have been a reenactment of her in the cell.) While there she received flowers, had her room furnished by local businesses, had gourmet meals sent in, and an orchestra serenade her outside of her cell window. Orchestra! WINDOW!</p>
