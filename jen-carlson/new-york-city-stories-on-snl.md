Saturday Night Live came through this weekend with some &quot;New York City Stories&quot;, shorts of the city (a contiuous joke in all of them being how things used to be, ie: &quot;We used to live in this mailbox for $2 a day!&quot;). These were pretty much the only entertaining parts of the show, however. 

</p><p>Our favorite was the CBGB short featuring &quot;Lou Reed&quot; and &quot;Patti Smith&quot;, but since that isn&apos;t up on YouTube yet, check out the above one featuring &quot;Martin Scorsese&quot; and &quot;Rosie Perez&quot;. </p>
