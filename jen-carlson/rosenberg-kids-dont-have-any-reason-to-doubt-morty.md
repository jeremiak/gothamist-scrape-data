Julius and Ethel&apos;s sons, Robert and Michael, say they have no reason to doubt &quot;Morty.&quot;  The Times adds &quot;whatever atomic bomb information their father passed to the Russians was, at best, superfluous; the case was riddled with prosecutorial and judicial misconduct; their mother was convicted on flimsy evidence to place leverage on her husband; and neither deserved the death penalty.&quot;</p>
