They sure are. Pack your bags, we&apos;re all moving to Cleveland! According to new reports, some New York artists are fleeing to there after getting priced out of the boroughs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034754/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/12/nyc-artists-migrating-to-the-cleve">Animal</a> notes that it&apos;s not &quot;a full-fledged trend yet,&quot; but it <em>is</em> getting media attention.</p>

<p>One relocated artist told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034754/http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=161580&amp;catid=45">WKYC</a> that in New York, &quot;you&#x2019;re losing the sense of community and working together&#x2026; Cleveland is a great place for art. There&#x2019;s a lot of culture and diversity here. You still get the big city feel.&#x201D; It also has this charming nickname: the Mistake by the Lake.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034754/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/micropolis/2010/nov/15/artists-flee-nyc-less-funding-same-high-rents/">WNYC</a> report pointed out that artists aren&apos;t just fleeing New York, but &quot;artists fresh out of art schools around the country are choosing to live in nascent artist communities in regional cities like Detroit and Cleveland&#x2014;which are dangling incentives to attract this group&#x2014;and bypassing New York altogether.&quot; Guess <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034754/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/22/the_art_scene_moves_to_newark.php">Newark</a> just isn&apos;t cutting it for this new lot of young creatives. We await the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034754/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/11/williamsburg.php">Cleveland-branded Camel</a>...</p>
