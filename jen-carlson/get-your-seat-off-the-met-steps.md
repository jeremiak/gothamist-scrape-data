Even tourists taking photos with the famous backdrop are getting booted.</p>

<p>How are people reacting to the change? Reportedly the museum staffers are quite busy shooing resting folks away all day -- some who oblige, some who do not. One visitor told CityRoom, &quot;New York is no fun anymore. Has it gotten so sanitized and tame that you can&#x2019;t do anything? Sitting on these steps is part of living in New York.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172051/http://www.nysun.com/arts/stepping-up-at-the-metropolitan/79182/">The NY Sun</a> chimes in with some history of the steps, noting that they were originally designed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172051/http://jssgallery.org/Paintings/Richard_Morris_Hunt.htm">Richard Morris Hunt</a> in the late 1800s and were far smaller, however, &quot;during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172051/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hoving">the Hoving era</a>, when the Met began to embrace an ever-expanding and increasingly populist audience for fine art, the museum wisely broadened the steps and thus transformed its entrance into one of New York&apos;s finest public spaces.&quot; This time around the steps are undergoing &quot;cleaning, restoring, and rethermalizing.&quot;</p>

<p>Met spokeswoman Elyse Topalian explained the abundance of &quot;pleasant seating space in the museum, including courtyards with art as well as seating.&quot;</p>
