<p>In 2007 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724054842/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/07/adam_horovitz_m.php">we interviewed</a> Adam &quot;Ad-Rock&quot; Horovitz, who introduced us to Watch Parties. Since then we&apos;ve been invited to our fair share of Watch Parties, and totally &quot;get them,&quot; but 2007 was a different time... a more innocent time, a time when our inboxes had less invites in them. Anyway, if you haven&apos;t yet been enlightened about Watch Parties, here is how Horovitz described them to us, through an anecdote about someone we are <em>still</em> not familiar with:</p>

<p><strong>Adam Horovitz:</strong> Willa Sands. I don&#x2019;t know if she&#x2019;s on anymore. It was a cable show and her main thing was gala events; she would go to gala events and film them for her cable show. You know, book signings, wine and cheese events, watch parties, you know, that kind of thing.<br>
<strong>John Del Signore:</strong> Watch parties?<br>
<strong>AH:</strong> You know; watch parties!<br>
<strong>JDS:</strong> I don&#x2019;t know what that is. <br>
<strong>AH</strong> You know, where a new expensive watch is out and they have a party and Brendan Fraser goes.<br>
<strong>JDS:</strong> Oh. I guess I haven&#x2019;t been invited to one of those. <br>
<strong>AH:</strong> I haven&#x2019;t either but I&#x2019;ve seen them in magazines.</p>

<p>This is all a mostly unnecessary, but totally entertaining, way of telling you that you can now procure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724054842/http://beastieboys.com/">a limited edition </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724054842/http://gothamist.com/tags/beastieboys">Beastie Boys</a> watch for $75 (the same ones that were released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724054842/http://www.ablogtowatch.com/nixon-watches-teams-up-with-the-beastie-boys/">in 2011</a> with Nixon), with all proceeds benefiting the newly dedicated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724054842/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/mca_photos.php#photo-1">Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn Heights</a>. And because they&apos;re keeping it real, there&apos;s no Watch Party to accompany the announcement&#x2014;just pick a color, make your payment, and sport the dopest watch in the five boroughs.</p>
