<p>Jealous of neighbors who get to live on streets called Sutton Place and Beekman Place, the residents of the Southgate co-op on 52nd Street would like to class up their block&apos;s name. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131151254/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/nyregion/on-a-numbered-street-apartment-owners-yearn-for-more-cachet.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;seid=auto">the NY Times</a>, some shareholders at the co-op&#x2014;which stands between Sutton Place South at 53rd street and Beekman Place on 51st&#x2014;want to ditch the number 52 and rename their block something a bit more elegant. Rich people!</p>

<p>At a recent meeting, a real estate lawyer planted the seed, saying &quot;I know a way to raise the value of all our apartments that won&#x2019;t cost us any money.&quot; (Currently two-bedroom apartments there go for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131151254/http://www.elliman.com/new-york-city/manhattan/sutton-area/434-east-52nd-street--6e---southgate/zyyjivq">over $1 million</a>.) After that, the movement gained momentum. But can they actually <em>rename</em> the block? The paper points out that ceremonial second names are often given to street blocks (and even that&apos;s become increasingly more difficult), but rarely does a block&apos;s name actually change. </p>

<p>If they manage to wade through all the red tape, what will they call it? A name hasn&apos;t been voted on just yet, but word is that &quot;River Place&quot; is at the top of the list.</p>
