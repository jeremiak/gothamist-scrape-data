</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s been a lot of talk about giving parts of the BQE a makeover (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115147/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/bqe_1.php">a park</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115147/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/09/will_the_bqe_silencer_happen_in_our.php?gallery0Pic=1">a silencer</a>)&#x2014;and last night there was a meeting concerning how to &quot;fix the ditch.&quot; Or, rather, a meeting about how to pay for the grandiose visions that have been proposed (the cheapest of the three plans is $10MM).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115147/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/47/dtg_bqetrenchfix_2010_11_19_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, options range from building six lightweight bike/pedestrian bridges over the ditch (the sunken section over Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill and the Columbia Street Waterfront District), to a massive tree-planting effort, to constructing an iconic, $85 million, energy-generating &#x201C;green canopy.&quot;</p>

<p>Residents are all for greening up the eyesore, but is it just a pipe dream? The concepts come from a plan led by the Economic Development Corporation&#x2014;ultimately they&apos;d like to achieve one of these options in a cost effective way sometime over the next 10 years.
