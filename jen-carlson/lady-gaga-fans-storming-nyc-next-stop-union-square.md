Currently her army of followers are camped outside of Rockefeller Center attempting to get stand-by tickets to SNL, which she&apos;ll be performing on tomorrow night. The fans have been camped out since Tuesday (related: it has been raining since Tuesday!), and at one point Gaga sent over pizzas to keep them nourished. One hopeful gal told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521144116/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2011/05/20/2011-05-20_lady_gaga_fans_camp_outside_saturday_night_live_for_days_in_hopes_to_score_ticke.html#ixzz1MvcPhb3G">the Daily News</a>, &quot;We are SNL fans and Lady Gaga is our idol.

Then on Monday morning starting at 8 a.m., the first 450 people to purchase a special edition 2 CD set of <em>Born This Way</em> and to do a free mobile phone upgrade check at the Best Buy store will receive a wristband for an opportunity to get an autograph at the event. It&apos;s time to jump through some hoops, monsters!
