										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="TFFrushtix.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235850im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/TFFrushtix.jpg" width="278" height="350"> <br> <i style=" width:278px; ;display:block"> Photo by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235850/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/365382951/">Wally G</a></i></div> The Tribeca Film Festival kicks off tonight (with the much-anticipated premiere of Tom Berninger&apos;s <em>Mistaken For Strangers</em> documentary*), and in case you are under the impression you can&apos;t get into the screenings without a magical pass or tickets you purchased <em>forever ago</em>... we&apos;re here to tell you that you can still get in to screenings (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235850/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/what_to_see_at_tribeca_film_festiva.php">check these out</a>), and you can even get into screenings that are listed as sold out... because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235850/http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/blogs/tff-never-sold-out">there is no such thing as sold out at Tribeca Film Fest</a>.<p></p>

<p>For the hardcore film nerd, show up to the screening you want to attend about 45 minutes before the start time. The TFF site explains:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Screenings and events that have no more advance tickets available will be listed as RUSH TICKETS. Rush Ticket lines will form approximately 45 minutes prior to scheduled event times at the venue. Admission will begin approximately 15 minutes before program start time based on availability. Note: There is a 1 Rush Ticket limit per person. Rush Tickets are priced as noted above, except at the BMCC TribecaPAC Theater where all Rush Tickets for screenings will be $8, and Rush Tickets to Tribeca Talks programs will be $15.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>As with anything in life, there are no guarantees, but you&apos;ll likely get in. And it&apos;s worth noting that there are still many great movies, documentaries, and talks where there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235850/http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival">still tickets available</a>.</p>

<p><span class="photo_caption">*Note: There won&apos;t be any way to get into the opening night premiere of <em>Mistaken For Strangers</em>.</span></p>
