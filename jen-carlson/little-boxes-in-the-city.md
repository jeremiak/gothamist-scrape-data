title: Little Boxes in the City
---

<p>This month many have been fooled into thinking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2008/03/tiny-toronto-house-new-brooklyn-urban.html">this house</a>, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/http://www.thelittlehouse.ca/page1.aspx">in Toronto</a>, was actually in Brooklyn, NY. While the tiny abode is nowhere near any of the five boroughs, there are some little residential gems amongst us (albeit still bigger than most city apartments). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/http://www.liqcity.com/linkage/noguchi-museum-struggling-to-stay-above-ground-newtown-creek-cleanup.php">liQcity</a> points out &quot;The smallest house in Long Island City&quot; on Courthouse Sq, Hunters Point (pictured), and in the past we&apos;ve seen a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/09/boat_1.php">tiny houseboat in the Bronx</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/23/urban_hut_in_br.php">urban hut of Brooklyn</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/16/brooklyns_simpl.php">trailer of Willoughby Avenue</a> -- but there&apos;s surely some more little houses hiding out there. If you&apos;ve seen any, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send pics our way</a>, and in the meantime check out some more from the Bronx and the East Village in the gallery. </p>

<p>And don&apos;t forget, come July <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140530/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/08/prefab.php">these little guys</a> will be housed at MoMA.</p><div class="galleryEase" id="gallery-0">
