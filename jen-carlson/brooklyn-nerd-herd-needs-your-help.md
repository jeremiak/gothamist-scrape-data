Their one hurdle: money. The paper reports, &quot;Raising the necessary $7,000 might be the most daunting feat yet for four brainy kids&quot; who &quot;took the New York City FIRST Lego League Robotics Championship&quot; with their motorized robot called Thingamajig. Yesterday the Sheepshead Bay kids held a bakesale to help fund their trip, but only raised $800&#x2014;combine that with the $2,700 the school raised and you don&apos;t need a genius to tell you they are half way there. If you would like to make a donation, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324173318/http://www.stedmundelem.org/">call the school</a>.<p></p>
