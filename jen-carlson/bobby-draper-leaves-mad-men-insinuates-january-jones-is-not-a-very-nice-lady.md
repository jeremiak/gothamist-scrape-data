Different actors, different ages! It made no sense. Well, the third actor to portray Bobby Draper on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507111500/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507111500/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/s157/mad-men/news/a336420/mad-men-recasting-bobby-draper-for-new-season.html">has just quit</a>. And hell hath no fury like an 11 year old scorned! Upon his departure, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507111500/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2765519/">Jared Gilmore</a> advised his replacement via an interview with TV Guide: &quot;Be careful around January [Jones]. She&apos;s not as approachable as the others. She&apos;s really serious about what she does. [But] everyone else is so nice.&quot; Previously, Zach Galifianakis told Jones to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507111500/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/23/that_time_zach_galifianakis_told_ja.php">&quot;be fucking nice.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Gilmore left in order to take a recurring role on the ABC series <em>Once Upon A Time</em>. The new actor (yet to be cast) in Bobby&apos;s role is expected to appear in 7 of the 13 episodes next season, which will (hopefully!) begin in early 2012.</p>
