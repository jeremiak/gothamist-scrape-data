<p>If you stop by Professor Thom&apos;s on 2nd Avenue right now, or anytime through Sunday night, you&apos;ll find three former college pals on the balcony watching <em>Lost</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410205245/http://www.asylum.com/2010/05/21/new-yorkers-attempt-to-break-world-record-watching-entire-series/">Every episode</a>, from beginning to Sunday night&apos;s series finale. All in all that&apos;s 96 hours of being on (and sometimes off) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410205245/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/20/lost_on_the_upper_east_side.php">the island</a>, and we&apos;re guessing by now they&apos;ve already lost any ability to keep up with plotlines we can barely understand when we&apos;ve gotten 8 hours of sleep. Because... why else would they be totally ignoring the television?!</p>

<p>They&apos;re being sponsored by Rockstar Energy Drink and some terrifying thing called Awake gum, and are attempting to break the Guinness World Record for most consecutive hours spent watching television. That&apos;s pretty sad, but also, for a good cause! If they reach their goal, three charities will split $100K in donations&#x2014;you can donate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410205245/http://lostathon.com/">online</a> or by dropping by. And you guys, you can watch them watching the show LIVE... where they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410205245/http://www.livestream.com/lostathon">so not paying attention</a>.</p>
