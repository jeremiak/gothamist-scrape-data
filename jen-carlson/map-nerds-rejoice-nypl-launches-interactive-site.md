<p>This morning we looked at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201402/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/04/flashback_croton_reservoir.php">the Croton Reservoir</a>, where the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201402/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/05/nypl.php">New York Public Library&apos;s main branch</a> now sits. In the time that it&apos;s been there&#x2014;since the early 1900s&#x2014;the surface of New York City has continued to change. Luckily, the library is home to a massive collection <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201402/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/31/mapping_new_yorks_shoreline_1609-20.php">of maps</a>, which chart the changes of this city as well as other areas&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201402/http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/02/03/drawing-past-enlivening-study-historical-geography-mapsnyplorg">this week</a> they&apos;ve officially launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201402/http://maps.nypl.org/">maps.nypl.org</a>. The site also hosts &quot;a powerful set of tools designed to significantly enhance the way we access and use maps and the cartographic information they contain.&quot; Click! Zoom! Pan!</p>

<p>So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201402/http://maps.nypl.org/warper/">learn more about the georectification</a>, or &#x201C;warping&quot; process (tutorial after the jump) and make some cool maps!  Anyone can participate by creating an account on the site.</p>
