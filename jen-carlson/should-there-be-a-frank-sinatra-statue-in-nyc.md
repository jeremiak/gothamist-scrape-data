<p>Yesterday the daughter of the late great blue-eyed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150646/http://gothamist.com/tags/franksinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> took to Twitter to continue the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150646/http://sinatrafamily.com/forum/frank-sinatra-8/frank-sinatra-statue-times-square-project-24503/">ongoing campaign</a> to get a statue of her dad planted in New York City&#x2014;specifically, Times Square. Singer Nancy Sinatra directed the Tweet at Mayor Bloomberg, saying, &quot;please help us.&quot; </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Please tell Mayor Bloomberg we need a statue of Frank Sinatra in Times Square.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150646/https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg">@MikeBloomberg</a> Mr Mayor, please help us.</p>&#x2014; Nancy Sinatra (@NancySinatra) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150646/https://twitter.com/NancySinatra/statuses/359220412569227264">July 22, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>In 2011 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150646/http://sinatrafamily.com/forum/frank-sinatra-8/frank-sinatra-statue-times-square-project-24503/index15.html">she explained</a> the Sinatra family&apos;s efforts and hurdles: &quot;We were given stamps of approval from every department in the city, the DOT, the Arts Council who held a competition of New York local artists, the Mayor&apos;s office and the city engineers who checked the supports under the street to make sure they could handle the extra weight of the statue footprint. All of the T&apos;s were crossed and Is were dotted and, until we ran into the Broadway on Broadway gang, the statue was a done deal and ready to go to the foundry.&quot; </p>

<p>As for what era of Old Blue Eyes would be depicted, should this statue ever happen, she says the artist made a mock up of Frank in his &quot;The Voice&quot; glory days at the Paramount Theatre, the scene of the Columbus Day riots in 1944 (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150646/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/11/frank-sinatra-pop-star">photographer WeeGee captured</a>).</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Sinatra to find out what the latest obstacles are, and will update if we hear back from her.</p>
