<p>Before November 24th we suggest heading over to the Storefront for Art and Architecture for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101349/http://www.storefrontnews.org/exhib_dete.php?exID=134">this urban housing designs exhibit</a>. The little gallery houses a New York City created from Legos! Not a completely new idea (this Sean fella did a good job of it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101349/http://www.seankenney.com/portfolio/new_york_city_models">previously</a>), however these guys have taken it to the next level, including little details only locals could appreciate. Seriously, there&apos;s even street art...and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101349/http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardzinho/148016342">Banksy</a> no less! </p>
