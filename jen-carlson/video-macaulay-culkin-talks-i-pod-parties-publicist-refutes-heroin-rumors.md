<p>Macaulay Culkin has been throwing his iPod parties at (Le) Poisson Rouge for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072750/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/are_you_ready_to_dance_with_macaula.php">nearly a year</a>&#x2014;which is a monthly party that incorporates a random theme set to the music on Culkin&apos;s iPod. It is said to be the &quot;only successful party that plays Chumbawamba,&quot; and, sure, that&apos;s probably true. Since the simplicity of the idea has seemed to confuse people who have yet to attend, Culkin and his partner in crime Brett Tabisel have explained the shindigs for you on LPR&apos;s new podcast series&#x2014;watch below. The next event takes place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072750/http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3520">this Thursday</a>.</p>
