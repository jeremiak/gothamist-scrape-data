From addiction to homelessness, you can hear the experience of rock-bottomness in his voice. The likes of Grizzly Bear&apos;s Chris Taylor and TV on the Radio&apos;s Kyp Malone were amongst those who recognized his talent, and have helped him record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055424/http://www.amazon.com/Miles-Benjamin-Anthony-Robinson/dp/B0018PJET4">his material</a>. He&apos;ll be hitting the road soon, but you can catch him at Music Hall of Williamsburg this tonight, and Zebulon next Tuesday.</em></p>

<p><strong>When did you start writing and playing music?</strong> I&apos;ve always written songs in my freakishly tiny head.  I started playing when I was old enough to stand up and start breaking the piano at my grandmother&apos;s.</p>

<p><strong>Do you feel any particular part of your childhood led you to become a musician?</strong> Crippling shyness. Also that movie <em>Amadeus</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a little about what it was like being homeless in New York?</strong> It seems even more expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any nights you remember distinctly from that time in your life?</strong> This album is not about being homeless in New York.  Maybe if we&apos;re having a beer sometime we can bullshit about our past and tell drug stories but the repeated discussion of them in relation to talking about my music is beginning to bore me.  I HAVE DONE A SHIT TON OF DRUGS AND I USED TO SLEEP OUTSIDE SOMETIMES.  I ATE FOOD OUT OF THE GARBAGE AND SAVED FOUND CHANGE TO BUY MALT LIQOUR. IF YOU DON&apos;T ALREADY HATE THIS STORY YOU WILL SOON. Oh the unshakeable stench of cliche that surrounds me.</p>
