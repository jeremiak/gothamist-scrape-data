<p>The other day we were thinking: Times Square really doesn&apos;t get crazy enough, <em>especially</em> on New Year&apos;s Eve. It&apos;s like a ghost town over there! The Crossroads of the World should really be jam packed with screaming people, especially when a new year is upon us. Well, it seems the suits over at the Times Square Party Down Council had the same thought. Their solution: they&apos;ve invited both Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber to perform in usually desolate area, this December 31st during something called Dick Clark&apos;s New Year&apos;s Rockin&apos; Eve, hosted by Ryan Seacrest. This might just be crazy enough to work!</p>

<p>Bieber revealed the big news <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020034952/http://ryanseacrest.com/2011/10/17/justin-bieber-announces-new-years-eve-performance-audio/">on Seacrest&apos;s radio show</a> yesterday. But Bielebers beware: previous public appearances the little guy has made in New York have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020034952/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/tiny_justin_bieber_has_been_injured.php">almost always</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020034952/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/07/justin_biebers_punishment_for_causi.php">led to riots</a>.</p>
