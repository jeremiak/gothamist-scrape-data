title: Rejoice: dELiA*s Will Make Clothes For Adults
---

	
										<p>Heartbreakingly, dELiA*s filed bankruptcy last year, but the clothing company is primed to make a comeback on top of a comeback under new ownership, and this time they&apos;ll be making clothes for adults. This is a good plan, as adults in 2015 were kids in the 1990s that were in love with the dELiA*s catalog and all of its offerings. Especially anything that looked like something Angela Chase, or Drew Barrymore in <em>Mad Love</em>, would wear. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115025226/http://www.nylon.com/articles/delias-adult-line">NYLON</a> reports that &quot;Steve Russo, the hero who purchased the brand from the fashion graveyard, says that the brand is &apos;working on doing a throwback flashback catalog that brings together the old and the new&apos; at the beginning of 2016. And yes, the nostalgia-fueled line will have sizes more suited for adults.&quot; He recently told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115025226/http://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/delias-back-from-the-dead-and-will-make-clothes-for-adults#.mnoQaq4XK">Buzzfeed</a>: &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t want to confuse the customer, but we&#x2019;re working on some things that will make it so older customers can get products for themselves as well &#x2026; we want to make sure we&#x2019;re meeting expectations and then do some really fun things.&#x201D;<br>
