<p>Do you think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809012432/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/video_10.php">Bloody Loco</a> knows that he&apos;s become an internet sensation? The man who demanded a fellow straphanger on the 7 train <em>recognize</em> (a-fucking-sap!) remains a mystery, which is probably a good thing, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809012432/http://gawker.com/#!5785015/subway-sweater-guy-who-fended-off-bloody-loco-speaks">Gawker</a> did get a little more information about the behind-the-scenes. The sweater-clad, book-reading man Bloody Loco was yelling at tells them, &quot;I got on the subway and accidentally bumped his leg and it started. He called me a pussy and I told him &apos;I am what I eat.&apos; When a girl laughed he went ballistic. The guy got off a couple of stops later asking me to get off the subway and &apos;shoot it out&apos; with him&quot; [he declined].</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the internet, there&apos;s a fake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809012432/http://twitter.com/#!/BloodyLoco">Bloody Loco Twitter</a> account, where recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809012432/http://twitter.com/#!/BloodyLoco/status/50667928676347904">Faux Loco Twote</a>: &quot;FUCK #SWEATERGUY #RECOGNIZE #BLOODYLOCO&quot;. At press time, there is no Sweater Guy Twitter account.</p>

<p>Something tells us this isn&apos;t the last we&apos;ve heard of Bloody Loco, he&apos;s still out there people, riding the subway, waiting for you to sit across from him...</p>
