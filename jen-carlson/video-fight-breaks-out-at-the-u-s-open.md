<p>Who knew tennis matches could be so riddled with crime! While it hasn&apos;t gotten all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130851/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416320/"><em>Match Point</em></a> over in Queens (<em>yet</em>), there has been some unsavory behavior at the U.S. Open, and it&apos;s only the first week. First up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130851/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/02/2010-09-02_accountant_arrested_for_scalping_us_open_tickets_had_335_spots_to_sell_worth_100.html">this guy</a> was caught trying to scalp 339 tickets on Tuesday&#x2014;but then the real action happened last night, when we saw the first upper deck brawl&#x2014;it was all caught on video, of course:</p>

<p><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rPelP6HG7ig?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130851oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/rPelP6HG7ig?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></object></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130851/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/fight_night_at_the_open_QlwSKhd4YInp9hGBdZ7m0K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, the fight happened during the Novak Djokovic (Serbia) and Philipp Petzschner (Germany) match, around 9 p.m., when a female fan asked a man in his 20s to refrain from using the F word so much. Words were exchanged, there was allegedly a slap match between the two, and then an older gent stepped in and ended up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130851/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/09/02/2010-09-02_fans_fight_in_upper_stands_at_arthur_ashe_stadium_during_novak_djokovic_match_at.html">falling down the stairs</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. Open may want to beef up their security! Needless to say, the match stopped due to the distraction, and a U.S. Tennis Association spokesman addressed the issue, saying: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a hot night in New York. Things happen.&quot; Maybe we&apos;ll get to see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130851/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGvKkLLUswY">Richie Tenenbaum</a> at Windswept Fields-type breakdown sometime before the Open closes on the 12th.</p>
