Okay, so maybe furry animals delivering candy is aiming more towards the Disneyfication of the city. Here&apos;s what they have to say for themselves: &quot;we are personally delivering a 100% sugar crack rock (multi-colored and multi-flavored with snow cone syrup) to your Brooklyn house on demand. Expect a 7-foot tall man in a plush, blue mascot head, white gloves and a tuxedo to come knocking soon after you call or text for delivery. You can purchase a few candy crack rocks for $1 a pop in a 1&quot; x 1&quot; crack bag.&quot; Seems innocent, if not a bit creepy (this is the same man who gives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118041646/http://clubanimalsnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/whenever-you-are-ready-to-join-our-club.html">bouncy rides</a> in the subway). But wait! The closing sentence declares: &quot;Can&apos;t say too much here because y&apos;know it&apos;s drugs.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118041646/http://clubanimalsnyc.blogspot.com/2009/05/create-synthetic-cocaine-made-from.html">Follow the link</a> if you wanna take your chances.
