<p>We&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232845/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/hbo_makes_huge_mistake_by_canceling.php">mourning the passing</a> of HBO&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232845/http://gothamist.com/tags/boredtodeath"><em>Bored To Death</em></a> since last November, but it seems there may be two lives for Jonathan Ames&apos;s characters&#x2014;rumor has it that a 90-minute movie could be in the works. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232845/http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/bored-to-death-movie-ted-danson.html">Vulture</a> spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221232845/https://twitter.com/MrSeries/status/212929562974240769">this Tweet</a> from Pierre Langlas, a French Journalist who recently talked to Ted Danson; Langlas wrote: &quot;Ted Danson annonce un fort probable 90mn Bored to Death.&quot; HBO later confirmed that there have &quot;been some conversations... it&apos;s at a very early stage.&quot; </p>

<p>We contacted Ames for a comment, but it seems he&apos;s off the grid until next week. However, in April he told us he has been &quot;very busy trying to write a script,&quot; but didn&apos;t give any specifics. Color us hopeful.</p>
