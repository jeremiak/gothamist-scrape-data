<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="gatsbygreat3d0211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120120032739im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gatsbygreat3d0211.jpg" width="220" height="281" class="image-left"> </span>Director Baz Luhrmann is currently working on his latest project, bringing <em>The Great Gatsby</em> to the big screen (again)... and possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120120032739/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/is_the_world_ready_for_gatsby_3-d.php">in 3-D</a> (the next natural step for an F. Scott Fitzgerald classic!). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120120032739/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/baz_to_make_gatsby_choice_I5ngKh4aqSwiEmZh6H0iKJ">The NY Post</a> has an update and reports that filming will likely begin in New York in June, and Luhrmann told the paper he&apos;s in the middle of deciding which studio he&apos;ll work with, also adding, &quot;I&apos;m making a big decision about <em>The Great Gatsby</em> by the end of the week.&quot; Luhrmann relocated to the city with his family last September for the project, and though recent reports suggested he may be off the film, it seems like he&apos;s still at the reigns.</p>

<p>It looks like the cast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120120032739/http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-great-gatsby-heads-to-warner-bros">will include</a> Leo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan... but we have to agree with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120120032739/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343092/board/nest/175050081">IMDB user hpavillion1</a>, who demands: &quot;RYAN GOSLING FOR GATSBY.&quot;</p>

<p>Think about it, Luhrmann.</p>
