<p><img alt="0806busdouble.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521075852im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0806busdouble.jpg" width="350" height="229" class="left">At around 11 a.m. the &quot;World&apos;s Strongest Men&quot; will be taking over 7th Avenue in front of the Garden. The men will be channeling The Hulk as they pull a double-decker bus down the block, a stunt that will make all of their other planned handiwork pale in comparison. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521075852/http://moneyries.blogspot.com/2008/06/worlds-strongest-men-on-7th-avenue.html">Moneyries</a> reports that in addition to their attempt at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521075852/http://believe-or-not.blogspot.com/2007/11/strong-man-pulls-bus-with-his-ears.html">breaking the bus record</a>, phone books will be torn to pieces, Hawaiian Tropic Zone models will be lifted up, frying pans will be bent and something awesome will be done with 900-lb tires. </p>

<p>This is all to promote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521075852/http://www.thegarden.com/events/worlds-strongest-man0608.html">the World&apos;s Strongest Man series</a>, which hits Madison Square Garden this Saturday. Did you know that strength athletes performed in MSG as early as 1904?</p>

<p>If you see men pulling a double-decker bus this morning, by all means, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521075852/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us photos</a>.</p>
