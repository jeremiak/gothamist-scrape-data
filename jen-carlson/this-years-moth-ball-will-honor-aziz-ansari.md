<p>This year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505234638/https://themoth.org/mothball">Moth Ball</a>, the best ball in town and one that benefits the storytelling nonprofit The Moth, will double as a 20th anniversary celebration of the beloved organization. As is tradition, the Ball will also have a theme and an honoree, and this year they&apos;re going with Summer Night&#x2019;s Dream and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505234638/http://gothamist.com/tags/azizansari">Aziz Ansari</a>.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s truly exciting for us to honor Aziz Ansari &#x2014;master storyteller, hilarious and talented actor, and championship of diversity in the arts, at this year&#x2019;s Moth Ball&#x2014; at the official 20th anniversary of The Moth&#x2019;s very first show.&#x201D; says Sarah Haberman, Executive Director, The Moth.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505234638/http://gothamist.com/tags/themothball">In recent years</a> Louis C.K., Carrie Brownstein, Zadie Smith, and Martin Scorsese have been amongst those honored.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170505234638/https://themoth.secure.force.com/ticket/#sections_a0F0P00000Gqv3jUAB">Tickets start at $500</a> for individuals and $10,000 per table. This includes dinner, open bars, and a really wonderful and entertaining night. Plus: proceeds will support over 550 live storytelling shows this year, The Moth Radio Hour, and their community and education programs.</p>

<p>The event will take place at Capitale (130 Bowery) on June 6th.</p>
