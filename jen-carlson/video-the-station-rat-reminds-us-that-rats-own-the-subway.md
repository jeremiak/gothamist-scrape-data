title: Video: The Station Rat Reminds Us That "Rats Own The Subway"
---

<p>The Station Rat has been lurking around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183236/http://twitter.com/#!/stationrat">on Twitter</a>, so we got in touch with him to find out what he&apos;s got to say on behalf of the unground rodent nation, that will undoubtedly one day serve as our overlords. Station Rat tells us that he is &quot;the voice of subway rats across the city. As full-time residents of the subway system, we know first-hand what is happening to the system. Budget cuts mean dirtier stations and less money for train cleaners. And we&apos;re happy about it. But now people are talking about &apos;fixing transit&apos; or &apos;cleaning up the subway.&apos; The last straw was the MTA&apos;s effort to clean up subway stations and remove trash from the system. We&apos;ve had enough.&quot; With that, he released this trailer today:</p>

<p>Station Rat also tells us, &quot;Next Monday, we&apos;ll be releasing a [full length] video as a reminder to New Yorkers that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183236/http://gothamist.com/tags/ratdemic">rats own the subway</a>.&quot; Color us intrigued/horrified/creeped out.</p>
