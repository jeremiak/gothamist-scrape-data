<p>Starting tomorrow (though it&apos;s already in place), and through August 24th, Swiss artist Olaf Breuning&apos;s Clouds will be hanging over Central Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310170731/http://www.publicartfund.org/view/exhibitions/6035_olaf_breuning_clouds">The Public Art Fund</a> has brought the delightfully cartoonish piece to New York, where it will be installed at the southeast entrance of Central Park, at 5th Avenue and 60th Street.</p>

<p>There it will &quot;tower nearly 35 feet above this plaza. Held aloft among the trees of Central Park by rudimentary steel supports, the six bright blue clouds are made of polished and painted aluminum and were cut to match a hand drawing by the artist. Calling to mind the set design of a school play or child-like drawings of the sky, the idea for this work is inspired by one of the artist&#x2019;s staged photographs.&quot; Get ready to see a lot of it on your Instagram feed.</p>
