title: Video: Is This The Best Manhattan Time Lapse Ever?
---

<p>That question is rhetorical, by the way. Josh Owens, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110605190457/http://www.mindrelic.com/">master of timelapses</a>, has released his latest video, taken from eleven different hotels around Manhattan. He writes, &quot;I recently spent a little over a month hotel hopping in Manhattan (March 12th to April 29th) shooting time lapse. These clips were pulled from over an hours worth of footage.&quot; The result is truly awe-inspring... in fact, it&apos;s making us a little verklempt!</p>
