You know how often a song will stick itself to a situation, an event, a memory...making music a sonic earmark, and the first few notes of a song leading you on an unwanted trip down memory lane. </p>

<p>So this site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://ruinedmusic.com/">Ruined Music</a>, not only focuses on those songs ruined by an ex...but also by &quot;a roommate, a bandmate, a former best friend, a neighbor, a teacher, or an ocelot&quot;. So go dig up that old mix tape and let nostalgia sink in, write a little 1,000 word diary entry on that song that reminds you of a 7th grade crush, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://ruinedmusic.com/submit.html">submit it</a> for the world to see. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://www.ruinedmusic.com/2006-weve-got-secrets-too.html">This one</a>, by New Yorker Carrie Jones, has got to be our favorite. The song? &quot;The Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side&quot; by the Magnetic Fields.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?type=32&amp;id=1545160#/overdrive/?id=1545160&amp;type=32">this clip on MTV News</a> where everyone from Lee Sargent of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, to U2&apos;s Bono, talk about what songs are ruined for them. </p>
