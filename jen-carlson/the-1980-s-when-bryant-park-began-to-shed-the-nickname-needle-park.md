<p>Bryant Park has been around for ages, first called Reservoir Square, around 1847 when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010102/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/04/flashback_croton_reservoir.php">the Croton Reservoir</a> was there. Prior to that it was still wilderness, until 1823 when it was designated a potter&apos;s field, which it remained through 1840. It wasn&apos;t until the bodies were (probably!) moved to Wards Island that it became a public park. But let&apos;s flash way forward, to the 1970s, when the park became overrun by drug deals and prostitutes.</p>

<p>Nicknamed &quot;Needle Park&quot; at the time (as were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010102/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Panic_in_Needle_Park">many parks in the city</a>), it was considered a &quot;no-go zone&quot; by all of those outside the seedy underworld of New York City. Part of the problem was Robert Moses&apos;s 1930 redesign, which made the park practically hidden to passerby, and thus the perfect hideout&#x2014;in fact, in 1980 one of the Bryant Park Corporation founders told the NY Times, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s incredible, but it seems the park was designed for pushers.&#x201D;  Eventually, a new day was upon us, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010102/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant_Park">The Internet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>From 1979 to 1983, a coordinated program of amenities, including a bookmarket, a flower market, cafes, landscape improvements, and entertainment activities, was initiated by a parks advocacy group called the Parks Council and immediately brought new life to the park&#x2014;an effort continued over the succeeding years by The Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, which had been founded in 1980 by a group of prominent New Yorkers, including members of the Rockefeller family, to improve conditions in the park.</blockquote> 

<p>Here are some photos of the park in the early 1980s, a few years before the 1988 redesign, showing New Yorkers enjoying the piece of land, sans needles in their arms. Though they <em>were</em> still smoking cigarettes in the park...</p>
