                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpYNcoq3AM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011235258im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpYNcoq3AM.jpg" width="640" height="380" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011235258/http://gothamist.com/tags/mileycyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> sure is one calculated genius, drawing you in with shiny sparkly controversy and then flipping the script and giving you <em>just her voice</em>. Now that her album is out, she&apos;s been doing a series of tamer performances that showcase her vocal chords, which actually make very nice sounds, even without autotune&#x2014;a rare trait in a pop star these days. </p>

<p>Her latest performance aired <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011235258/http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2013/10/jimmy-fallon-miley-cyrus-the-roots-sing-we-cant-stop-a-capella/">on last night&apos;s <em>Late Night</em></a>, where Cyrus delivered an a cappella version of &quot;We Can&apos;t Stop&quot; with Jimmy Fallon and the Roots, who make everyone seem so lovable. Watch as Fallon reacts to getting the &quot;big butt&quot; lyric aimed at him, and Questlove feigning absolute shock at that cocaine line...</p>
