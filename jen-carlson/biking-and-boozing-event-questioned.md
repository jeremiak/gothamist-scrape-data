										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bikebooze0709.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bikebooze0709.jpg" width="300" height="352" class="image-right"> </span>Summer is upon us, and Mayor Bloomberg has declared July to be Good Beer Month. And there&apos;s nothing quite like riding ones bike to a bar and imbibing in some cold ones, right? Actually that sounds like a dangerous idea, but it still didn&apos;t stop some folks from putting together a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841/http://www.biketothebars.com/">Bike to the Bars</a> event. </p>

<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/of-bikes-bars-and-beers/">CityRoom</a> questioned the decision of organizers encouraging riding under the influence (a topic that was discussed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/09/is_drunk_cycling_as_hazardous_as_dr.php">earlier this year</a>), and organizer/owner of Jimmy&apos;s 43, Jimmy Carbone, told them, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not saying go to 10 bars and get drunk. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/09/beer_bike_pedal.php">Europeans get it</a>. After a good bike ride or a run, people have a beer somewhere.&#x201D; </p>

<p>However, the tour de beer seems to include more than 10 bars across 2 boroughs. It takes place this Saturday and the leader of the pack, Slow Food USA&apos;s Cecily Upton, promises, &#x201C;This is about good people coming together and sharing a ride and a good beer.&quot; But should biking under the influence be touted as innocent and promoted as the centerpiece of an event? Maybe we should loosen up, but, this seems <em>way</em> more dangerous than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/10/are_your_children_safe_from_sand.php">sand</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/17/tomato_fungus_outbreak_spreading_de.php">tomatoes</a> combined!</p>

<p>In fact, there have been plenty of accidents because of the combination of boozing and biking, and the site notes that a recent report found that 21% of New York cyclists involved in a fatal accident had alcohol in their blood. And plenty others have suffered minor injuries, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910043841/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/21/david_byrne_bik.php">David Byrne</a> isn&apos;t immune!</p>
