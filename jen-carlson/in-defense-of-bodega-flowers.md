<p>This week WNYC&apos;s Leonard Lopate tweeted out the following inquiry from a caller: &quot;How do I get my husband to not get me bodega flowers?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But lady, bodega flowers are beautiful,&quot; my heart whimpered upon seeing this.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;How do I get my husband to not get me bodega flowers?&quot; asks a caller, and now we have a new Valentine&apos;s day hashtag: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904040852/https://twitter.com/hashtag/bodegaflowers?src=hash">#bodegaflowers</a></p>&#x2014; Leonard Lopate Show (@LeonardLopate) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904040852/https://twitter.com/LeonardLopate/status/697837091401678848">February 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>This woman falsely believes that somehow bodega flowers are not as good as other, more expensive flowers that were grown in the same goddamn ground we all step upon every day. She whined, &quot;I love flowers, but I like <em>florist</em> flowers.&quot; (You can listen to her explain her &quot;problem&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904040852/http://www.wnyc.org/story/answering-your-burning-questions-about-love/?hootPostID=fdcd0597cd162b4e6ffeccb70db4c582">towards the end</a> of the episode.) </p>

<p>The show started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904040852/https://twitter.com/hashtag/bodegaflowers?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=hash">a #bodegaflowers hashtag</a> that didn&apos;t take off, <em>but it should have</em>. The city&apos;s residents should have come to Twitter to defend bodega flowers. Since no one did, it falls to us.</p>

<p>One of the greatest things this city has to offer is the bodega bouquet. Whether you are purchasing some, or walking by a stand filled with them. Whether it&apos;s first thing in the morning, on a gray Tuesday afternoon, or late at night&#x2014;those bodega flowers are there for you. Cheering you up. Lookin&apos; pretty. Smellin&apos; nice. If you&apos;ve had a bad day, you can buy some for yourself and feel a little bit more hopeful. Bodega flowers will dry your tears, mend your heart, and brighten up your apartment. This stands true if you are buying them for yourself, or for someone else. And they cost about as much as your morning cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Here are some more bodega flower facts:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="BODEGAFLOWERSIG.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904040852im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/BODEGAFLOWERSIG.jpg" width="640" height="395" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<ul><li>Seriously, bodega flowers only cost around $5. Sometimes less! 
</li><li>They also seem to be immortal, having probably built up the same kind of superhero immunity New Yorkers have. They last at least a week longer than your fancy florist flowers.
</li><li>Is it your first time dabbling in flowers? Bodegas will even sell you a vase on the cheap!
</li><li>Many bodegas sell add-ons so you can create your own unique bouquet&#x2014;these include everything from baby&apos;s breath to branches that the proprietors have clearly ripped off a nearby blossoming cherry tree. 
</li><li>They come in all types: the bold red rose, the playful tulip, the joyful daisy, the majestic sunflower, and the under-appreciated carnation.</li></ul>

<p>In other cities they have to rely on Trader Joe&apos;s for less expensive and more convenient flower arrangements, and those usually die before you&apos;re out of line. Bodega flowers are pretty uniquely New York. So respect the bodega flower*. Love the bodega flower*. Embrace the bodega flower*. They are the flower of the people, and NYC&apos;s streetscapes would be so sad without them.</p>

<p><span class="photo_caption">*This does not include the artificially dyed bodega flowers. Fuck those things. Fuck them right to hell.</span></p>
