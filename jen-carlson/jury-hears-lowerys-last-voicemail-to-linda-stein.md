However, Lowery maintains Stein went for a walk that day (something the doorman who testified said that wasn&apos;t true). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173513/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/02/02/2010-02-02_audio_linda_steins_alleged_killer_natavia_lowery_leaves_a_voice_mail_alibi_after.html">The Daily News</a> has a recording of the voicemail, in which Lowery makes a point to mention Stein&apos;s walk. One problem? The message was left at 6 p.m. that dayThough the voicemail was left at 6 p.m., Lowery tells Stein she is planning to leave work at 5:30 that day, and &quot;If you get this message before 5:30 you can just call me.&quot;</p>
