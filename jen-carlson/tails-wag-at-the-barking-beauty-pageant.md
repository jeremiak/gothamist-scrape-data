</div></div><p>Yesterday afternoon some of the city&apos;s cutest canines competed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052108/http://www.thebarkingbeauty.com/">Barking Beauty Pageant</a> held at Richmond Shepard Theatre. The 4th annual event was to benefit the Stone Soup Theatre and the Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition, and was hosted by the National American Miss Pageant&apos;s Leslie Hughes, who had a little help from her Yorkshire Terrier, SalliSue. The grand prize winning pup (dressed as Carrie Bradshaw) was showered with gifts that will <em>further</em> anthropomorphize it, like a fashion photo shoot.</p>
