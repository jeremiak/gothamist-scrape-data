title: Denise Albert Addresses Her "Mommy Rage"

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpMetPSJPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004306im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpMetPSJPM.jpg" width="132" height="200" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s been nearly a week since Denise Albert unleashed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004306/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/18/angry_mom.php">her mommy rage</a> onto the pages of the internet for all to see, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004306/http://www.metro.us/us/article/2010/02/22/22/2536-82/index.xml">now she&apos;s back</a>, apologizing, and burdened by a slight case of post-traumatic writer shock.</p>

<p>She says that last week&apos;s tirade, which she noted at the time may seem &quot;aggressive or forceful,&quot; wasn&apos;t meant to make her seem &quot;mean-spirited and entitled.&quot; She really just wants everyone to be nice and courteous. And clearly the best way to get this result is by penning an article about her self-described &quot;useless anger,&quot; and sprinkling it with threatening phrases like &quot;if you make me angry you will know it&quot; and &quot;Move out of my way&quot;? </p>

<p>Anyway, she&apos;s sorry-ish, and really hopes that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004306/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/18/angry_mom.php#comment-2480001">commenter Kojak</a> isn&apos;t going to push her and her stroller into oncoming traffic.</p>
