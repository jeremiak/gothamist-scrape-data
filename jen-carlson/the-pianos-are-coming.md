</div></div>					<p>So are we all in agreement that 60 public pianos being placed throughout the city is a pretty freakin&apos; cool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727183624/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/public_pianos_yay_or_just_plain_ann.php">public art project</a>, like on a scale of 1 to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727183624/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/25/its_waterfalls_eve.php">waterfalls</a>? As long as the city doesn&apos;t become engulfed in a chorus of Chopsticks, British artist Luke Jerram&apos;s unveiling of the pianos on Monday should be the start of something beautiful. </p>

<p>The pianos will be in all five boroughs, and Jerram told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727183624/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brit_big_apple_reach_chord_with_TnyebOu7EaQC9nG2sD5yTI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post</a>, &quot;We want to reach a broad and diverse audience. You could easily put them in the wealthiest parts of the city and there wouldn&apos;t be any problems. It&apos;s good to take a few risks.&quot; Check out all the locations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727183624/http://www.streetpianos.com/nyc2010/">here</a>&#x2014;one is already up at Gantry Plaza State Park in LIC, where Mayor Bloomberg stated they would be up for only two weeks, and &quot;it doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re a world-class virtuoso like Beethoven or a guy who took one year of lessons.&#x201D; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727183624/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1572748995/all-city-nigel-hall-and-the-nyc-street-pianos">This musician</a> is aiming to play them all.)</p>

<p>If you spot one next week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727183624/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos and videos!</p>
