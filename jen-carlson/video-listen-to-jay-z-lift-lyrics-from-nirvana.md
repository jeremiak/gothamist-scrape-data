<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207082013/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> owns the rights to &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; and gave Jay-Z permission to use the song (which he changed the lyrics to: &quot;And we all just entertainers / And we&apos;re stupid and contagious / And we all just entertainers&quot;). When the Nirvana song was originally released in 1991, Jay Z was still five years away from dropping his debut album.</p>
