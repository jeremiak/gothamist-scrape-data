title: Is Playing Your Cello On The Subway Bad Subway Etiquette?

<p>This week a young man, sporting a top man bun, took his cello on the subway to play some Bach for fellow straphangers <em>whether they liked it or not</em>. There&apos;s something just a little more intrusive when the busker not only steps off the platform and onto the train, but also takes up precious space to deliver the entertainment with their <em>massive cello</em> (it&apos;s unclear if an accompanying case was out of frame). And don&apos;t those violent, jagged movements needed to play the instrument basically look exactly like someone is murdering your peace and quiet?</p>

<p>So our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025535/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> dial is leaning towards POOR on this one. Still, wouldn&apos;t mind hearing this in a park or on the platform:</p>
