title: Farewell Regis: This Morning The Talk Show Host Takes His Leave
---

<p>This morning, 80-year-old Regis Philbin embarks on his final farewell from the morning talk show he has co-hosted for over twenty years (#RegisFarewell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020316/http://twitter.com/#!/Regis_and_Kelly/status/137527035873595392">is trending</a> on Twitter right now). The other day we looked back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020316/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/regis.php">Regis throughout the years</a>, and last night David Letterman (a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020316/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/fall_guy_regis_scoots_on_over_ehRwO5LVi5lPJVl8pwVqNK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">huge fan</a> of the Reeg) gave him the Top 10 treatment, with &quot;Top 10 Things We&apos;ll Miss About Regis&quot; (he also predicts we&apos;ll all need therapy when we realize Regis isn&apos;t coming back to our television screens&#x2014;although Regis is calling this a leave, because he doesn&apos;t like the word &quot;retirement&quot;):</p>

<p>If you head over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020316/http://livewithregis.com/">the show&apos;s website</a>, you can dive down a rabbit hole of memories, but we especially like this video narrated by Alan Alda:</p>

<p>Here are some scenes from this morning, before the show began: </p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Mayor Bloomberg is on the show, suggesting that Philbin be a cab driver or work at Gray&apos;s Papaya.  Guests in the audience include Diane Sawyer, Donald Trump, Tony Danza and, yes, Kathie Lee Gifford.  There is a montage of various celebrities doing Regis impressions&#x2014;Dana Carvey, Martin Short, Jimmy Fallon, Ben Affleck, Amy Poehler, Neil Patrick Harris and Kelly herself&#x2014;as well as montages featuring his wife Joy and daughters Jennifer and JJ.  </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_11_tweeter.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020316im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_tweeter.jpg" width="640" height="478"> <br> <i>Via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020316/http://lockerz.com/s/157241785">Regis &amp; Kelly</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p><b>Update</b>: At the end of an emotional show, including a performance of &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; by the current cast of Rent, Disney president Bob Iger presented Philbin with a plaque outside the ABC Studios at Columbus and 67th Street. And that seemed rather anti-climactic: As one person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020316/http://twitter.com/#!/tessiesanci/status/137544652466302977">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Watching last #RegisandKelly. I&apos;m sure #Regis loved having ABC president dedicate plaque 2 him-instead of renewing his contract on his terms.&quot;</p>
