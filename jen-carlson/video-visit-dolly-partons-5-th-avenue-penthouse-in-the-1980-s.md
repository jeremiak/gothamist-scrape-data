<p>In 1980 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206115009/http://gothamist.com/tags/dollyparton">Dolly Parton</a> was on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206115009/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dolly-parton-19801211">the cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, preparing for her first movie role (<em>9 To 5</em>), and splitting her time between the country and the city. This CBS segment for &quot;Country People&quot; with Huell Howser (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206115009/http://laist.com/2013/01/07/la_tv_icon_huell_howser_has_died.php">RIP</a>) aired on CBS in 1980, and was shot while she was preparing for her big screen debut. In it, Parton reads from the script, plays a tune, gives a tour of her 5th Avenue penthouse apartment, and talks New York City:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I love it up here. I don&apos;t get here all that often, but it&apos;s a good place for me to work, I write a lot of songs up here. Looking out over Central Park there&apos;s just that little bit of simplicity, it almost looks like a country scene, and then to kind of look out and see all the buildings and the high rises. It&apos;s like the country and the city, just this little part here, and I get inspired.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Not bad, but she still preferred the country...</p>

<p>Maybe because you can make more noise there&#x2014;in 1979 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206115009/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19790310&amp;id=ywofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3dIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1458,4762360">she told one paper</a>, &quot;We play music too loud and we&apos;ll probably get thrown out that window. We got neighbors and I respect &apos;em but sometimes I forget, like when I&apos;m playin&apos; on my new album and thinkin&apos;, we need horn in that piece or we need to put string on this, and I turn it up so loud I can hear all I&apos;m supposed to and then all of a sudden the neighbors don&apos;t particularly want horns.&quot; To her credit, she did try to help by putting &quot;sound absorbing fabric&quot; on all of the walls.</p>
