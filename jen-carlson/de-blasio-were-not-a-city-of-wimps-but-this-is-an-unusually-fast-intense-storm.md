<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio held a press conference at the NYC Emergency Management offices in Brooklyn this morning to update the city on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404183814/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/winter_storm_snow_nyc.php">the snow situation</a>, kicking things off by noting the oddness of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404183814/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/anthropocene_style.php#photo-1">the drastic shift in weather</a> in less than 24 hours&#x2014;it&apos;s &quot;something like we&apos;ve never seen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is an unusually fast, intense storm,&quot; de Blasio declared, noting that earlier we got 3&quot; of snow an hour, for two hours in a row, which is a rare rate of snowfall. The snow will slow down between noon and 1 p.m., and the hope is that it will stop by 6 p.m. If that is the case, &quot;I&apos;m feeling good about tomorrow morning&apos;s rush hour,&quot; he said, and that most likely school will be open, and the city will be back to normal by morning.</p>

<p>De Blasio and DSNY Commissioner Kathryn Garcia urged everyone to stay off the streets so the 2,300 sanitation vehicles can keep clearing the snow. When a reporter on hand questioned this urging of New Yorkers to stay inside, asking when we became &quot;a city of wimps,&quot; de Blasio replied, &quot;When you&apos;re talking about a super concentrated snow storm, it is just plain common sense to not go out if you don&apos;t have to. It is not a moral judgement, it is not that we&apos;ve changed who we are, this is one of the toughest cities on earth...&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed we&apos;ll get 10&quot; to 14&quot; of snow in total.</p>

<p>As for today: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404183814/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/snow_flights_canceled.php">you&apos;re not going to</a> have a lot of luck flying, or crossing certain bridges (the upper level of the Verrazano Bridge has been closed), and you know what: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404183814/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/mass_transit_snow_issues.php">maybe skip the subway</a>, too. So far today there have been delays on the 1, 2, 3, 5, L, J, N and W lines, and buses are running very sl...ow...ly.</p>
