<p>Brooklyn&apos;s D. Carlton Bright has been filming 3D images of Williamsburg for the past ten years, and has now cut it all together for an hour-long feature called <em>Williamsburg: 3D of a Decade</em>, which will be screened at Nitehawk Cinemas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121624/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/2013/11/excerpt-from-williamsburg-3d-of-a-decade/#sthash.79MXtMLr.dpuf">this Thursday</a>. Below you can see a preview (sans the 3D but for some reason with a double vision screen)&#x2014;the film chronicles &quot;the neighborhood, its residents and how it&apos;s changed (for better or worse) over the last ten years.&quot; You know, back when Williamsburg&apos;s outdoor concerts were held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121624/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/28/mccarren_park_p_1.php">in the abandoned McCarren Park Pool</a>&#x2014;those were the days.</p>

<p>But we sort of wish it went back a few decades further.
