It told the story of one woman&apos;s move to Long Island, which she described as &quot;a jail sentence,&quot; despite the pleasant shrubbery and forsythia. Instead of finding the best of country life and city conveniences mixed in to one perfect Utopia, she found that it had &quot;all of the drawbacks of living in the city... and none of the advantages!&#x201D; This was years after her family originally moved there, and everything became very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605140532/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnzs2O-2z_U"><em>Edward Scissorhands</em></a>. Here are just some of the reasons why the suburbs sucked:<br>
<ul><li>&quot;People are almost all from the same income level, have the same interests, the same outlook, the same values. There&#x2019;s just no difference.. It isn&#x2019;t just monotony, it&#x2019;s stagnation!&quot; <br>
</li><li>We may have moved out here for the fresh air, but these days there&#x2019;s so much gasoline exhaust in the air it could hardly be called fresh. No one walks an inch!&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Each day, almost every day, seems to be spent running dozens of errands and doing things I don&#x2019;t want to do. In most cases, they&#x2019;re things I wouldn&#x2019;t have to do if we were living in the city.&quot;<br>
</li><li>There are just three restaurants in town, so Saturday night is &#x201C;Steak Night&#x201D; at one of them. Sunday night is &#x201C;Chinese dinner&#x201D; night at another.<br>
</li><li>&quot;It&#x2019;s so difficult to get around out here, and transportation is so time-consuming, that we don&#x2019;t have the opportunity to choose our friends for their attributes and qualities, as we might if we were living in a city. We&#x2019;re forced to select our friends for their geographic availability.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Guess it wasn&apos;t all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605140532/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/18/please_say_use_your_leftovers_in_a.php">jello salad</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605140532/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltl0EQ9O7Gg">shooting pigeons</a>. At least there was plenty of <em>white whine</em> to go around though. Her list also included:<br>
</p><ul><li>&quot;Membership in the country club almost drains the budget.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;I happen to like small dinner parties of six or eight, [but] what&#x2019;s &apos;in&apos; is huge cocktails-and-buffet parties at which you can pay off all your social obligations at one time, and offend no one because you&#x2019;ve invited everyone. The only trouble with them is that they aren&#x2019;t any fun.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
