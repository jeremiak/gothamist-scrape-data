<p>When Matilda the Algonquin Hotel cat updated her Facebook this week saying, &quot;Getting my suitcases down and gathering up my toys&#x2014;travel time is almost here,&quot; we worried that Mayor Bloomberg was booting her from the hotel, following some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160907161725/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/23/matilda.php">troubles with the Department of Health</a>. Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160907161725/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10150490733594555&amp;id=51291379554">Matilda added</a>, &quot;They think I don&apos;t know&#x2014;but am being taken to the vet today for my travel check up&#x2014;then to the passport office (ooops&#x2014;am I telling you too much?)&quot; When we tried to contact her via email, we got an out of office reply, saying, &quot;<strong>Happy Holidays FURiends. Matilda</strong>.&quot; So, finally, we made the call. </p>

<p>This morning, we reached Matilda by phone (okay, we reached a very nice woman who told us she had Matilda on her lap, by phone), and asked where she was going and if the move was permanent. Good news: Matilda is only going away while the hotel undergoes renovations for four months starting in January, and she&apos;s not venturing too far. She&apos;ll be exploring a different borough, however: Queens (to stay with the hotel&apos;s chief cat officer, Alice de Almeida). Following that, she&apos;ll return, and following <em>that</em> she&apos;ll be strutting her stuff at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160907161725/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/11/the_new_matilda_gets_her_first_cat.php">her annual Cat Fashion Show</a> in August.</p>
