<span class="photo_caption">Which one would you get?</span></p>

<p>There are two Tattoo parlors in Brooklyn offering up Halloween specials this year, because there&apos;s nothing like a bargain to help you in deciding what to permanently ink onto your skin. First up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151913/http://www.brokelyn.com/halloween-tattoos-brooklyn-tattoo/">Brokelyn</a> notes that Sara Antoinette, an apprentice at Brooklyn Tattoo on Smith Street, is offering the $31 special today, Thursday, Saturday, and Monday. You have to pick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151913/http://sara-land.blogspot.com/2011/10/halloween-tattoos.html">one of these</a> Halloween-themed designs&#x2014;so if you ever wanted a piece of candy corn on your body <em>forever</em>, now is the time to pull the trigger!</p>

<p>On Monday, Three Kings Tattoo in Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151913/http://www.brokelyn.com/more-halloween-tattoos-for-just-31/">will bring back</a> their annual $31 sale from noon to 10 p.m., giving you a choice of seasonal images to choose from... but they won&apos;t be revealed until the day of. Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151913/http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/3-kings-tattoo.jpg">last year&apos;s selections</a>, which included Darth Vadar, and some other dark creatures. We&apos;re gonna hold out for Thanksgiving for that pilgrim holding a cornucopia tattoo we&apos;ve been wanting.</p>
