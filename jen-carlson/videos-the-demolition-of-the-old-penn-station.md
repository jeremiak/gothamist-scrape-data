<p>The original Pennsylvania Station, designed by Charles F. McKim, of McKim, Mead &amp; White, opened on September 8th, 1910. The gorgeous building lasted an admirable, yet way too short, 53 years on New York City soil before being torn down. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729140338/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/30/tk_photos_of_old_manhattan_being_to.php#photo-2">As promised yesterday</a>, here&apos;s a look at the demolition of the building&#x2014;one of the biggest mistakes the city ever made (according to people who like nice, pretty architecture over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729140338/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/flashback_madison_square_garden.php#photo-1">soulless sports arenas</a>). And here are some fun and totally depressing facts about the building:</p>

<ul><li>The original Pennsylvania Station had the biggest waiting room in history.
</li><li>Natural light streamed through the iron and glass roof, which hovered 150-feet up.
</li><li>The structure sat upon a (highly valuable) nine-acre lot.
</li><li>On July 25th, 1961, The NY Times published an article about Madison Square Garden moving to the site of Pennsylvania Station, noting that the original station&apos;s waiting room would be part of the new facility. Of course, this didn&apos;t happen.
</li><li>Ada Louise Huxtable, architecture critic for the NY Times, wrote, &quot;We are an impoverished society. It is a poor society indeed that can&#x2019;t pay for these amenities; that has no money for anything except expressways to rush people out of our dull and deteriorating cities.&quot;
</li><li>Destruction began on October 28th, 1963, as protesters watched silently in the rain.
</li><li>In a farewell letter to the station, published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729140338/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D1EF93A59137B93C2AA178BD95F478685F9">in the NY Times</a>, the destruction was called &quot;a monumental act of vandalism.&quot; The writer also stated, &quot;One entered the city like a god; one scuttles in now like a rat.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;The origins of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729140338/http://gvshp.org/blog/2011/07/11/historic-preservation-101-what-is-a-landmark/">the New York City Landmarks Law</a> are often attributed to the loss of New York City&#x2019;s Pennsylvania Station in 1963.&quot;
</li><li>The building&apos;s remains, including 16-ton decorative eagles and the 84 Doric columns were later dumped into the marshlands of Secaucus, New Jersey.</li></ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We have been asked to remove the photos we originally posted, so here are some videos of the rise and fall of the station:</p>
