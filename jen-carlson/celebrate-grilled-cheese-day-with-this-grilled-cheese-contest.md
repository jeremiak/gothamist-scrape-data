<p>Tomorrow (which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071741/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/12/its_national_grilled_cheese_day.php">National Grilled Cheese Day</a> here in the land of fake holidays), Artisanal will host its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071741/http://www.artisanalbistro.com/new_Grilled_Cheese_Tickets_index.php">Third Annual Grilled Cheese Contest.</a> While there won&apos;t be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071741/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/09/salted_caramel_angry_lobster_fatty.php">Salted Caramel Lobster Grilled Cheese</a> on the offering plate, you can attend and taste a variety of takes on the grilled cheese.</p>

<p>At the end of the event, one winner will be declared by a panel of judges, which for some reason includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071741/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/08/christopher_noth_on_jerry_orbach_gi.php">Chris &quot;Mr. Big&quot; Noth</a>. But will it be better than your mom&apos;s simple white bread, butter and American cheese grilled-to-perfection work of art from your youth? Probably not.</p>

<p>Tickets for the event&#x2014;taking place from 3 to 5 p.m. at 44 East 32nd Street on Friday&#x2014;are still available and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071741/http://shop.artisanalbistro.com/Artisanals-3rd-Annual-Grilled-Cheese-Contest-E-Ticket-022.htm">cost just $15</a>. Did we mention you&apos;ll also get sparkling wine and live music by a band called The Ramps that we really hope are named after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516071741/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">ramps</a>?</p>
