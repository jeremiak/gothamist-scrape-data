<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="EXTAPT09.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065018im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/EXTAPT09.jpg" width="200" height="252" class="image-right"> </span>This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065018/http://www.elliman.com/new-york-city/14-convent-avenue-unit-1f-manhattan-ssfwctz">Elliman listing</a> is now online and ready to crush your soul! The realtors are offering this &quot;brand new alcove studio with three, large, east-facing windows allowing for robust sunlight throughout the day&quot; all for just $1,275/month. What else will you get for your hard earned rent money?</p><blockquote>&quot;Floors are contemporary dark-wood, and kitchen appliances are newly-installed, jet-black. Cabinet space is generous. Bathroom is new with rainforest showerhead. The building is a gut-renovated pre-war structure with laundry in the basement and a garden for exclusive use by tenants.&quot;</blockquote>And while the &quot;alcove&quot; may look legitimate with whatever trick photography they used for this listing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065018/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/smallest-apartment-nyc-article-1.1459066">the Daily News</a> has a shocking photo spread that tells it like it is with aerial views. Let&apos;s take a closer look&#x2014;the alcove is shown like this in the listing:<p></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="alcovelol.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065018im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/alcovelol.jpg" width="640" height="419" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065018/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1459063.1379460869!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/micro18u-4-web.jpg">here&apos;s what it looks like IRL</a>. Yeah, that slight indentation at the top is an &quot;alcove&quot; in realtor speak now. </p>

<p>All in all the apartment&#x2014;located at 14 Convent Avenue&#x2014;is much smaller than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065018/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/22/first_look_inside_the_citys_new_mic.php#photo-1">the micro units</a>, coming in at 100-square-feet... and that&apos;s basically all kitchen (and bathroom... at least there&apos;s a bathroom?).</p>

<p>UPDATE: The listing has been taken down, but here&apos;s a screenshot we got before it did.</p>
