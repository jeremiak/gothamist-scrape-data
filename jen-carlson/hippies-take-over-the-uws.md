<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110804143215/http://www.rat-dog.com/">Rat Dog</a> ended their three-night run at the Beacon Theater. The band is led by the Grateful Dead&apos;s Bob Weir, and is one of the few left that will bring the hippies out to the Upper West Side (pictured). </p>

<p>As for the band, they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110804143215/http://www.rat-dog.com/news/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1207424762&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=1&amp;">blogged</a> about their stay, saying, &quot;We&#x2019;ve gotten to New York City &#x2013; &#x2018;just like I pictured it&#x2019; &#x2013; and things are getting seriously New Yorked.&quot; For those keeping track for tape-trading purposes, the Thursday show included Warren Haynes joining in on <em>Sugaree</em>, while &quot;a fine vocalist with Janis-like powerful pipes named Dana Fuchs, jumped in for an incendiary closing <em>Lovelight</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>A source tells us that both young and old hippies showed up, with many bringing their babies. Hopefully they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110804143215/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/15/best_seat_in_th.php">protected their baby&apos;s ears</a>, though the source tells us, &quot;I think the babies were left in strollers on the sidewalk during the show to practice their hacky-sack skills...that&apos;s only a guess, though.&quot;</p>
