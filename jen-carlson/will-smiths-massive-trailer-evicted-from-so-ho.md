<p>After getting some bad press yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515220133/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/will_smiths_trailer.php">Will Smith&apos;s trailer</a> (named The Heat) has been banished from the streets of SoHo! The 1,150 square-foot luxury trailer (housing everything from a movie room to a bar) had been parked at Broome and Greene streets, but after neighbors complained, the city stepped in. The Mayor&apos;s Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515220133/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/will_smith_movoe_set_trailer_relocated_v6YMwzIoNG4vaVcplqOkzM">issued a statement</a> saying, &#x201C;To balance the interests of the production and the neighborhood, we have instructed <em>Men in Black III</em> to relocate the trailer to a private lot.&quot;</p>

<p>The monstrous mobile home was one of 25 trucks that invaded the neighborhood on Monday, including one other 55-foot-trailer housing Smith&apos;s personal gym. It&apos;s worth pointing out that the actor is also renting a $25,000/month apartment nearby on Bond Street.</p>

<p>A rep for Sony Pictures Entertainment told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515220133/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20488724,00.html">People</a> that &quot;the trailer has been relocated to private property.&quot; They added, &quot;We appreciate the opportunity to film in New York, which has been the home of all three <em>Men In Black</em> productions.  This trailer has been used many times in this city by different studios on various movies over the years, and while its use has never been an issue before, we regret any inconvenience it may have caused.&quot; </p>

<p>Smith, though confronted by reporters when he emerged from the trailer yesterday, has remained mum on the subject. Below, some reactions from those passing by the monstrosity prior to it relocating:</p>
