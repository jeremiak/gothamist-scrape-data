<p>There was some nail-biting action <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422212535/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/kickball_crisis_brooklyn_ballers_fa.php">last week</a> when word got out that the Brooklyn Kickball League would lose their field (until July) due to resodding, but now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422212535/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/12/wb_mccarrenseeding_2011_3_25_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that the Parks Department won&apos;t be sowing any seeds on the dusty field anytime soon.</p>

<p>The summer may be saved, but the field (also used by area high school baseball teams) could close for rehabilitation in September; the new look will come in the form of new sod or synthetic turf (TBD!). The last sodding, in 2001, cost about $560,000. Grass may be difficult to maintain with the amount of use on the field, and Brooklyn Parks Commissioner Kevin Jeffries says, &#x201C;We want to have a conversation with the community to find out what serves the community best.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Public meetings to discuss the field&apos;s makeover will be taking place over the next few months, but rest assured, balls will be kicked this summer.<br>
