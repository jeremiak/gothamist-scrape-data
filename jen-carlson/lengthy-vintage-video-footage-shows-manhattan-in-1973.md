<p>The following is a 26-minute video shot by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520022513/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Blumberg">Skip Blumberg</a> (one of the original camcorder-for-broadcast TV producers, who currently produces for programs like <em>Sesame Street</em>) for his collective Videofreex in 1973. The video shows outdoor shots of Manhattan (along with plenty of Chase bank signs)&#x2014;including Luchow&apos;s Restaurant (RIP) in Union Square, various storefronts and buildings on Houston Street, and La Nueva Estrella Restaurant at 28 Bond Street&#x2014;as well as interior shots of lofts and a recording studio. The whole thing closes out with a viewing of a news broadcast in a loft, regarding Nixon and the Watergate tapes.</p>
