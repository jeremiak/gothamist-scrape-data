Stencil</a> art piece. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421125218/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/19/grls-james-powderly.html">Boing Boing</a> reported the news at nearly 8 this morning, he had been held for around 19 hours already. They were tipped off by Students for a Free Tibet, who learned of it via a Twitter message that read &quot;held since 3am.&quot; There&apos;s no further word about the status of this situation, and Beijing officials have yet to acknowledge he&apos;s being held.</p>

<p>There is plenty of information on what led to the art project Powderly has allegedly been detained for, however. Boing Boing points to a statement that reads, in part: &quot;James is proud to have been kicked out of the Synthetic Times new media art exhibition in Beijing because he wouldn&#x2019;t censor his little art project. It was after being kicked to the curb by the show&#x2019;s curator that James connected with Students for a Free Tibet and decided he would go to China anyway and do what he though was right in support of Tibet, Taiwan, free speech and the people of China.&quot;</p>
