<p>Using hard data from a new app called Spreadsheets (which &quot;uses your phone to provide statistical feedback about your duration, thrusts, and decibel peak&quot;), the people of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161851/http://www.nerve.com/love-sex/which-states-have-the-longest-and-shortest-sex">Nerve</a> have put together a map showing how long we&apos;re all having the sex for here in America. They averaged the intercourse time of all 10,000 early adopters of the app in the U.S. and... we&apos;re not taking home the Gold from the Olympsex.  </p>

<p>On average, we clocked in at 3:01 (New Mexico got 7:01, ranking them highest, and Alaska got 1:21, coming in last). Nerve notes that we should not be shocked by these numbers, which do no include foreplay time, as &quot;previous research has shown that, despite the hubbub about hours-long tantric sessions, intercourse itself usually only lasts for about 3 to 13 minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe we&apos;re just conditioned to keep it short for the sake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161851/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/17/etiquette_101_how_to_be_a_good_neig.php">of our neighbors</a>?</p>
