<p>We&apos;re back with another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615171233/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">Guess The Year</a> challenge (everyone did a really good job <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615171233/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/13/guess_the_year_21.php#photo-1">guessing yesterday&apos;s</a>!). So, can you guess which year&#x2014;and even better, guess what neighborhood&#x2014;this photo was taken in? We&apos;ll update later with the date, and more information. (P.S. If you cheat, we won&apos;t get mad, but we WILL be disappointed in you.)</p>
