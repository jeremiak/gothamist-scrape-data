Seriously, they say if you drink two cups a day you&apos;ll even be less suicidal. Other scientific facts include: those drinking up to four cups a day are 25% less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes; men who drink at least six cups a day have a 60% lower risk of developing advanced prostate cancer; five cups a day can lower your risk of Alzheimer&apos;s by 65%... and so on. And all you&apos;re left with is a life-long addiction, and probably the shakes.</p>
