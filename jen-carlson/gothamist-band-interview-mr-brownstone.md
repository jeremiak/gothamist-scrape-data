<p>The &quot;cast&quot;: Sean Greenhalgh plays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023437/http://www.mrbrownstone.info/axl.html">Axl</a>, he&apos;s also got a side project called Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.  Gerard Egan plays the enigmatic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023437/http://www.mrbrownstone.info/slash.html">Slash</a>. Drew Thurlow plays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023437/http://www.mrbrownstone.info/duff.html">Duff McKagen</a>, he&apos;s also in a band called Hair Supply. Mac Furey plays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023437/http://www.mrbrownstone.info/steven.html">Steven Adler</a> and Chris Joyce plays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023437/http://www.mrbrownstone.info/dizzy.html">Dizzy Reed</a>. Then there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023437/http://www.mrbrownstone.info/izzy.html">Izzy Stradlin</a>, played by Dave Godowsky...who took some time away from the groupies to answer our questions. </p>

<p>Don&apos;t miss Mr. Brownstone this Saturday at Bowery Ballroom...where they will play to a New York audience for the last time ever! The band will then play their last show EVER in Boston on July 15th. It truely is the end of an era.</p>

<p><strong>How did you choose Mr. Brownstone for your name? Did you ever consider any other G N&apos; R song names as the band name?</strong><br>
The Gods of rock spoke, and we listened. &quot;Ye Shall be Known as Mr. Brownstone...&quot; and we were all like shit yeah, cool.</p>

<p><strong>Do you know of many other Guns n&apos; Roses cover bands out there? </strong><br>
Apparently there is a band called Appetite for Destruction that will be taking over once we&apos;re gone. We wish them luck as our rock bretheren. Also there is a band called Guns n&apos; Roses that I hear is all right.</p>

<p><strong>Have you ever met Axl?</strong><br>
I never have, although he apparently listened to part of one of our shows via cell phone while he was at a Rangers game. He said he wished he could attend but feared being attacked by fans/media.</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York? </strong><br>
I lived here for a while before actually gaining consiousness, so it&apos;s hard to say. But I would guess that my first memory of living in NYC was reading Gothamist.com and being overwhelmed by the concise journalism, appealing layout, and effective coverage of current events relating to New York City.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York? </strong><br>
Both: being mugged outside my apartment in Park Slope on my birthday.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out? </strong><br>
There is no question about it: the best place for drinks, live music, etc. is Barbes in Brooklyn. Unless the date is June 10, 2006, in which case it&apos;s clearly the Bowery Ballroom.</p>
