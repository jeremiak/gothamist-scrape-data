<p>The gorgeous old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030044023/http://gothamist.com/tags/190bowery">190 Bowery</a>, formerly Germania Bank, has been a private residence of photographer Jay Maisel for the past 5 decades. Recently it was sold to a developer who promptly had it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030044023/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/10/photos_bowery_officially_stripped_o.php#photo-1">buffed of its graffiti</a>, thus beginning its transformation into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030044023/http://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-the-deal-news-digest-1429490458">an office space</a>, and maybe one day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030044023/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/01/190_bowery_uugghh.php">luxury condos</a>. Only in New York! This Saturday, however, the new owner, developer/art collector Aby Rosen, will open the doors of the historic building to the public. </p>

<p>Rosen sent out this below invite (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030044023/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2015/05/on-saturday-190-bowery-opens-to-the-public-for-the-first-time-since-1966.html">The Lo-Down</a>): </p>

<blockquote>Vito Schnabel is pleased to announce the opening of First Show / Last Show, a group exhibition at 190 Bowery on May 16, 2015. Featured artists include Joe Bradley, Dan Colen, Jeff Elrod, Ron Gorchov, Mark Grotjahn, Harmony Korine, and Julian Schnabel. &#x201C;The artists included in First Show / Last Show are seven of my favorite painters. I have had the privilege of living with some of their works and have long wanted to show them together. There are very few artists whose work immediately conveys its significance, like each of these seven. They represent three generations of great American contemporary art, ranging in age from 35 to 85. 

<p>I grew up in New York City, walking by the former Germania Bank countless times. I always wanted to go inside, thinking it might be a perfect place for an exhibition. This is the first time this 1899 landmark building will be open to the public since the bank closed in 1966 and it became a private residence.I am most grateful to Aby Rosen for letting me use this space and for his continued support. I&#x2019;d also like to thank the artists, all of whom I am honored to be able to work with. Joe, Dan, Jeff, Ron, Mark, Harmony, and Julian&#x2014;thank you.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Step inside the landmark this Saturday, from 5 to 8 p.m. It&apos;ll look a little different, but here&apos;s a tour of the inside:</p>
