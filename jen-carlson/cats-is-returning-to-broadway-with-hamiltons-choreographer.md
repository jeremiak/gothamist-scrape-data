<p>One of the most successful musicals of all time, <em>CATS</em>, will be returning to Broadway this summer, with performances beginning July 14th and opening night August 2nd. Here&apos;s what you need to know: <br>
</p><ul><li>It will not be returning to its original home of the Winter Garden Theatre, instead the feline dander will fly at the Neil Simon Theatre (250 West 52nd Street).<br>
</li><li>The revival will be bring back original director Trevor Nunn.<br>
</li><li>There will be all new choreography... provided by Andy Blankenbuehler, choreographer of <em>Hamilton</em> (!!!!)<br>
</li><li>Upon reopening, according to the press release, &quot;Andrew Lloyd Webber will, once again, have the rare distinction of having three musicals running simultaneously on Broadway: The <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>, <em>School of Rock</em>, and <em>CATS</em>.<br>
</li><li><em>CATS</em> was based on T.S. Eliot&#x2019;s &#x201C;Old Possum&#x2019;s Book of Practical Cats&#x201D;?<br>
</li><li>The original run of <em>CATS</em> was 18 years long, which is 89 years in cat life (if you believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530065945/http://www.calculatorcat.com/cats/cat-years.phtml">this crazy formula</a>).<br>
</li><li>The musical opened in 1982, and its final night at Winter Garden was  September 10th, 2000.<br>
</li><li>In total, there were 7,485 performances.<br>
</li><li>During its first run the show took home 7 Tony awards.<br>
</li><li>It remains one of the longest-running show Broadway history.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>The Shubert Organization and The Nederlander Organization (acting as co-producers)  released this statement: &#x201C;In 1982, the arrival of CATS took Broadway by storm. The show went on to dazzle audiences at the Winter Garden for the next 18 years, becoming one of the longest-running shows in Broadway history. We are delighted to join together to bring Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x2019;s phenomenal musical back to Broadway.&#x201D;</p>
