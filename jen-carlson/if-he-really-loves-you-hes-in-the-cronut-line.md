<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030451/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiqueansel">Dominique Ansel</a> handed out roses to the crazy fools in love on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030451/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">Cronut</a> line, which is longer than usual because the true expression of love can only be found at the end of a 3-hour-long, painfully cold wait on line for a pastry. There is something about that in the <em>Kama Sutra</em>.</p>

<p>We reached out to the bakery, and they confirmed the line <em>is</em> longer today&#x2014;&quot;close to 150 starting at 5:15 a.m. We did a survey and a good 70% said it was for a Valentine. We&apos;re doing an entirely pink pastry case today [including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030451/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/27/dominique_ansel_channels_friends_fo.php">those lobsters</a>], so a lot of folks are getting the Cronut and a whole bunch of pastries.&quot;</p>
