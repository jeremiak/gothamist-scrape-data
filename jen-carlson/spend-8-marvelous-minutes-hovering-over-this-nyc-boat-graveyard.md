<p>Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063032/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/03/staten_islands_graveyard_of_ships.php#photo-1">boat graveyard</a> is a strangely beautiful thing to behold, which is typically only seen from sea level. But now we live an the era of drones.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063032/https://www.instagram.com/jerseydrone/">Chad Aaronson</a> took this footage flying his drone over the watery grave in Arthur Kill&#x2014;it&apos;s so vivid and crisp, showing every peeled paint detail, that it makes the whole scene even more surreal:</p>

<p>In 1990s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063032/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/nyregion/a-lesson-in-history-of-old-ships.html">the NY Times</a> reported up to 200 boats in the the marine-salvage yard, from submarine chasers to tugboats, and some dating back to before WWI. It&apos;s unclear how many remain today.</p>

<p>According to an old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063032/http://www.wired.com/2014/07/graves-arthur-kill-ship-graveyard/">Wired</a> article, the boats started piling up over there &quot;in the years following World War II... the adjacent scrapyard began to purchase scores of outdated vessels, with the intention of harvesting them for anything of value. But the shipbreakers couldn&#x2019;t keep pace with the influx of boats, especially once people started to use the graveyard as a dumping ground for their old dinghies.&quot; And here we are, with an entire lot of eternally sinking ships, a rusting homage to New York&apos;s shipping era.</p>
