Before becoming a librarian he was a bookstore clerk, Queens College student, cab driver and under the employ of Sufi Bakery and a butcher shop on Queens Blvd called Joe Salta&apos;s Meats. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Currently he&apos;s a supervising librarian (and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111105313/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/arts/31rese.html">librarian to the stars</a>), but on top of directing New Yorkers to the information they seek, he&apos;s also a member of PEN American Center, on the Board of the Accompanied Literary Society, and an advisor to many. He&apos;s also a vault of information, and a teller of some fascinating stories. Recently he told us about giving Werner Herzog an insider&apos;s tour of the NYPL, about how stacks run all under Bryant Park and about his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111105313/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/sports/16goldstein.html">dear friend Joey Goldstein</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>When was your first visit to the NYPL?</strong> My first visit to the Library at 42nd Street &amp; Fifth Avenue was in 1975. I was living on Third Street between First and Second Avenue and working part time as a clerk for a Doubleday Bookstore, (which enabled me to pay my rent of $135.00). I used to enjoy reading in the Main Reading Room for a couple of hours before going to work. <br>
 <br>
<strong>What is your day-to-day like there now?</strong> I administer two rooms for writers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111105313/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E2DE1439F935A15752C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">the Wertheim Study</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111105313/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DD133DF931A3575BC0A961948260">Frederick Lewis Allen Room</a>. About 230 people are signed up all told; many authors with book contracts, many graduate students and PhD candidates from CUNY and other colleges in the NY area, and several people working on book proposals. I also work the reference desk in the Public Catalog Room 2-3 hours a day where my colleagues and I assist patrons using the Library&apos;s catalog, databases and reference works.  </p>

<p><strong>Prior to working at the library, you drove a cab (amongst other things), can you tell us when that was, and a particularly interesting anecdote from your time behind the wheel?</strong> I drove for one month, August 1977; was mugged twice and quit. Between the hack license fees and the robberies, I lost about a hundred dollars. After that I got a job at the Doubleday Bookstore on Wall Street. Much safer. Louis Auchincloss used to come in the store from time to time.</p>
