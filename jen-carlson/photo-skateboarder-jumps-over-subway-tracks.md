<p>Yesterday ago a tipster sent in the above photo, but our imaging laboratory was closed for renovations and we were unable to verify if it was real or not. Now it&apos;s turned up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1aof0e/skateboarder_ollies_nyc_subway_tracks/">on Reddit</a>, along with a little backstory. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;This photo shot by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://www.allenying.com/">Allen Ying</a> appears in the third issue of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://43magazine.com/">43 Magazine</a> and the footage will be released some time this month from MandibleClaw. Mandible Claw released a Subway themed edit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/13/video_there_aint_no_skateboarding_l.php">in 2011</a>, this trick and others will be in the upcoming sequel.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The trick was done <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://jacobireland.tumblr.com/post/45757782020/ive-been-waiting-to-share-this-till-43-magazine">at the 145th Street stop</a> in Harlem. And MandibleClaw, who shot it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://mandibleclaw.blogspot.com/2013/03/soon.html">writes</a>: &quot;We waited till about 5 a.m. to get this trick but it was worth it. I wasn&#x2019;t sure Koki was going to do it when we went down, but after a few run ups he landed it first try.&quot;</p>

<p>Before <em>you</em> try to attempt this, amateur skateboarder, please review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">our stories on subway fatalities</a>, and revisit the end of <em>Beat Street</em> when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705220907/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/nyc_as_seen_on_tv.php#photo-12">the third rail kills off two taggers</a>.</p>
