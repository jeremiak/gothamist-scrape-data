Next up is The Doors <em>Strange Days</em> cover, photographed by Joel Brodsky.</p>

<p>Since Jim Morrison refused to appear on the cover of the album, Brodsky drew inspiration from Federico Fellini&apos;s 1954 circus film, <em>La Strada</em>, and photographed a group of acrobats and jugglers on the streets. Apparently they had trouble finding models, since most circuses were out on summer tours. The trumpet player is actually a cabbie that the art director grabbed from a passing cab. He offered him $5 to appear in the shot, and the driver apparently called him later and asked where he could further his modeling career. The muscleman was the doorman at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071627/http://www.friarsclub.org/">The Friars Club</a>. </p>

<p>The location of the photoshoot was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071627/http://www.nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID009.htm">Sniffen Court</a> (named after architect John Sniffen) and can be found at 150&#x2013;158 East 36th Street. Wow, something might actually get us to go to Murray Hill. If you don&apos;t want to go, you can watch this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071627/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj_AQbyeJNs&amp;search=sniffen%20court">video of Sniffen Court</a>. The back cover of the album <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071627/http://doors.iscool.com/albums/strangedaysb.jpg">can be seen here</a>. </p>
