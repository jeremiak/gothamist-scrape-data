</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ve seen the old New York City Transit Authority Graphics Standards Manual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144155/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/27/extra_extra_377.php">before</a> (if you can get your hands on one, you&apos;ll find the book is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144155/http://www.flickr.com/photos/19896816@N00/4177364324/">pretty hefty</a>)&#x2014;designed by Massimo Vignelli and Bob Noorda, the manual lays out the official typefaces, colors, and signage design for the city&apos;s subway system. (Sadly, they didn&apos;t include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144155/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/16/nyc_transits_top_typos.php#photo-5">how to spell</a> everything.) And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144155/http://thestandardsmanual.com/">now the entire manual is online</a>. </p>

<p>Discovered inside of a locker under some gym clothes at the New York office of Pentagram, this first edition copy of the manual was scanned by some employees of the company, who then created a minisite which allows you to flip through the entire thing. All 182 pages are available for the masses... at least, the ones who are into this sort of thing. Click through for a preview&#x2014;it&apos;s a thing of beauty.
