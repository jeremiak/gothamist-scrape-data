										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0409747.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185428im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0409747.jpg" width="350" height="252" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier this morning we got a concerned email about a commercial-size jet flying uncomfortably low over Lower Manhattan, where buildings were being evacuated. Another tipster at 2WFC said announcements in that building declared &quot;there&#x2019;s no emergency and that we all need to stay inside.&quot; Soon after word came out that it was just Air Force One, keeping New Yorkers on their toes! From the newswire: &quot;AUTHORIZED FLY-OVER OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY BY AIR FORCE ONE FOR A PHOTO SHOOT. THE PRESIDENT WAS *NOT* ON BOARD.&quot; </p>

<p>The Staten Island Advance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185428/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/faa_says_lowflying_plane_over.html">has a photograph</a> (the first one was allegedly posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185428/http://www.businessinsider.com/first-pic-of-hudson-scare-plane-posted-on-twitter-2009-4">on Twitter</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185428/http://blogs.wsj.com/middleseat/2009/04/27/readers-did-you-see-the-low-flying-jet-over-lower-manhattan/">the Wall Street Journal</a> is now reporting that &quot;Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said the Defense Department is conducting a photo op that involves deploying two F-16s and escorting a Boeing 747 in the vicinity of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty.  Mr. Peters says the maneuver was not an emergency and was coordinated in advance with the FAA and state and local officials.&quot; No word on why civilians weren&apos;t pre-warned about this.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief&apos;s Boeing 747 is called Air Force One when he is on board.  The National Geographic Channel had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185428/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/on-board/all/Overview/22">show about the plane</a> and even has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185428/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/on-board/all/Overview/22#tab-paper-airplane">links for you to download PDFs</a> to make paper Air Force One planes.  After the jump, a video from National Geographic&apos;s trip on the 747 with soon-to-be-President Barack Obama, heading to the Inauguration from Chicago.</p>
