<p>How many times do we have to tell you? Never take your light saber to a bar. Bad, bad idea. Today&apos;s lesson in leaving your light saber at home is courtesy of Flynn Michael, an engineer from Bed-Stuy who is now offering a $100 reward for the return of his saber. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428163004/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/6/dtg_jedimaster_2012_02_10_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, back in September Michael put his custom made $400 light saber &quot;beneath the bar&quot; at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428163004/http://www.yelp.com/biz/project-parlor-brooklyn">Project Parlor</a>, and when he went to grab it a little after 2 a.m., it was missing. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re wondering about that <em>$400</em> light saber, now is a good time to mention that Michael is the founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428163004/http://www.newyorkjedi.com/">New York Jedi</a>, an academy we&apos;ve written about here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428163004/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/01/video_lightsabers_meet_segways_in_b.php">before</a>, where he&apos;s &#x201C;teaching people how to be heroes.&quot;</p>

<p>So what&apos;s a Jedi to do? Michael told the paper, &#x201C;Who steals somebody&#x2019;s light saber? I finally got my uber custom saber, and then some jerk walks out with it. I guess that&#x2019;s the joke&#x2014;some Jedi I turned out to be.&quot; But there may be hope&#x2014;he claims he caught the thief on the security camera, and convinced the cops won&apos;t be of any help, has been posting flyers around. He even came face to face with the alleged thief in December, but the man denied stealing the saber. </p>

<p>If you want to fight the Dark Side, keep an eye out for the alleged thief (the Brooklyn Paper has a photo) and send any intel to thrillsandskills@gmail.com.</p>
