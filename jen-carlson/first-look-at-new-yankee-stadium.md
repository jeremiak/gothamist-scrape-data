</div></div><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075444/http://www.diamondhoggers.com/2009/01/exclusive-virtual-tour-of-new-yankee.html">Diamond Hoggers</a> has a first look inside the new Yankee Stadium, which includes a new shiny locker room complete with giant hot tub and Yankee logo carpeting. Elsewhere there&apos;s an indoor batting cage for rainy day sluggers, as a sign hangs outside stating the date the park is to be born: 2/17/09. That&apos;s the day construction is set to end, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075444/http://njmg.typepad.com/yankeesblog/2008/11/2-17-09.html">reportedly</a> &quot;some of the workers on site are wearing buttons that say, &apos;YANKEE STADIUM, 2-17-09&apos; as a motivational reminder.&quot;</p>

<p>While the site notes that nearly everything else is the same as the old stadium, even &quot;those legendary bleachers out in right field,&quot; there is one noticeable difference so far: The scoreboard is apparently more modern looking in the new park. However, the public has a while before getting their seats on the new bleachers: The Yanks won&apos;t host their first exhibition games until April 3rd, 2009, which happens to be the same day that Mets host their first exhibition games at their new home, CitiField.</p>
