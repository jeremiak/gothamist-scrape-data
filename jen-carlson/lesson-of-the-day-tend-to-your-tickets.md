Seems a girl filed a complaint against her ex-boyfriend and even though it was deemed ridiculous he still had to face it, which resulted in nearly two days at central booking. Turns out he had a warrant out for an old ticket given to him for riding his bike on the sidewalk. </p>

<p>We&apos;re guessing this sort of thing happens a lot, and here are some highlights which may prompt you to take care of any outstanding tickets asap!:</p><blockquote>11:30pm &#x2013; taken to anther room&#x2026; the final room before freedom. There are cups in this room. Dirty cups. One of those office sized water bottles is just sitting mouth up in the middle of the floor about a quarter full. Is it 24 or 72 hours before you suffer adversely from dehydration? I forget. I have a drink&#x2026;tasted metallic.<p></p>

<p>1am - A room, 50 x 50 perhaps, benches line the walls, the central floor is open. Milk containers and old PB&amp;J; sandwiches are crammed under the benches to make room for the 40 or 50 guys that are spending the night. It stinks. It stinks bad. I smuggled in some chapstick and shoved some gobs up my nose to try to deal. I find a spot on the grimy cement and lay some claim&#x2026; moving a foot any direction is not possible due to the body next to me. </p>

<p>2:01am &#x2013; Music starts blasting. Deep trance, heavy base, no lyrics&#x2026;. Terrible music, torturous music. I suppose the guard on duty could have played some ironic bluesy stuff. This was just sadistic. In 18 hours I&#x2019;ve had one glass of poison water, half a bagel, and one slice of pizza&#x2026;been handcuffed, photographed and transported. Now on the vibrating hard floor I just hope not have to spend another night.</p></blockquote>Read the whole story after the jump...<p></p>
