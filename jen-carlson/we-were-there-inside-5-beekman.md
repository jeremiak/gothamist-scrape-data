</div></div>					<p>We had the chance to explore the amazing 5 Beekman building when we were filming a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022172118/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/live_from_gothamist_house_small_bla.php">Gothamist House</a> session there last October. This place is like the Grey Gardens of downtown, with signs from the past peeking in through the dust that&apos;s gathered, but now the owners hope to give it new life in the form of a luxury hotel. The two towers that overlook the gorgeous atrium would be penthouse suites, across from those on the roof would be a rooftop bar, and there are plans for a lounge in the cellar (someone affiliated with the building told us earlier today: &quot;the project has had some delays but I am hopeful that 2011 will be a very exciting year for 5 Beekman.&quot;)</p>

<p>Nearly everything would stay the same as far as aesthetics... but hopefully they&apos;ll improve the elevator. It was the third elevator in all of New York City, and it currently takes a few nerve-racking moments to ride it up to the atrium. Click through for photos from our visit...</p>
