										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="snookimorrison0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223330im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/snookimorrison0311.jpg" width="365" height="240" class="image-right"> </span>Last night Snooki, of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223330/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> fame, went to college! Rutgers University invited the reality show starlet to come by for a Q&amp;A;, to the tune of $32,000. As everyone is pointing out today, that&apos;s $2,000 more than the school gave Toni Morrison for her commencement speech later this year. However, this booking was made by a student-run committee, using the mandatory student activity fees undergraduates must pay with their tuition. <em>But still!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223330/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/03/snooki_of_jersey_shore_gets_2k.html">NJ.com</a> was on hand to find out what nuggets of knowledge this pint-sized fist-pumper had to offer today&apos;s youth. Nearly 1,000 students showed up for the two separate Q&amp;A; sessions, which were set up like a mock <em>Inside the Actors Studio</em>; admission was free, and some stood in line for <em>seven hours</em>. Once inside, they were handed down knowledge like, &quot;study hard, but party harder.&quot;</p>

<p>One pre-med student thought they got Snooki for a bargain, saying, &quot;Honestly, I thought they would have paid her more.&quot; (Get your doctors appointments out of the way in the next 6 years or so!) Allegedly the students wanted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223330/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/08/aziz_ansari_comedianactor.php">Aziz Ansari</a>, but he cost $75,000&#x2014;and as long as Aziz is making more than Snooki, we can sleep at night.</p>
