										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170854/http://gothamist.com/tags/naomicampbell">Naomi Campbell</a> is keeping her right hook sharp; her latest victim found himself on the wrong side of an ABC camera. During a recent interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170854/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/naomi-campbell-outburst-abc-news-blood-diamond-questions/story?id=10365701">the network</a> asked her if she was given a &quot;blood diamond&quot; by the former Liberian president Charles Taylor&#x2014;who is currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170854/http://www.charlestaylortrial.org/">on trial</a>. The interview will air tonight during a Diane Sawyer report regarding Taylor&apos;s case and crimes against humanity. Campbell has allegedly refused requests to be interviewed about the allegations, something that could &quot;help link Taylor to the possession of uncut diamonds used to fuel a campaign of terror in Sierra Leone between 1997 and 2001.&quot; </p>

<p>When pressed for details about the diamond, Naomi refused to answer any questions, stood up, and punched the camera being held by a producer. For added dramatic effect, turn on the volume to hear a loud glass-smashing sound. Good thing she wasn&apos;t wearing that huge diamond!</p>

<p>Earlier this year the supermodel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170854/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/05/naomi_2.php">pre$$ured a driver</a> into not filing charges after she punched him.</p>
