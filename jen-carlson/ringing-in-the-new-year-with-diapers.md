For one thing, there are long bathroom lines, if not a complete lack of bathrooms all-together. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091739/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01012008/news/regionalnews/lets_potty_like_its_2008_10292.htm">NY Post</a> reports that many channeled the spirit of Baby New Year and one of 2007&apos;s big news stories: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091739/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Nowak">Lisa Nowak</a>.</p><blockquote>&quot;I wear a diaper,&quot; the 30-year-old musician from Tokyo proudly declared, adding that his traveling pals, brothers Taro and Shinsuke Koyama, used the same strategy.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I asked a girl to join us,&quot; said Shinsuke, also 30. &quot;She said I was crazy, and she didn&apos;t want to wear one.&quot;</p></blockquote>Those who wouldn&apos;t wear diapers vowed to &quot;hold it all day&quot; lest they lose their precious spot. Others stopped on their way to the &quot;Crossroads of the World&quot; to wait in nearby long lines before claiming their standing room in the Square. While there were seemingly no major incidents that took place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091739/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/01/happy_2008_new.php">last night</a>, we&apos;re betting there were plenty of public urination fines given out.<p></p>
