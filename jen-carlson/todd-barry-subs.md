<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811120102/http://www.toddbarry.com/news.html">Todd Barry</a>, as you know, is a comedian. However, he wasn&apos;t <em>always</em> a comedian. Todd&apos;s new essay in the New York Times magazine today tells one of his true-life New York stories, pre-comedian days. </p>

<p>This one is all about being a sub at the School for the Deaf...without knowing sign language. Ah, hijinks ensue. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The School for the Deaf needs a sub today,&quot; the woman on the line said.

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know sign language,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; the woman said.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t matter if I know sign language? Wow. I&apos;ll remember this conversation when I get a call from &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
