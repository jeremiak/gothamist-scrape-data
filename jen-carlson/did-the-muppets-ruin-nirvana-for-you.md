<p>We&apos;re not going to take sides on this one, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013855/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/15/in_defense_of_courtney_love_who_is.php">we love Courtney Love</a>, but we also love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013855/http://gothamist.com/tags/muppets">The Muppets</a>, so we&apos;ll just give it to you straight: Ms. Love believes Kermit &amp; Co. &quot;raped&quot; the memory of her late husband Kurt Cobain by ripping off his song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; for the most recent Muppets movie.</p>

<p>According to Love, she has absolute power when it comes to Cobain&apos;s music being used for commercial purposes, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013855/http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/13/courtney-love-kurt-cobain-nirvana-muppets-smells-like-teen-spirit/#.T1-RkmJWq-1">TMZ says</a> she may have sold off half of her rights to a company called Primary Wave Music, who may have also been given the &quot;exclusive right to distribute Nirvana&apos;s entire catalog.&quot; They go on to say that Primary Wave <em>did</em> approve the use in the Muppets movie, as did Dave Grohl (who has a cameo on the movie) and Krist Novoselic. It&apos;s unclear if Love is also supposed to sign off in situations like this. Anyway, here&apos;s the scene Love has an issue with: </p>

<p>So, do you think the Muppetization of Nirvana is a bad thing? Personally, we always kind of liked this fan made video:</p>
