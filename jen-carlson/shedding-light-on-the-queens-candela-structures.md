                            <p>The City Reliquary Museum delves deeper into the somewhat mysterious prefab constructions located on the Flushing Bay Promenade in Queens. They&apos;ll be opening their exhibit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203073956/http://candelastructures.org/info.html"><em>Candela Structures: A New York City History Mystery</em></a> on May 16th, which promises to tell &quot;the story of the underappreciated fiberglass formations and the surprising culture of mystery and misinformation surrounding them, from their origins as exhibit spaces during the 1964 World&apos;s Fair to their current status as neglected but enduring landmarks on the Queens waterfront.&quot;</p>

<p>At the opening reception on the 16th, arts and crafts materials will be provided so guests can sculpt their own Candela Structures, and &quot;Save the Candelas&quot; letters and envelopes will also be provided so guests can petition city officials attend to the sorely needed repairs on the structures.</p>
