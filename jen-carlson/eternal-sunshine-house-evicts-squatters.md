The abandoned residence, used in the Michel Gondry film and located at 59 Orient Avenue in Williamsburg, had recently turned into a squatter&apos;s paradise--something neighbors were not too keen on. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044004/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/39/31_39_bm_crackhouse.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> is reporting that the druggies and prostitutes residing in the house and lurking in neighbor&apos;s yards, have departed. The paper is patting themselves on the back, saying that once their &quot;reporter questioned building owner Carlos Mery, he and his brother replaced the faulty plywood fence with a sturdier barrier, cleared out thick vegetation that gave trespassers cover for their illicit activities, better boarded up the first and second floors of the decaying mansion, and even fixed holes in the third floor and roof to keep vagrants out.&quot; One neighbor noted that once this took place, &quot;the crackhouse problem was solved.&#x201D;</p>
