										<p>In the newest chapter of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211048/http://gothamist.com/tags/girlwalkallday">Girl Walk // All Day</a>, the girl gets a makeover fit for the 1%... and then shows off her new look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211048/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Zuccotti Park</a>. Unsurprisingly, while there, she gets a lot of attention from photographers, and the thumbs down from the protesters for flaunting all of her fancy shopping bags.</p>
