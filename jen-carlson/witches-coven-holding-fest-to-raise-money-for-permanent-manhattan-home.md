<p>A coven of witches is headed to Union Square with the hopes of raising enough dough to build a permanent home right in Manhattan. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172918/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120203/murray-hill-gramercy/witches-plan-cast-spell-over-union-square-at-wiccan-festival#ixzz1lKLYBRAu">DNA Info</a>, the members of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172918/http://www.wiccanfamilytemple.org/">Wiccan Family Temple</a>, who are based out of the Lower East Side, are planning the WitchsFest on July 8th, which will include 50 vendors selling items like those found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172918/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Box_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)">The Magic Box</a>. Probably.  </p>

<p>The high priestess, Hectuba Hestia, says they currently meet at a small rented space inside an old school at 107 Suffolk Street, but would like their very own building with a backyard, where they could perform their Wiccan rituals. Hestia says they do cast spells, and use magic wands, but they do not worship the Devil. Picture Willow before she went all dark (sorry for all the <em>Buffy</em> references, it was that or <em>The Craft</em>).</p>

<p>WitchsFest may happen more than once, depending on how much money they raise at the first one.</p>
