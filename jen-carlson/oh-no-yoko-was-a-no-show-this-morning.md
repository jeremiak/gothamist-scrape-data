<p>Well, if you hauled ass to Central Park at 5 a.m. today, hopefully you weren&apos;t <em>only</em> in it to meet Yoko Ono... because she didn&apos;t even show up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151658/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/20/set_your_alarm_join_yoko_ono_in_cen.php">to her own event</a>! Maybe that was all part of the plan? Or maybe she got scared about meeting strangers in the woods at dawn? <em>Who knows</em>, Yoko Ono is a complex lady.</p>

<p>Anyway, she was probably sound asleep in the Dakota dream-laughing at you all as you stood there sleepy-eyed amongst strangers. One attendee sounded off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151658/http://twitter.com/#!/zingarazumiko/statuses/83160724133777408">on Twitter</a>, saying: &quot;I woke up really early this morning thinking that different musicians were going to get together and play a Yoko Ono tone. instead i got there and everybody was on their own wandering around the park like a homeless person. There was someone there but as soon you sign your name they send you away.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151658/http://twitter.com/LoriZimmer">Others</a> were more specific saying they were handed a map and given little or no direction beyond that. There also may have been some tea in a styrofoam cup.</p>
