The festival&apos;s U.S. arm started in the delightfully kitschy Catskills venue Kutsher&apos;s Country Club, an old Borscht Belt resort; after three years of that, they moved on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141018094128/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/26/atp_festival_is_jersey_shore-bound.php">to Asbury Park</a> in New Jersey last year. Now organizers have announced they&apos;ll be taking over Pier 36 on the East River from September 21st through 23rd.</p>

<p>Organizers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141018094128/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/08/barry_hogan_atp_festival.php">Barry Hogan</a> and Deborah Kee Higgins told Ben Sisario <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141018094128/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/all-tomorrows-parties-heading-to-manhattan/">at the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;I think it will be the change ATP needs to make it positive. Even though we love Asbury Park and had a fantastic event there last year, we have found a killer spot in New York that you can walk to from the Lower East Side. It was a tough decision but we had to do what was right for the event to ensure its continued success in the long run.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This year the festival is curated by Greg Dulli (The Afghan Whigs), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141018094128/http://www.atpfestival.com/newsview/1207131501.php">the lineup includes</a> Philip Glass &amp; Tyondai Braxton, Janeane Garofalo, Lightning Bolt, Lee Ranaldo, Chavez, Kurt Braunohler, Afterhours, Joseph Arthur, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, The Album Leaf, The Psychic Paramount, Braids, Tall Firs, Blanck Mass, Endless Boogie, Demdike Stare and DJ Jonathan Toubin. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141018094128/http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymusa2012/tickets.php">Tickets</a> will cost $199 for the weekend or $60 and $75 for single-day passes.</p>
