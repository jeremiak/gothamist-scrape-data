<p>A new season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517043016/http://laist.com/tags/twinpeaks"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a> is hitting Showtime on May 21st, and we&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517043016/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/03/inside_twin_peaks.php">seeing eerie Laura Palmer billboards</a> around town for a few weeks. But now, just ahead of the premiere, you&apos;ll be able to get your own little piece of the show&apos;s return&#x2014;the MTA has just released a limited edition MetroCard featuring either Laura Palmer or Agent Cooper as part of Showtime&apos;s ongoing ad campaign.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now vending from select machines and station booths, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517043016/https://twitter.com/Showtime">@Showtime</a> Twin Peaks branded MetroCards. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517043016/https://t.co/haQXtCnUvn">pic.twitter.com/haQXtCnUvn</a></p>&#x2014; NYCT Subway (@NYCTSubway) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517043016/https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/864140572017164290">May 15, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170517043016js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>The MetroCard will only be available at select stations, and those are: Bedford Ave, York St, Metropolitan Ave, Bergen St, W4 St, Astor Pl, 14 St 8th, Broadway-Lafayette, 2nd Av, 50 St Broadway, and 50 St 8th.</p>

<p>These stations may see some crowds&#x2014;when the Supreme MetroCards came out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517043016/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/21/hybe_beasts_of_the_subway_wild.php">in February</a>, there were huge lines and big markups on eBay.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> if there&apos;s an agent at the subway station&apos;s booth, ask there first (when we dropped by the machine didn&apos;t have them yet, but the booth did).</p>
