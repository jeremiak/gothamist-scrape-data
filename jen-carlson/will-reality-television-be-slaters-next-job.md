<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="slatersteven0810f.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050342im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/slatersteven0810f.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="image-right"> </span>Oh how the mighty folk hero has fallen. Just one week after JetBlue flight attendant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050342/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevenslater">Steven Slater</a> made a dramatic exit from his job by deploying the emergency slide, investigators may be closing in on what <em>really</em> happened. </p>

<p>Following his exit, Slater became a somewhat of a hero, garnering applause from the working class for his <em><strike>Falling</strike>Sliding Down</em> moment. However, as the days have passed, passengers on the flight have come out and said that Slater&apos;s story was all lies&#x2014;that in fact, the female passenger he lashed out on never hit him, and wasn&apos;t even very rude! Instead, passengers say Slater was inebriated and boarded the flight with an attitude. Though he&apos;s a recovering alcoholic, he <em>did</em> exit the plane double-fisting two Blue Moon beers.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050342/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/jetblue_clues_nix_slater_tale_oSrOsX3t8HggyXIxZmuvAK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, investigators are now &quot;definitely leaning toward&quot; the idea that Slater&apos;s claims about being assaulted are false, since there is no evidence backing his story. JetBlue has allegedly reached out to their most famous flight attendant to get his side of the story, but they have not heard from him yet. They told TMZ, &quot;We have not been asked nor do we plan to promote our brand in this manner for the sake of publicity.&quot;</p>

<p>Slater could be all about promoting <em>his</em> brand, however. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050342/http://www.tmz.com/2010/08/14/steven-slater-reality-show-jet-blue-quit/">TMZ</a> source, &quot;Stone Entertainment is going after Slater to host a show in which various disgruntled workers quit their jobs in extravagant ways.&quot; Slater&apos;s lawyer confirmed that they received an offer, however, it could all be tossed out if his story ends up being a sham.</p>
