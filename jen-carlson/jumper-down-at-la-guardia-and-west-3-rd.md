(The building appears to be residential.) We&apos;ll update when we find out more. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> the latest report is that a female jumper from the 8th floor has landed on a 3rd floor balcony.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> NYU spokesperson John Beckman tells us, &quot;The person who died is not an NYU student.  The building is not an NYU building.  Based on our understanding from the police, the person has not relationship with the University.&quot; He added that in 2009, NYU had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211111300/http://gothamist.com/tags/andrewwilliamsonnoble">one suicide</a>, while so far in 2010 there have been zero. Guess he&apos;s not counting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211111300/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/13/professor_jumps_to_death.php">faculty</a>?</p>
