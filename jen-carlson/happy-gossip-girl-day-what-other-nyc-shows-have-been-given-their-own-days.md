<span class="photo_caption">Which Gossip Girl character are YOU?</span></p>

<p>Today the Mayor of New York City has officially declared it to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113082314/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2012a/pr034-12.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1"><em>Gossip Girl</em> Day</a>. Which... it just sort of feels like we, as a city, are failing America, and the world. The Mayor even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113082314/https://twitter.com/#!/NYCMayorsOffice/status/162571281244491778">XOXO&apos;d a Tweet</a> :( But let&apos;s move on, for tomorrow is NOT <em>Gossip Girl</em> Day, and at least we&apos;ve got that. Anyway, this isn&apos;t the first time a television show has been given its own day&#x2014;we asked the Mayor&apos;s Office of Media and Entertainment what other shows have been given the honor. Here&apos;s the list we were given:<br>
</p><ul><li>The Today Show<br>
</li><li>Sesame Street<br>
</li><li>The View<br>
</li><li>Regis &amp; Kelly<br>
</li><li>Tyra Show<br>
</li><li>Montel Williams<br>
</li><li>As the World Turns<br>
</li><li>Cyberchase<br>
</li><li>All My Children<br>
</li><li>Third Watch<br>
</li><li>Conan O&apos;Brien<br>
</li><li>Guiding Light<br>
</li><li>Law &amp; Order<br>
</li><li>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</li></ul><br>
Guess the Mayor&apos;s office isn&apos;t a fan of the SVU spin-off. While we were told that they&apos;re unsure when they started handing out this honor, &quot;the City has issued proclamations to TV shows, movies and theatrical productions for many years.&quot; And why not, if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113082314/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/yarn_bombing.php">Yarn Bombing</a> can be given a holiday, so can a show about rich, white, over-privileged Manhattanites.<p></p>

<p>And speaking of Blair &amp; Co., the Mayor&apos;s office visited the set today as their 100th episode looms, noting &quot;that 2011 broke all records for television production in New York City.&quot; Over the past five years, <em>Gossip Girl</em> alone has spent $200 million on local development and employed approximately 6,300 individuals&#x2014;so we suppose that&apos;s worth celebrating. Even if the locals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113082314/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/16/more_new_yorkers_complaining_about.php">don&apos;t always love it</a>.</p>
