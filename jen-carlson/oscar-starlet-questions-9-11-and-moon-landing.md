Nonetheless, Cotillard sides with the conspiracy theorists when it comes to 9/11...and the moon landing! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180027/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7273651.stm">BBC News</a> has a partial transcript:</p><blockquote>&quot;We see other towers of the same kind being hit by planes, are they burned?&quot; she asks. &quot;There was a tower, I believe it was in Spain, which burned for 24 hours. It never collapsed. None of these towers collapsed. And there [in New York], in a few minutes, the whole thing collapsed.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The Twin Towers, she claims, were a &quot;money sucker&quot; that would have cost much more to modernise than to destroy. </p>

<p>The actress goes on to cast doubt on the Moon landing of 1969. &quot;Did a man really walk on the moon?&quot; she asks. &quot;I saw plenty of documentaries on it and I really wondered. In any case I don&apos;t believe all they tell me.&quot;</p></blockquote>Well, WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein (who got the lease shortly before the attacks) <em>did</em> get a rather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180027/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/24/world_trade_cen_5.php">large insurance payout</a>. As for Cotillard, she also noted that, &quot;I tend to believe in the conspiracy theory,&quot; and finds them &quot;addictive.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180027/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ilisUg2KBMUnsTwLciuOMD_yXloA">Her lawyer stated</a> that the actress &quot;never intended to contest nor question the attacks of September 11, 2001, and regrets the way old remarks have been taken out of context.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Only one way to settle this, she needs to face off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180027/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/21/bill_maher_does.php">with Bill Maher</a>!</p>
