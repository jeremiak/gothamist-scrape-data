                            <p>Do you think Space Invader and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206190115/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> are staying at the same hotel? The French street artist is in town for a residency of his own (and he just screened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206190115/http://jonathanlevinegallery.com/?method=Blog.NewsDetail&amp;entryID=0391FC48-B269-A900-A7DFDA2392C67A0F">his film</a> here, too). Invader&apos;s pieces started turning up on Lower East Side buildings this week, and presumably his porcelain tiles will be popping up elsewhere, though he won&apos;t say how long he&apos;s in town for. In an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206190115/http://www.newsweek.com/paris-street-artist-invading-new-york-banksy-leaves-1299">Newsweek</a> he said as much, and also talked a little about the appeal of NYC to street artists: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;New York is the Mecca of Art in general and street art in particular. This is my fifth invasion wave in the city, which I started invading in 1999 at the very start of my project &apos;invasion of the world,&apos; but it is so huge and dense that I could come a hundred times without being satisfied. New York would need as many space invaders as Paris, which counts more than 1,000 of them.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The street artist (who hides his identity like Banksy) was also in the film <em>Exit Through The Gift Shop</em>, as his cousin is Thierry Guetta, a.k.a. Mr. Brainwash. You can follow along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206190115/http://instagram.com/invaderwashere">on Instagram</a>, where his first post from New York is of a piece in Chinatown: </p>
