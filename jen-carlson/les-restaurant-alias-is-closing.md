<p>The Lower East Side has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122556/http://gothamist.com/tags/riples">losing a lot of establishments</a> lately, and now the Clinton Street mainstay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122556/http://aliasrestaurant.com/">Alias</a> will be closing in the near future, though no exact date has been given yet. The owners of the restaurant, which has operated out of its space at the intersection of Clinton and Rivington Streets for 11 years, announced the news in a letter to customers:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;After 11 years on Clinton Street, we&apos;ve decided to retire Alias Restaurant and hand over the proverbial baton to the next generation of entrepreneurs. However, before this happens and in traditional Alias fashion, we&apos;d like to celebrate with you and thank you, our friends and neighbors, who&apos;ve helped to make our business the success that it has become over the last decade. So please do drop in as often as you can over the next few weeks as we pull out all the stops and celebrate all that Alias the &apos;Fresh Friendly Neighborhood Restaurant&apos; has become known for.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>What will become of the space? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122556/http://www.wildedibles.com/">Wild Edibles</a> has applied for a liquor license and aims to make it a seafood and tapas restaurant called Black Crescent, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122556/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2013/05/alias-on-clinton-street-is-closing.html">the Lo Down</a>. Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122556/http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb3/downloads/sla/2013/04/20-%2076%20Clinton%20Street.pdf">papers show</a> that they plan to be open 7 days a week, until 4 a.m.&#x2014;so this will also operate as a bar.
