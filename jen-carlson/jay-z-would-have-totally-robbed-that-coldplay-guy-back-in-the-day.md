They have a lot in common these days: famous wives, lots of money, etc. But in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151216015058/http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/839060-jay-z-i-would-have-robbed-chris-martin-as-a-teen">an interview</a> Jay-Z says if they met in his earlier days, he probably would have robbed Martin, saying, &#x201C;I was a different person then. I wasn&apos;t open to the world and to the cultures. I would have been, &#x2018;Yo! Who are you? Give me your money.&apos; You couldn&#x2019;t have a guy like Chris walking through Marcy. He&#x2019;d have to get robbed. At best.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Now Martin has responded in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151216015058/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/10/chris-martin-to-jay-z-we-dont-believe-you-you-need-more-people/">the latest issue of XXL</a>, saying,&#x201C;He definitely wouldn&#x2019;t have taken my sneakers because mine were always a lot too dirty for him. I don&#x2019;t know. He wouldn&#x2019;t have touched me then. He&#x2019;s too sweet underneath. I don&#x2019;t believe that from him.&quot; Yep. Someone who wrote a song called &quot;Every Teardrop Is A Rainbow&quot; would totally say something like that.</p>
