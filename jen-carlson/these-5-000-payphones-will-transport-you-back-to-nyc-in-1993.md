<p>5000 payphones in Manhattan have been given a new life with an amazing project that will transport anyone who picks up the receiver back to 1993. In conjunction with the current exhibit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092430/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/1993.php">at the New Museum</a>, the &quot;<a href="www.nyc.recalling1993.com">Recalling 1993</a>&quot; project brings prerecorded messages to the payphones. The messages deliver an oral history of the neighborhood you&apos;re standing in during that year.</p>

<p>One of the organizers of the pro-bono project tells us it &quot;turns every Manhattan pay phone&#x2014;from Inwood to the Financial District&#x2014;into geo-located time capsules from 1993 featuring hundreds of never-been-told stories and memories from WNYC&#x2019;s Brian Lehrer, the Village Voice&#x2019;s Michael Musto, CUNY&#x2019;s Suzanne Wasserman, Mario Batali, Chazz Palminteri, Fern Mallis, Doug E. Doug, Robin Byrd, James St. James and many more.&quot;</p>

<p>To access the nostalgia trip, you just have to deal the toll-free number: 1-855-FOR-1993 from any Manhattan pay phone. You&apos;ll then hear &quot;hyper-local, personal accounts&#x2014;from memories of the World Trade Center bombing in the Financial District to the club culture at Limelight in Chelsea to the opening of Angels in America in Midtown.&quot; When we called this number from our phone, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092430/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_%22Speed%22_Levitch">Speed Levitch</a> told us to &quot;get off the cell phone you&apos;re calling from, find a street corner, pick up the first payphone you lay your eyes on,&quot; and dial the number to find out &quot;what is was like to be a real New Yorker in 1993.&quot;</p>

<p>There is 4.5 hours of recorded content, and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092430/http://clients.droga5.com/droga5Media/New_Museum-Recalling_1993/Recordings/">hear a sample here</a>.</p>
