In fact, you are one of the safest neighborhoods in New York City, surrounded by a shield of shiny luxury condos. But while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723172231/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/12/stabbings.php">the machete slashing</a> may have cooled off <em>for now</em>, &quot;police officers remain vigilant about incidents involving a roving homeless population.&quot; Could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723172231/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/th_precinct_cops_address_grand_larcenies_wAKoj2ayGT1GUDXQlFbRLO">the Post</a> be speaking of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723172231/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/17/gutter_punks_part_deux.php">gutter punks</a>?</p>

<p>A deputy inspector told the paper that &#x201C;It was a pretty uneventful summer&quot; and crime complaints are down 9.57% compared to last year. Most crimes committed were home invasion, grand larceny, identity theft and purse snatching. </p>

<p>The aforementioned transients proved a concern at a recent community board meeting, where the deputy declared that they &quot;don&#x2019;t want to go to the shelters. They are moving on. I haven&#x2019;t seen the problem for over a month ... they&#x2019;re not in the 94&quot; [th precinct]. Allegedly they&apos;ve gone to the South Side of Williamsburg, so it looks like they&apos;re the 90th precinct&apos;s problem now.</p>
