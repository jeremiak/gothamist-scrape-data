<p>It&apos;s very difficult to pinpoint what New York City can <em>feel</em> like to you at any moment. Sometimes it feels magical, or scary, or vast, or small and you&apos;re running in to your ex like <em>all the time</em>, maybe it feels empty, or too fast, or beautiful in a way that&apos;s so overwhelming you know you can&apos;t live anywhere else even if that guy next to you is totally peeing on your bag of overpriced groceries. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206163254/http://gothamist.com/tags/colbymoore">Colby Moore</a> has successfully captured different <em>feelings</em> of New York City in his past few videos, and his latest may be the most perfect yet.

Below, enter a New York City of sadness, beauty, stillness, and that &quot;am I about to get murdered?&quot; feeling in a way that makes us never want to leave:</p>
