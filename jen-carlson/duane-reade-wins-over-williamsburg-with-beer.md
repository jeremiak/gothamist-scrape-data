										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:325px; "> <img alt="drbeer011311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422010258im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/drbeer011311.jpg" width="325" height="244"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422010258/http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlposse/4736236524/">Aman*Duh&apos;s Flickr</a></span></i></div> Williamsburg&apos;s Duane Reade moved into their new spot on Bedford Avenue (located right across from mainstay King&apos;s Pharmacy) late last year, only to be met by angry young locals and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422010258/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/05/williamsburg_locals_band_together_b.php">their boycotting</a>. So Duane Reade decided to take a few tips from that sleezy frat boy at the end of the bar, and get those locals nice and drunk. It won&apos;t be long before they&apos;re all waking up surrounded by Duane Reade-branded bags filled with Duane Readed-branded items and wondering what happened last night. Poor King&apos;s Pharmacy, always such a <em>nice guy</em>.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422010258/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/business/14beer.html?_r=1&amp;hp">The NY Times</a> takes a look at the bar that the chain opened inside their Bedford store, which specializes in hard to find beer; they hand out samples, and you can even have your growlers filled up. Mike Dunning, assistant manager, tells them, &#x201C;We knew we would have a little bit of a battle to try to bring Duane Reade into this community, because they really don&#x2019;t like a chain store. With each of our newer stores, we&#x2019;re trying to find what works in our community.&quot; He notes that in the Bronx they carry Goya items, and in Harlem they have &quot;40-foot-wide sections of African-American hair products.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in Williamsburg, they even made the bar look like a subway station. Because hipsters love when things that aren&apos;t subway stations look like subway stations? Duane Reade&apos;s VP of Marketing says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really a young hipster community so we thought [the bar] would work well.&quot; Will locals drink the <strike>Kool</strike>Beer-Aid? One 25-year-old thinks so, saying Kings may soon lose customers to the chain. Like a heartbroken boyfriend, Kings has &quot;no comment&quot; on the situation.</p>
