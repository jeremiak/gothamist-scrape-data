<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> Just around 11 a.m. we got word that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200012/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/video_coyote.php"><em>the</em> coyote</a> was running down the West Side Highway&apos;s bike path with aviation following his every move. Just moments later the newswire alerted us that the coyote had been cornered in a nearby parking garage around Canal Street, where authorities managed to tranquilize him. We await footage, but above is our mock up of what the incident most likely looked like. We&apos;ve also contacted the aptly named Wiley Norvell at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200012/http://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a> and will update when we get his  comment on this latest threat to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200012/http://gothamist.com/tags/bikelane">bike lanes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Norvell tells us, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve said it a million times, &#x2018;Coyotes don&#x2019;t kill people. Cars kill people.&#x2019; When less than 5% of traffic fatalities in NYC are coyote-related, I am shocked and outraged to see a harmless coyote so unduly harassed.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200012/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/manhattan/coyote-near-west-side-bike-path-20100325-kc">MyFoxNY</a> has some footage of the coyote&apos;s capture. He has since been transported to the Manhattan Animal Care &amp; Control on the Upper East Side.</p>
