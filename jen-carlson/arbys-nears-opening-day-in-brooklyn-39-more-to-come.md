And boy oh boy, is it the fanciest Arby&apos;s you ever did see. <p></p>

<p>Opening in the historic land-marked Gage and Tollner space on the Fulton Mall, 25-year-old Arby&apos;s franchise guy Ray Chera tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001140/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/11/06/2009-11-06_arbys_steaks_claim_to_historic_home_of_gage__tollner.html?r=ny_local">the Daily News</a> that the &quot;jaw-droppingly beautiful&quot; space is one of 40 Arby&apos;s he plans to open in the city over the next 10 years. So we have that going for us. He also notes, &quot;We&apos;re making a couple of minor additions to the interior, but we took great pains to leave the space exactly as it is.&quot; The Landmarks Conservancy says they&apos;ll be keeping a watching eye on the roast beef dealer, who have already adorned the facade of the building with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001140/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/29/arbys_1.php">a big ol&apos; Arby&apos;s sign</a>.</p>

<p>At least one resident is planning a boycott, saying, &quot;It&apos;s a little soulless. I don&apos;t care if it looks like Trump Plaza; I&apos;m not going to Arby&apos;s.&quot; </p>
