title: Video: Here's What One Brooklyn Man Did Every Day For The Past Year
---

	
										<p>Brooklynite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420043915/https://vimeo.com/88672173">Irsten Horowitz</a> has put together a video that features one second from every day of his past year (&quot;I used an app called One Second Everyday to stitch the seconds together&quot;). The video takes you from March 6th, 2013 through March 6th, 2014, and features people like Sting, Paul Simon, is that Neil Young at the 5:03 mark?, a woman vacuuming in her underwear, puppies, biking, a bagel, snow, snow, snow, strippers, a subway, a subway <em>fight</em>, sunsets, alcohol, and... this guy may be having too much fun. Ah, looking at someone else&apos;s life: never gets old?</p>
