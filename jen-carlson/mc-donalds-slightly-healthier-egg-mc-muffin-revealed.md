<p>Like a siren calling you to shore, McDonald&apos;s and its breakfast offerings are nearly impossible to resist if you wake up hungover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604040049/http://www.examiner.com/article/mcdonald-s-breakfast-hours">before 10:30 a.m</a>. The fast food chain is one of the rare ones to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604040049/http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/the-best-fast-food-breakfast-sandwiches-egg-mcmuffin-sausage-bacon-egg-croissants-mcdonalds-white-castle-wawa-starbucks-dunkin-donuts.html">use real eggs</a> in their sandwiches, which also include salty cheese, salty meat, salty bread product, and salty salt. And now they&apos;re making a very slightly healthier alternative: the Egg White Delight McMuffin, which they&apos;ll start slinging on April 22nd.</p>

<p>A McDonald&apos;s rep tell us this new sandwich will pack 250 calories, which is really only 50 calories less than the classic&apos;s 300.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604040049/http://www.thedailymeal.com/mcdonald-s-rolling-out-egg-white-delight-mcmuffin-nationwide-april-22">the Daily Meal</a>, &quot;The egg whites are cooked free-form on the griddle with a spatula, and will join a slice of American cheese and Canadian bacon on a whole-grain English muffin. Egg whites will also be made available on all the other breakfast sandwiches the company offers.&quot;</p>

<p>The sandwich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604040049/http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/eggwhitedelight.html">was tested</a> last November, &quot;and sales proved that it deserved a nationwide release&quot;&#x2014;at the very least, they&apos;ll do better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604040049/http://www.forbes.com/sites/marketshare/2013/03/12/mcdonalds-fish-mcbites-flounders-new-product-line-doesnt-hook-consumers/">the Fish McBites</a>.</p>
