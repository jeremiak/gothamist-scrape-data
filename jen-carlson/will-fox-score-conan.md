According to reports, he&apos;s been presented with the outline of a deal for a show on Fox, but no official offer has been made. This is according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165942/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i56ed42b9a46f855488b8059a05ad933e">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, who note the talks aren&apos;t exclusive, and allegedly &quot;O&apos;Brien has been pitched about two dozen ideas for his next TV gig, including five or six legitimate enough for consideration.&quot; Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165942/http://www.tmz.com/2010/03/18/conan-obrien-fox-affiliates-the-tonight-show/#ixzz0iY28LrEV">TMZ reports</a> that Fox execs have been in touch with several affiliates, &quot;applying pressure&quot; to put Conan on the air during the 11 o&apos;clock hour.</p>
