<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="phpSA4xbOAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061346im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpSA4xbOAM.jpg" width="350" height="255"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Steven Avery</i></div> The defense attorneys from Netflix&apos;s <em>Making A Murderer</em> documentary series <a href="ConversationonJustice.com">are going on tour</a>... <em>for justice</em>. <p></p>

<p>Dean Strang and Jerry Buting were the defense attorneys for Steven Avery, the main subject in the series. Avery&apos;s case is unusual&#x2014;he already had a long rap sheet by his early 20s, for burglary, assault, and killing his family cat by dousing it with gasoline and tossing it into a fire. Then he was imprisoned for 18 years on first-degree sexual assault and attempted first-degree murder charges... but it turned out he didn&apos;t commit that crime. DNA eventually proved his innocence and he was exonerated. </p>

<p><em>But then</em> Teresa Halbach was murdered, and the (probably totally corrupt) Manitowoc County police department arrested Avery. He&apos;s been in jail for that crime since 2005, along with his nephew, Brendan Dassey. Whether or not you believe Avery and Dassey did it, you can probably agree that they didn&apos;t exactly get a fair trial, as the series offered an infuriating look at the failures of our criminal justice system. And that&apos;s what Strang and Buting will be discussing on their multi-city speaking tour.</p>

<blockquote>Strang and Buting&#x2019;s tour will involve the two attorneys in conversation about the Steven Avery case and its broader implications, as well as a discussion on the larger topic of the American criminal justice system. Each night will also feature a Q&amp;A; portion and the opportunity for the audience to address questions directly to Dean Strang and Jerry Buting.
 
At a time when the nation is gripped with pressing questions about the fairness and effectiveness of our criminal justice system, concerns that have been highlighted by true crime narratives from <em>Making A Murderer</em>, Serial and <em>The Jinx</em> to the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, Strang and Buting will be exploring and discussing our process of justice today and throughout history. Reviewing these situations, they will highlight the imperfections in our judicial system and suggest improvements that are sorely needed.</blockquote>
