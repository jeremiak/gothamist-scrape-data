<p>An NBC employee here in New York broadcasted the network&apos;s cafeteria menu from earlier today over the Twitter waves. To celebrate Black History Month, they were offering up a delicious selection of fried chicken, collard greens, corn bread, black eyed peas, etc. But then two hours later the sign was mysteriously removed, leaving diners with a <em>grilled</em> chicken option. It&apos;s unclear what could have possibly prompted NBC to change course (ahem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121080740/http://twitter.com/questlove/status/8644799362">?uestlove</a>), but we hear employees are excited for St. Patrick&apos;s Day, when the commissary will serve Irish Car Bombs.
