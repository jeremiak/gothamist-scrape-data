<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="kaneytweets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/kaneytweets.jpg" width="640" height="334" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Rapper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> recently, and <em>finally</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057/http://twitter.com/kanyewest">joined Twitter</a>. He may be fashionably late to the 140-character game, but he&apos;s delivering&#x2014;and possibly even <em>dominating</em>. His little lexical gems have included, &quot;Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on,&quot; and &quot;wuuuuuuuuuut I need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057/http://twitpic.com/2al7ni">this goblet</a> in my life!!!&quot; </p>

<p>Naturally, there have been spin-offs&#x2014;our favorite might be the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057/http://twitter.com/budgetkanyewest/status/19916484210">Budget Kanye West</a> Twitter, which transmits messages like: &quot;lovin this new box fan i just got.&quot; A stark contrast to the rapper&apos;s feed, where he&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057/http://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/20005295645">stated</a>, &quot;I replaced my bottom row of teeth with diamonds.&quot; And now the comedy team of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057/http://twitter.com/paulandstorm">Paul and Storm</a> have taken <em>New Yorker</em> cartoons and captioned them with real life Kanye Tweets. Perfection. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152057/http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/awesome_of_the_day/2010/08/new-yorker-cartoons-captioned-by-kanye-west-tweets.html">Enjoy them here</a>.</p>
