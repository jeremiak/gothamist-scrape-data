                            <p>Rick Rubin, the legendary 50-year-old gray-bearded producer most recently spotted backing Eminem during his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112458/http://www.spin.com/articles/eminem-saturday-night-live-snl-lip-sync-kerry-washington-video/">allegedly lip synced</a> SNL performance over the weekend, has briefly returned to where it all began. And in doing so, he&apos;s given us the gift of this photograph: </p>

<p>This tableau and its various contrasts are perfect, but it&apos;s even better with context: this is where Rick Rubin started Def Jam Records. Somewhere under the pink patterns and the collage of BFF selfies is the birthplace of the label that brought us the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Run-DMC, and more recently Rihanna and 2 Chainz. Someone go stick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112458/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hose_(band)">a Hose EP</a> or something to the door of room 712 at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112458/http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/def.htm">NYU&apos;s Weinstein Residence Hall</a> please... and maybe encourage the current resident to throw a Rubin-esque rager: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112458/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/index2.html">Rick&#x2019;s most famous dorm party</a> was the bikini contest. It was about 150 people. Packed. Everything about it was unsafe. Surging crowds, straight vodka, gin, tons of beer. Finally the time rolls around for the bikini part, and girls start stripping and people start throwing drinks. I kind of remember Adam Horovitz pouring water over some of those girls.&quot;</blockquote>
