                            <p>Brooklyn&apos;s own Jonathan Lopes is currently recreating the urban landscape with that hot new art medium: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010318/http://gothamist.com/tags/lego">LEGO bricks</a>! (Note to artists: if you want to go viral, use LEGOS. Or paint <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010318/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/mta_not_a_fan_of_metrocard_artist.php">on MetroCards</a>.) The huge undertaking is small in scale, as it has to fit inside of Lopes&apos;s Boerum Hill living room&#x2014;you can check out all of his work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010318/http://www.mocpages.com/home.php/3284">right here</a>. He told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130912010318/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/04/07/2011-04-07_cant_lego_his_vision_brooklyn_man_creating_replica_of_the_borough_in_his_living_.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;It&apos;s challenging to achieve certain aesthetics with the limitations of the brick. I try to get it as real looking as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>The obsession started with, what else, a <em>Star Wars</em> LEGO model he purchased 10 years ago. It was about 4 years ago that he began to work on this current scene, which now nearly takes up his living room&apos;s entire 400-square-feet; he told the paper, &quot;I want it to look like what I see every day when I walk to the subway.&quot;</p>

<p>The buildings in his plastic city are real spots he frequents or walks past in the borough&#x2014;the Fairway in Red Hook, the Williamsburg Savings Bank (12,000 LEGO bricks!), and even a gardening shop on Hoyt Street are all there. He&apos;s nearly done with the model, which will be broken down for parts upon completion, and currently the aforementioned Savings Bank is on display at a dry cleaners at 391 Pacific Street.</p>
