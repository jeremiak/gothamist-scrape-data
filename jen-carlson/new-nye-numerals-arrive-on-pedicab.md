<p>Last year Times Square got a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150916001330/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/11/ball.php">LED-lit ball</a> for its New Years Eve celebration; two years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150916001330/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/14/17_days_from_8s.php">the number 8</a> took the 6 train to the Crossroads of the World; and yesterday morning the numbers 1 and 0 got ushered in by pedicab! The duo will be on display for a week at the Duracell Smart Power Lab at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150916001330/http://timessquarealliance.com/">1540 Broadway</a>. Somehow none of the LED bulbs managed to burst during the surely bumpy ride.</p>
