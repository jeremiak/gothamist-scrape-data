</div></div>					<p>Finally, photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812162306/http://www.sohoblues.com/">Allan Tannenbaum</a> is releasing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812162306/http://www.amazon.com/New-York-70s-Allen-Tannenbaum/dp/1590201728/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238184328&amp;sr=8-1">a new book</a> of photographs that will transport you back to NYC as it was in the &apos;70s. Sex, drugs, street gangs, disco divas, politicians, homeless, celebrities, musicians, hookers, and literally every other thing (and person) that went down during the decade are amongst the images included. It&apos;s nearly impossible to narrow down just a few from the book, but consider this a preview (minus all the sex club, disco orgy, x-rated shots). The book is out April 2nd, and the preface is written by Yoko Ono, with a foreword by P.J. O&#x2019;Rourke.</p>
