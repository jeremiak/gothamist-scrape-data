<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="manne0313.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/manne0313.jpeg" width="350" height="351" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/http://www.michaelaanne.com/">Michaela Anne</a> grew up in a military family, calling many places home&#x2014;by the time she was 18 years old she had lived in twenty different houses. Her dad was a Naval Submarine Officer and transferred over his love for country music to her at a young age. At 11 years old she was listening to heavy doses of Patsy Cline, Hank Williams, and a new country trio of the time: the Dixie Chicks. Eventually she took music lessons from a bluegrass guitarist and singer, and now she&apos;s putting out her own country songs, straight from the heart of... Brooklyn. </p>

<p>Recently ABC&apos;s <em>Nashville</em> has made even the country music genre&apos;s toughest critics tap their feet&#x2014;and the show&apos;s soundtrack was ranking competitively with Taylor Swift&apos;s <em>Red</em> when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/retail/1483743/chart-moves-nashville-nets-years-best-sales-week-for-tv-soundtrack">it was released</a>. Cynical city slickers like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/https://twitter.com/lenadunham/status/299998900029378561">Lena Dunham</a> have also fallen for the show... so we got to wondering: is there a Nashville in New York City? Can those cold New York hearts that have recently warmed up to twang find it in their own backyard? And that&apos;s when we found Michaela Anne&#x2014;for the <em>Nashville</em>-educated, she&apos;s like the Scarlett O&apos;Connor of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The singer/songwriter&#x2014;who moved to New York in 2008 to attend the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music&#x2014;told us, &quot;There was definitely not a country music scene to be found within that world. I actually felt like I had to hide my love of country music for some foolish reason. I was dying to find people who just loved to hear a sad song. For some reason I had felt ashamed of the fact that that was what did it for me. Simple beautiful music.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="MAquote0313.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/MAquote0313.jpeg" width="275" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>&quot;But then I heard about Michael Daves, a great bluegrass guitarist and singer, and I heard that you could take private lessons with him through the school. Through studying with him, I learned about the great roots music scene in New York. It was really refreshing for me to find a community of people who really liked simple, song-based music. But for a long time, I would say I didn&apos;t really have friends here in New York who loved country music like I do... the first few years I definitely questioned why I was here.&quot;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/08/country-musics-biggest-audience-is-in-new-york-city/">last year</a> Nielsen/SoundScan numbers showed that New Yorkers purchased the most country music out of any other city in the nation, including Nashville. At the time, Billboard&apos;s Wade Jessen acknowledged a possible connection: &#x201C;New York City is a very demanding place to live, country music is a great way to put the brakes on a lot of the noise in people&#x2019;s lives.&#x201D; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/howdy_brooklyn_nyc_gets_first_count.php">this year</a> New York City got its first country music radio station in 16 years: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/http://www.nashfm947.com/">Nash 94.7</a>, broadcasting out of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>While country fans are out there in the five boroughs, Michaela Anne tells us the country music scene isn&apos;t <em>that</em> strong &quot;unless you&apos;re using country in the broadest sense of the word. There&apos;s a great scene for American based roots music. Bluegrass, old-time, western swing, honky tonk, some cajun are all really prevalent here. There are some world class players who call New York home, and that&apos;s one of the great reasons to live here if you&apos;re into that music. But as far as a scene of songwriters who are writing and performing what would be classified as &apos;country&apos; music versus any of the other roots genres, I think it&apos;s still a pretty small scene.&quot;</p>

<p>Michaela Anne&#x2014;who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/michaelaanne">currently raising funds</a> to record her new album&#x2014;is one of those musicians that introduces blues and folk into her brand of country, just like some of the younger artists on <em>Nashville</em>...</p>

<p>...and she watches the show, too.</p><blockquote>&quot;I&apos;m a fan! I think the characters and story lines could be called accurate to the scene here or elsewhere. Given that I&apos;m not a commercially successful bus touring superstar I&apos;d probably say that the Gunnar and Scarlett storyline could be most relatable to the scene I know. People working jobs, writing music, seeing your friends gain success or not, seeing relationships sour or flourish because of choices people make to achieve their goals. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s specific to country music, but to life... country music is a genre that typically tries to portray real life in songs. It&apos;s about talking about the day to day struggles, heartbreak, triumphs, hopes. It&apos;s so sincere to the point that it&apos;s easy to make fun of. Hence country music being the butt of many jokes.&quot;</blockquote>But country has been winning fans over for years&#x2014;there&apos;s even an annual Brooklyn Country Cantina at SXSW and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080723/http://brooklyncountry.com/">Brooklyn Country</a> website dedicated to the music genre in NYC&#x2014;so if you&apos;re ready to drink the moonshine, the below guide will get you started.<p></p>
