</div></div>					<p>Brooklyn Bridge Park unveiled new sections of waterfront parkland recently, during a mid-season roll-out of new developed territory. Now as you travel from Jay Street to Pier 6 you&apos;ll spot fields of wildflowers, a new tiny pedestrian bridge, a dog park, a sunken living room created from rocks, and more. Click through (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171919/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/28/brooklyn_bridge_park_peek.php">and here</a>) for a preview, but you can also now experience this all IRL, as most of these sections are now open to the public. Bonus: everything looks so fresh and so green if you&apos;re walking across the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bridge15bbp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171919im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bridge15bbp.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">The bridge is meant to show visitors how the tides come in and out through the day. (Ben Miller/Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>The most welcome addition comes on the DUMBO side of things, where it&apos;s been a barren wasteland around Jay Street in recent years. Now at the end of the street you&apos;ll find the John Street Park, which features a tidal salt marsh amongst its 13,000-square-feet. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171919/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2015/08/brooklyn-bridge-park-opens-john-street-park/">Brownstoner</a> notes that &quot;scattered about the marsh are industrial building footings found during construction, lending some historic character to the park,&quot; which will partially be set in front of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171919/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/24/dumbo_fancy.php">new condos</a> going up.</p>

<p>The Main Street Park under the Manhattan Bridge now has sprawling lawns, a dog run, and a bouldering wall for climbing. This area now also offers public restrooms and an educational center.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the park there are still new features that have not been completed, namely the massive renovation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171919/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/25/inside_empire_stores_dumbos_huge_wa.php">the old Empire Stores building</a>, which will eventually house office and retails spaces. Brooklyn Bridge Park certainly has come a long way, baby&#x2014;check out how the area looked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171919/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/27/brooklyn_bridge_park_before_after.php#photo-1">decades ago</a>.</p>
