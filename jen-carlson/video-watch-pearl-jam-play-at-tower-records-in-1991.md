<p>On August 27th, 1991, Pearl Jam released their debut studio album, <em>Ten</em>. This past August, twenty one years after its release, the album had sold 9,963,000 copies in the U.S., and is still the band&apos;s most popular. Back in the day, however, they were touring relentlessly in support of it, and <em>Ten</em> didn&apos;t really take off until late the following year, when it finally reached #2 on the Billboard charts. Their manager, Kelly Curtis, reminisced about the time, saying, &quot;once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it.&quot;</p>

<p>During that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193437/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam_1991_United_States_Tour">1991 tour</a> the band played Wetlands and The Marquee Room in NYC, and also took their show outside of the traditional venue by doing in-store performances. Below, you can watch their entire set from November 14th, 1991 at a Tower Records (R.I.P.) in Yonkers, New York. It&apos;s almost depressing until you see Eddie Vedder&apos;s smile... and realize that by the next year they would be the musical guest on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, have their own MTV Unplugged special, be playing the main stage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193437/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lollapalooza_lineups_by_year#1992">at Lollapalooza</a>, and appear in Cameron Crowe&apos;s <em>Singles</em> (as well as on the soundtrack).</p>
