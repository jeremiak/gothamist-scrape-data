On board there will be solar and wind-generated electricity, a &quot;greenhouse made from recycled materials&quot; and not much else. Whatever they can grow in there, or catch off the boat, will be all they&apos;re allowed to consume from May through October. During those months there will also be on-board lectures, screenings and art events. The paper reports that &quot;when they aren&#x2019;t farming, fishing, or tending to their proposed chicken coop, the artists aim to educate New Yorkers about global warming, the risks of rising sea levels, and the concept of self-sufficient, nomadic sea cities.&quot; The route hasn&apos;t yet been determined, but if you&apos;re wondering how much this endeavor is costing, the figure is around $800,000.</p>
