title: Video: Dirty DIY Bathroom Gets Cleaned!
---

	
										<p>Silent Barn, the dirtiest venue in New York (unsubstantiated!), recently got a little cleaner. <em>A little</em>. The DIY music venue/art space located in Ridgewood, Queens has one of those bathrooms that make you contemplate adult diapers&#x2014;it is not a pretty sight. In exchange for a video shoot there, one band &quot;paid&quot; the powers-that-be in one bathroom cleaning. This important moment, which like a total solar eclipse probably won&apos;t happen again for another 360 years, was documented:</p>

<p>Do you think that fly tape was holding bed bugs? Don&apos;t worry, the Bar Keepers Friend likely killed the rest.
