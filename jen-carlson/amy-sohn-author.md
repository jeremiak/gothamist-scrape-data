Sohn&apos;s fictional tale, at points, holds a mirror up to the neighborhood, drawing upon the real life happenings there; from celebrity couples to sexless marriages to swingers to stroller-pushers. Last week she told us a little bit about it all, and confirmed that blow job prowess is indeed a fairly accurate measure of one&apos;s self worth.</em></p>

<p><strong>You&apos;re a fashionable, young writer with a kid who lives in Park Slope who wrote a book about a fashionable, young writer with kid who lives in Park Slope.  Isn&apos;t fiction supposed to be stuff you make up? Why didn&apos;t you set it in Fort Greene just to throw people off?</strong> I am flattered you think I am fashionable.  You haven&apos;t seen me on a bad hair day (which always results from brushing it).  Park Slope has a unique combination of leftist values, affluence, and insane people.  You put vegans, breeders, ballers, gays, lesbians, and dog-lovers all in one area and it makes for a lot of comedy.  I mean, we have these characters here - Crazy Opera Man, Crazy Sign-Ripping Man, Intense Garbage-picking Homeless Dude, Boomer Lady Who Yells at Stroller People. But even with all of them to draw on, most of the book is made up.  I drew on real places and events (wallet stealing at the Coop, swinging on ParkSlopeParents, a bike accident) but only insofar as they advanced the dramatic storylines of my made-up characters.</p>

<p><strong>Louise Crawford (Park Slope&apos;s Only The Blog Knows Brooklyn) said your book is perfect for a person who thinks &quot;prowess giving blow jobs is a true measure of your worth as a person.&quot;  Do you think prowess giving blow jobs is a fair measure of personal worth?  Does your book appeal to any other hidden demographics?</strong> I do think blow job prowess is a fair way to measure self-worth.  Many times I have been despondent over various aspects of my life and in those moments I have tried to focus on the good things about me.  My beege prowess is one of them.  I&apos;ve gotten a lot of good head tips over my eleven years writing about sex.  I would give the same advice to Park Slope mothers that I once received in a letter from an ardent reader of my &#x201C;Female Trouble&#x201D; column:  &#x201C;More swallowin&#x2019;, less wallowin&#x2019;.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Louise&apos;s gripe with me seems to be that I am obsessed with being a cool mom.  She is wrong.  I&apos;ll tell you why.  1) In my articles about motherhood, I have made it clear that I don&#x2019;t like cliquishness and high-school-type games among mothers.  Mothers should try to be real with each other and honest.  If this happened, deeper friendships could form, and moms could actually support each other through the many, difficult aspects of early motherhood.  I am anti-cool-obsession.  2)  If I had to categorize myself, I would say I am an uncool mom - and not only because of my Albert Einstein hair.  I don&apos;t do well in moms groups.  I tried to be the Funny Mom but someone had already been cast.  My references were too obscure and I was trying too hard.  Desperation in unappealing in dating and friendship.</p>

<p>My book appeals to anyone who has a sense of humor about Park Slope or any bourgeois bohemian breeding ground, who feels their blood pressure rise when they enter the Coop, who gets annoyed by large strollers, who&#x2019;s ever been in the Teat Lounge, who loves or hates kids, loves or hates breeders, who has witnessed gentrification firsthand, who has contemplated or engaged in infidelity, and who enjoys seventies cinema.</p>
