City officials are sided with the latter group, and have proposed an alternative cleanup plan that would be overseen by the EPA, would take less time, and wouldn&apos;t have such a scary word attached to it.<p></p>

<p>The plan would &quot;allow polluters to voluntarily pay for the cleanup under binding agreements. To help bring them to the table, the officials said, the Army Corps of Engineers could complete a feasibility study it has already begun that calls for the corps&#x2019;s own environmental restoration project at the canal. Such an effort would be eligible for separate federal funding and could reduce the ultimate price tag for the polluters.&quot;</p>

<p>An adviser of Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s said, &#x201C;The goal is to have a Superfund-quality cleanup faster than the Superfund,&quot; but the plan still wouldn&apos;t be completed for 9 &#xBD; years. The E.P.A. is concerned about the plan, saying it &quot;relies on federal allocations that may not be forthcoming and adds to an already complicated process by having both the corps and the E.P.A. tackle parts of the cleanup.&quot; In other words: multiple parties, more problems.</p>

<p>Your opinion counts too, and public comments will be accepted on the proposed Superfund designation through July 8th, and supporters of the Superfund can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151126071145/http://www.superfundgowanus.org/">go here</a>.</p>
