<p>Beloved Connecticut (and Yonkers, NY) grocery wonderland, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130853/http://www.stewleonards.com/">Stew Leonard&apos;s</a>, has moved on from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130853/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">the Cronut</a> with a new offering: a Crogel. Their Norwalk bakery has been experimenting with the croissant-bagel hybrid, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130853/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152502809022678&amp;set=a.163566067677.152760.33439252677&amp;type=1&amp;theater">just announced</a> they&apos;re on sale. Here&apos;s how they did it: &quot;shape croissant dough into the size of a bagel, then kettle boil and hearth baked it. Crispy on the outside... buttery and flaky inside!&quot;</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the store, it&apos;s a pretty crazy supermarket with a maze-like layout and an amazing selection of creative and homemade items, on top of the regular stuff. We&apos;ve been lobbying for them to come to NYC for quite some time... but no dice, yet. In the meantime, before they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130853/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/31/the_dossant.php">trademark</a> this thing, someone in the city please create one.</p>
