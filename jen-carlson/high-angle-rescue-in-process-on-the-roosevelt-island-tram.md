<p>Around 12 noon today the FDNY was called to the Roosevelt Island Tram&#x2014;we&apos;re told by their press office that a worker&apos;s foot is stuck. When we talked to the FDNY moments ago it was believed that the Tram was near Tower 1, coming from the Queens side. The rescuers have taken a second Tram car to reach the worker, and are now helping in the removal process. You can currently expect heavy delays, and we&apos;ll update when we have more information.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 1:12 p.m.:</strong> According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401005341/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/02/05/worker-rescued-after-being-stuck-on-top-of-tram/">to CBS</a>, the worker &quot;got his foot stuck in the apparatus on the top of the tram car,&quot; and was brought inside of the second tram car during the rescue. The FDNY could not confirm at this time if the worker was on top of the Tram, or on the tower when he got stuck.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 1:39 p.m.:</strong> The FDNY tells us the injured was taken to Elmhurst Hospital with right leg trauma. Service has been restored with some residual delays.</p>
