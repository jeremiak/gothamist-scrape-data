The only people who pay more live in Alaska, Hawaii, Fishers and Block Islands. <p></p>

<p>The federal numbers released yesterday were from 2008, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616141527/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/con_ed_wallet_shock_T6Xs8Frt0NF3I6l6qhsD9H">the NY Post</a> reports that the company charges an average 24.18 cents per kilowatt hour, something they dub <br>
&quot;sky high rates&quot; when other areas pay and average of 11.26 cents per kilowatt hour. A rep for the company said, &quot;Many costs are higher in New York than in other parts of the country.&quot; Well, that&apos;s true, but... <em>why?</em></p>

<p>Con Ed is pointing the finger at high state and local taxes, and management of the state&apos;s electric grid. While the state Public Service Commission did promise lower rates ten years ago, after it deregulated electricity, the utility&apos;s prices have only increased since&#x2014;meaning New Yorkers have never paid less than half of the national average. And don&apos;t expect any relief soon&#x2014;in November last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616141527/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/11/con_ed_wants_to_hike_gas_prices.php">it was reported</a> that the Public Service Commission approved a 2010 Con Ed rate hike (resulting in a $6/month increase for residential bills) <em>and</em> they want more rate hikes in 2011 and 2012 to help with their rising costs. Okay then... we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616141527/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/new_trend_freezing_in_your_own_apar.php">a recent Times trend piece</a> on going without heat, up next: living by candlelight?</p>
