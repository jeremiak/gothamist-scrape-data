										<p>Last night television created a new internet superstar (though we&apos;re sure they won&apos;t make <em>any</em> money off this whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140415152059/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike#Background_2">internet thing</a>), when Homer Simpson paid homage to Brooklyn&apos;s own Noah Kalina. You can watch the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140415152059/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B26asyGKDo">original video here</a>, and Homer&apos;s below.</p>

She was negotiating a rate for the song, until they never got back to her. No fee was agreed on, no contracts signed. She and I both assumed that they were no longer interested in using her song for the show. Last night the episode aired and sure enough her song is part of the show. What&#x2019;s up with that?! I am thrilled that the Simpsons parodied me, but Carly should have been compensated.&quot; </p>

<p>Will Homer get some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140415152059/http://www.flickr.com/photos/noahkalina/327570376/in/set-72157594432356323">Hilton-love</a> next?</p>
