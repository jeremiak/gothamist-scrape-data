<p>This Sunday the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711063050/http://bodiesofpyongyang.com/">Bodies of Pyongyang</a> installation was set up outside of St. Mark&apos;s Church. The project is by artist Yoonhye Park and features 20 female performers inside of a 70&quot;x70&quot;x70&quot; clear plexiglass cube, all with the aim of bringing awareness to women&apos;s issues in North Korea. &quot;These tightly packed schoolgirls try to move about the enclosed cube box expressing their emotional pain and struggle. Red strings symbolizing their dual inner states of suppression and resistance entangle the girls further confining their freedom to move within their already limited and hermetic space.&quot; The installation will be back May 2nd (Washington Square) and May 9th (Tompkins Square).</p>
