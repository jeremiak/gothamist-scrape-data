Or lazy. Or living in cramped quarters. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629084817/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/04/2009-10-04_how_green_is_my_city_not_too_much_pros_blame_confusion__lack_of_space.html">The Daily News</a> reports that we&apos;re throwing recyclables in the regular trash over half the time. Some blame confusion, while others point out there&apos;s simply not enough space in cramped NYC living quarters to have a separate container for everything.<p></p>

<p>To that latter point, the paper points out that &quot;neighborhoods that recycle the most household paper, plastic, glass and metal have more single-family homes. Queens has the best residential recycling record, followed by Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx, which recycles only 34% of what it could.&quot;</p>

<p>With all this confusion and lack of space, apartment building owners would rather risk the $25 fine. And, you know, <em>the survival of our planet</em>.</p>
