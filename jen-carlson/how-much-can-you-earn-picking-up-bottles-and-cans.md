Recycling those items, after all, is like looking under the couch cushions of all of New York City&#x2014;if you don&apos;t mind picking through trash, you can probably earn some sweet bucks, right? The site reports back after their well-documented journey, with this final tally):<p></p>

<blockquote>So what can you earn? In a best-case scenario, you can make a bit more than $5 an hour from collection to redemption (untaxed, of course). We each walked away with $2.50 from our trips, but in truth the whole enterprise was a one-man job. On the first run in September, we collected $5.60 for an hour&#x2019;s work; the second run last month netted a smooth $5.25.</blockquote>

<p>Plus, all that walking around and digging through trash in the open air&#x2014;it&apos;s like someone&apos;s paying you to go to the gym (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131121021340/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/20/broke_guy_faces_2000_fine_for_colle.php">don&apos;t use a car</a>)!
