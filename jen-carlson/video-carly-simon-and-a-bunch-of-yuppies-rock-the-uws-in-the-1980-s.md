<p>In an episode of <em>Mad Men</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160539/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/04/last_nights_mad_men_that_wasnt_the.php">this season</a>, Sally Draper refers to the Upper West Side, saying, &quot;We don&apos;t go across the park, there&apos;s bums on the other side.&quot; By the 1980s the neighborhood was gentrified, however&#x2014;and cyclists and yuppies alike were dancing in the streets and getting drenched in champagne. At least, that&apos;s if this amazingly bad Carly Simon video for her song &quot;Why&quot; is to be believed as an accurate portrayal (seems right to us!). This was released in 1982, and (with all due respect to Ms. Simon) somehow managed to become a hit (though it was a fine addition as a sample to the Tribe Called Quest song &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160539/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-j-DCz_V3U">Bonita Applebum</a>&quot;).</p>

<p>The shots appear to be filmed mostly between 73rd and 75th Streets, starting outside of Simon&apos;s old apartment (which she shared with James Taylor through 1983) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160539/https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=135+Central+Park+West&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89c2588c413a51e3:0x8f8802f20b747689,135+Central+Park+West,+New+York,+NY+10023&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=HAn_T-7JM6TL0QGuhbHhBg&amp;ved=0CAYQ8gEwAA&amp;oi=local_group">135 Central Park West</a>. In the video you&apos;ll see the original yuppies infiltrating the neighborhood, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160539/http://pinterest.com/pin/223843043948851940/">old institutions like Ruelle&apos;s</a> on 75th and Columbus.</p>
