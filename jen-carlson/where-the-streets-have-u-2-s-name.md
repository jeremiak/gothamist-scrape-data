title: Where the Streets Have U2's Name
---

	
										<p>Bono &amp; Co. kicked off their week long residency on Letterman last night, and because they are such a Big Deal, Mayor Bloomberg has declared that part of West 53rd Street (leading up to the Ed Sullivan Theater) is now temporarily renamed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232338/http://wcbstv.com/entertainment/u2.on.letterman.2.948880.html">U2 Way</a>. And, perhaps grasping how litigious New Yorkers can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232338/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/13/are_your_sidewalks_frozen.php">when it comes to icy sidewalks</a>, the supergroup was out there yesterday keeping their new street snow-free. (Letterman also addressed the white stuff in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232338/http://lateshow.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/top_ten/index/php/20090302.phtml">Top Ten</a>.)</p>

<p>They also performed, of course, and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232338/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGurpsGKPCg">watch that here</a> (don&apos;t expect anything familiar, they went with &quot;Breathe&quot; off their new album <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232338/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/149460-u2-no-line-on-the-horizon"><em>No Line On The Horizon</em></a>). This Friday they&apos;ll take their show to the Bronx to give the staff and faculty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232338/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/27/u2_to_rock_fordham_u.php">at Fordham</a> a little wake-up concert at 8 a.m. (student IDs are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232338/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/tix/1057150736.html">on Craigslist</a>).</p>
