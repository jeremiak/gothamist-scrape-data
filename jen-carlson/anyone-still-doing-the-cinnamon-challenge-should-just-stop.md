	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smcinnchall0413.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061538im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smcinnchall0413.jpg" width="344" height="350" class="image-left"> </span>Somehow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061538/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/cinnamon.php">the Cinnamon Challenge</a> continues to draw people into its viral web even though years and years of YouTube videos prove that <em>no one wins</em> when it comes to shoving spoonfuls of cinnamon into your mouth. Finally, science is stepping in and attempting to put a stop to this stupidity.</p>

<p>Doctors and poison control experts are now warning people that the challenge is dangerous&#x2014;a report published in the journal Pediatrics today (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061538/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/04/16/peds.2012-3418.full.pdf+html">PDF</a>) finds that calls to poison control centers and visits to emergency rooms have increased, with people (mostly teenagers) suffering collapsed lungs, nosebleeds, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and some even ending up on ventilators.</p>

<p>While sprinkling some of the spice onto your coffee at Starbucks is totally harmless, when inhaled it can cause inflammation and scarring of the lungs&#x2014;cinnamon contains cellulose fibers, which do not biodegrade and can get lodged in the lungs.</p>

<p>Author of the report, Dr. Steven E. Lipshultz, says, &#x201C;People are being poisoned and sickened because of this. We have seen a rise in calls to poison control centers around the United States that mirrored the rise in YouTube videos and their viewing. And that&#x2019;s just for the acute issues.&#x201D; According to the report, the number of calls to poison control centers &quot;has increased dramatically,&quot; from 51 in 2011 to 222 last year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061538/http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/consequences-of-the-cinnamon-challenge/">the NY Times</a>, &quot;Google recorded 2.4 million hits for the topic [Cinnamon Challenge] in 2012, up from 200,000 in 2009. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061538/http://www.cinnamonchallenge.com/">A website</a> devoted to the challenge claims that more than 40,000 videos have been posted on YouTube, and it describes the goal of the challenge as trying to swallow a spoonful of cinnamon in 60 seconds without drinking water.&quot;</p>

<p>Other things you should stop doing: planking, making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061538/http://gothamist.com/tags/harlemshake">Harlem Shake</a> videos, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061538/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/icing.php">icing</a>.</p>
