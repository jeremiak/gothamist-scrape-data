This one could turn out to be the summer of dolphins! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714145600/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/28/dolphins_spotted_off_city_island.php">Yesterday</a> we noted that following the sighting of 150-200 confused dolphins in Long Island Sound on Saturday, a pod of dolphins was spotted off the south end of City Island. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714145600/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-lidolp2912928456jun28,0,171215.story">Reportedly</a> the group had started off as one (they were also sighted last Wednesday in Northport), and has now split in two: the City Island crew (team Bronx) and the the Long Island Sound crew (team Bayville).</p>
