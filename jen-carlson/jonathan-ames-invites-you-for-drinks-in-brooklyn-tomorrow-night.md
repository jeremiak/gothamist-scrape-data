<p>Earlier when we heard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301185012/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/hbo_makes_huge_mistake_by_canceling.php">HBO axed <em>Bored To Death</em></a> (boo, hiss, etc), we reached out to the show&apos;s creator Jonathan Ames. Here&apos;s what he tells us, and you:</p><blockquote>&quot;I invite all fans of <em>Bored to Death</em> to come to the Brooklyn Inn tomorrow night, Wednesday, and I&apos;ll buy you a drink.  John Hodgman will be joining me and perhaps other local New York City actors from the show will be there, and we can all toast <em>Bored to Death</em> and a completely loony and improbable three-year run.&quot;</blockquote>Get there around 10 p.m. and just try not to drink <em>too</em> much.<p></p>
