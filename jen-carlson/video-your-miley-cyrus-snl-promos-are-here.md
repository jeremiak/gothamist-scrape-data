                            <p>This weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005020439/http://gothamist.com/tags/mileycyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> is pulling double duty at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005020439/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>, playing both host and musical guest. Just like Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Mick Jagger, Elton John, Bruno Mars, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, and actually... <em>a lot of others</em> before her. Her promos were just released, where she&apos;s seen alongside Taran Killam wearing a rather conservative ensemble and barely sticking her tongue out. This might be the least controversial thing Miley has done in a while. </p>

<p>We await some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005020439/http://previously.tv/features/sketch-predictor/">sketch predictors</a>, but our money is on a full 90 minutes of conceptual performance art revolved around twerking.</p>
