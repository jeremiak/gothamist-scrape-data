<p>As season two of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717023758/http://laist.com/tags/twinpeaks"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a> was airing on ABC in 1991, David Lynch and the City of New York released an eerie (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717023758/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/01/what_neighborhood_will_our_rats_ove.php">evergreen</a>!) PSA from the director, which addressed NYC&apos;s rat and trash problems. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717023758/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/13/video_david_lynchs_psa_for_nycs_rat.php">The piece</a>, part of the &quot;We Care About New York&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717023758/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6XFkFLblg">series</a>, also featured the work of Lynch&apos;s trusted Director of Photography, Frederick Elmes (<em>Eraserhead</em>, <em>Blue Velvet</em>). </p>

<p>Alas, even Lynch&apos;s fear-instilling masterpiece couldn&apos;t solve the city&apos;s rodent and litter problems, which remain a challenge to this day. What if we told you that all the rats were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717023758/http://twinpeaks.wikia.com/wiki/BOB">BOB</a> and each piece of garbage tossed on the ground will invoke him?</p>

<p>This wasn&apos;t the only short piece Lynch created&#x2014;he&apos;s got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717023758/http://www.lynchnet.com/ads/">a whole bunch of commercials</a> on his resume.</p>
