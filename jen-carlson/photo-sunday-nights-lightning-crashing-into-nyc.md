<p>The storm Sunday night had the Yankees and Red Sox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103911/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/video_yankees_red_sox_players_hilar.php">shaking in their cleats</a>, and who can blame them? Loud noises are scary, and if they stepped outside of their dark dugouts to look at the sky they probably would have been blown away by the BEAUTY OF NATURE. Luckily, intrepid photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103911/http://www.flickr.com/photos/yukonblizzard/8938898297/">Steve Kelley</a> captured the storm as its lightning bolts crashed all over of Manhattan and Long Island City. And as a bonus, one of the city&apos;s prettiest bridges made it in to his shot.</p>

<p>Hey, did someone say <em>lightning crashes</em>?</p>
