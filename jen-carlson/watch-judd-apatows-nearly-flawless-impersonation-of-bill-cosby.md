title: Watch Judd Apatow's Nearly Flawless Impersonation Of Bill Cosby
---

	
										<p>During his appearance on <em>The Tonight Show</em> last night, Judd Apatow dedicated a full minute of his stand-up set to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121085706/http://gothamist.com/tags/billcosby">Bill Cosby</a>&#x2014;a terrible monster whom he has rightfully targeted since allegations came about Cosby&apos;s checkered, rape-ridden past. While previously we&apos;ve only seen Apatow use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121085706/https://twitter.com/juddapatow">Twitter</a> to take down Cosby, this time around he delivered the blows from the stage, using a spot-on impersonation of the disgraced comic.</p>
