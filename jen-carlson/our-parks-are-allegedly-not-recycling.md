Those are for the East River!<p></p>

<p>A Parks employee told the paper that supervisors give orders to &quot;dump everything on garbage trucks, because it&apos;s the fastest solution for cleaning parks.&quot; Oh dear, someone alert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151330/http://gothamist.com/tags/shame">the Shame Shame Shame crew</a> about this! </p>

<p>On top of all that, not even all parks are set up for recycling. Geoffrey Croft, of the watchdog group New York City Park Advocates, said of the 1,875 parks citywide only a small amount have recycling bins, to which a Parks Department spokeswoman declared the department is &quot;committed to recycling.&quot;</p>
