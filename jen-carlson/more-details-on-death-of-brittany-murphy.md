The coroner official now says it &quot;appears to be natural,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054723/http://www.tmz.com/2009/12/20/brittany-murphy-simon-monjack-autopsy-death/">TMZ</a> reports an autopsy will take place either today or tomorrow, despite her British screenwriter husband, Simon Monjack, objecting to one.</p>

<p>The website, which broke the news of the starlet&apos;s death, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054723/http://www.tmz.com/2009/12/21/brittany-murphy-cardiac-arrest-diabetes-vomit-autopsy-coroner/">also reports</a> that Murphy was a diabetic and experiencing flu-like symptoms (taking prescription meds for several days for the latter) &#x2014; on Sunday, she &quot;began vomiting... and told family members she was feeling very ill.&quot; When she was found by her mother, there was reportedly a significant amount of vomit around her.</p>

<p>Allegedly there were a lot of prescriptions found in the house, and while Murphy had denied using hard drugs and having an eating disorder in the past &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054723/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/12/20/2009-12-20_actress_brittany_murphy_dies_at_32_of_heart_attack_report.html">the Daily News</a> reports that her friends had been openly worried about her addiction to Vicodin. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054723/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/actress_brittany_murphy_dead_at_GDDCtbbW2aUw9YveWQhh1J">The NY Post</a> printed a disturbing quote from the star, where she stated, &quot;My worst vice is caffeine. I am also way too high-strung. I can&apos;t even take a Sudafed. Can you imagine? My God. I think my heart would explode. I mean, literally something terrible. That&apos;s awful.&quot;</p>

<p>Murphy was pronounced dead at 10:04 yesterday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Those who knew her wished their public condolences online; Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054723/http://www.bradwalsh.com/2009/12/rip-brittany/">Brad Walsh</a> posted a photo with her on his website, writing, &quot;Brittany Murphy was not a close friend of mine by any means, but we had several times together and I always found her to be very warm, concerned about other people, and a lot of fun. She was a special person.&quot; Meanwhile, her ex-boyfriend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054723/http://twitter.com/aplusk">Ashton Kutcher</a> Twittered: &quot;2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine. My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany&#x2019;s family, her husband, &amp; her amazing mother Sharon. See you on the other side kid.&quot;</p>
