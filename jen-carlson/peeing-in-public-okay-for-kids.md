<p>Aside from being illegal, it is generally frowned upon when an adult urinates in public. Ergo, this is not the kind of behavior you want to teach your children. But what if <em>they&apos;re not your children</em>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174302/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/kid-pees-in-park-again-other-kids-frolic-in-it-i-do-nothing.html">FIPS</a> writer &quot;Bitchy Mom&quot; (who gets very angry about things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174302/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/park_slope_lady_very_angry_at_vegan.php">vegan ballet slippers</a>), relays the story of a recent disturbing encounter she had in Prospect Park:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Out of the corner of my eye I spied a nanny pulling down the pants of her kid... this lady picks up the kid and carries her pants-down to the closest tree where she pees all over the fucking place.... so I just get up and GTFO. THEN today I go back to the park and what do I find? A group of innocent kiddos frolicking in yesterday&apos;s pee soaked wood chips.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Well, it <em>did</em> rain last night. Anyway, should Park Slope children be allowed to relieve themselves in our parks, or is that right reserved for Canada geese and dogs?</p>
