Central Perk next to Monk&apos;s coffee shop next to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233037/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/the_newsroom.php">Hang Chew&apos;s</a>!<p></p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233037/http://www.npr.org/2013/01/23/170074762/friends-will-be-there-for-you-at-beijings-central-perk">NPR</a> paid the faux <em>Friends</em> coffee shop a visit, reporting back that there&apos;s even a Gunther...</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Tucked away on the sixth floor of a Beijing apartment block is a mini replica of the cafe, orange couch and all, whose owner Du Xin introduces himself by saying, &apos;Everyone calls me &apos;Gunther&apos; here.&apos; Indeed, he is a Chinese version of cafe owner Gunther from the show. The extent of Du&apos;s Friends obsession is clear on entry to Beijing&apos;s Central Perk. The level of detail is scary: same window, same doorway. People sitting on the orange sofa are watching TV&#x2014;reruns of Friends, naturally.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>That&apos;s not all, even the menu is an homage to the sitcom, only serving snacks mentioned in episodes&#x2014;&quot;For instance, the menu informs anyone ordering cheesecake that it was&#x2014;in season 7, episode 11&#x2014;the subject of Rachel&apos;s exclamation to Chandler: &apos;You stole this cheesecake. That is wrong!&apos;&quot; Though it seems no one is craving cake at the cafe, the young patrons have admitted to &quot;secretly hankering for the world of casual sexual encounters depicted on [the show].&quot; But those are aspirations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233037/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/how_many_sexual_partners_did_the_ch.php"><em>no one</em> should have</a>&#x2014;Joey alone had over 50 sexual encounters during the run.</p>
