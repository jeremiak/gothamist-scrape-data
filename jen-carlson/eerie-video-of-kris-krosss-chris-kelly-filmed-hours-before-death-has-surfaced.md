Last week Chris Kelly, the 34-year-old best known for being one half of the 1990s hip hop duo Kris Kross, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719050509/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/kris_krosss_chris_kelly_found_has_d.php">was found dead</a> on the couch in his living room. It was discovered soon after that he had both heroin and cocaine in his system, and now footage of him in his home, shot just before he died, has surfaced on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719050509/http://www.tmz.com/2013/05/06/chris-kelly-video-drugged-out-rap-session-hours-before-he-died/">TMZ</a>. The video shows Kelly somewhat struggling to rap along to a song he had reportedly been working on (which contains lyrics about a room full of dead bodies) around 7 a.m., clearly still up partying with friends. Kelly was pronounced dead about 10 hours after this video was shot.</p>
