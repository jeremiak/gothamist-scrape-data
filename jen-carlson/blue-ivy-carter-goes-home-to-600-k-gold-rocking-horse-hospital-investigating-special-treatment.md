<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="babyblue20122.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042811im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/babyblue20122.jpeg" width="300" height="331" class="image-right"> </span>Blue Ivy Carter has left the building. Specifically, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042811/http://gothamist.com/tags/blueivy">baby Blue</a> has departed her private digs at Lenox Hill Hospital to go live with her parents, Jay-Z and Beyonc&#xE9;, in Tribeca. The little diva, less than a week old, left the hospital in a luxury Mercedes van. So, now what? </p>

<p>She&apos;s probably enjoying her new digs&#x2014;reportedly she has a nearly $20,000 crib that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042811/http://www.poshtots.com/baby-furniture/baby-cribs/all-baby-cribs/fantasy-carriage-crib/18/2661/1313/12867/poshproductdetail.aspx">looks like a carriage in a fairytale</a>. And according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042811/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/blinging_up_baby_F2J9meHKafEahag3zPl1JP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, she&apos;s also got a &quot;solid-gold, handmade horse from Japanese jeweler Ginza Tanaka that Jay-Z bought for $600,000.&quot; The kind of person to buy a newborn a solid gold horse for $600,000 <em>certainly</em> wouldn&apos;t be the kind of person to hand over some cash for a birthing room hand built around his specifications, right? </p>

<p>That&apos;s right, Baby Blue may be at home, but BabyGate continues! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042811/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/lenox-hill-hospital-investigates-jay-z-beyonce-security-parents-maternity-ward-article-1.1004317">the Daily News</a>, the head of Lenox Hill Hospital has ordered an internal investigation after non-famous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042811/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/baby_blue_ivy.php">new parents complained</a> they weren&apos;t allowed to see their newborns because the Carter family&apos;s security detail stopped them. Executive Director Frank Danza is now talking to the parents who felt they were inconvenienced by the famous couple&apos;s special treatment (which the hospital <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042811/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/beyonce_jay-z_and_lenox_hill_hospit.php">has been denying</a> even happened). He adds that the couple did not pay $1.3 million to rent out an entire floor, nor did they pay for renovations to the suites, claming instead that &quot;several newly built executive suites&quot; were just completed before they arrived, so the couple got lucky. Right, so the average couple now needs bullet-proofing and tinted windows in their hospital room?</p>
