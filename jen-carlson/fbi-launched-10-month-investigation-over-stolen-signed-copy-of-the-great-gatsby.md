<p>The son of the man who was allegedly the inspiration for Tom Buchanan has filed a lawsuit against a book dealer who is attempting to sell his father&apos;s stolen, signed copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123543/http://gothamist.com/tags/thegreatgatsby"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a>. William Hitchcock, whom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123543/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/fight_for_the_great_dad_sby_6RievlJ3Y8fEt16uHRVHbI?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">the NY Post</a> describes as a Texas oil honcho, says his late Long Island-bred father Tommy was the model for the character, and F. Scott Fitzgerald gifted him with an inscribed copy of the novel. The note reads: &quot;To Tommy Hitchcock for keeps, from his friend F. Scott Fitzgerald. Los Angeles, 1927.&quot;</p>

<p>The prized possession was allegedly stolen in 2006 and the lawsuit claims it was sold on the black market. &#x201C;Someone grabbed it&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t know who. It&#x2019;s still a mystery,&#x201D; Hitchcock told the paper. Rare book dealer James Robert Cahill purchased it for $61,000 at a Bonham&apos;s auction in 2010, and was attempting to sell the novel for $750,000 last April, when it was spotted by a friend of Hitchcock&apos;s. Though Hitchcock say, &quot;I just want my dad&apos;s book back,&quot; he is now suing him for the $750,000. But where is the book <em>really</em>? This <em>Great Gatsby</em> caper gets pretty cutthroat! According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123543/http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/03/06/55476.htm">court documents</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;During his telephone conversation with [attorney Terry] Higham, James Robert Cahill claimed that he had already transferred the book to a resident of the United Kingdom who intended to deface the book by cutting out the pages containing Fitzgerald&apos;s signature and inscription. Upon Higham&apos;s objection to the defacing of the book, Mr. Cahill indicated that he could prevent such defacement of the book, if he chose to do so.&quot;</blockquote>Hitchcock&apos;s lawsuit comes after he tried to deal directly with Cahill, and after a 10-month FBI investigation was launched, where the feds &quot;concluded the case must be handled in civil court.&quot;<p></p>
