<p>More recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025957/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/the-feed-blog/restaurants-bars/?p=2667">TONY</a> hinted that Southpaw owner Matthew Roff planned to sign a lease to take over the space, and today it&apos;s been confimed; from a press release:</p><blockquote>In an exciting development for New York City&#x2019;s performing arts and music scene, <strong>Michael Palms, Matthew Roff, of Southpaw, &amp; Larry Hyland, of Matchless, are taking over the old Galapagos Art Space</strong>!<p></p>

<p>Natural Selection, the new venue, will continue to feature cutting edge programming,  art and music.And, <strong>Galapagos Art Space will continue to be a presence in Williamsburg</strong> by helping to create cultural and community programs that continue to partner the community with the new venue. <strong>Natural Selection</strong>, as its name suggests, will help evolve and develop the Brooklyn arts and culture scene.</p></blockquote>Roff discussed the new name, saying, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re all fans of Darwin, obviously. We were originally going to call it Madagascar&#x2014;we are trying to have some continuity between &apos;Natural Selection&apos; and the new Galapagos.&quot; Meanwhile, look for the <em>real</em> new Galapagos opening up in DUMBO this Spring. <p></p>
