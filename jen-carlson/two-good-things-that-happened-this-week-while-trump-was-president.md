<p>On Fridays we usually deliver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313180547/http://gothamist.com/tags/5goodthings">five good things</a> that happened &quot;this week&quot; in the age of Trump, but this week we&apos;re coming up short. So here&apos;s what we&apos;ve got. Two good things. Two out of five ain&apos;t bad.</p>

<p>This week is a blur, but at some point between Sunday and Tuesday I watched Mike Birbiglia&apos;s new Netflix special, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313180547/https://www.netflix.com/title/80133550"><em>Thank God For Jokes</em></a>, which was a wonderful escape. So good that I may need to watch it four million more times this weekend. I may just crawl into a closet and hide under a blanket and watch it over and over again until I die from laughing and/or old age. Both? Fingers crossed.  (Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313180547/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/birbiglia_always_with_the_jokes.php">our review from the off-Broadway production</a>.) </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313180547/http://laist.com/2017/03/03/superbloom.php">over in Southern California</a>, they&apos;re about to get a super bloom after the heaviest rainfall in nearly a decade. And not just any flowers, <em>wildflowers</em>, and not just growing out of dirt, <em>growing out of the goddamn desert ground</em>. Check out a preview: </p>
