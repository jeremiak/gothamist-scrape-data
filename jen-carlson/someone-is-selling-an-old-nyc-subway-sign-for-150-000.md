<p>How much is a 100-year-old subway sign worth? A seller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613011856/https://www.etsy.com/listing/509552025/times-square-subway-station-sign-nyc-irt?ref=shop_home_feat_1">on Etsy</a> has got one listed for $150,000. The sign is a simple black and white design, with the words &quot;Times Square&quot; on it. The seller, Scott Stein (a.k.a. Streetreasure) says the piece measures 8&apos; x 11&quot;, and was made by the Baltimore Enamel Company on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>He told us, &quot;I acquired this sign at The New York Americana Pier Show almost 20 years ago [and] have been collecting and selling vintage signage for even longer as a hobby. There is no paperwork with this piece&#x2014;as with most of all old New York street and subways signs they were scrapped or kept by workers who later sold them off.&quot; </p>

<p>The Baltimore Enamel Company, which manufactured the sign, &quot;was one of the oldest producers of Porcelain enamel signs in America. They started with license plates in 1903,&quot; Stein says. He added that his asking price was determined by factoring in &quot;the rarity of this item and its World Famous Location factor.&quot;</p>

<p>Six years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613011856/http://www.collectorsweekly.com/stories/11083-vintage-new-york-city-times-square-subwa">someone posted</a> the same (or a similar) sign on Collectors Weekly, noting that they purchased it at the Antiques/Americana Show in Manhattan in 2011, but were uncertain of how old it was.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the Transit Museum to see if they could confirm its authenticity and worth. We&apos;ll update if we hear back. But if you&apos;re a history buff on a budget, note that over on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613011856/http://web.mta.info/nyct/materiel/collectsales/">MTA&apos;s site</a>, you can buy authentic items like a subway seat (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613011856/http://web.mta.info/nyct/materiel/collectsales/pdfs/mc08406.pdf">$500</a>) and grabholds for a bargain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613011856/http://web.mta.info/nyct/materiel/collectsales/pdfs/mc08414.pdf">at 25 bucks</a>!</p>
