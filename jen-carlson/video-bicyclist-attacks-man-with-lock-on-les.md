---

	
										<p>Recently a Starbucks customer witnessed a scuffle outside the store between an older gentleman and a bike messenger. The witness described the incident, on the the corner of Allen and Delancey, as such: &quot;they ran into each other at the intersection. the old guy just wouldn&apos;t leave the bike dude alone, so the bike dude totally let him have it, POW! KRYPTONITE LOCK TO THE FACE LIKE 3 OR 4 TIMES!&quot; Lucky for us, he filmed it:</p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/AUFiowOcnIw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529012230oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/AUFiowOcnIw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>Lesson: Never mess with a bike messenger unless you have your own Kryptonite (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529012230/http://www.kryptonitelock.com/">the metal kind</a>, that is).
