First off, even though sidewalks are city property, they are the responsibility of homeowners, who can be held liable for injuries. When a homeowner is issued a violation, they have to repair the sidewalk via a private contractor, or through the DOT, which may take a while.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816092528/http://www.timesnewsweekly.com/news/2009-11-05/Local_News/HURRYING_TO_FIX___QNS_SIDEWALKS.html">Times Newsweekly</a> reports that the DOT &quot;aims to have work crews repair defective sidewalks in most areas of the borough within 45 days of receiving a request submitted by a homeowner in writing or online. According to the agency, there are currently more than 5,000 properties&quot; in Queens alone that have sidewalk violations. This may be why this new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816092528/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot//html/pr2009/pr09_048.shtml">pilot program</a> just launched in that borough.</p>

<p>The new Expedited Sidewalk Repair Program has raised the DOT&apos;s normal rates of $8 to $9 per square foot, to $11 to $13 per square foot (&quot;Based on the average 200 square feet of sidewalk adjacent to a typical one-family home in Queens, homeowners could be charged anywhere between $2,200 and $2,600 if it is determined entire pathway must be repaired&quot;). They note there&apos;s a similar program for the Parks Department regarding uprooted trees causing sidewalk damage... or you can save your money and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816092528/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/15/more_trees_more_problems.php">call in Arnold Diaz</a>.
