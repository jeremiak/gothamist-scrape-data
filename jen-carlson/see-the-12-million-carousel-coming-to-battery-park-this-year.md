Anyway, this $12 million &quot;21st century&quot; SeaGlass carousel is set to open in Battery Park in October&#x2014;it will simulate fish-swimming patterns, and feature fish, dolphins, angelfish instead of traditional merry-go-round land animals. It will also place riders <em>in</em> the fish, instead of on top of them. The sea life were created by Broadway set designer George Tsypin, who worked on <em>The Little Mermaid</em> musical.<p></p>

<p>The aquatic-themed carousel is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822153929/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/construction/project_updates/battery_park_enhancements_95278.aspx">46-feet-wide</a> with a spiraled turntable designed to simulate the ocean floor. WXY Architecture&apos;s Claire Weisz says, &#x201C;In addition to a carousel, it&#x2019;s a theater. For people of all ages, it will create one of those moments when you feel great to be in New York City.&#x201D;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822153929/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/spin-citysea-themed-carousel-set-battery-parkcome-sea-spin-city-article-1.1319980">the Daily News</a>, Battery Conservancy President Warrie Price helped raise around $4 million in funds for the project, while the other $8 million comes from city budgets and the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. Price says, <strong>&quot;There is nothing like this in the history of carousels.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>There was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822153929/http://www.thebattery.org/projects/seaglass/">a &quot;topping off&quot; ceremony</a> today when the final roof panel was placed on the structure, which sits where the New York Aquarium was from 1896 through 1941.</p>
