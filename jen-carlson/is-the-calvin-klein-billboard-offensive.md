<p>C&apos;mon New York, are we such prudes that we can&apos;t handle a little denim clad foursome? People are reportedly up in arms over the latest Calvin Klein billboard that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155508/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/06/14/2009-06-14_risqueacute_business_calvin_klein_billboard_in_soho_too_sexy_say_some.html">the Daily News</a> says &quot;seems to show a teenage girl in a threesome&#x2014;with suggestions of a foursome.&quot; </p>

<p>Located at Lafayette and Houston Streets, not too far away from the always risque <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155508/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/24/seen_on_the_cor_2.php">American Apparel ads</a>, the billboard has been called &quot;borderline pornographic&quot; by locals, who are also raising eyebrows at the youthfulness of the girl in the ad. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155508/http://wcbstv.com/local/racy.ck.billboard.2.1044421.html">one tourist</a> visiting from Texas said, <strong>&quot;I think it&apos;s telling people it&apos;s okay to do that, and it&apos;s kind of gross.&quot;</strong> Sure, <em>tourists</em> may be shocked at the idea of four clothed jean-lovin&apos; kids dry-humping, but have the rest of us really not come this far since 1981, when a 15-year old Brooke Shields posed spread eagle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155508/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK2VZgJ4AoM">in a commercial</a> declaring that nothing would come between her and her Calvins?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the business side, an Ad Critic for Adweek Media Magazine thinks the billboard is &quot;a desperate act for Calvin Klein,&quot; but the company says the &quot;intention was to create a very sexy campaign that speaks to our targeted demographic.&quot;</p>
