<p>Did you know the original Sub Pop version of Nirvana&apos;s video for &quot;In Bloom&quot; was filmed at South Street Seaport? The video, filmed in 1990, features Kurt, Krist and Chad (Channing, the band&apos;s original drummer) goofing off inside the South Street Mall... and Wall Street, too. </p>

<p>In June&apos;s issue of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050500/http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201106/nirvana-20-years-later">GQ</a>, the magazine looks back at the band 20 years after the release of <em>Nevermind</em>. Alan Mintz, Nirvana&apos;s lawyer, adds to the oral history they&apos;ve compiled, saying, &quot;I was a music attorney, and they came up to my office. <strong>I asked them, &apos;What&#x2019;s our goal here? Is it to do another record for Sub Pop?&apos; Kurt leaned forward and said, &apos;Get me off this blankin&#x2019; label&#x2014;I want to sell millions of records.&apos;</strong> They left me a cassette of their demo. The next day I was walking down the street, singing to myself and racking my brain: &apos;What is that song?&apos; It hit me that it was the chorus to &apos;In Bloom.&apos; I called the band and said, &apos;Let&#x2019;s do this.&apos;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Love also added this gem: &quot;Kurt had more presence and more beauty than Brad Pitt&#x2014;who wanted to play Kurt, by the way. He was a leader, he was strong, <strong>in fact he was well fucking hung, if you really want to know</strong>.&quot; (Jonesing for more of those Love-isms?
