The photo was originally taken by photographer Jason Lee Parry (who specializes in topless photography) last year. He is now being sued by the model&apos;s parents&#x2014;the retailer, and two other stores (including Brandy &amp; Melville in SoHo) are also part of the suit. The teen&apos;s parents filed yesterday in Manhattan Federal Court, and say while they knew about the photoshoot (which was for a magazine), and the specific photo, they never approved it for the shirts. </p>

<p>In the photograph, she is &quot;revealing portions of her breasts... in a spread eagle position making her crotch area the focal point of the image may portray a child in a sexually suggestive manner and may be in violation of one or more federal and/or state laws.&quot; The suit also notes that the girl is shown in other photos from the same shoot drinking a beer, riding a motorcycle without a helmet, and showing her pubic hair. (Where were her parents <em>during the shoot?</em>) Parry allegedly agreed with her former modeling agency not to release the images, and now claims they were stolen.</p>
