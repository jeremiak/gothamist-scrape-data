title: Emergence Art on Governor's Island
---

<p>Coinciding with the opening of Governor&apos;s Island, the Emergence Art Show launched on May 31st; the exhibit is housed in a couple of the abandoned mansions on the island. The summer exhibition includes:</p><blockquote>Experimental and participatory art involving more than 30 artists/collectives, with a strong emphasis on audience and artist interaction. Using the theme, &quot;Creative Pioneers in Uncharted Territory,&quot; exhibitors will use the context, history, and recent steps towards revitalization, or &quot;emergence,&quot; of Governors Island as the source of inspiration and departure for the creation of participatory art exploring the human condition.</blockquote>The site-specific show will change throughout the season due to its interactive nature; see more of the installations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054038/http://emergenceshow.blogspot.com/">here</a> and head over yourself, the show is open Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Need more than one reason to make the journey to Governor&apos;s? Curator of the show, Johan Kritzinger, also has the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054038/http://figmentnyc.org/home_html/">Figment Festival</a> coming up at the end of the month. Not enough? There&apos;s also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054038/http://www.figmentnyc.org/2008/projects/minigolf.html">City of Dreams mini golf course</a> set up for the season! Get over there before July 26th though, when the Emergence Art Show will cease to exist. <p></p><div class="galleryEase" id="gallery-0">

<div class="galleyEaseInfo"><div class="galleryEaseInfo"><p>Erik Fabian &quot;No Rules: Governors Island Edition&quot;, 2008 

Concept: A simple imagination game of offense and defense. This game unveils a series of impending dooms that befall the City of New York, to which a series of bold counter attacks are carried out in the nick of time. It places the heroic Governors Island between beloved New York City and utter destruction. </p></div>
