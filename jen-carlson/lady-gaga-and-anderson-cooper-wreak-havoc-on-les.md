<p>It&apos;s been a glorious two months since we last posted about Lady Gaga (what <em>was</em> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171424/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/26/whats_in_lady_gagas_casserole_dish.php">that casserole dish</a>, anyway?)&#x2014;but now that she&apos;s got a new album coming out, the Fame Monster has hurled herself back into the spotlight. In fact, <em>right now</em> she is on the Lower East Side with CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171424/http://evgrieve.com/2011/01/breaking-anderson-cooper-interviews.html">EV Grieve</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171424/http://www.catsitterinthecity.com/2011/01/cat-sitter-in-city.html">via</a>), the two were strolling down Stanton Street (her former stomping grounds), and may have broken into her old apartment building at 176 Stanton. Or something! Here&apos;s what we know:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It appears that they enter the building for a tour... afterwards, the pair walk toward Clinton Street, where a police car pulls up. Lady Gaga says hello, etc. They move on. Then! The police car pulls in front of 176 Stanton, where someone who could be the super emerges and starts screaming and gesturing. Basically, he&apos;s pe-od that Lady Gaga got into the building... Minutes later, the super is still screaming.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the NYPD to see if they&apos;ve apprehended a severely under-dressed pop star, but according to an eyewitness, just after 2 p.m. Cooper and Lady Gaga were seen hugging in front of Earth Matters. So everything seems just fine, and almost... adorable.</p>
