Maxfield Parrish&apos;s 25-foot King Cole mural, owned by the St. Regis Hotel, just got restored to its original splendor at that exact price. The $12M painting hadn&apos;t been cleaned in 40 years, and since there wasn&apos;t a smoking ban for most of that time, and the painting hung in the hotel bar - the appearance suffered. This cleaning was one of the last parts of a $35 million refurbishment of the hotel.</p>

<p>Back in January, as the painting went in for its cleaning, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144447/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/nyregion/17painting.html?ex=1326690000&amp;en=f4d92f135310c5c7&amp;ei=5088">NY Times</a> reported on its condition: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Now, the painting suffers from cracking and from a scattering of dents, even splashes of alcohol. Worse, it is coated with a decades-old layer of brownish grime and nicotine residue that has not only hid the artist&#x2019;s technical mastery, but has also obscured a century-old joke embedded within the image.&quot;</blockquote> 

<p>The masterpiece went back on view in the King Cole Bar &amp; Lounge at the St. Regis starting today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144447/http://www.nysun.com/article/55640">The NY Sun</a> reports that originally the work was commissioned in 1906 by Colonel John Jacob Astor for his Knickerbocker Hotel on 42nd Street. It then hung on many a wall around the city until taking its place on a wall at the St. Regis in the 1930s. Since then many look at the painting as a symbol of New York elegance, and a signature feature of the hotel.</p>
