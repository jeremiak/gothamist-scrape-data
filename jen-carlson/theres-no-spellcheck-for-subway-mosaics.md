<p>This typo was spotted over the weekend on the G train platform. Could it simply be an MTA error that has gone unnoticed, or is it the handiwork of a subway mosaic mash-up artist (if such a thing exists)? The MTA says they weren&apos;t aware of the error and told us that while they &quot;can&apos;t imagine we&apos;ve done any work there recently,&quot; they&apos;re going to look into it. Too bad people can&apos;t post comments on subway stations; the typo would have been corrected immediately. </p>
