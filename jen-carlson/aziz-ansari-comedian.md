He launched off the stand-up stage to get his own MTV series (Human Giant), is now in an anxiously awaited spin-off of The Office (he clears up the plotline below), and he&apos;s been busy filming movies with the likes of Seth Rogan and Paul Rudd. Not too shabby. This weekend he returns to New York, after moving out to Los Angeles&#x2014;catch his Glow in the Dark Tour (not to be confused with Kanye&apos;s) at Comix this Friday or Saturday (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025415/http://azizisbored.com/tour.html">buy tickets</a>).</em></p>

<p><strong>How has LA been treating you?</strong> So far, so good. It&apos;s warm most of the time. I am very glad to be back in NYC this week though. </p>

<p><strong>What do you miss most about NYC?</strong> Going to Momofuku Ssam, eating burgers at Shake Shack, and seeing my friends (in that order - sorry friends, I gotta be honest). </p>

<p><strong>What can you tell us about the Office spin-off show? Is it actually a spin-off? When will it air?</strong> It originally was going to be a spin-off, but when Greg Daniels and Mike Schur were creating it, they decided to make it a separate world with no affiliation to the characters from The Office. The cast so far is myself, Amy Poehler, and Rashida Jones. </p>

<p>All I can say at this juncture is Rashida plays a nurse named Ann who&apos;s boyfriend has a strange injury that leads her into the world where Amy and I work. That&apos;s the only info NBC has released up until now. I can however reveal the show is exclusively sponsored by Arby&apos;s, so there are a lot of plotlines involving characters eating roast beef sandwiches and the show premieres in April.</p>

<p><strong>You&apos;ve recently been in a few movies, can you tell us about what the experience has been like?</strong> Very fun. I was lucky enough to get a few small roles in movies that I believe should be very funny. </p>

<p>In the summer, I filmed a part in &quot;Observe and Report,&quot; a new movie about Seth Rogen being a mall cop that should be out in April. I play a lotion stand operator named Kevin that loves Chick-fil-A (a trait I brought over from my real life). I also filmed a small part in this movie &quot;I Love You, Man&quot; starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, where I play one of Rudd&apos;s fencing pals. . </p>

<p>In the past few months, I&apos;ve been shooting on &quot;Funny People,&quot; Judd Apatow&apos;s new movie and that has been amazing. I play a standup comedian named Randy that is very high energy in a Katt Williams like way and is obsessed about telling jokes about receiving fellatio. It&apos;s been a lot of fun, because I was able to write all my character&apos;s standup and Judd let me bring a lot of my own ideas to the character. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&apos;s not all good news. I was supposed to be the villain in &quot;Fast and the Furious 4,&quot; but the part was recast due to creative differences between me and Paul Walker.</p>
