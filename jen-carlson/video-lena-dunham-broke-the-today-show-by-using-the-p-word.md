title: Video: Lena Dunham Broke The 'Today' Show By Using The P Word
---

	
										<p>Lena Dunham is back promoting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212193107/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/12/to_all_the_girls.php">her &apos;life in Brooklyn&apos; documentary series</a> <em>Girls</em>, as the final season of the series kicks off on HBO this Sunday, February 12th. During her appearance on the <em>Today</em> show this morning, she brought things to a pretty PG level for morningtime viewers, using the word &quot;penis&quot; during her interview with Maria Shriver. Despite &quot;penis&quot; being a scientific term, it completely threw Shriver off, launched her into a giggle fit, and caused her to completely malfunction for what seemed like a lifetime on live television.
