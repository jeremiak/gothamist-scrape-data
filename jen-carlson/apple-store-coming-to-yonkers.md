<p>Grab some tissues <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143920/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/08/marty_markowitz_uses_ipad_to_beg_fo.php">Marty Markowitz</a>, because Yonkers is about to get an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143920/http://gothamist.com/tags/apple">Apple Store</a> <em>before</em> Brooklyn. We&apos;re told that the company&apos;s next New York-based store will be opening this Saturday, June 30th, in what looks to be a strip mall off I-87.</p>

<p>The store, located at 143 Market Street will be open to the public at 10 a.m. We&apos;ve contacted the company to find out why Yonkers, and not, say, <em>Brooklyn</em>, got the coveted storefront first, and will update if and when we hear back. <em>(Not that the good people of Yonkers don&apos;t deserve one.)</em> The last rumor we heard was that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143920/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/fuggedaboutit_brooklyn_nycs_next_ap.php">Queens might be next</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143920/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/apple_boosts_all_gct_shops_x3Sr2L1ivkvnq8IPpuXq7I">other Apple news</a> (besides the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143920/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/24/report_apple_hoping_its_retail_empl.php">news that its retail workers don&apos;t make commission</a> and don&apos;t get very good raises or have many chances for advancement), the company&apos;s Grand Central outlet is giving other businesses in the terminal a business boost, averaging a 7.5 percent hike in profits since the store&apos;s opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143920/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/more_photos_of_the_grand_central_ap.php#photo-1">in December</a>. Tenants say, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s definitely bringing in more people...&quot; and &#x201C;a lot of times, the customers already have their Apple products in hand when they walk into the store. It has definitely helped sales.&#x201D; Looks like the Cheesecake Factory and Dick&apos;s Sporting Goods are looking at an uptick in business starting this weekend!</p>
