<span class="photo_caption">Oak Bridge is close to one of the happiest places in Manhattan, says non-scientific study (Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213205105/http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinyca/4610581278/">christinyca&apos;s flickr</a>)</span></p>

<p>Do you have a happy place in New York City? Earlier this year a site called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213205105/http://onehappybird.com/2012/03/22/question-where-is-the-happiest-place-in-new-york-city/">Computational Story Lab</a> uncovered some happy spots in Manhattan via gathering information on Twitter. So if you Tweeted that you were having the <em>best time ever</em> at a concert in Central Park, that would have qualified. In total they used &quot;more than a half million messages from 2011 to investigate the happiness of NYC streets and avenues.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213205105/http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2012/12/the-happiest-place-in-new-york-city.html">Inside the Apple</a> revisited the non-scientific findings recently, noting that the site used a &quot;list of words that had previously been ranked as indicators of happiness and connect[ed] them to geotagged Twitter posts throughout the city.&quot; Many of the happy Tweets came from the Upper West Side, and the happiest place in all of Manhattan was determined to be &quot;somewhere near the hypothetical intersection of Seventh Avenue and West 77th Street. This is on the Ramble side of the lake and is full of serene and picturesque spots.&quot;</p>

<p>The original &quot;study&quot; notes that the West Side is happier than the East Side (but only by a little bit), and that happiness declines as one moves further uptown. Their heat map only shows 16th to 116th Street, and portrays a pretty content Midtown... so this map may more accurately show tourists bragging on Twitter about how wonderful their trip to the big city is:</p>
