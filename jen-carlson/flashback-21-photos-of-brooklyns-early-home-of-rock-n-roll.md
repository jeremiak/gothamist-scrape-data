</div></div>					<p>If you&apos;ve ever seen the movie <em>La Bamba</em> then, on top of the insurmountable tragedy, you witnessed a recreation of an all-star performance at Brooklyn&apos;s Paramount Theater. Built in 1928, the theater held 4,124 seats, showing movies and hosting concerts. It closed in 1962, just a few years after Ritchie Valens performed there in 1958. Valens&apos;s performance was part of the legendary Alan Freed &apos;50s rock &apos;n&apos; roll Jubilees, which would (according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095940/http://books.google.com/books?id=yY-qrbtfonUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=paramount+theater+ritchie+valens+brooklyn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y0Mx9meT37&amp;sig=CbK6djfTHCPoDoQb-NHwMzYcFcs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1GMgTpueH8rTgQfa0OTjBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramount&amp;f=false"><em>The Day The Music Died</em></a>) be &quot;all-day affairs,&quot; with performers delivering the same set of songs several times throughout the day. Fun fact: The Chirping Crickets (led by Buddy Holly) even shot their album cover on the rooftop of the Paramount, &quot;using the natural blue sky as a backdrop.&quot;</p>

<p>Long before it became an early home of rock n&apos; roll, vaudevillian acts like Mae West, crooners like Bing Crosby, and jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington were center stage.</p>

<p>These days the theater is serving as a gymnasium for Long Island University, where the original Wurlitzer organ remains (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095940/http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/618">Cinema Treasures</a> notes it&apos;s still used for basketball games). While some say it&apos;s moved way past its glory days in appearance, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095940/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/entity.php?id=5709">still has</a> a &quot;grand staircase, wrought iron Juliet balconies, huge deco chandeliers and 40-foot high white wedding cake ceiling.&quot; Click through for photos from one of Freed&apos;s concerts back in 1958. The last live rock n&apos; roll stage show there was Clay Cole&apos;s Easter Parade of Stars, with headliner Jackie Wilson.</p>
