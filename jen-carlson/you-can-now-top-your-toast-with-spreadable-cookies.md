                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="COOKIEbutter1013.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071803im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/COOKIEbutter1013.jpg" width="640" height="334" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Why didn&apos;t anyone tell us about Cookie Butter? Apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071803/http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Speculoos-Cookie-Butter/dp/B006KK4GUO">Trader Joe&apos;s</a> makes some, based off of the cookie butter that originated in Belgium, where they make a gingerbread flavored Speculoos version. But why stop there? America has its sugar-coated hands on this beast now, so let&apos;s <em>take it to the limit</em>.</p>

<p>A NYC-based company called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071803/http://www.gooeyontheinside.com/">Gooey on the Inside</a> has announced their own line of smooth, creamy spreadable cookie, with flavors like Red Velvet White Chocolate Cream-Cheese Frosting (that is <em>one flavor</em>!), Fluffernana, Birthday Cake, S&apos;mores, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071803/http://www.gooeyontheinside.com/Cookie_Butters_Info.html">and more</a>. They&apos;ve also got seasonal spreads like Brown Butter Cranberry-Apple Pie, Caramel Pecan Pie, Sweet Potato Pie, Pretzel Candy Corn, and Earl Grey-Maple Pumpkin Spice Gingerbread. </p>

<p>And you can spread this on anything! Things like toast, a spoon, a ladle, <em>a cookie?</em> Drink it through a straw. Anything you want&#x2014;even fruit, they say... but let&apos;s not ruin this thing with fruit okay?</p>

<p>Anyway, Cookie. Butter. Cookie Butter. RIP Nutella.</p>
