<p>Remember back in 1957 when brownstone Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195349/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/10/flashback_last_brownstone_standing.php">was being replaced</a> by &quot;new facades of gleaming aluminum&quot;? (Actually, didn&apos;t that start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195349/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/22/were_there_nimbys_in_the_1930s.php#photo-1">in the late &apos;30s</a>?) Well Carnegie Hall wasn&apos;t safe from the building boom either, and this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195349/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/when-carnegie-hall-almost-met-the-wrecking-ball/">Ephemeral NY</a> reminded us of that now infamous rendering of a giant red skyscraper that was set to replace the hall. The image ran in a LIFE magazine article in September 1957; read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195349/http://books.google.com/books?id=UT8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=life+magazine+carnegie+hall+1957&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9TcqpGvzC-&amp;sig=CwKXO1ETnDge5KPQz8GMXENiK3A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7a-LTYSAIqPp0gHHrcCADg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">full article here</a>, and a brief history of the Hall&apos;s near destruction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195349/http://www.carnegiehall.org/textSite/press/bios/ExecutiveBiography.html">here</a>. Thankfully, the red giant never left paper.</p>

<p>Perhaps city planners and architects should keep a copy of this image on their drawing boards the next time they&apos;re starting to think about a new eyesore for the city&apos;s skyline?</p>
