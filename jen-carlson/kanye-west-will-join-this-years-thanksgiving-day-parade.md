Thanksgiving is coming up, and with it, the annual Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311012533/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/03/2010-11-03_stars_are_aligned_for_big_turkey_day_parade.html">the Daily News</a>-sponsored Big Apple float has some super-sized bookings, including Kanye West, who will perform while rolling down... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311012533/http://gonyc.about.com/cs/thanksgiving/a/tdayparade.htm">one of the streets</a>. Parade producer Amy Kule told the paper, &quot;The 84th Macy&apos;s Parade will dazzle and entertain the entire nation with a fantastic pageant filled with the most popular giant character helium balloons, awe-inspiring floats, the nation&apos;s best marching bands and an amazing lineup of performers.&quot; </p>

<p>Sounds like West has some big competition&#x2014;including new float additions Kool-Aid man and Kung Fu Panda! Do you think the performer is just angling to get his own helium homage&#x2014;a parade balloon&#x2014;one day (our interpretation pictured to the right)?</p>

<p>In other Kanye news, in a radio interview he discussed the Taylor Swift incident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311012533/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/kanye-west-says-taylor-swift-incident-is-bigger-than-bush-moment-after-katrina/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">saying</a>, &quot;The situation is bigger to me than the Bush moment. It&#x2019;s bigger than a lot of things.&quot; The &quot;Bush moment,&quot; of course, came during a post-Katrina telethon to raise money, when Kanye declared to the watching nation, &quot;George Bush doesn&apos;t care about black people.&quot; Kanye might be surprised to hear that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311012533/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/george-bush-kanye-west-rant-was-disgusting-moment-of-my-presidency-2010311">Bush recently told</a> Matt Lauer on <em>The Today Show</em> that the moment &quot;was one of the most disgusting moments in my Presidency.&quot; Which, you know, is saying <em>a lot</em>.</p>
