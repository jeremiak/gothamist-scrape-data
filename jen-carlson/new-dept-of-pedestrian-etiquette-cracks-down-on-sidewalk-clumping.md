<p>A notice from the NYC Department of Pedestrian Etiquette, dated July 10th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065309/http://evgrieve.com/2015/07/a-memo-from-nyc-department-of.html#.VaOyxf66WNw.twitter">has been posted on East 7th Street</a>, warning anyone who plans to navigate the sidewalks of this town that some changes are be implemented. Specifically, violating any pedestrian etiquette rules &quot;will result in denial of permission to enter the city for a period of no less than one year.&quot; Harsh.</p><blockquote>Effective April 1, 2016 all new residents and visitors to New York City Over the age of 16 will be required to take a mandatory training session on Proper Etiquette for navigating the sidewalks and streets of the greater metropolitan area.</blockquote>The DoPE is obviously a very premature April Fool&apos;s gag, but the behavior it&apos;s targeting is no joke to Busy Important New Yorkers who are frequently delayed on the crowded sidewalks of NYC:<ul><li>Blocking the sidewalk in a large group or just standing like an idiot in the middle of pedestrian traffic. Also referred to as &quot;clumping.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Walking too slowly with more than one person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065309/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/06/sidewalkspreading.php">spread across sidewalk</a>.<br>
</li><li>Stopping abruptly without stepping off to the side.<br>
</li><li>Block pedestrian traffic to stare up at the Very Tall Buildings or to clump in a group to look at maps. <br>
</li><li>Walking with your face in a map or mobile device.</li></ul>This list goes on, but the pulsating forehead vein who wrote it may want chill out with yelling at tourists for being &quot;morons&quot; because our ways are unfamiliar to them. They give us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065309/http://www.nycgo.com/articles/nyc-statistics-page">many, many millions of dollars</a> annually! Perhaps one day enough millions where we&apos;ll be able to give them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065309/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">their own sidewalk lanes</a>, solving everything.<p></p>

<p>First <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115065309/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/30/east_village_locals_glue_rocks_to_p.php">the NIMBY rock bench</a>, and now this&#x2014;when did the East Village become so uptight, anyway?
