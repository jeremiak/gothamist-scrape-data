<p>Your favorite adult contemporary classic rock radio station hits will be performed live on a stage near you! 62-year-old Sting and 72-year-old Paul Simon still got it (talent, energy, <em>it</em>) and they&apos;re teaming up for a joint tour called &quot;Paul Simon and Sting: On Stage Together.&quot; A very literal name for a tour. </p>

<p>Sting told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106220016/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/music/sting-and-paul-simon-will-tour-together.html?smid=tw-nytimesmusic&amp;seid=auto&amp;_r=2&amp;">the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t really know where this is going. We don&#x2019;t really have a clue how this is going to pan out.&#x201D; What they do know is that they&apos;ll be playing their own hits, as well as a few duets. And this won&apos;t be the first time they&apos;ve shared a stage: </p>

<p>The tour will last for 18 dates and take place February 8th through March 16th, with a March 4th date at MSG. Go, and scream extra loud for Simon&#x2014;he told the Times, &quot;I&#x2019;m not even sure I have a fan base anymore.&#x201D;</p>
