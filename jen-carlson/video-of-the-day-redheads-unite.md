										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154043/http://www.improveverywhere.com/">Improv Everywhere</a> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154043/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/29/charlie_todd_prankster.php">at it again</a> recently. Their latest mission? Protesting Wendy&apos;s &quot;racist logo&quot; with over 50 redheads, numerous protest signs and some catchy chants on hand. &#x201D;Biggie Size Bigotry!, Value Menu Us! and Where&#x2019;s Our Beef? In Your Logo!&#x201D; are some of our faves.</p>

</p><p>Head over to the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154043/http://www.improveverywhere.com/2007/07/24/redheads/#more-165">for more</a> on the &quot;protest&quot; as well as a look at what it&apos;s like to ride the subway and suddenly realize you&apos;re surrounded by ginger kids. Improv Everywhere points out &quot;redheads only make up 1% of the world&#x2019;s population, and with the racial diversity of the New York subway system, it&#x2019;s probably an even smaller percentage.&quot; And yes, they took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154043/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/23/best_subway_1_t.php">the 1/red line</a>.</p>
