<p>We have just received an email from the creators of <em>Unclear Holocaust</em>, about &quot;an ultraviolent, over-edited orgy of every Hollywood movie in which New York is desecrated, attacked, destroyed, in anarchic narrative unity.&quot; They tell us it is &quot;Hurricane Sandy, 9/11, and 2012 starring Tom Cruise and Will Smith&quot; all in one&#x2014;in other words: it is everything anyone has ever needed in a NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220114/http://gothamist.com/tags/destructoporn">destructo-porn</a> video... <em>and it&apos;s feature length</em>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220114/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/10/the_funniest_91.php">Village Voice</a> calls it &quot;the funniest 9/11 movie ever,&quot; and note it was created out of scenes from 50 disaster flicks, and used the clips &quot;to retell a version of the events of 9/11 and lay bare with encyclopedic thoroughness the bloody fantasy of the destruction of New York that Hollywood has nursed since long before the planes hit the towers.&quot;</p>
