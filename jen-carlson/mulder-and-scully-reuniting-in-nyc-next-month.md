<p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of <em>The X-Files</em> (don&apos;t think about it! You look so young!), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061632/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/david_duchovny.php">David Duchovny</a> and Gillian Anderson are getting back together for a talk at the Paley Center. Mulder &amp; Scully 4 Eva! </p>

<p>The show, which aired on Fox from 1993 to 2002, is one of the best sci-fi thrillers of all time&#x2014;bringing aliens, even El Chupacabra right into our homes. Also there was that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061632/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBtHFbO3bjw">weird ghost episode</a>: </p>

<p>We&apos;re all just a little bit more paranoid, and have a few more conspiracy theories in our brain space thanks to the show.</p>

<p>If you want to revisit the series decades later, the two stars will be at the Paley Center on October 12th, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061632/http://www.paleycenter.org/2013-fall-x-files">tickets going on sale</a> tomorrow for members ($25), and September 27th to non-members ($35). Now we just need to find our &quot;The Truth Is Out There&quot; t-shirt.</p>
