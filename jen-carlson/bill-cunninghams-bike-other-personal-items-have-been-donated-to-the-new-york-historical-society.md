					<p>The late, great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222062035/http://gothamist.com/tags/billcunningham">Bill Cunningham</a>&apos;s personal effects have been donated to the New-York Historical Society, and select items will be on display there later this spring.</p>

<p>The NYHS has announced that the possessions of the celebrated NY Times fashion photographer and iconic New Yorker, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222062035/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/25/famed_nyt_fashion_photographer_bill.php">died at the age of 87 last June</a>, are now a part of their permanent collection.</p><blockquote>Donated by John Kurdewan, Cunningham&#x2019;s right-hand man, and Louise Doktor, longtime friend and muse, the objects include Cunningham&#x2019;s personal library of more than 200 books&#x2015;stuffed with clippings, notes, inscriptions from authors, marginal annotations, and photographs&#x2015;as well as the Biria bicycle Cunningham rode around the streets of New York, the Nikon camera he used to snap photographs of fashionable New Yorkers on the street and at society events, and his trademark blue jacket, among other items.</blockquote> The items join &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222062035/http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/bill-cunningham-facades">Facades</a>,&quot; Cunningham&#x2019;s collection of 88 photographs featuring historic settings, which were previously donated to them by Cunningham in the 1970s.<p></p>

<p>Dr. Louise Mirrer, president and CEO of the New-York Historical Society said in a statement, &quot;His death was deeply felt by all of us who knew him and respected his work, so it is with great pride that the New-York Historical Society becomes the new home for his earthly belongings. We feel extremely privileged and grateful that Bill&#x2019;s longtime friends John and Louise have chosen to share their bequests with us. These objects will join Facades in our permanent collection, allowing scholars and admirers the opportunity to remember Bill&#x2019;s legacy for years to come.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>Among the items are &quot;a custom-made bicycle helmet, given to Cunningham in 2005 by Bergdorf Goodman in a hat box covered with colorful images from his New York Times column; his pewter Living Landmark presentation plate from 2009, made by Cartier; the Medal of Excellence, presented to Cunningham in 2012 by Carnegie Hall, his longtime residence; and his millinery supplies from his time as a designer, including two hats in the process of being styled, his tools, and a collection of feathers.&quot;</p>

<p>Details about when the items will be on display have not been released yet.
