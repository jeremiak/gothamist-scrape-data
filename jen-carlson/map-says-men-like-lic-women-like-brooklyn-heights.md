<p>Ah, an age-old tradition: dividing up things into what boys like and what girls like. And now this division of the sexes has been applied to a map of New York City. </p>

<p>Something called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310102200/https://www.zumper.com/">Zumper</a> generated a map that shows what areas were popular with male and female renters this summer, and they found out that ladies just love Brooklyn Heights. Of course they do! It&apos;s where all the rom-coms are filmed, and if you move there you&apos;ll fall in love with a man who wears cableknit sweaters on crisp, autumn weekends while he reads the man sections of the newspaper with furrowed brow. And then all week you&apos;ll sit in your home awaiting him to return from a long day at the office, taking breaks in between cooking and cleaning to press your nose into that sweater he wore over the weekend. Is that a hint of another woman&apos;s perfume? It&apos;s probably that trollop Janine from the office. Maybe you should start trying for kids soon...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, men love Long Island City. All the factories turned apartments are so manly! If Ron Swanson lived here he&apos;d definitely pick LIC to live in. Such an industrial landscape, like one large man cave, impenetrable to woman.
