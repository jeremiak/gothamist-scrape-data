										<p>The Loch Ness monster, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421004540/http://www.flickr.com/photos/lunapark/704779754">tagging the city</a>, has been in a marsh in Brooklyn for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421004540/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/05/extra_extra_688.php">over a month</a>. A note to New York&apos;s mythical creature coterie, you only have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421004540/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_newsroom/media_advisories/media_advisories.php?id=20003">through December 31st</a> to catch Nessie so close to home. </p>

Weighing in at 600-lbs, it&apos;s made from fiberglass, aluminum and foam -- and we&apos;re betting it has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421004540/http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/news/ny-nydiar255475658nov25,0,4413796.story">frightened some unaware passer-by</a> over the past month. Personally, we&apos;re hoping to see some holiday flare added to the beast before it becomes land-bound (A red nose? Anters? Some twinkly lights?)</p>
