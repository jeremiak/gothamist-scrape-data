<p>Welcome To Twin Peaks, the website that brought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717085042/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/agent_dale_cooper_spotted_in_coney.php#photo-1">Agent Dale Cooper to Coney Island</a> recently, is now inviting you to transform your own hometown into Twin Peaks, albeit on a very small scale and with less surrealism. They explain:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We&#x2019;re inviting fans around the world to discover Twin Peaks in their own towns and cities.
Here&#x2019;s how you can participate in the Welcome to Twin Peaks project we&#x2019;re launching today:
<ul><li>Take the album cover out of your Soundtrack from Twin Peaks album, or print it out if you don&#x2019;t have the CD (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717085042/http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/welcome-to-twin-peaks-project/#ixzz2U8oM9tDu">download the image here</a>).
</li><li>Take the cover/cutout on the road while humming &#x201C;Dance Of The Dream Man&#x201D; and try to blend the image into your surroundings. Even if you live on a beach.
</li><li>Found a great spot? Then take a photo (or multiple photos) and share it on our Facebook page, Twitter (use hashtag #welcometotwinpeaks) or Instagram (tag it with #welcometotwinpeaks) and don&#x2019;t forget to mention your location (city + country).</li></ul></blockquote>

<p>New York: Represent! We want to see a Twin Peaks Brooklyn Bridge, a Twin Peaks Rockaway, a Twin Peaks Times Square...</p>
