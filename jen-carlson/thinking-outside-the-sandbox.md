<p>A reader sent in these photos from Riverside Park&#x2014;one from tot lot 110 at Riverside and 110th Street, and the other from tot lot 108 at Riverside and 108th Street. Is this some sort of exercise to get kids to think outside the (sand)box? We&apos;ve contacted the Parks Department to see what they had in mind when dumping the sand so far away from its intended destination, and will update when they get back to us.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Philip Abramson of the Parks Department tells us, &quot;This is as close as we can get with a truck to deliver the sand.  These piles were dumped last night in preparation for tomorrow morning when the Riverside Park Fund will host volunteers at each playground to help fill the sandboxes in preparation for spring.  We&apos;ve been doing this for a few years.&quot; So calm down, people.</p>
