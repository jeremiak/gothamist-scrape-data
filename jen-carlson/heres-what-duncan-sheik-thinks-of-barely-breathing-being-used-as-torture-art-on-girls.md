(Jen Carlson/Gothamist)</i></div> On last night&apos;s episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151117073702/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham"><em>Girls</em></a> we saw the return of Booth Jonathan, the artist and master seducer who scored the first season&apos;s <em>hottest scene</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151117073702/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1qpdTLV3wk">watch again</a>, we&apos;ll wait). In that scene, he told Marnie: &quot;The first time I fuck you, I might scare you a little, because I&apos;m a man, and I know how to do things.&quot; Last night he delivered on his promise, bringing her back to his place for creepy doll-watching sex... but not before some non-traditional torture-art foreplay. Artists!<p></p>

<p>In the scene, Marnie is locked inside of a tiny room&#x2014;an art piece that Booth has created using old television sets, disturbing images, and Duncan Sheik&apos;s 1996 hit song &quot;Barely Breathing&quot; turned up to 11. </p>

<p>Obviously, we needed to know what Sheik thought of his song being used as an integral component of the seduction <strike>torture</strike>-chamber... so we asked him over to watch the scene with us. Below, watch Sheik react (very well!) to the use of his song in it:</p>

<p>Sheik&#x2014;who has most recently been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151117073702/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/duncan_sheik_american_psycho_musical.php">scoring the <em>American Psycho</em> musical</a>&#x2014;added, &quot;If there&apos;s anything from my catalog that you wanted to torture someone with that&apos;s a good song to use, I couldn&apos;t agree with [Booth] more.&quot; Though he was curious &quot;what the reasoning was behind the choice of that song&quot; in particular, so we&apos;ve reached out to the show&apos;s music supervisor and will update when we hear back. In the meantime, let&apos;s guess how many bars in Brooklyn are currently transforming their photo booths into one of these things...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&apos;re told that the writers, specifically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151117073702/https://twitter.com/campsucks">Jenni Konner</a>, chose the song, though is unable to comment at this time as to why.</p>
