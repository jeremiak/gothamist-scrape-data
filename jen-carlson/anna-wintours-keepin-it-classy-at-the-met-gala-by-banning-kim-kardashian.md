<p>There aren&apos;t too many occasions that put us on the side of Anna Wintour, but the Vogue editrix banning Kim Kardashian from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201844/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/stars_sparkle_at_the_2012_met_gala.php#photo-1">the Met Costume Institute Gala</a> has us screenprinting &quot;Team Wintour&quot; tees. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201844/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/05/kim-kardashian-met-gala-snub-vogue-ban">RadarOnline</a>, Wintour banned Kim Kardashian from the big event on Monday, which draws a who&apos;s who A-list crowd each year. And the ban didn&apos;t stop Kardashian&apos;s new boyfriend Kanye West from attending, he turned up without the arm candy by his side. </p>

<p>A source told the site, &#x201C;Anna hates Kim. Why would she be invited to the event? It is all the biggest stars in the world and Kim doesn&#x2019;t fit that bill at all.&#x201D; And while Kate Upton purchased her way in to the Gala (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201844/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/03/kate_upton_noted_philanthropist_wil.php">to the tune of $25,000</a>), Kardashian wasn&apos;t even allowed to do that. Somewhere, Kardashian&apos;s team of publicists are spinning away.</p>
