title: JK Rowling is Buggered About NY Times Review

										<p><img alt="2007_07_michikosnape.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030063915im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2007_07_michikosnape.jpg" width="330" height="270" class="left">The clock is ticking and the new Harry Potter book will be released at 12:01am, less than twelve hours from now! The scene will surely be crazy and something that this city hasn&apos;t seen since...well, Wednesday when people lined up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030063915/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/18/im_not_a.php">for a canvas grocery sack</a>. </p>

<p>JK Rowling bids farewell to the boy who made her billions with this final novel, and she&apos;s feeling a bit buggered about the reviews that came out before the book hit the shelves. As reported, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030063915/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/19/speed_reader_mi.php">the NY Times ran a review on Thursday</a>, as did the Baltimore Sun. Both papers said they obtained the book &quot;through legal and ordinary means.&quot; No matter, Rowling and her revelers were still, understandably, riled up. </p>

<p>The author made a statement saying, &quot;I am staggered that some American newspapers have decided to publish purported spoilers in the form of reviews in complete disregard of the wishes of literally millions of readers, particularly children. I am incredibly grateful to all those newspapers, booksellers and others who have chosen not to attempt to spoil Harry&apos;s last adventure for fans.&quot; </p>

<p>While we agree it was pretty petty of those papers to run the reviews (which they clearly did just to be &quot;first&quot;), is it really that difficult to avert your eyes if you don&apos;t want to know what happens? The Times book editor Rick Lyman defends Michiko Kakutani (pictured, as, um, Snape) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030063915/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/books/19potter.html?ref=books">her review</a>, saying it didn&apos;t give away significant details (however it does reveal plot details).</p>

<p>Bloomsbury and Scholastic (the books publishers in the UK and US) spent millions trying to protect the contents of the novel. A spokeswoman from the former said the Times review being run was &quot;very sad&quot; and that the paper could have waited another day. Very true - but then the Bloomsbury spokesperson gets all British and likens the event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030063915/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070719/en_nm/arts_potter_review_dc;_ylt=AsD2tnJLu.xoohNcDC5gvaVxFb8C">to the Boston Tea Party</a>!<br>
