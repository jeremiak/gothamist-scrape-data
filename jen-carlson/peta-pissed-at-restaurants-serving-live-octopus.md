title: PETA Pissed At Restaurants Serving Live Octopus
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115113/http://gothamist.com/tags/peta">PETA</a> is now focusing their gaze on the city&apos;s octopus community... which some find quite delicious! The organization&apos;s David Perle tells us they&apos;re addressing disturbing practices they&apos;ve found in Manhattan and Queens restaurants, and aim to stop the &quot;chopping up or slowly steaming live octopuses and serving them while they&apos;re still conscious.&quot; </p>

<p>They&apos;ve penned some letters to the district attorneys of each jurisdiction, pointing out that octopuses can feel pain and the restaurants&apos; practices violate the state&apos;s anti-cruelty statute. Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman noted that in some of these establishments, &quot;the chef uses scissors to cut off an octopus&apos;s tentacles and then serves them on a dish&#x2014;the octopus&apos;s heart keeps beating as the animal writhes and slowly die.&quot; In this National Geographic video, some take it a step further:</p>

<p>We&apos;ve obtained the letters sent to the district attorneys, which name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115113/http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2009/12/try_live_seafood_for_less_at_u.html">Sushi Uo</a> at 151 Rivington Street, and Flushing&apos;s Sik Gaek and East Seafood Restaurant as the main culprits. The latter is allegedly the meeting spot for a Gastronauts club that dines on &quot;macho&quot; cuisine&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115113/http://www.gastronauts.net/index2.html">their website</a> shows photos of the live octopus (and a menu promising &quot;live lobster&quot; as well). What do you say: Bon Appetit or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115113/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQk7eFQOJOA">The Great Barf-O-Rama</a>?</p>
