title: New FAILE Wheel Spins in Williamsburg
---

	
										<p>The last FAILE prayer wheel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829190433/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/25/faile_1.php">was stolen</a> shortly after people discovered it, but today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829190433/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/05/without-faile-street-artists-install-another-prayer-wheel/">AnimalNY</a> spotted a new one by the Brooklyn-based collective, again in Williamsburg. How long will this expensive piece of street art last? Perhaps a few more hours than the original, as it&apos;s on the more populated Bedford Avenue. For those who won&apos;t get to see it in person, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829190433/http://www.flickr.com/photos/smkjr/3529886410/in/set-72157618117833540/">here&apos;s a video</a> that catches the spinning action. </p>
