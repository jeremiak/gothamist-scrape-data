</div></div><p>Just in time for the winter chill, the Park Here park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124210511/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/11/parks_move_indoors_for_the_winter.php">is back</a>, Openhouse Gallery&#x2019;s three-month pop-up park in Nolita. This year features a concert series with Rolling Stone mag, ten local food vendors, wine tastings, BBQ, movies and more. Plus, it&apos;s warm, free, has WiFi, and... it&apos;s a freaking indoor park, people, <em>it&apos;s just awesome.</em> Where else are you going to swing on a hammock or have a picnic with friends in the city right now? At press time, the Parks Department isn&apos;t providing warmth domes, nor do warmth domes exist, so this is it.</p>

<p>Each day the park is open from noon to 8 p.m., and offers up something different&#x2014;you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124210511/http://parkhere.info/">sign up here</a> for invites and a schedule (and it wouldn&apos;t kill you to follow along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124210511/https://twitter.com/#!/openhousenyc">on Twitter</a>, too). They&apos;ll be open through February 15th... then we&apos;ll have to tough it out for a few months before we can enjoy the outdoor parks again. <em>Or</em> we can pressure the powers that be to keep this thing open til May.</p>
