title: When City Smells Turn Into Odor Violations

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="smell0610.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160627160359im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smell0610.jpg" width="300" height="312"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Signalman Nick Carter holding hand on nose to signal hotbox smell. NY, 1943.</span></i></div> New York City is filled with unique little scents, like &apos;em or not, and each turn of the corner can bring a new top note to your olfactory collection. Some say smell is the most nostalgic of all senses, so maybe one day down the road you&apos;ll get a whiff of hot fishy garbage and it&apos;ll take you back to all those sweltering summer days you spent in Chinatown. But for now, these smells are just a nuisance to some&#x2014;and according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160627160359/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704103904575337012761127830.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTTopStories#&amp;mg=com-wsj">Wall Street Journal</a>, 311 gets 1000 odor complaints per year, pertaining to restaurants alone. Each one is then <br>
investigated by the Department of Environment Protection, and only a small fraction get violations in the end.<p></p>

<p>One 65-year-old TriBeCa man, Allan Tannenbaum, told the paper that he suffers from &quot;smell blasts&quot; from a nearby Indian restaurant called Salaam Bombay&#x2014;&quot;Let&apos;s say you&apos;re having some cereal for breakfast and they start cooking. All of a sudden your Cheerios taste like tandoori chicken.&quot; </p>

<p>The restaurant owner, however, notes how some people love the smell, explaining, &quot;We have an Indian restaurant and somebody doesn&apos;t like Indian food smell. But most of my customers come in and they feel the smell is so great, very tempting.&quot; And therein lies the problem: what smells bad to one, may smell like a delicious dinner to another. Case in point, one odor complaint made over the past month was against a bread shop in Carroll Gardens (we can only assume this was placed by a member of the Atkins army).</p>

<p>Some restaurants have spent thousands on specialists to change the direction of their exhaust system so their smell moves away from nearby residents, and Salaam Bombay&apos;s owner may rack up a bill close to $35K in efforts to appease Mr. Tannenbaum, who has caused quite a stink himself at community board meetings. If you think that&apos;s extreme, remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160627160359/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/12/upper_east_side_1.php">back to 2007</a>, when one Upper East Side condo board sued a Subway sandwich franchise owner for half a million bucks because of the smell!</p>
