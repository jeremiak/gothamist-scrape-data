<span class="photo_caption">Photoshop composite of what it probably looked like when Lady Gaga moved to the LES in the early aughts. Bad old days!</span></p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020404/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> documented her return to the Lower East Side, traveling back to her old digs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020404/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/08/lady_gaga_5.php">at 176 Stanton Street</a>... and now she digs even deeper to her roots in this mini documentary, <em>Inside the Outside</em>, which aired on MTV. </p>

<p>In her little rock doc, she explains the perils of growing up wealthy and living four blocks from Lincoln Center, saying, &quot;I became rebellious... I was kinda bad, I would go down to all kinds of places with my friends in the Village. When I grew up by Lincoln Center I wasn&apos;t able to access all of the things that were on the Lower East Side [ed. note: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020404/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=70+N+Broadway,+New+York,+NY+10023-7503+(Lincoln+Center)&amp;daddr=176+Stanton+St,+New+York,+NY+10002&amp;geocode=Fb8ibgIdMBeX-yFBwa77mjnajCmf4CH59VjCiTGGhEezRZHKeg%3BFThXbQId7BeX-ynXwJ_xgVnCiTEtwucwNu5oOw&amp;gl=us&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=ltm&amp;dirflg=r&amp;ttype=dep&amp;date=06%2F02%2F11&amp;time=11:34am&amp;noexp=0&amp;noal=0&amp;sort=def&amp;sll=40.743746,-73.979187&amp;sspn=0.088699,0.258694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.744136,-73.991032&amp;spn=0.088698,0.258694&amp;t=h&amp;z=13&amp;start=0">MTA</a>]... <strong>it was like I needed to go fuck myself up and go lick the ground for a couple of years to understand New York City</strong>, and understand a whole different side of the pavement.&quot; Back in the early aughts that Lower East Side was rough!</p>

<p>Still, Gaga braved the mean streets on her own, and eventually even moved there, barely able to support herself with her dad <em>only</em> paying half of her $1,100 rent. Check out more of her sob story below.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this Saturday the Lower East Side streets of her past will be flooded with Gaga look-a-likes, at least if all goes according to plan. The Go Gaga Look-A-Like Competition will be taking place at 6:30 p.m., but the party starts three hours earlier (more details in the below flyer).</p>
