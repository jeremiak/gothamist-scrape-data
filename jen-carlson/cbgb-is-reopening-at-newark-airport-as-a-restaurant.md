<p>When Hilly Kristal opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604150127/http://gothamist.com/cbgb">CBGB OMFUG</a> on the Bowery in 1973, he served his special chili&#x2014;cooked in the presence of the chef&apos;s pet rat, &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604150127/http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2013/10/11/cbgb-rise-punk-no-holds-barred-party">Hilly&#x2019;s Chili</a>&quot; contained surprise seasonings like cigarette ashes and bodily fluids. But the venue was known for the music, not the menu&#x2014;the Talking Heads, Blondie, and The Ramones all found their sound on its ramshackle stage. It was legendary, and when Kristal died in 2007 his venue faded away with him. Consider this the final nail in the coffin of CBGB, the Bowery, punk, everything: CBGB is reopening as a restaurant IN NEWARK AIRPORT.</p>

<p>What? How? Why? </p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604150127/http://www.grubstreet.com/2014/11/newark-airport-restaurants.html">Grub Street</a> buried this bit in an article about Newark dining: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604150127/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/30/chef_harold_moo.php">Harold Moore</a> hooked up with the lamented CBGB and will serve &apos;American fare in a fun environment recalling the legendary music venue.&apos;&quot; That fare will include $9 deviled eggs, an $11.50 wedge salad, and a $14 cheeseburger. There will not be an homage to Hilly&apos;s Chili, for any price.</p>

<p>The current owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604150127/http://gothamist.com/tags/cbgbfest">of all things CBGB</a> declined to comment on the venture, but it seems that all CBGB trademarks have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604150127/https://twitter.com/ProofofUse/status/598568358120923137">assigned to a holding company</a>, and it is they who are behind this airport nonsense.</p>

<p>We hear it may be opening by the end of the year.</p>
