She has a new perfume coming out with top notes of an expensive hooker. She says, &#x201C;I wanted to extract the feeling and the scent of blood and semen from molecular structures. [Blood and semen] is in the perfume but it doesn&#x2019;t smell like that&#x2014;you just get the after feeling of sex from the semen and the blood is primal. The perfume smells like an expensive hooker.&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212458/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/17/smell_like_lady_gaga.php">Last year</a> she noted that it would smell like New York City, but it sort of seems like she got more inspiration from the last season of <em>Dexter</em>.</p>

<p>But who has offered up the blood for the sake of such a ridiculous gimmick? Lady Gaga herself, or so she says, declaring: &#x201C;It was taken out of my own blood sample so it&#x2019;s a sense of having me on your skin.&quot;</p>

<p>We have to go bath now. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212458/http://fashionista.com/2011/02/gaga-confirms-her-fragrance-will-contain-the-feeling-and-scent-of-semen-and-a-sample-of-her-own-blood/">Fashionista</a>]</p>
