<p>While it&apos;s well known that there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192426/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/worlds_fair_1939.php#photo-1">time capsules</a> still buried below Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, did you know that there may also be a much larger relic down there? The 1964-65 World&apos;s Fair had an exhibit called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192426/http://www.nywf64.com/undrghome03.shtml">Underground World Home</a>, which some people believe never got taken out of the ground (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192426/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/recaps/609/recaps.php">someone behind <em>CSI</em></a>, who included it in an episode).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192426/http://narrative.ly/2012/10/search-for-the-undeground-home/">A new article</a>, written by Nicholas Hirshon, documents the effort to unearth the subterranean dwelling, which was designed in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Turns out a few people&#x2014;namely Dr. Lori Walters&#x2014;have been lobbying to dig and see if it&apos;s still there. Walters, a history professor, &quot;plans to rely again on her university. She hopes her archeologist colleagues will guide the search, perhaps with financial backing from the university, grants and private foundations.&quot; Currently she&apos;s preparing an excavation proposal for the Parks Department.</p>

<p>Hirshon details the &quot;sub-urban&quot; home&apos;s beginnings in Queens, where a plot (Block 50, Lot 5 ) was scored &quot;on the fairgrounds between the Hall of Science and the Port Authority Heliport, and they began to dig fifteen feet into the Flushing Meadows marsh. Within a few months they had created a concrete shell of about 12,000 square feet and installed the home&#x2019;s gypsum board ceilings. Candelabras sat on the Steinway &amp; Sons piano in the living room. A simulated garden featured a bed of plastic flowers, artificial wisteria and an organ.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192426/http://www.worldsfairphotos.com/nywf64/booklets/underground-world-home.pdf">Here&apos;s a PDF</a> of the pamphlet for the exhibit, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192426/http://nywf64.com/undrghome04.shtml">a sample underground home</a> from that time, which included &quot;views that span a continent with San Francisco&apos;s Golden Gate to the West and New York&apos;s skyline to the East&quot;:</p>

<p>While the furnishings were taken out at the Fair&apos;s end, some believe that the home&apos;s designer, Jay Swayze, wanted to avoid demo costs and abandoned the home, leaving it underground. Years ago a World&apos;s Fair Community member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192426/http://www.worldsfaircommunity.org/topic/10329-in-search-of-the-underground-home/">claimed</a> there were documents at the New York Public Library that would debunk the myth that the home is still preserved underground&#x2014;we&apos;ve contacted the NYPL to see if we could get a hold of some evidence, and will update with any new information.</p>
