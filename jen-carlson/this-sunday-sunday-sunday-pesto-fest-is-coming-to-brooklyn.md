<p>This Sunday (Sunday! Sunday!) the most important food-based competition of our time is coming to Brooklyn: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529110031/http://brooklyn.cleanplates.com/events/pesto-fest-chefs-marcellus/">the Pesto Competition</a>. A group of chefs, restaurateurs and other food professionals working to stop fracking (hydraulic fracturing for natural gas) will host a Spring Fling and Pesto Competition at Ger-Nis Culinary and Herb Center (540 President Street, Suite 2E) from noon to 4 p.m. The only thing that could make this <em>more</em> exciting is if Kobayashi showed up to see how much of the savory spread he could devour in a short period of time (someone bring the Tums, just incase).</p>

<p>The cost is $25 per person, but that will get you some bites to eat, as well as &quot;herbaceous libations compliments of Pierson and Wolf &amp; Deer.&quot; Plus, you&apos;ll get to watch the main event go down, when the judging of the pestos occurs! </p>

<p>Whose pesto will reign supreme? Our bet is on whoever uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529110031/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">ramps</a>&#x2014;but maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529110031/https://twitter.com/#!/JJSteele3/status/195543647880613889">we&apos;re biased</a>.</p>
