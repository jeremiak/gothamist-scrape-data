<p>Bodega cats are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215208/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/video_exotic_bodega_cats_caught_on.php">a New York City treasure</a>&#x2014;they guard our apples, our milk, and our Bud Lite Lime when we aren&apos;t around. They protect our corner bodega from the one thing that metal rolldown gate can&apos;t: rodents. And sometimes they pop their cute little faces out of the bottom shelf when you reach down to grab a bottle of water. They&apos;re so cute that we don&apos;t even care that their cat litter is right next to the produce&#x2014;that&apos;s a mark of true love. Pictured is one of the bodega cats that we see every day&#x2014;he lives in a storefront on Jay Street in Brooklyn with one other cat, and as you can see he takes his job very seriously, wearing a tuxedo every single day. </p>

<p>So, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215208/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send photos to tips@gothamist.com</a> of <em>your</em> bodega cats and together we&apos;ll compile the greatest directory of New York City bodega cats this world has ever seen! Also feel free to include a location (general vicinity/neighborhood and/or borough is good enough, since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215208/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/11/to_balance_out.php">we don&apos;t want to get anyone in trouble</a>) and any details you may know about the cat. You can also share photos with us via Instagram by hashtagging them #Gothamist and #BodegaCat, or via Flickr tagging them with &quot;gothamist&quot; and &quot;bodega cat.&quot;</p>
