<p>Pardon our amazing Photoshop skills, but we needed to alert you of the Hipster Threat Level that&apos;s just been issued at the Brooklyn Bridge. Here&apos;s what we know: earlier today the Department of Transportation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120921/http://twitter.com/#!/NYC_DOT/status/65503140002279424">noted that</a> they&apos;d be giving away bike bells tonight on the Brooklyn Bridge from 5 to 8 p.m. (did you know it&apos;s required by law to have a bike bell?). So there&apos;s congestion problem #1. <em>Then</em>, Matt &amp; Kim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120921/http://twitter.com/#!/mattandkim/status/65514023499735040">Tweeted</a>: &quot;we are going to be doing the last shot of our music video in the middle of the Brooklyn bridge at 6:30 today! Come and get wild!&quot; (Last time this happened tourists were traumatized by the pasty white skin of the Brooklynites as they stripped down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120921/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/27/video_brooklyn_band_undresses_in_ti.php">in Times Square</a>.)</p>

<p>So what we&apos;re saying is, if you have no urge to get wild, receive a free bike bell, or watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120921/http://gothamist.com/tags/mattandkim">Matt &amp; Kim</a> and their fans get wild (possibly <em>with</em> bike bells)... then avoid an evening stroll across the bridge tonight.</p>
