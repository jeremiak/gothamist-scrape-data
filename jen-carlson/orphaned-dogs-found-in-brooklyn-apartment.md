										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpiQYz8MAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144523im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpiQYz8MAM.jpg" width="250" height="173" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, just after 3 p.m., word came in over the newswire that numerous animals were found in a vacant apartment at Sterling Place and Rochester Avenue in Brooklyn&#x2014;&quot;some dead and some still alive.&quot; Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144523/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/14/2010-05-14_10_dogs_left_in_brooklyn_apt_rottweillers_body_lay_in_home_near_starving_pooches.html">the Daily News</a> reports that there were 10 emaciated dogs living in the apartment&#x2014;mostly pit bulls, 7 of them puppies&#x2014;for weeks without human supervision or care. </p>

<p>One downstairs neighbor, who called 911 when water was leaking into her apartment, said, &quot;It&apos;s sad because it looked like they [had been] healthy animals.&quot; A rottweiler was found dead and decomposed in the kitchen, and now the surviving pit bulls are with Animal Care and Control, who say there is no evidence that they were part of a dog-fighting ring. It&apos;s believed the dogs were all well taken care of by their owner&#x2014;an elderly musician battling cancer&#x2014;who has not been seen for over a month.</p>
