<p>After we posted about the Brooklyn Tomato Battle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034544/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/massive_tomato_fight_coming_to_broo.php">happening this coming Saturday</a> at Floyd Bennett Field, there was some concern over wasting perfectly good tomatoes on a silly food fight. Also, <em>fifty dollars</em>. Also, hipsters. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034544/http://tomatobattle.com/">organizers</a> <em>promise</em> you will not be throwing any sort of <em>edible</em> tomato at their event: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;All of the tomatoes used during the exhibition will have been previously marked for disposal, making the Tomato Battle an efficient and entertaining use of nonedible waste.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>That said... they <em>do</em> kind of look perfectly red, ripe, juicy, and totally edible from this angle: </p>

<p>At least they&apos;ll be cleaning up their mess? Unlike the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034544/http://gothamist.com/tags/pillowfight">Pillow Fight</a> people.</p>
