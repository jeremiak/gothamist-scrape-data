<p>A rainy car ride from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426021423/http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Long+Valley,+Washington+Township,+NJ+07853&amp;daddr=Brooklyn,+NY+11211&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.822124,-74.778442&amp;sspn=1.511003,4.007263&amp;geocode=FQ1YbgId_PGK-ym5AFN63oTDiTGd1BeSl2H8ig%3BFbRObQIdxGCX-ym9sSOVV1nCiTHgpqkzdYIVHA&amp;t=h&amp;gl=us&amp;mra=ls&amp;z=11">Long Valley, NJ. to Brooklyn</a> never looked more enjoyable. One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426021423/http://www.reddit.com/">Redditor</a> put together this time lapse showing his journey from the rather rural looking New Jersey town, back to his home in Brooklyn, just off the Williamsburg Bridge. He says the trip took 90 minutes, and there&apos;s one photo per second. The real sell? It&apos;s set to &quot;Desperation Breeds&quot; the enthralling opening track on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426021423/http://gothamist.com/tags/andrewbird">Andrew Bird</a>&apos;s masterful new album <em>Break It Yourself.</em></p>
