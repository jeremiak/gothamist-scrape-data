                            <p>Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053504/http://gothamist.com/tags/googleglass">Google Glass</a>? The company&apos;s eyewear isn&apos;t available to the masses yet, but Famouses are getting their hands on it. This week documentary filmmaker Chris Barrett shared his Glass with Jon Bon Jovi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053504/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhLpezf84tc#at=154">and keyboardist David Bryan</a> &quot;to film a first person perspective of a sold out Bon Jovi concert.&quot; Sadly, while you see them walking through the bowels of MetLife Stadium in New Jersey towards the stage and roaring crowd, there&apos;s no<em> running onto the stage</em> pay-off. You also can&apos;t really hear anything, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053504/http://mashable.com/2013/07/30/bon-jovi-google-glass/">Mashable</a> says this was filmed during &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive.&quot;</p>

<p>Bryan told the site, &quot;It was a great experience to perform, wearing Google Glass, in front of a sold out crowd of 55,000. Glass and wearable-technology is an example of another step in consumer-facing innovation that will change how we share the music experience with our fans in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>Barrett&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053504/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/06/video_the_first_fight_and_arrest_ca.php">you may remember</a> as the first guy who captured a fight and arrest using Glass&#x2014;says watching Bon Jovi and Bryan wearing his Glass was &quot;surreal and amazing.&quot;</p>
