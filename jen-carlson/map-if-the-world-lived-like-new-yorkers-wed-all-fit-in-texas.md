<p>Here&apos;s a pretty cut and dry <em>and terrifying</em> graphic to take in. This rendering shows &quot;how much space the world&#x2019;s population of 6.9 billion would need if it were as dense as certain cities.&quot; So if everyone lived like New Yorkers, the entire population could fit into Texas! Comparatively, if we lived like Parisians (see map below), we&apos;d all be able to fit into 128,000 square miles (or Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Let&apos;s just not compare living space square-footage, okay?</p>
