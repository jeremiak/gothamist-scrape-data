<p>It&apos;s New Yorkers versus Hollywood, once again. Locals have sounded off against film crews invading their neighborhoods in the past, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140112/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20120115/REAL_ESTATE/301159997#ixzz1jecgIeYU">Crain&apos;s NY</a> has the latest from the front lines, which have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140112/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/massive_movie_production_moves_into.php">moved from</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140112/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/11/local_dumbo_resident_to_hollywood_g.php">Brooklyn</a> to Queens for the latest battle.</p>

<p>While the site points out that productions bring nearly $5 BILLION into the city&apos;s economy  each year, supporting around 100,000 jobs, some people are just too inconvenienced by the whole thing to make it worth it <em>for them</em>. Right now residents of Long Island City are asking the city to cut down on filming there, with one resident saying, &#x201C;On average, there are two productions a week here. Bright lights are shining in our windows late at night, and crews are very loud. We&apos;re living in a film set.&#x201D; And on top of all that, they&apos;re losing valuable parking spots when production crews drive in.</p>

<p>Long Island City is home to Silvercup Studios <em>and</em> Kaufman Astoria Studios, as well as sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline, so it&apos;s unlikely there will be a filming ban there anytime soon, but locals hope that the Bloomberg administration will work with production companies on making filming less disruptive. They also declared that production companies could make their complaints stop if they helped out &quot;with local projects like street repairs or park cleaning.&quot;</p>

<p>But doesn&apos;t <em>anyone</em> think it&apos;s kind of fun to see things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140112/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/06/photos_secret_batwing_location_is_a.php">the Bat Wing</a> around town, though?</p>
