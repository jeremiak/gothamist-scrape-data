<p>This is a pretty hotly debated topic at Gothamist HQ: Is the Staten Island Ferry a good first date spot? Our own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163607/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/bloomberg_right_stats_show_si_ferry.php">Chris Robbins says</a>: &quot;This is a first date, people: it&apos;s make or break. Would you invite someone to ride the B/D over the Manhattan Bridge and back for the view so you can stare into each other&apos;s eyes as a guy hocks a loogie in the corner?&quot; Others in the office love the idea, and also think elevated trains <em>are very romantic.</em> But Mayor Bloomberg is the top promoter of public transit dates, speaking up again about it during a ride on the Staten Island Ferry yesterday.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163607/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/popcorn-in-hand-mayor-rides-ferry-to-staten-island/">CityRoom</a>, the billionaire &quot;reminisced a bit about his bachelor days, when the ferry was one of his preferred spots for a date. &apos;You&#x2019;d get a six-pack of beer, a pizza, and you&#x2019;d sit outside; it was really romantic.&apos; &quot;</p>

<p>Coincidentally, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163607/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/27/todd_barry_gives_advice_on_first_da.php">we asked comedian Todd Barry</a> to weigh in the ferry date yesterday&#x2014;he told us, &quot;The Staten Island Ferry is a great idea for a first date, as long as that ferry is headed to STATEN ISLAND&#x2019;S HOTTEST &#x201C;SMALL PLATES&#x201D; RESTAURANT!&quot;</p>

<p>Might we recommend the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163607/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/12/east_river_ferry_1.php">East River Ferry</a>? It&apos;s not the most popular ride for commuters, so you may even get the whole vessel to yourselves!</p>
