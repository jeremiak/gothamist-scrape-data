</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413093325/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynnavyyard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> wall (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413093325/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/wall_to_fall_for_navy_yard_market_oVdv1OVQ1nOKNIfoD2cYSK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> confusingly refers to as Brooklyn&apos;s version of the Berlin Wall) is coming down... well, at least enough of it to make way for the new ShopRite! <em>Sigh</em>. </p>

<p>The Bloomberg administration has brokered a deal to bring the supermarket to the area, an addition that has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413093325/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/27/admirals_row_update.php">discussed in the past</a> and has been met with both cheers and rally cries. To include the market in the historic grounds, most of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413093325/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/02/inside_admirals_row.php">Admiral&apos;s Row</a> houses will be torn down, as will a section (at Flushing Avenue and Navy Street) of the 12-foot-high brick walls that have long guarded the area. Ground will be broken in early 2012 for the 55,000-square-foot supermarket, which will come with 30,000-square-feet of other retail space <em>and</em> 125,000 square feet of industrial space. All in all the development will bring 500 permanent jobs to the area in 2013, and Councilwoman Letitia James declares, &quot;I can&apos;t wait until that wall is demolished.&quot; <em>Double sigh</em>.</p>

<p>Before all that happens, however, here&apos;s a look back at the Brooklyn Navy Yard circa December 1941, through the camera lens of a LIFE magazine photographer.<br>
