And Project Bueller 2.0 will be bigger-- they are recruiting &quot;2000 secret agents to capture the spirit of the scene along the parade&#x2019;s 20 block path.&quot; If you want to join in, there are some (flexible) rules of course, mainly that you should dress in 80s business casual attire (more details at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410024633/http://projectbueller.tumblr.com/">the project&apos;s blog</a>). Fun fact: In the movie (filmed during the Von Steuben Day Parade in Chicago) some of the dancers you see were simply random onlookers caught up in the moment and filmed when John Hughes spotted them.</p>
