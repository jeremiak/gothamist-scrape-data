<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618134743/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">Justin Bieber</a> may not be playing his New York City shows until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618134743/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/justin_bieber_coming_to_barclays.php">later this year</a>, but he dropped by the <em>Today</em> show this morning to give his screaming, pint-sized fans a taste of his new album, <em>Believe</em>. His fans have been camped out at Rockefeller Plaza for days, some of them buried under Bieber-branded paraphernalia. This morning, many of them finally broke, and were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618134743/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2PiU3NqJGs">spotted sobbing</a> during his performance. Justin Bieber: still got it!</p>

<p>This all probably means that Bieber is in town still, so beware stampeding tweens&#x2014;they may be small but their Bieber Fever has been known to give them Hulk-like qualities... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618134743/http://toyotaconcertseries.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/14/12226890-waiting-bieber-fans-get-a-surprise-visit-from-star?lite">especially when traveling in groups</a>.</p>

<p>For the older ladies out there, original morning show dreamboat Matt Lauer posted this top photo on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618134743/https://twitter.com/#!/mlauer">his Twitter</a>, which he just activated thanks to the Biebs, who sent out his first messages for him on air today. Tweet Him Maybe?</p>
