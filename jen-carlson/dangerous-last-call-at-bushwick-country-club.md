										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpVEZAP4PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223522im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpVEZAP4PM.jpg" width="151" height="127" class="image-right"> </span>This police blotter story in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223522/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/29/32_29_bm_90_blot.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> has it all: violence, Brooklyn, hipsters, the NYPD, puke, and lots and lots of alcohol. According to police reports, earlier this month a 28-year-old and his girlfriend were enjoying one too many drinks at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223522/http://www.bushwickcountryclub.com/">Bushwick Country Club</a>. The young man started vomiting at the bar at 2:45 a.m., but refused to leave upon the encouragement of all those around him, including staff. But when the vomit landed on one employee&apos;s shirt, things went &quot;from disgusting to dangerous&quot; (or really just a hybrid of the two). After being forced out of the venue, <strong>&quot;a female bartender doused the victim in water and struck him in the head with a plastic bucket&#x2014;leaving a laceration that required seven stitches. Then a gang of drinkers from the bar roughed up the victim on the sidewalk in front of the venue.&quot;</strong> Can a plastic bucket really do that much damage? Anyway, the real story here is that the PBR-fueled hipsters turned on one of their own. Is this the beginning of the end?</p>
