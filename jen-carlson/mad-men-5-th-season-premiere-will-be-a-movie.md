<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:275px; "> <img alt="madmenpromo0112.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170258im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/madmenpromo0112.jpg" width="275" height="263"> <br> <i>via Copyranter</i></div> For being notoriously sparse on details, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170258/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> creator Matthew Weiner has a lot to say about the upcoming season over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170258/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/mad-men-season-5-matthew-weiner-282456">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, but unless you consider general themes a spoiler, nothing will ruined for you by reading it. As opposed to the last time we heard from Weiner and he gave a serious detail about how the entire series will end (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170258/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/matthew_weiner_already_knows_how_ma.php">spoiler here</a>). <p></p>

<p>So, with the show&apos;s fifth season beginning to air on March 25th, and ads showing a free falling Don Draper popping up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170258/http://copyranter.blogspot.com/2012/01/mad-men-season-5-teaser-poster-is.html">around the city</a>, Weiner is setting the press machine in motion once again. He told THR that the year we&apos;ll find Draper &amp; Co. in during the fifth season &quot;doesn&#x2019;t really mean anything. It doesn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m not doing a history lesson.&quot; He added, &quot;The thing that I&#x2019;m excited about is <strong>I wanted to give people a big helping. I wanted a two-hour premiere. It&#x2019;s a <em>Mad Men</em> movie&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think anyone&#x2019;s going to think it&#x2019;s two episodes spliced together. There is a story that starts in the middle of it [but otherwise] it&#x2019;s one story. The beginning and the ending are related to each other.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>When we last left Draper, he had proposed to Megan, but in this latest interview Weiner points out that Don has not yet married Megan, saying, &quot;Don proposes to Megan. And Megan accepts.&quot; So maybe he can still dodge that bullet!</p>
