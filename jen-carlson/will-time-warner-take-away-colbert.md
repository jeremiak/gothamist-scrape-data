<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144916/http://www.timewarnercable.com/nynj/mtv.html">Time Warner&apos;s site</a>, they note: &quot;We are negotiating earnestly, honestly and fairly with MTV Networks, but so far have been unable to reach an agreement or get an extension. MTV Networks may pull these channels from your lineup on January 1st.&quot; Their explanation, which can be read in full after the jump, includes Viacom wanting to charge more for their channels despite decreased ratings. </p>

<p>Viacom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144916/http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/happy-new-year-time-warner-cable-to-yank-mtv-nickeodeon-comedy-central-off-the-air/">issued a statement</a> as well, explaining: &quot;We have asked for an increase of less than 25 cents per month, per subscriber, which adds up to less than a penny per day for all 19 of MTV Networks&#x2019; channels. We make this request because TWC has so greatly undervalued our channels for so long.&quot; Hmm, maybe if they didn&apos;t substitute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144916/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/30/john_norris_mtv_news.php">John Norris</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144916/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/02/the_city.php">Whitney Port</a> we&apos;d consider loosening the change purse a bit.</p>

<p>The network has also released an ad campaign that includes some of their Nickelodeon cartoon characters <em>crying</em>, to which the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144916/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123068447857944249.html">Wall Street Journal</a> says: &quot;While programmers and operators often battle fiercely over contract renewals, Viacom&apos;s campaign is notable in its willingness to pull children into the debate.&quot;</p>
