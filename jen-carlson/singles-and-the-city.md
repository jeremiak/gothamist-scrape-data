An unprecedented rating for us! </p>

<p>According to their results, out of 14,104,498 -- 33% of us are unmarried. Add that to the fact that we&apos;re (apparently) the 32nd drunkest city...and voil&#xE0;! We&apos;re a top city for attracting the single class. This island is not unlike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101630/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Neverland</a>, so it&apos;s not surprising that no one seems to grow up and &quot;settle down,&quot; but just because it&apos;s a Forbes-approved fun place for the unattached to reside, doesn&apos;t mean the Big Apple is a good place for singles to find the big L. Perhaps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101630/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2007/08/the_facebook_to_reduce_rage_in_1.html">the new Facebook application</a>, that helps those with a Metrocard and internet access connect, will help. </p>

<p>The ranking was based on &quot;culture, nightlife, job growth, the cost of living alone, online dating, the number of other singles and that ever-elusive quality, cool,&quot; you can read more about their methodology <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101630/http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/21/methodology-data-cities-forbeslife-singles07-cz_de_0821method.html">here</a>.  It&apos;s all fun and games til <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101630/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/12/new_victorians.php">those New Victorians</a> take over, kids.
