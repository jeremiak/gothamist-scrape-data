The Upright Citizens Brigade have been settling in to a new space on Avenue A at 3rd Street, and the welcoming committee has already forced them to take down some signage. Welcome to the East Village circa 2011! EV Grieve has had total coverage of the events, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030006/http://evgrieve.com/2011/03/resident-starting-petition-to-have-hot.html">CB3/SLA meeting</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030006/http://evgrieve.com/2011/03/your-hot-chicks-room-sign-update.html">a petition</a> going around to the eventual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030006/http://evgrieve.com/2011/03/breaking-ucb-will-remove-hot-chicks.html">agreement</a> to get rid of the sign all together. That sign, by the way, says &quot;Hot Chicks Room&quot;&#x2014;which one local believes made it sound like a 1970s Times Square peep show (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030006/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/08/flashback_times_square_1986.php">for comparison</a>).</p>

<p>The point of the sign was to differentiate the theater from their bar next door. However, managing director Alex Sidtis has given up on the joke, saying, &quot;Rather then fight, the UCB have decided to change the sign. Our goal is to make people laugh by presenting the best comedic material in town and not to cause a stink over a silly sign.&quot;</p>

<p>A new name has not yet been chosen, any ideas? The original short-lived name came from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030006/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upright_Citizens_Brigade#Season_1">a 2006 UCB skit</a> from troupe member Amy Poehler.</p>
