</div></div><p>Early this morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627162514/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/08/pennsylvania_tree_will_soon_be_murd.php">a 75-year-old, 74-foot tree in Pennsylvania</a> was cut down in front of friends and family, who we are told were on the scene to &quot;bid farewell to their Norway Spruce.&quot; Once it was murdered (footage below!), the tree was hoisted by a huge crane, and is currently on a <strike>hearse</strike> flatbed truck which is transporting it to New York City. Once here, it will be adorned, propped up, and made a spectacle of.</p>

<p>If you want to see its cold, dead body for yourself, it will be officially unveiled on November 30th, after which time spectators can view the lighted tree each day from 5:30 a.m. through 11:30 p.m. until January 7th. Though a source tapped in to the dendrophilia community tells us the tree will be arriving on Friday morning, and will likely be propped up then.</p>

<p>R.I.P. unnamed tree, 1937-2011.</p>
