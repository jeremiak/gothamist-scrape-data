</div></div><p>The Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum took its rally for a space shuttle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629200119/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/the_intrepid_needs_you.php">underground today</a>, to the shuttle train out of Grand Central. Gov. Paterson, Borough Presidents Scott Stringer (Manhattan) and Marty Markowitz (Brooklyn), Intrepid Museum President Bill White and a lot of space shuttle enthusiasts gathered to ask NASA to gift us one of their retired space shuttles (you can sign the petition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629200119/http://www.shuttle2nyc.com/">here</a>). How can they say no to that face?</p>
