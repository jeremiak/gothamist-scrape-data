<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516223943/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08112009/news/regionalnews/pier_57_is_no_longer_terminal_183952.htm">The NY Post</a> talks to Greg Carney, of the Youngwoo &amp; Associates firm that will be developing the Pier, who confirms that the plans include an education center, a rooftop park, art galleries, cafes, an art library and auction house, and of course a restaurant with a view. He told the paper,  &quot;We saw a real opportunity to extend what is happening in the Meatpacking District and West Chelsea. It&apos;s an extension essentially of 15th Street to create a city street environment in the pier structure.&quot; </p>

<p>Overall, the Hudson River pier, located off 15th Street, will become an arts and entertainment center, even housing an outdoor cinema run by the Tribeca Film Festival. The paper notes that &quot;The project, recently approved by the Hudson River Park Trust, will convert the historic shipping terminal into a $210 million cultural complex, including an artsy, indoor market with shops housed in refurbished steel shipping containers.&quot; (Full press release and video after the jump.) Should be ready in, like, three years or so.</p>
