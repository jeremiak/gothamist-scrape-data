<span class="photo_caption">Directly under de Blasio during his appearance is a news scroll that seems to be stuck on the words: &quot;Job growth declines for third straight quarter.&quot; De Blasio hasn&apos;t even been in office for one quarter, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021856/http://www.billdeblasio.com/issues/jobs">he has promised jobs</a> for all neighborhoods.</span></p>

<p>Last night, <em>The Good Wife</em>&#x2014;which takes place in Chicago, but is shot in NYC&#x2014;was actually <em>set</em> in NYC, as the lawyers assembled for the American Bar Association&apos;s conference, where Alicia Florrick (&#x200E;Julianna Margulies) was delivering the keynote speech. This was the episode where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021856/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayordeblasio">Mayor Bill de Blasio</a> was making his cameo (Bloomberg appeared on the show during his Mayorship as well), which came in the form of a very loud <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021856/http://gothamist.com/tags/taxitv">Taxi TV</a> PSA.</p>

<p>While much of it is spoken over, you do hear the Mayor promote the city with Tourism Talk like: &quot;New York is the city of endless possibilities, it&apos;s a different adventure every day and every minute. Take a ferry ride to the Statue of Liberty, visit the Empire State Building, walk through the Lower East Side. This may be your first visit to New York, but I guarantee it won&apos;t be your last.&quot; The PSA shows up several times in the episode, as Nathan Lane&apos;s character tries to talk on the phone and, naturally, cannot get the TV turned off or the volume to go down&#x2014;&quot;Can you turn down the TV?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m trying but the Mayor won&apos;t stop talking!&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021856/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/nyregion/main-ingredient-in-mayors-tv-cameo-ham.html?_r=0">the NY Times</a>, the Mayor&apos;s cameo (which is not available online yet) was filmed at a Marriott Hotel by the Brooklyn Bridge&#x2014;they note that he&apos;s an &#x201C;intense fan&#x201D; of the show (which is loosely based on the relationship of Eliot Spitzer and Silda Wall Spitzer). Regarding his performance, he told the paper that &quot;the producers encouraged him to have fun with the idea of an obnoxious, self-promoting mayor&#x2014;&apos;They were surprised at how quickly I could get to over-the-top obnoxious.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Last night&apos;s episode (which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021856/http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_good_wife/video/">watch here</a>) also featured a cameo from an anti-semitic bear in Times Square, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021856/http://gothamist.com/tags/antisemiticelmo">a la Elmo</a>: </p>
