It&apos;s just so perfectly South Shore Staten Island. <p></p>

<p>The new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233107/http://www.yelp.com/biz/tiki-island-staten-island-2">Tiki Island</a> <em>destination bar</em> is located in Tottenville (the area furthest from the ferry), and owners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233107/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/staten_island_new_business_tik.html">told SI Live</a>, &quot;Our concept is that no one should walk through the Tiki Island gates without their jaw dropping.&quot; Concept accomplished. Here are some more Things about Tiki Island&#x2014;things like Smirnoff Raz, hopes, dreams, and promises:<br>
</p><ul><li>&quot;Tiki Island transcends [sic. transports? tricks?] bar-goers into a South Beach, Miami-like atmosphere featuring tropical plants, 300-cubic yards of sand for sunbathing and games of volleyball.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;VIP tiki huts for bottle service.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Vacation without leaving the borough.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Specialty drink menu includes exotic beverages, such as Tiki Tai (Malibu, Captain Morgan, Bacardi, pineapple, orange and a splash of cranberry juice) and Raspberry L.I.T. (Smirnoff Raz, Bacardi, Triple Sec, Sprite and a splash of cranberry juice).&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Pineapple stuffed burgers.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;We have showers where people can cool off.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
