title: "Get on Tapas" Fooled Brooklyn Locals
---

	
										<p>In May, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116082232/http://www.seriouseats.com/required_eating/2008/05/photo-of-the-day-a-rediscovered-sweets-shop.html">Serious Eats</a> alerted to the closing of a pet food store on Prospect Park West in Brooklyn, as the storefront was stripped down to its original &quot;beautiful stained glass sign from an old, possibly 1930s-era sweets shop.&quot; Soon enough a tapas restaurant popped up, called Get on Tapas (get it?), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116082232/http://blondieandbrownie.blogspot.com/2008/07/new-tapas-place-coming-to-windsor.html">locals were checking out the menu</a> for the new neighborhood spot...only to discover they were fooled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116082232/http://filminginbrooklyn.com/2008/07/01/i-hate-valentines-day-may-be-the-nicest-production-ever">by Hollywood</a>. </p>

<p>Turns out the movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116082232/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762105"><em>I Hate Valentine&apos;s Day</em></a>, which features a reunited Nia Vardalos and John Corbett, is the source of the confusion. The rom-com is based around a florist who tries to convince a restaurant owner to date her without the fear of it becoming a full-fledged relationship. But the locals are more interested in the menu and reviews of the faux establishment, which are displayed on the windows.  </p>

<p>The review prop states that Get on Tapas offers a &quot;modest and casual&quot; atmosphere and offers up reasonably priced food cooked on induction burners, panini presses, and toaster ovens. But kiss the punny-named tapas joint goodbye, locals--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141116082232/http://www.eattoblog.com/the-saga-of-get-on-tapas/">rumor has it a liquor store</a> will be opening once production is done.</p>
