<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> You think today&apos;s cyclists have it rough? Way back when they had to make their own bike lanes, pushing through men in bowler hats! Can you guess the year this photo was taken? We&apos;ll update later with the answer and more details.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This photo was taken on May 3rd, 1913, and the original caption on it reads: &quot;Start of Fred. Scherer &amp; Walter Wiley.&quot; According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163030/http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201066271/">Library of Congress</a>, the photo shows bicyclists Fred J. Scherer and Walter Wiley in New York City at the start of a bicycle race from New York to San Francisco.</p>
