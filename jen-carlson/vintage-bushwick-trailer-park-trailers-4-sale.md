                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="TRAILERPARK04111.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102210im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/TRAILERPARK04111.jpg" width="365" height="395" class="image-right"> </span>The saga of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102210/http://gothamist.com/tags/bushwicktrailerpark">Bushwick Trailer Park</a> is coming to an end. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102210/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/artists-trailer-park-is-history/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the Gray Lady</a> the 20-person art collective has succombed to The Man, who earlier this year evicted them from their warehouse rental housing their RVs. But their loss is your gain! The paper reports that founder Hayden Cummings is currently selling the trailers on Craigslist for very reasonable prices! </p>

<p>While he&apos;s already sold about 1/3 of the vehicles, there are still approximately 16 left. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102210/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/rvs/2352632338.html">They&apos;re going for $650 bucks</a>, but you&apos;ll want to purchase one <em>only if you have a plan</em>. Let&apos;s learn from their mistakes, people! Cummings says &quot;the trailer park community as we knew it is definitely done with,&#x201D; and that is in part because he couldn&apos;t find a place to store the unregistered vehicles. </p>

<p>Cummings might consider a career in sales! He tells the paper, &quot;since we bought them a year and a half ago, there&#x2019;s a much bigger market out there for vintage travel trailers.&#x201D; He&apos;s giving the proceeds to members of the collective, however, so... <em>awwww</em>.</p>
