										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="new2114woody.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/new2114woody.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Over the weekend the NY Times published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/dylan_farrow_writes_open_letter_abo.php">a brave piece by Dylan Farrow</a>, who finally broke her silence on the allegation that Woody Allen sexually abused her when she was a child. Farrow, daughter of Allen&apos;s former partner Mia, started off her essay with a strong punch to the gut: &quot;When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother&#x2019;s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me.&quot;</p>

<p>As she surely expected, not everyone reacted in a supportive way, some questioning if she was telling the truth&#x2014;but the support did come, in part from Hollywood voices who weren&apos;t really around to look the other way when she was a child. </p>

<p>As for the stars of Allen&apos;s movies that were called out by name in Farrow&apos;s essay, two have responded so far. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cate-blanchett-woody-allen-molestation-676383">Cate Blanchett reportedly said</a>, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some resolution and peace.&#x201D; While Alec Baldwin went with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://www.upi.com/blog/2014/02/02/Dylan-Farrows-Woody-Allen-letter-Cate-Blanchett-Alec-Baldwin-respond/9301391379955/#ixzz2sHTDG5HH">a more expletive-heavy response</a>, in a series of Tweets to someone who addressed him on the social media platform: &quot;What the f&amp;@% is wrong w u that u think we all need to b commenting on this family&apos;s personal struggle? So you know who&apos;s guilty? Who&apos;s lying? You, personally, know that? You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family&apos;s issue.&quot;</p>

<p>The essay was posted in Nicholas Kristof&apos;s corner of the Times (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/opinion/sunday/kristof-dylan-farrows-story.html">he also provided an accompanying piece</a>), and he tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20782530,00.html">People magazine</a>, &quot;She&apos;s really heartened by the response and support she&apos;s getting. She sends a big thank you to all those speaking up about sexual abuse and trying to break the silence. She was nervous about what the reaction would be to an essay so personal, but she put herself out there.&quot; </p>

<p>The magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20782501,00.html">also recalls</a> that Connecticut state&apos;s attorney Frank S. Maco announced in 1993 that while he found &apos;probable cause&apos; to prosecute Allen, he was dropping the case because Dylan was too &apos;fragile&apos; to deal with a trial.&quot; Filmmaker Robert Weide, who directed a documentary on Woody Allen, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/27/the-woody-allen-allegations-not-so-fast.html">unpacked out the history of allegation</a> in a controversial Daily Beast post defending Allen.</p>

<p>Allen&apos;s publicist Elkan Abramowitz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174737/http://gawker.com/woody-allens-lawyer-on-farrow-letter-story-engineere-1514462773">says that</a>, &quot;At the time, a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts. The experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother Mia Farrow. No charges were ever filed.&quot; </p>

<p>Allen&apos;s spokeswoman, Leslee Dart, released this statement: &quot;Mr. Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful. He will be responding very soon.&quot;</p>
