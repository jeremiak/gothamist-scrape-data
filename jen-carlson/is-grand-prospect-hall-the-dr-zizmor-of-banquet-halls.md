The quirky television spot airs 20 times a day on local networks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125920/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/13/2011-01-13_dreams_come_true_homey_ads_pay_off_for_grand_prospect_hall_owners.html">the Daily News</a> reports, and owner Michael Halkias believes that 98% of the city is familiar with it... making Grand Prospect Hall the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125920/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/08/dr_z.php">Dr. Zizmor</a> of banquet halls! Halkias says he made the commercial for free, &quot;so if anybody wants to laugh at the homemade aspect of it... I am laughing all the way to the bank.&quot; Paging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125920/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/hotel_chelsea_1.php">Andre Balazs</a>, we got a new idea for marketing the Hotel Chelsea!</p>

<p>The 2009 ad that runs now wasn&apos;t the first, either. Below check out their 1986 commercial as well:</p>
