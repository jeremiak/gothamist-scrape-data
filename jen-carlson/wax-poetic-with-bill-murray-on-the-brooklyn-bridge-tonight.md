<p>For 20 years now, Poets House has hosted a poetry walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. This is attended by hundreds of people every year, including our own Poets House member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008150022/http://twitter.com/yenbakas">Ben Yakas</a>, and actor/poetry fan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008150022/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/15/poetry_walk_across_brooklyn_bridge.php#photo-1">Bill Murray</a>. This year, Murray will lead the walk along with poet Richard Blanco, and both will share &quot;city-centric poems at strategic points along the Bridgewalk, using metaphor and verse to construct the skyline of literary New York City.&quot; Please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008150022/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/30/selfie_stick_purchased.php">leave your selfie sticks at home</a>, and refrain from quoting <em>Caddyshack</em>.</p>

<p>The walk begins at 6:30, and sign up is necessary&#x2014;participants need to sign in at 6 p.m. in the small park just outside of the Municipal Building at 1 Centre Street. Readings will take place in the park and on the Bridge and culminate with a sunset reading of Walt Whitman&#x2019;s &#x201C;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry&#x201D; by Richard Blanco beside Jane&#x2019;s Carousel in Brooklyn. There will be a dinner to follow. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008150022/http://www.poetshouse.org/programs-and-events/poetry-walk">The event</a> costs $250, and will benefit Poets House.</p>

<p>For those not in the know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008150022/http://poetshouse.org/">Poets House</a> is a 60,000-volume poetry library, national literary center, and creative space that invites poets and the public to step into the living tradition of poetry.</p>
