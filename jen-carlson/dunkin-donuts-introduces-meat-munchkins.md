<p>We spotted these signs all over our local Dunkin&apos; Donuts this morning&#x2014;this one appropriately displayed behind a &quot;caution&quot; marker&#x2014;presenting the chain&apos;s latest food item: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526213834/http://news.dunkindonuts.com/dunkin+donuts/dunkin+donuts+news/dunkin+donuts+pancake+bites.htm">Sausage Pancake Bites</a>! Or as we prefer to call them: Meat Munchkins. You can get three for $1.59, or six for $3, and each maple-flavored morsel comes with 100 calories and nearly 7 grams of fat, at no additional cost! (For those keeping track, five of these little things have the same amount of calories as one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526213834/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/02/taste_testing_the_mcrib_returning_t.php">McRib sandwich</a>.) Your move, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526213834/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/13/tim_hortons_timbits_are_here.php">Tim Hortons</a>.</p>
