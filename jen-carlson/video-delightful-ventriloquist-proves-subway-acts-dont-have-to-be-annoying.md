<p><em>It&apos;s shooooowtime!</em> Sure, subway performers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140115040251/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/video_cantankerous_straphanger_trie.php">aren&apos;t always for everyone</a>... unless you&apos;re <em>this</em> guy. He&apos;s got these straphangers in the palm of his hand, right along with his ventriloquist dummy. </p>

<p>We did some digging, and this is Queens-born Nigel Gabriel Dunkley, aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140115040251/https://twitter.com/@LivinGeltown">Docta Gel</a>. And he&apos;s pretty much an inspiration. From his bio:</p><blockquote>&quot;Being a fan of Sesame Street, Mr. Bean, classic folktale, and comedy in general &apos;Docta Gel&apos; desired to provide entertainment in his own fashion. He understood everyone faced difficulties  in life so he wished to uplift folks through the medium of comedy. He embraces that the use of hands can either be destructive or productive, he chose to talk with them.&quot;</blockquote>Isn&apos;t it nice to know there are some good people underground just trying to put a smile on your face?<p></p>
