<p>Have you seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054749/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/24/sex_and_the_cit.php"><em>Sex and the City</em></a> filming around town? Seems like some people are watching the cast of the &apos;ol show film the new movie every step of the way. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054749/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/movies/25mele.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">The Times</a> chronicled the madness and, OMG, talked to Carrie Bradshaw herself (who was hiding away in the basement of the Bryant Park Hotel). She had this to say of her on-the-job craziness: &#x201C;I basically just look down between every take because it&#x2019;s too hard if you look up and you see the perimeter is madness.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The paper also dropped some details about the movie -- spoiler alert!? Samantha now lives in LA! And Carrie is &quot;making a serious attempt at making grown-up decisions about love and about life choices&quot; -- probably not a bad idea for an engaged 40-year old. As for the rest of us, we&apos;ll be able to exhale when the movie <em>finally</em> hits the big screen in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054749/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000774">May of 2008</a>. We wonder what sort of elaborate ad campaign we&apos;ll be seeing around the city that has long forgot about Carrie &amp; Co.</p>
