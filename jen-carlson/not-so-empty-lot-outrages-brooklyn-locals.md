<p>There&apos;s an empty lot on Pacific Street (near Smith Street) in Brooklyn that&apos;s got locals outraged; they&apos;ve brought their complaints to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144446/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/29/2010-11-29_rundown_plot_on_pacific_st_full_of_debris_vermin_is_a_blight_on_neighborhood_loc.html">the Daily News</a>, and say the overgrown lot has become a haven for some unsavory characters. The empty space is right next door to Pacifico restaurant, and one employee there says she&apos;s heard everything from fighting to moaning emanating from the lot late at night.</p>

<p>The unmaintained piece of land has become home to a bloody mattress, liquor bottles, out-of-commission cars, and other assorted junk; current tenants include drifters and rats. A nearby resident explains, &quot;It might look abandoned, but if you look closer, you see how often it&apos;s actually used. There&apos;s garbage everywhere and it&apos;s obvious that people chill out around here.&quot; Not for long! The Sanitation Department is <em>on it</em>&#x2014;they ordered the owner (262-276 Atlantic Realty Corp.) to clean the mess by tomorrow, and said if it&apos;s not done, the city will clean it and send a bill. They also noted that none of the neighbors had ever called 311 to complain about the lot in the past, so they were not aware of the problem.</p>
