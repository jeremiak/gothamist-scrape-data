<p>The hybrid pastry trend has traveled alongside us into 2014, grasping our hands tightly, not letting go, ever. The latest second cousin twice removed from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123145/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">the Cronut</a> comes to us from the Green Radish, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123145/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/new_vegan_food_truck_to_serve_faux.php">the vegan food truck</a> run by James Rafferty. Starting sometime in March, his truck will be doling out donarts. That&apos;s half donut, half tart. </p>

<p>He tells us the baked vegan sweets, which he created, will be $5 a pop and will come in three flavors: the Old School Cinnamon Sugar Donart with Chocolate Glaze and Vanilla Swirl; the Glazed Double Dark Chocolate Donart; and the Vanilla-Almond Donart with Raspberry Glaze and Mango Dots.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123145/https://twitter.com/thegreenradish1">the Green Radish</a> on Twitter and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123145/https://www.facebook.com/thegreenradish">Facebook</a> to catch the announcement of when they&apos;ll be making their debut on the truck.</p>
