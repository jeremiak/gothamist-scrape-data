<p>Right now you can purchase someone&apos;s Instagram photo for around $100,000. The money won&apos;t go to the photographer, however, it will go to &quot;artist&quot; Richard Prince, who has blown up and made prints of other people&apos;s Instagram photos for his series titled &quot;New Portraits.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601093351/http://pagesix.com/2014/09/18/richard-prince-images-being-privately-shown/">previously private</a> show at the Gagosian has been a part of Frieze.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601093351/http://petapixel.com/2015/05/21/richard-prince-selling-other-peoples-instagram-shots-without-permission-for-100k">to Petapixel</a>, &quot;Prince is notorious in the art world for taking other people&#x2019;s work, &apos;appropriating&apos; them as his own with various changes, and then selling them for large amounts of dough.&quot; And no, he did not get permission for these prints, which are screenshots of the images with one addition from Prince, &quot;a short message [he] posted as the last comment on each one.&quot; </p>

<p>Artnet addressed the exhibit in a piece titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601093351/https://news.artnet.com/art-world/richard-prince-sucks-136358">Richard Prince Sucks</a>,&quot; where they write: &quot;In another image, he writes under young singer-songwriter Sky Ferreira&apos;s portrait of herself in the passenger seat of a red sports car: &apos;Enjoyed the ride today. Let&apos;s do it again. Richard.&apos; If she had a snide response to the leering comment, we never learn what it was. Like a true troll, Prince always gives himself the last word.&quot;</p>

<p>One Instagram in the show was taken by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601093351/https://instagram.com/doedeere/">DoeDeere</a>, who posted an image from the show earlier this week, adding: </p>

In the past, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601093351/http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/richard-prince-wins-major-victory-in-landmark-copyright-suit/">he&apos;s won</a>, since his work (including these Instagrams) falls under fair use.</p>
