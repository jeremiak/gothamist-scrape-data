<p>The blizzard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/14/march_blizzard_falls_short.php">may be cancelled</a> in NYC, which has been left with a cruel wintry mix soundtracked by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/14/thundersnow_pr0n.php">thundersnow</a>, but other regions of the state are transforming into winter wonderlands. And <em>other</em> areas are literally frozen. Take Webster, NY, for example, where the effects of heavy wind just off Lake Ontario this week left homes encased in ice. </p>

<p>These photos were taken by WROC news anchor John Kucko at 9:10 a.m. on Monday morning, and of course quickly went viral. Typically you only see something like this when there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://chicagoist.com/2013/01/23/in_pictures_dramatic_photos_of_chic.php#photo-1">a fire during a snowstorm</a>. </p>

<p>The iced-up row of homes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2017/03/13/webster-homes-made-into-ice-palaces/99114332/">reportedly</a> &quot;had back doors untouched by the ice, although windows and other entrances were sealed shut.&quot; The ice formations appeared after last week&apos;s windstorm, which was extreme even by local standards. &quot;We don&apos;t usually get this kind of intensity,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://buffalonews.com/2017/03/13/rochesters-ice-house-trump-buffalos-ice-car/">Kucko said</a> of the conditions.</p>

<p>Currently, the area is being covered in snow, and could end up with 22 inches by tomorrow. Kucko&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/13/weather/house-frozen-trnd/">told CNN</a> the home he captured is a remote beach house around 25-feet from Lake Ontario&#x2014;told us he will likely return to document the homes again after the snowfall.</p>

<p>Move over, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/23/paging_audi_owner_your_car_is_cover.php">ice car</a>... and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318160009/http://galleries.buffalonews.com/default.aspx?id=5491#/0">other ice car</a>.</p>
