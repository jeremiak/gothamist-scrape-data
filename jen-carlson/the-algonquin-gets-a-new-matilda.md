The last one (nicknamed Tilly) just celebrated her 15th birthday at the hotel, and has since retired and moved to a stunning pre-war classic in Brooklyn (so we&apos;re told) with her primary caregivers. Enter Matilda III, who has now taken over the throne (or rather, a small chaise lounge in the front entry of the hotel). The Algonquin folk tell us that the blue-eyed Ragdoll kitty is from the North Shore Animal League (and looks just like Matilda II).<p></p>

<p>In the most adorable press release ever, General Manager Gary Budge explains that after an exhaustive interview process, Matilda III was chosen to be the new Algonqueen. Budge says, &quot;We were sad to hear that our beloved Matilda had decided to retire. But, although she can never be replaced in our hearts, we are thrilled to welcome the new Matilda to reside here at The Algonquin, especially since she was chosen with care by Tilly herself.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225248/http://www.algonquinhotel.com/algonquin-cat">The tradition</a> began at The Algonquin in the 1930s when a straggly stray cat wandered in through the hotel&#x2019;s front door looking for food and shelter. Owner Frank Case, &quot;the consummate host most famous for first welcoming Dorothy Parker and her friends to start the legendary Algonquin Round Table in the hotel&#x2019;s bar,&quot; gladly welcomed the cat inside. Matilda has kept up with the times, and these days even has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225248/http://www.facebook.com/MatildatheAlgonquinCat#!/pages/Matilda-The-Algonquin-Cat/51291379554">Facebook</a> page and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225248/http://twitter.com/#!/Algonqueen">Twitter</a>! She&apos;ll be publicly celebrated at the annual Matilda birthday party this August&#x2014;with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225248/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/13/more_cat_fashion_show.php">best darn cat fashion show</a> in town.</p>
