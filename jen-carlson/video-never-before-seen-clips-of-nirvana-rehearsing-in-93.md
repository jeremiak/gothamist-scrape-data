<p>Every time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926230119/http://gothamist.com/tags/mtv">MTV</a> dips into their archives to offer up something nostalgic online, we take it as their own acknowledgement about how far their content has fallen since they launched the channel. We also question why they don&apos;t just launch a nostalgia vertical, and <em>why they sit on this stuff for so long?</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926230119/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1714432/nirvana-live-and-loud-1993-van-toffler.jhtml">Their latest offering</a> is never-before-seen clips from the <em>Nirvana: Live and Loud</em> rehearsals&#x2014;a concert that aired on New Year&apos;s Eve 1993.</p>

<p>The clips come as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926230119/http://gothamist.com/tags/nirvana">the band</a>&apos;s final studio album, <em>In Utero</em>, turns 20 and gets the re-issue treatment&#x2014;something Chicagoist recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926230119/http://chicagoist.com/2013/09/11/interview_steve_albini.php">talked to Steve Albini</a> about, who said: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I can say that if you get the new deluxe edition double 12-inch 45 vinyl version of Nirvana&#x2019;s <em>In Utero</em> that is as good as records can be made. You literally can&#x2019;t do anything more to ensure fidelity on a record than all the steps that we took for that record. It was cut from the original master tapes, it was cut directly into copper, the whole thing was overseen by the guy who was in the room at the time the record was being mixed. Everything about it was done in the best possible way that we could conceive in order to give people the purest, most accurate, best fidelity listening experience that they could have with that album. I&#x2019;m pretty happy with the way it came out. It&#x2019;s exactly what a record of that stature deserves.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>You can see where Albini and the band recorded the album <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926230119/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/kurt_cobain_1.php#photo-1">here</a>, from our visit there in 2008. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926230119/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/nirvana_1989_tour_footage.php">here&apos;s a lot more footage</a> from an early Nirvana tour in 1989.</p>

<p>The MTV concert these clips are from was filmed on December 13, 1993, just months after the album release, a month after the <em>Unplugged</em> session was filmed, and months before Kurt Cobain died.</p>
