The concept was that of Ann Buttenwieser, founder of the Neptune Foundation and a former manager of City Parks. The water on water can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203854/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/index.cfm?objectid=0CCA838D-FF00-454A-641B0376A606096D">at Brooklyn Bridge Park</a>, it&apos;s free and open from 11am to 7pm (the beach is open from 9am to 9pm) - seven days a week. </p>

<p>The park&apos;s website tells us how to have fun whether you&apos;re floating or land-bound: &quot;Take a dip in the 25 meter, 7 lane Floating Pool Lady, a floating swimming pool moored in the East River. Run your toes through the sand on the 40,000 square foot Brooklyn Bridge Park Beach. Grab a burger, rent an umbrella and enjoy the spectacular views of New York Harbor. Get your game on for pick-up beach volleyball and sand soccer or contact MetroSoccer to sign up for leagues and clinics!&quot;</p>

<p>The pool saw some action today when the Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Marty Markowitz took a dip. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203854/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=27&amp;id=13873">The Brooklyn Eagle</a> reports on the pool as well as the park developement: </p>

<blockquote>There was a significant new face Tuesday: Patrick Foye who heads the downstate part of the Economic State Development Corp. An appointee of Governor Spitzer, he was the second speaker after Borough President Marty Markowitz. Foye&#x2019;s group will build the park, and it was clear from public comments made that his group was the one primarily responsible for cutting through miles of red tape so as to have a dockside pool.</blockquote>

<p>The pool itself, which can be found around 334 Furman Street, has a maximum capacity of 175 and swimmers will be issued colored wristbands for hour-long swim sessions on a first-come, first-serve basis. Free shuttle buses will run from Borough Hall to the pool every 10 minutes.</p>
