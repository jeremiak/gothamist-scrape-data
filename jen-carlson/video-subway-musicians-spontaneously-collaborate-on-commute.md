title: Video: Subway Musicians Spontaneously Collaborate On Commute
---

<p>Is the city getting you down? Go no further than this video, showing a ukelele player spontaneously collaborating with a percussionist on the subway. The person who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093334/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2P-i_5skhsU">uploaded</a> the footage says these two musicians never met each other before this moment (as noted by another person in the video). Try to push back that cynical side that tells you they&apos;re just scamming us for tips, and watch:</p>

<p>The uploader also notes that &quot;the singer continued with another great song after the entire subway car demanded an encore. Her name is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093334/https://www.facebook.com/jesslatshaw">Jessica Latshaw</a>. It&#x2019;s rare that someone singing on the train, isn&#x2019;t annoying, so enjoy.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093334/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2P-i_5skhsU">Animal</a>]</p>
