<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cleaverjune0211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225013356im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cleaverjune0211.jpg" width="365" height="394" class="image-right"> </span>Sure, the hipsters of the early aughts enjoyed a little retro in their daily routine... but usually it came in the form of an overpriced vintage t-shirt or ironic whatchamacallit. These modern day hipsters are taking things <em>a little too far</em>, however, and sending women back to the days of June Cleaver. Way to go, ladies of Brooklynburg! </p>

<p>In a piece titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225013356/http://www.brokelyn.com/how-to-survive-as-a-sahg-stay-at-home-girlfriend/">How To Survive As A SAHG (Stay At Home Girlfriend)</a>, Greenpoint girl Quiana Stokes describes her sad little life as such: &quot;When my boyfriend goes off to work, I spend my days cooking, cleaning our two-bedroom Greenpoint apartment and trying to look good for him when he comes home... I&#x2019;ve always been someone who&#x2019;s really into keeping her boyfriend happy [ed. note: blowjobs], it&#x2019;s now my primary occupation after job-seeking.&quot;</p>

<p>She claims she&apos;s not alone, and that she was the third amongst her female friends living with a boyfriend to wind up out of work. Should you find yourself out of work and living with your boyfriend, Stokes has a slew of tips for you involving at-home waxing kits and always being willing when he wants sex! We suggest you settle in with some casserole and read them as if it&apos;s some sort of Betty Draper fan fiction.</p>
