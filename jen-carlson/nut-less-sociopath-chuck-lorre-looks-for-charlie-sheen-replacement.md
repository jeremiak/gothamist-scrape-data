<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sheencharlie042911.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103525im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sheencharlie042911.jpg" width="365" height="365" class="image-left"> </span><em>Two and a Half Men</em> creator Chuck Lorre may be replacing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103525/http://gothamist.com/tags/charliesheen">Charlie Sheen</a> and giving Jon Cryer a bigger role, so of course the MaSheen fired off a letter to Lorre (and CC&apos;d TMZ, of course). You can read the entire thing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103525/http://www.tmz.com/2011/04/28/charlie-sheen-chuck-lorre-goodbye-letter-two-and-a-half-men-attack-cancelled/">right here</a>, where the self-proclaimed Warlock explains, <strong>&quot;My fans may tune in for a minute, but at the end of the day, no one cares about your feeble show without me.&quot;</strong> Just to play Devil&apos;s Advocate for a moment: isn&apos;t that how it sort of was before this whole thing started?</p>

<p>Amidst his attempted takedown of Lorre, Sheen taps into his inner Tourette&apos;s and calls him: &quot;a sad silly fool... A-hole pussy loser... low rent, nut-less sociopath... a stupid bitch... a narcissist... a coward... a loser... a spineless rat... a cockroach.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, he goes on to tell Lorre, <strong>&quot;you created a show BASED ON MY AWESOME LIFE.&quot;</strong> And, well, another show based on Sheen&apos;s &quot;AWESOME LIFE&quot; that didn&apos;t involve Lorre? His critically panned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103525/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/09/video_torpedo_is_a_dud_charlie_shee.php">stage show</a>... which he&apos;s now been giving tickets away to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103525/http://twitter.com/#!/charliesheen">via his Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>So, who is fit to replace Sheen on the show? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103525/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chuck-lorre-hatches-two-a-183300">Rumors</a> have included everyone from Woody Harrelson to Jeremy Piven to Bob Saget, though a CBS executive claims those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103525/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/studio-eyes-a-revised-sitcom-without-sheen/">names were not on Lorre&apos;s list</a>. Not that any of these actors would do it, but...</p>
