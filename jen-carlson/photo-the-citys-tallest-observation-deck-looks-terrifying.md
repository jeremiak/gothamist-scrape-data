---

	
										<p>New York City&apos;s tallest observation deck is in the works over in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505192923/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/15/hudson_yards_sneak_peek.php">Manhattan&apos;s new luxury neighborhood</a>, Hudson Yards. The open-air deck will be situated 1,100-feet above the ground, making it higher than the Empire State Building&apos;s observation deck by 50 feet. A new rendering now shows what the deck will look like... and it will look like it&apos;s dangling off the top of 30 Hudson Yards. Wheeeeee.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505192923/http://nypost.com/2015/08/14/new-deck-to-top-view-from-empire-state-building/">the NY Post</a>, the deck is the skyscraper&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505192923/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/12/03/30_hudson_yards_tower_will_feature_mysterious_thrill_device.php">thrill seeking element</a>,&quot; and will &quot;stretch more than 5,000 square feet, boasting spectacular 360-degree views of Manhattan and beyond.&quot; They also note the deck is expected to get around several million visitors annually, though it won&apos;t be open for business until 2019, when everyone will have their own jetpacks anyway.</p>
