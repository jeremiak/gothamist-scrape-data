<p>As we type this, a great white shark has just been spotted up off the shores of Montauk. The shark, named Mary Lee, was tagged by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035328/http://www.ocearch.org/INACTION.html">OCEARCH</a> last September when it was in Cape Cod. Since that time the 16-footer has made its way down to St. Augustine, Florida, and earlier this month started her journey to Long Island.</p>

<p>The shark, weighing in at 3,456-pounds, was about 40 nautical miles off of Montauk Point this afternoon, and was recently just off of the South Fork shoreline. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035328/http://sharks-ocearch.verite.com/">keep track here</a>!</p>

<p>While there are 34 other sharks tagged by OCEARCH out there, they aren&apos;t as present as Mary Lee, who is &quot;super coastal&quot; and therefore sending out more pings, as opposed to the others whose tracking devices don&apos;t go off as much due to their deep ocean locations. Founder Chris Fischer says, &quot;Until now, many researchers have never gotten up close to a great white. And Mary Lee is the first shark in history we are able to track like this.&quot; His goal is to learn more about the Atlantic great white.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035328/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/montauk_shark_fishing.php#photo-1">plenty of sharks in Montauk</a>, of course, but ever since Steven Spielberg made it so, there&apos;s always been a fascination with these particular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035328/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/20/jaws_turns_37_today.php">Jaws-like creatures</a>. However, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035328/http://easthampton.patch.com/articles/real-life-jaws-arrives-in-the-hamptons#photo-13167344">East Hampton Patch</a>, no one should panic&#x2014;&quot;Petty Officer Patrick Rogers at Coast Guard Station Shinnecock said there is no cause for alarm, as the shark is heading away from the coast.&quot; Rogers added that this is the first time he&apos;s come across a great white in the waters.
