<p>Making its first appearance in North America this year is Anish Kapoor&apos;s &quot;most viscerally arresting installation&quot; called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016033922/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/press/anish-kapoor-descension-to-be-installed-at-bbp?mc_cid=384cc8f8c7&amp;mc_eid=6d606966c4">Descension</a>.&quot; The piece looks like a portal to another dimension and if you stare at it long enough it may just offer a sweet, dark daydream escape from life in Trump&apos;s America. </p>

<p>The installation will be in Brooklyn Bridge Park from May 3rd through September 10th, and comes by way to the Public Art Fund; their chief curator, Nicholas Baume, had this to say about the piece: &quot;[Kapoor] creates an active object that resonates with changes in our understanding and experience of the world... [he] is interested in what we don&#x2019;t know rather than in what we do, understanding that the limit of perception is also the threshold of human imagination.&#x201D; </p>

<p>You&apos;ll be able to find it, come May, in the Park&apos;s Pier 1 area&#x2014;just look for the massive, 26-feet in diameter continuously spiraling funnel of dark water.</p>

<p>The Public Art Fund is turning 40 years old this year, and you can learn more about the process of bringing specific public art pieces to NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016033922/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/24/nyc_public_art_process.php">right here</a>.
