<p>Hot off the heels of news that Staten Island men are amongst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035609/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/12/staten_island_men_are_the_most_sens.php">the most sensitive</a> in the nation, some FBI documents have been unsealed showing that the borough&apos;s own Wu-Tang Clan is linked to guns, drugs, and murders. The report was obtained by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035609/http://gun.io/blog/i-got-ol-dirty-bastards-fbi-file/">blogger Rich Jones</a>, who filed a FOIA request. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035609/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ol-dirty-bastard-fbi-file-filled-drug-gun-murder-allegations-wu-tang-clan-article-1.1005698#ixzz1jNBjZSsl">the Daily News</a>, the 93-page file is part of the late Russell Jones&apos;s file, aka Ol&#x2019; Dirty Bastard.</p>

<p>The August 1999 report shows that NYPD detectives &#x201C;have documented in their case files that the Wu-Tang Clan is involved in the sale of drugs, illegal guns, weapons possession, car jackings and other types of violent crime,&#x201D; also blaming one member of the 9-man group for the 1997 murder of Staten Island man Robert Johnson. The man had a falling out with the group and it&apos;s believed his death was ordered by a member, and his wasn&apos;t the only one.</p>

<p>You can read all about the murders, racketeering, weapons, and their links to the Bloods street gang, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035609/http://gun.io/blog/i-got-ol-dirty-bastards-fbi-file/">right here</a>. The file also includes a clipping of a Newsday article from 1999 about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035609/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/diddy_finally_settles_lawsuits_from.php">Manhattan nightclub shooting</a> that got Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs and Jennifer Lopez arrested. Nothing is noted about a connection between the group and the incident, however. <em>Interesting!</em></p>

<p>And shockingly, Wu-Tang isn&apos;t commenting on the reports. Here&apos;s a song to listen to while you&apos;re reading through that hefty file: </p>
