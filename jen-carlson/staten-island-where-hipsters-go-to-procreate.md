Hipsters! They&apos;re still here, in all their b&amp;w; print glory. This time they&apos;re settling down in Staten Island to make babies. </p>

<p>The new slow-growing hipster mecca has been a nearly silent Siren for a few years, drawing the hipster crowd over from Brooklyn -- the Times even tells us that at least one resident there wears &quot;black nerd-chic glasses, skinny pants and an Army cap.&quot; He also plays the harmonium and owns vinyl! SI has managed to fend off the hipster crowd for the most part, but they&apos;re ever so slowly beginning to colonize the North Shore. St. George, Tompkinsville and Stapleton are low-rent, indie friendly neighborhoods -- though most South Shore residents look at the area as &quot;the ghetto&quot;. Slightly dangerous + cheap + small artist community + <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040919/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/09/lamours_rocks_s.php">L&apos;amour</a> seems like it may be an equation for future luxury condos.</p>

<p>Recent talk of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040919/http://www.plannyc.org/project-77-Staten-Island-North-Shore-Light-Rail">a light rail on the North Shore</a> may also help draw attention to the area and bring over even more 30-somethings that are through with their now overpriced Brooklyn rents. As a snapshot of what you can get with your hard earned cash, one couple in the Times article pay $375 a month to rent a cottage on a farm in Stapleton, and another rent a two-bedroom apartment in a Victorian house for $950 a month.
