<p>Even though the original Hole lineup briefly reunited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609173541/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/14/video_hole_reunite_at_surprise_show.php">last year in Brooklyn</a>, Courtney Love will be taking a new band on when she does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609173541/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/courtney_love_is_touring_this_summe.php">a short tour in June</a>. She&apos;s also ditching the Hole name in favor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609173541/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">her own</a>, taking a cue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609173541/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/billy_corgan_interview.php">from Billy Corgan</a> and leaving the past in the past. But where does a rock veteran like Love find musicians to back her up? Craigslist, just like your friend&apos;s friend&apos;s band. From an interview she recently did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609173541/http://www.bust.com/courtney-love-discusses-nirvana-rage-and-not-being-crazy.html">with BUST</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The band, such as it is, consists of Love, her guitarist Micko Larkin, drummer Scott Lipps, and bassist Shawn Dailey. For now she&#x2019;s the only girl in the group, but that&#x2019;s not for lack of trying. &apos;I put an ad on Craigslist that said, &#x2018;Band in the style of Hole looking for bassist in the style of Melissa Auf der Maur.&#x2019; I got exactly one response. There&#x2019;s just not a lot of chick bass players.&apos;&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Auf der Maur has left an impossible bass strap to fill, but at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609173541/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Dailey#Hole_.282008-Present.29">Dailey</a> was in the 2008 version of Hole. In the interview, Love also brings up something we can all agree on: a Nirvana musical would be a terrible, terrible thing (&#x201C;Somebody has to guard the gates of this thing. Because you know what would happen? The second I sell [the rights], it becomes a jukebox musical, makes a billion dollars, and you&#x2019;ve got jazz hands on Broadway.&quot;) So at least she&apos;s changed her tune on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609173541/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/is_courtney_love_bringing_a_nirvana.php"><em>that whole thing</em></a>.</p>

<p>Love and her new band will play Warsaw in Greepoint on June 26th and the Capitol Theatre on June 27th.</p>
