<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111232047/http://twitter.com/Newyorkist/status/4733946981">Spotted on</a> Mott between Spring and Prince: a <strike>passive-</strike>aggressive note to a mysterious anti-pooper scooper! We just can&apos;t help but think this note could have been written better, though. It currently reads: &quot;To person whose dog has taken a shit twice this week and you didn&apos;t pick it up. I&apos;ll be watching. If I catch you it won&apos;t go well for you.&quot; The threatening tone is there, but it doesn&apos;t seem to have that certain... <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. Next time maybe just try to sick the Sanitation Department on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111232047/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/05/fido_fines_doub.php">the Pooper-trator</a>.</p>
