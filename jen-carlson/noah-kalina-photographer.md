After posting a video online containing a photograph of himself taken each day for six years, he went down in viral video history. That video, called &quot;everyday,&quot; was scored to original music by his ex-girlfriend Carly Comando, and both have the world&apos;s attention again after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152141/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/17/homer_simpson_n.php">The Simpsons parodied it</a> a couple of weeks ago. If you are one of the few who haven&apos;t seen the original, you can do so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152141/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B26asyGKDo">here</a>. This Friday marks the 8th year he&apos;ll be taking a photograph of himself every day! And today Jen Bekman is offering one of Kalina&apos;s prints for sale through her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152141/http://20x200.com/">20x200 website</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>It&apos;s been over a year since &quot;everyday&quot; came out, how have things changed for you since then? Have you gotten more attention as a photographer even though the video didn&apos;t really showcase your talent in that area?</strong><br>
Things have changed considerably. The video was accepted by both the art world and pop culture worlds. As a result I was flown to a show that displayed everyday in a museum in Switzerland and I was flown out to LA to attend parties and take part in the VH1 Big in &apos;06 awards. For a time I was really busy preparing for all of these different shows and events. I also get a lot more emails now but for the most part things have seemed to have died down. At least for now.</p>

<p>Regarding my professional photography it has helped, but I can&apos;t really quantify how much. Millions of people have looked at my video and a lot check out my photography afterwards, but it hasn&apos;t really turned into jobs. I think people look at my work now and say, &quot;This is the work of that guy who took a photo of himself every day for six years,&quot; scratch their chins and move on.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have plans for another viral-type project in the future?</strong> <br>
I&apos;ve had some ideas, and I was trying to put something together a few months ago, but I stopped working on it. I think in my mind all I wanted to do was try to trump the success of everyday with something sensational. Now I&apos;m taking my time. I may or may not have another viral video in the next few years.</p>

<p><strong>Recently The Simpsons aired a parody of your video, can you explain how that came about. Has Carly Comando spoken with them or come to any sort of agreement since they used her song without permission?</strong><br>
The Simpsons never contacted me. They contacted Carly and sent her the script. She then sent it to me and told me they were going to do it. They were negotiating a deal for the use of her music, but then they stopped and she never heard back. Both of us assumed that they were no longer going to use her song. Sure enough it aired with her music, but we didn&apos;t even know to watch. I just started receiving text messages and emails from friends and fans around the country that night.</p>

<p>The next day I made a post on my blog about Fox not paying Carly for her song.  Blogs and newspapers picked up the story and it became a big deal. As a result I got a call from one of the writers of the Simpsons who told me it was a big mistake and they are doing what they can to correct it. He also wanted to say how much he loved my video and thanked me for the inspiration.</p>

<p>I&apos;m not totally sure what Carly has done as far as getting the money from them, but I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;ll get resolved soon. All of that aside, I&apos;m thrilled that they did it and I love their take on it.</p>
