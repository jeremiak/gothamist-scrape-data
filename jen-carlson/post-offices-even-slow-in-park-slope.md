<p>The argument over where New York&apos;s worst post office is could go on forever, since they are all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160828101219/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/03/far_rockaway_po.php">pretty much</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160828101219/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/23/is_the_kensingt.php">the worst</a>, but one tipster is tossing the 9th Street Post Office of Park Slope into the hat. So angered by the slowness of the establishment, this morning one local (we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160828101219/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/12/move_over_ket_c.php">our suspicions</a>) turned to the chalk to take out their aggressions. Now, now, let&apos;s all take a deep breath and recall when  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160828101219/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/15/residents_businesses_rally_for_prin.php">residents rallied</a> for the now-closed Prince Street Post Office, declaring: &quot;The Worst Post Office is Better Than No Post Office!&quot;</p>
