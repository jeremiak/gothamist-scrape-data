Below, a sampling of their wisdom:</p>

<ul><li>Don&apos;t say you&apos;re &quot;from New York&quot; when you&apos;re from New Jersey or Long Island. There are very nice parts of New Jersey and Long Island; some very nice people live there. But this is not Boston&#x2014;you don&apos;t get to say you&apos;re &quot;from New York City&quot; if you&apos;re from slightly outside it. If your prevarication is discovered, this is a quick route to contempt.
</li><li>Never ever ever EVER refer to the city as &quot;the Big Apple.&quot; If you say this, you are a tourist, and a clueless one at that. Using the phrases &quot;only in New York!&quot; and &quot;a New York minute&quot; falls in the same category, but they may be used, sparingly, by long-time residents, with a heavy dose of irony.
</li><li>Don&apos;t wear &quot;I Heart NY&quot; t-shirts, or indeed any article of clothing that mentions New York in any capacity, with the exception of gear supporting a sports team.
 </li><li>When you get on a bus or step up to a subway turnstile, have your change or MetroCard ready. There&apos;s a special circle of hell devoted to people who waste 20 seconds of everyone else&apos;s time with their fumbling.
</li><li>Don&apos;t ask people where you can find good &quot;New York Pizza.&quot; In New York, it&apos;s just called pizza... do not say you prefer Chicago, New Haven or (God help you) California pizza. This is a direct route to a heated argument.
</li><li>New York eats late&#x2014;don&apos;t propose dinner earlier than 7 p.m. unless the other party has kids. People won&apos;t hate you for violating this, but they may give you a strange look.
</li><li>DO NOT eat at Olive Garden, TGIF&apos;s, Macaroni Grill or anything else you can eat at home.
</li><li>This may seem like a no-brainer, but I&apos;ve encountered it way too often: if you are a tourist, don&apos;t bring up 9/11.
</li><li>Perhaps less of a faux pas and more of a pet peeve; don&apos;t ask &quot;What&apos;s a good restaurant?&quot; or &quot;What&apos;s a good hotel?&quot; There are literally thousands of restaurants and hotels in New York, many of them good.
</li><li>This one is absolutely vital&#x2014;don&apos;t interfere with others&apos; privacy. New York is a very crowded place. The way people deal with it is to create their own space. Thus, what outsiders often see as aloofness and isolation is, in fact, a sign of community; there is a shared ethos that everyone respects others&apos; privacy and expects others to respect his own. This is chiefly communicated through eye contact. If you stare at someone on the subway: if you linger in looking out your window into someone else&apos;s bedroom; if you react to or interrupt a celebrity; or if you seem to be intentionally listening in to another&apos;s conversation, you are violating one of New York&apos;s most sacred unwritten rules. Keep yourself to yourself, buddy, and let others do the same.
</li><li>Skipping / omitting &quot;the&quot; in &quot;the Bronx.&quot;
</li><li>Do not touch a stranger&apos;s kid. 
</li><li>Don&apos;t fake a New York accent.</li></ul>

<p>Are tourists really walking around <strike>the</strike> Bronx touching strangers&apos; kids and eating California pizza before 7 p.m.? Only in New York! [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204012/http://kottke.org/11/09/nyc-etiquette">Kottke</a>]</p>
