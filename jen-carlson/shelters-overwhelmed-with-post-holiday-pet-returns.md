										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpg9MTsDPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022043051im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpg9MTsDPM.jpg" width="213" height="250" class="image-left"> </span>Remember when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022043051/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/08/daily_candy.php">Daily Candy suggested</a> you buy an adorable little potbelly piglet as a stocking stuffer over the holidays? Well, now those and other animals given away as gifts this past Christmas are filtering into the shelter system.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022043051/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/pets/2010/01/08/2010-01-08_after_holiday_thrill_ends_many_christmas_morrning_puppies_and_kittens_dumped_at_.html">the Daily News</a> new pet owners are knocking down shelter doors after finding their adorable gifts to be a time suck and money pit.</p>

<p>The Humane Society of NY&apos;s Sandra DeFeo says, &quot;Lots of people come to us before Christmas and say they want to get an animal as a gift for their fianc&#xE9;e, or their mother, or their brother. Then after Christmas... people admit they are not prepared and they want us to take care of the animal.&quot; She adds that larger animals are returned more often, and even more gifted pets are expected in the coming months. </p>

<p>Patrick Kwan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022043051/http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=48782834768">of the HSUS</a> tells us &quot;February (Valentine&apos;s Day) is another time when people make the uninformed decision to buy animals from pet stores to give away as surprise gifts.&quot; Stick to a box of chocolates, people! Or if you want to give your sweetheart a furry friend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022043051/http://www.petfinder.com/petpromise">give them a certificate</a> for a pet from an shelter animal, so they can make a decision on their own (while not supporting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022043051/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/06/puppy_mills.php">puppy mills</a>).</p>
