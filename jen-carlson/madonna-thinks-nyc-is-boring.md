Well, sort of. In this coming month&apos;s issue of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520103421/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/05/madonna200805?currentPage=1">Vanity Fair</a> the material girl says New York has lost its magic.</p><blockquote>&quot;It&apos;s not the exciting place it used to be. It still has great energy; I still put my finger in the socket. But it doesn&apos;t feel alive, cracking with that synergy between the art world and music world and fashion world that was happening in the 80s. A lot of people died.&quot;</blockquote>Odd, wasn&apos;t one of her last videos for a track called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520103421/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyjUmRr_wuU">&quot;I Love New York&quot;</a>? Guess we shouldn&apos;t expect any love songs on her upcoming release, <em>Hard Candy</em>.<p></p>

<p>When Madonna first came to New York in 1977, she worked at Dunkin&apos; Donuts while dancing in modern dance troupes. She said of that time, &quot;When I came to New York, it was the first time I&apos;d ever taken a plane, the first time I&apos;d ever gotten a taxi-cab, the first time for everything. And I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I&apos;d ever done.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;re guessing the excitement wears off as you near 50-years-old and have enough money to buy your former employer out. Either that or, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520103421/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/03/madonna_no_longer_loves_new_yo.html">NY Mag</a> says, living in &quot;Marylebone, London is <em>so</em> CBGB circa 1983.&quot; Chances are she&apos;ll frequent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520103421/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/23/goodbye_cbgb_he.php">the John Varvatos boutique</a> that took over CBGB more than she appeared at the venue itself. </p>
