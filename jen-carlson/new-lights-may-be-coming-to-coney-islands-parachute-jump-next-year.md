<p>It appears that the &quot;Eiffel Tower of Brooklyn,&quot; aka the now defunct Parachute Jump in Coney Island, is going to get an <em>illuminating</em> makeover! Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145906/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/20/coney_island_parachute_jump_needs_b.php">in March</a> the NYCEDC, who have been working on rehabilitating the landmarked amusement ride for years, announced they wanted to bring a new lighting scheme to the structure. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145906/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/173002/ny1-exclusive--luna-park-operator-wins-bid-to-light-up-coney-island-s-parachute-jump">NY1 reports</a> that &quot;Zamperla, the company that runs Luna Park, has won the city&apos;s bid to add lights.&quot; The proposal will go before the Landmarks Preservation Commission on December 11th, and they could be installed as soon as next summer.</p>

<p>Currently the lighting incorporates over 150 fixtures, 450 LEDs and 17 lamps&#x2014;it&apos;s also programmable with different schemes reflecting the seasons, holidays, and lunar cycles throughout the year.</p>
