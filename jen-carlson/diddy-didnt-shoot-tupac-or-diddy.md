title: Diddy Didn't Shoot Tupac...or Diddy?

<p><img alt="200803diddybiggie.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174146im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200803diddybiggie.jpg" width="220" height="285" class="left">Though the mystery has never been solved, many have attached Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs and Christopher Wallace (Biggie Smalls/The Notorious B.I.G.) to the 1994 attack and 1996 killing of Tupac Shakur -- sparking an East Coast/West Coast rap war, leading to Biggie&apos;s 1997 murder and escalating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174146/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/24/video_of_the_da_67.php">the &quot;no snitching&quot; policy</a> into law. The accusation even came from Tupac himself after the attack in 1994. </p>

<p>Enter LA Times writer Chuck Phillips, who has been on the beat for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174146/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fi-tupac6sep06,1,1478981.story">quite some time</a>, and continues to be a thorn in the sides of Combs &amp; Co. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174146/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-naw-quad17mar17,0,4451053.story">His latest look</a> at the now 14 year old attack (and 12 year old unsolved murder) contains new information which, in part, backs up &quot;Shakur&apos;s insistence that associates of rap impresario Sean &apos;Diddy&apos; Combs were behind the [1994] assault. Their alleged motives: to punish Shakur for disrespecting them and rejecting their business overtures and, not incidentally, to curry favor with Combs.&quot; </p>

<p>The associates are two New York hip-hop figures: James &quot;Jimmy Henchman&quot; Rosemond and James Sabatino. The latter is in jail for an unrelated crime, and the former is the CEO of Czar Entertainment; he has never been questioned in the murder case even though an FBI informant pegged him as being involved. Rosemond says he&apos;ll be talking to his lawyer about the libelous LA Times article. </p>

<p>As for Diddy, he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174146/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/03/18/2008-03-18_diddy_raps_lie_in_hit_on_shakur.html">speaking out</a> against the allegations as well, saying that neither he nor Biggie &quot;had any knowledge of any attack before, during or after it happened,&quot; and is &quot;shocked the story was published.&quot; He alleges the story, which is based off of FBI records and informant statements, &quot;is a lie. It is beyond ridiculous and completely false.&quot;</p>

<p>The movie currently titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174146/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/09/finding_biggie.php"><em>Notorious</em></a> (due out in January 2009) will likely have a slant favoring Combs and Biggie. Casting has just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174146/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1582881/story.jhtml">been completed</a> and Brooklyn rapper Gravy will play B.I.G. Surprisingly Combs will not play himself -- Derek Luke will take on that role, while Anthony Mackie will play Tupac Shakur. Filming has already begun in New York.</p>
