<p>In December word got out that <em>Saturday Night Live</em> had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095705/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/12/saturday_night_live_held_secret_aud.php">secretly auditioning</a> black female comedians, in response to the criticisms about the lack of diversity in the new cast. (Earlier this season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095705/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/videos_saturday_night_live_3.php#photo-1">SNL skewered its own lack of diversity</a> by airing a sketch where host Kerry Washington was forced to play Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Beyonce.) After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095705/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/14/videos_these_are_reportedly_the_3_f.php">narrowing down candidates</a>, Lorne &amp; Co. have finally picked the new addition&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095705/http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/saturday-night-live-adds-sasheer-zamata-black-cast-member/">Deadline reports</a> it&apos;s UCB alum Sasheer Zamata, who will make her debut on January 18th (with Drake as host and musical guest). </p>
