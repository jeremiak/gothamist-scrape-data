										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpOckttaAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpOckttaAM.jpg" width="640" height="358" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>On the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656/http://www.hulu.com/watch/566433">most recent episode</a> of <em>The Mindy Project</em>, Dr. Mindy Lahiri (played by Kaling) is seen trying to get her Christmas tree on to a crowded subway car. (The show, by the way, has some of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/04/does_the_mindy_project_have_the_mos.php#photo-1">the most unrealistic subway cars</a> on television.) This move wasn&apos;t some made up Hollywood thing... it happens in the real life subway system every holiday season. But is it <em>okay</em>?</p>

<p>Last year there was that 12-foot tree on the subway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/29/12-foot_christmas_tree_spotted_on_s.php">which we gave a pass to</a>, noting it was something only Clark W. Griswold would be ballsy and idiotic enough to try, and therefore demanding approval. You see, The Christmas Tree doesn&apos;t have the same rules as other large items&#x2014;while your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/photo_bros_bring_patio_furniture_on.php">iron patio furniture set</a> may lead to civil unrest, a Christmas tree can transform a dreary train car tableau into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/18/the_best_the_worst_of_christmas_tel.php#photo-1">a magical holiday Lifetime movie scene</a>. So even if it&apos;s large and intrusive, only a grinch will really be annoyed. <em>Or</em> anyone who associates holidays with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/04/gift-amist_an_occasional_holiday_gi.php">empty materialism</a>... or bad memories... or intense stress and anxiety... or that, like, feeling of a true sense of aloneness.</p>

<p>It may also start a chain reaction of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150656/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/execution_date_set_for_local_tree.php">Arboreal Bloodlust</a>. </p>

<p>So maybe just don&apos;t bring your tree on the train... and especially don&apos;t do it in the way it&apos;s pictured above.<br>
