<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115045217/http://gothamist.com/tags/trevornoah">Trevor Noah</a>, who will be taking over Jon Stewart&apos;s desk at <em>The Daily Show</em> later this month, was one of 10 men photographed for Vanity Fair&apos;s feature on the &quot;titans&quot; of late night talk shows that was released yesterday. The photo was met with uproar over the lack of women in the late night world, and Noah has now responded, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115045217/http://www.newsweek.com/trevor-noah-women-are-more-powerful-men-comedy-372142">telling Newsweek</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;Yes, that Vanity Fair [spread] is all men, which is what it is. But I guess what we need to look at is how is that evolving? The first step in that is you go, OK, there&apos;s two men of color. That&apos;s a big jump. Pretty soon there will be a woman that&apos;ll be added to that. And there will probably be more women, which is gonna be fantastic. And over time, that&apos;ll happen; it&apos;s a conversation that we need to continue having. We always have to address the shortcomings of any era that we are living in. I think we also sometimes need to take a beat to realize the progress that is being made.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>

<p>He added, &quot;women are more powerful than men in comedy right now. If you look at the top comedy actors, Melissa McCarthy by far is killing most of the numbers of other actors. You look at Amy Schumer right now&#x2014;I would argue that there is no more preeminent voice in comedy. Tina Fey, Amy Poehler...&quot;</p>

<p>The spread <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115045217/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/14/vanity_fair_late_night_hosts.php">featured 10 men</a>&#x2014; Jimmy Fallon, Conan O&#x2019;Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Maher, James Corden, Larry Wilmore, John Oliver, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah&#x2014;all of whom have their own late night programs on network and cable television. While the lack of women isn&apos;t the fault of Vanity Fair, the magazine titled their article: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115045217/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/late-night-tv-colbert-fallon-kimmel?mbid=social_twitter">Why Late-Night Television Is Better than Ever</a>.&quot; But maybe it could be... better-<em>er</em> than ever-<em>er</em>... you know, with some female voices? Even Stephen Colbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115045217/http://splitsider.com/2015/09/17-men-2-women-colberts-writers-room-shows-that-nothings-changed-in-late-night/">only has 2 women</a> in his writers&apos; room, compared to 17 men&#x2014;and he&apos;s supposed to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115045217/http://splitsider.com/2015/08/stephen-colbert-vows-that-late-show-will-celebrate-womens-voices/">our great white male hope</a>!</p>
