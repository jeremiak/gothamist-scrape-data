<p>Before their big show at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224614/http://gothamist.com/tags/governorsball">Governors Ball</a> this weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224614/http://gothamist.com/tags/gunsnroses">Guns n&apos; Roses</a> will play the intimate Brooklyn Bowl. The show, taking place this Thursday at 8 p.m., was just announced, and tickets will go on sale TONIGHT (June 4th) at 7 p.m. Tickets will set you back $150 each (no, that does not include traveling back in time to the glory days of the original lineup), and there&apos;s a four ticket max per person. The price includes a full-set, followed by a late night after-party featuring Gn&#x2019;R keyboardist Chris Pitman as DJ.</p>

<p>They warn: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224614/http://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/292933?utm_source=MEL&amp;utm_medium=34765">only buys tickets HERE</a> (not through scalper or any other website.)</p>

<p>If you drink enough, it might seem like this:<br>

<p>If you don&apos;t, it&apos;ll be more like this&#x2014;but you gotta hand it to Axl, he&apos;s got a lot of energy for a 51-year-old with some hard road miles behind him!:<br>

<p>P.S. The press release we received noted that there is absolutely no audio or video recording, and no cameras allowed :(</p>
