                            <p>In October, director Michel Gondry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303235135/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/gondry_filming_at_home_in_williamsb.php">was spotted filming</a> outside of his house on Orient Avenue in Brooklyn. No <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> sequel rumors spread (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303235135/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/20/eternal_nightmare.php">Clementine&apos;s house</a> is on the same block), but curiosity was piqued. Turns out the work was all for Dick Annegarn&apos;s &quot;Soleil du soir&quot; video. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303235135/http://shapeandcolour.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/michel-gondry-dick-annegarn-soleil-du-soir/">one blogger</a> notes, the artist sounds a bit like the French Randy Newman. But you still get some cool shots of the neighborhood. And way to go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303235135/http://gardengrillcoffeeshop.com/">Garden Grill</a>, the diner got a bunch of time lapse love.</p>
