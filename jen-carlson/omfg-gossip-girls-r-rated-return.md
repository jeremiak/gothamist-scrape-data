<p>When last the teens of <em>Gossip Girl</em> were gossiped about, it was pre-writers strike and Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf were battling through the tough adolescent years: sex, car services and cocktails at The Plaza. Tonight the drama returns, with the first of five episodes that will close out season one. </p>

<p>Serena, known IRL as Blake Lively, said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122117/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-04-17-gossip-girl-ads_N.htm">the advertising campaign</a> (pictured) is accurate, and that every episode will contain at least three &quot;Oh-my-goodness-gracious!&quot; moments. She tones down the raciness there, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122117/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-04-17-gossip-girl-main_N.htm">the show is allegedly</a> &quot;introducing a new generation to the city Sex [and the City] glamorized a decade ago,&quot; and they&apos;ve also got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122117/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i639db5ad9522d8c75c65fbe6fda1a776">ads running on-air</a> that are steaming up small screens nationwide.</p>

<p>The show gained a lot of viewers through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122117/http://tvdecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/gossip-girl-returns-no-streaming-for-you/">online streaming</a> of episodes at CWTV.com, but the higher-ups that delivered that service will now taketh away, only offering iTunes downloads at $1.99 a pop. An experiment to &quot;see if we can grow the ratings by keeping these five episodes exclusive to our airwaves.&quot; Failing that, will all the on-air bad judgments, low morals and wrong-side-of-the-East River relationships (Nate and Vanessa? OMFG!) save <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122117/http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/tvguide/359654_thebiz18.html">the struggling CW network</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122117/http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/46225">NYMag</a>, in a lengthy article on the show, seems to think so.</p>
