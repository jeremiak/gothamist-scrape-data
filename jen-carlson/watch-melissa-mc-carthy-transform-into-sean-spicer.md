<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510231158/http://gothamist.com/tags/melissamccarthy">Melissa McCarthy</a> will host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510231158/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> for her sixth time this coming weekend, which means we&apos;ll see the return of Sean Spicer. Will this be the last time we see Spicey this season? NBC just released a teaser for the episode (the penultimate of the season) which shows the actress&apos;s transformation into the press secretary. Beautiful.</p>

<p>Haim will be the musical guest this weekend, and next weekend (May 20th) The Rock and Katy Perry will hold it down for the finale.</p>
