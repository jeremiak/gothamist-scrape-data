<p>Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119104655/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/02/pearl_jam_nyc.php">as we suspected</a>: Pearl Jam will be playing Central Park this September, as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119104655/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/festival/2015/">the Global Citizen Festival</a> lineup. Along with that announcement comes another big name joining the bill, Beyonce, who also made an appearance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119104655/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/28/video_beyonce_jay_z_light_up_centra.php">last year</a> along with husband Jay Z. </p>

<p>Coldplay was also recently added to the bill, prior to that the only act announced was Ed Sheeran, pal of Taylor Swift, so we wouldn&apos;t be surprised if she made a cameo. Chris Martin is actually a partner with Global Citizen, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119104655/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/beyonce-to-perform-at-global-citizen-festival-in-central-park/">the NY Times</a> got Beyonce on board, calling her &quot;our dream headliner.&quot; He added, &quot;I did feel like a 12-year-old boy asking her: &#x2018;I know you&#x2019;re really busy...&apos; She is this powerful presence and person. She can make any bill look good.&quot;</p>

<p>The concert is entering its fourth year in the Park, and will take over the Great Lawn on September 26th. The show is free, but attendees need to earn spots by taking &quot;actions&quot;&#x2014;this includes writing letters to world leaders, making phone calls to elected officials and signing petitions. The event is meant to raise awareness and help fight against inequality and world hunger.</p>
