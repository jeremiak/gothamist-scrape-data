<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415101843/http://maningray.com/">Man in Gray</a> creates loud music that we love to scream and sing to when it&apos;s on our iPod. This gets us strange looks on the subway, but it&apos;s totally worth it. Somehow it simultaneously speaks to our teen angst ridden soul and our present day state of mind. From political punk and think rock to schizophrenic ballads, the band has an original sound with some traces of Sleater-Kinney, The Thermals and maybe even The Breeders mixed in. 
The co-ed Man in Gray is part hard-edged punk, part melodic hard rock and they&apos;re always leaving us shaking our heads and moving our feet. 
Be sure to get to Movable Hype tomorrow night by 8pm for their set! More details after the interview...  

</p><p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
Bryan: We used to hang out at the Spring Lounge after practice and since we had our first show coming up (a showcase at NYU in early 2001) but were being too indecisive about picking a name, I (drunkenly) decided that the first thing I read on a jive dictionary on the wall would be our name. There ya go.<br>
Tina: I think Bryan covered that very well.  Let&apos;s just say at a bar, drunk and looking for inspiration.<br>
Jeremiah: It&apos;s slang for &quot;postman&quot; or something. It was on the wall at a bar we used to hang out at when we were just starting. We thought it sounded kinda cool.<br>
Jared: I wasn&#x2019;t around, so somebody besides me should answer that.<br>
Jeremy: We were at a bar and needed a name for our first show.  They had a jive dictionary on the wall, and after we chose &quot;Man in GraY&quot; a guy with a gray suit came in to the bar and started dancing. I thought that was a good sign.</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
Bryan: Wondering how long it would take my roommate to kill me and if anybody would notice.<br>
Tina: Thinking that living with three girls in a studio dorm-room was totally normal considering the lack of space in NYC.<br>
Jeremiah: Seeing Buffalo &apos;66 my first night here and Pi the second.<br>
Jared: Being a wee freshman at New York University and wandering over to Avenue A at four in the morning to eat pierogies at Leshko&#x2019;s now-sadly-departed coffee shop.<br>
Jeremy: Going downtown to buy tickets to Superdrag, my first concert in NY.</p>
