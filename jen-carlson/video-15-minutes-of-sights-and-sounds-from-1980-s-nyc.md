<p>This fifteen minute long video will bring you back in time to New York City in the earlier half of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200626/http://gothamist.com/tags/1980s">the 1980s</a>. It&apos;s oddly quiet and calm&#x2014;except for a few sirens and car horns&#x2014;showing Times Square, Central Park, Broadway, and the Twin Towers from the Staten Island Ferry. You&apos;ll see <em>Porky&apos;s</em> on the marquee, boxy old cabs, and a &quot;countdown on the Fuji neon for the Los Angeles Olympics.&quot; The person who filmed it (who also brought us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200626/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/video_times_square_subway_1986.php">this sweet 1986 subway video</a>) notes, &quot;the movie recording on Broadway is for a commercial for the new musical Chorus Line... [and] some street scenes are mixed with radio edits from original 1986 New York radio station recordings.&quot;</p>
