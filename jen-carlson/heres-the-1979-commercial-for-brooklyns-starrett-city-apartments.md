                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="STARRETTCITY0213.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013134im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/STARRETTCITY0213.jpg" width="640" height="452" class="image-none"> </span><br>

<p>What is now called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013134/http://www.springcreektowers.com/">Spring Creek Towers</a>, &quot;the country&#x2019;s largest federally subsidized housing complex,&quot; started out as (and is still better known as) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013134/http://gothamist.com/tags/starrettcity">Starrett City</a>. There are 5,881 apartment units in 46 buildings in the complex, which opened up in 1974 (the name was changed in 2002) in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013134/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=starrett+city+brooklyn&amp;ll=40.647955,-73.881683&amp;spn=0.10133,0.224876&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=starrett+city+brooklyn&amp;cid=0,0,668166431635704781&amp;t=h&amp;z=13">Canarsie/East New York area</a>.</p>

<p>Over time there have been some ups and downs, and in 2008 Starrett City Associates reached an agreement with Federal, State and City officials on a sale process that ensured the property&#x2014;which was developed under the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program&#x2014;would remain affordable if a new owner took over. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013134/http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/NY-Brooklyn-Spring-Creek-Towers.html#axzz2M7QX51YC">some say</a> the rent has been increasing and the management and conditions have been lacking.</p>

<p>But let&apos;s look back at the expansive property, which originally spanned 153 acres, when it first opened its doors. Below is a commercial from 1979, where the narrator/tour guide declares, &quot;In the past year over 1,000 people have made the smart move to Starrett City, it&apos;s almost sold out.&quot; One resident touts the large rooms and parquet floors, and then there&apos;s the utility sell: &quot;Everything is included in the rent&#x2014;gas, electricity, and air conditioning. You get the most for your money.&quot;</p>
