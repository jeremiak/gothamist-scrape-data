Michelle holds two master&apos;s degrees from Columbia, and James is a graduate of NYU (as well as an 11th-generation New Yorker). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060028/http://www.walknyc.com/">Their walking tours</a> showcase their extensive knowledge, and now they&apos;ve put it all down in a book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060028/http://www.insidetheapple.net/"><em>Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City</em></a>, which includes 14 (free) walking tours of various neighborhoods in the city, and 182 little chapters jam-packed with facts. This week they told us a little bit abut how they became such experts, Buddy Holly&apos;s home in the Brevoort apartments, and the only old-growth forest left in Manhattan.</em></p>

<p><strong>When did you start giving tours, and why?</strong> Our interest in exploring New York started avocationally&#x2014;we would just grab a guidebook and go out to find something new. Michelle&#x2019;s academic background is in art history and archaeology and James&#x2019;s interest in New York comes from studying his family roots (he&#x2019;s a 10th generation descendant of the last secretary of the City of New Amsterdam). It became apparent to us at a certain point that we&#x2019;d studied and learned enough that we could share our love and knowledge of the city with an audience. We&#x2019;ve been giving tours professionally for about 10 years now.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any neighborhoods you haven&apos;t given tours of but would like to?</strong> We&#x2019;d love the excuse to spend more time in Brooklyn than we do. We are sometimes asked if we can give tours of neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Brighton Beach, and Park Slope. Right now we haven&#x2019;t done the intensive research necessary to do any of those areas justice, but it would be great to spend more time exploring them.</p>

<p><strong>How did the book come about, and what was the biggest challenge in putting it together?</strong> One of the questions we often get asked on tours is, &#x201C;Where can I read about all the great things I&#x2019;ve just seen?&#x201D; And while we&#x2019;re happy to provide off-the-cuff bibliographies of books and articles for further study, most people who ask that question are really hoping we&#x2019;ll recommend one good, concise history of the city. Since we didn&#x2019;t think that book existed, we decided to write it ourselves. Moreover, we wanted a book that reflected our specialty as tour guides, so every story or vignette in Inside the Apple is tied to a place you can visit.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge the book presented was to make sure that we were getting all our facts straight. We pride ourselves on giving tours that are pretty rigorously researched, but even so it can be easy when presenting information orally to forget a date or mix up a story. We wanted to make sure before committing these tales to print that we had done due diligence and verified everything. We also didn&#x2019;t want to simply repeat pieces of conventional wisdom. We write in the book about Chumley&#x2019;s in the West Village; it&#x2019;s a common story that the term to &#x201C;Eighty-Six&#x201D; something came from the address of the speakeasy&#x2019;s back door. (To eighty-six the customers was to throw them out the door when the cops raided.) The only problem with that story is that the term was clearly in use before Leland Chumley ever created his bar. We wanted to use Inside the Apple to set the story straight about that and other common New York myths and misconceptions.</p>
