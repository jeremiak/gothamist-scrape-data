</div></div>					<p>Yesterday the top dogs of competitive eating faced off at the scales. Reigning champ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729025133/http://gothamist.com/tags/joeychestnut">Joey Chestnut</a> and six-time winner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729025133/http://gothamist.com/tags/takerukobayashi">Takeru Kobayashi</a> were weighed in prior to their annual July 4th Nathan&apos;t Hot Dog showdown tomorrow. Chestnut, 25, came in at 218 lbs, to his 31-year-old competitor&apos;s 132 lbs. The two have faced off four times, with each taking home the belt twice, so this year will be a tie-breaker. Chestnut currently holds the world record, with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729025133/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/04/liveblogging_th_4.php">2007 performance of eating 66 hot dogs</a> in 12 minutes</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150729025133/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/07/03/2009-07-03_man_bites_dog__with_one_winner.html">The Daily News</a> reports that Mayor Bloomberg was on hand, and told the crowd, &quot;July 4 isn&apos;t a holiday for these men. It&apos;s going to be a day of reckoning.&quot; There will be 18 other eaters in the contest, but who will take home the mustard belt?!</p>
