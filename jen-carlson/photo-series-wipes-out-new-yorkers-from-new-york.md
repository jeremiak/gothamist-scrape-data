                            <p>We&apos;ve seen apocalyptic scenes from New York City before, and they always involve the subway system overgrown with weeds and empty streets with old newspapers blowing around like tumbleweeds. This photo series from Lucie and Simon, titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112931/http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/40938/silent-world/">Silent World</a>,&quot; shows the world&#x2019;s busiest cities abandoned... for the most part. There are a few lucky leftovers who get to explore the city without noise, cars, or fellow humans around to get in their way... or maybe they are the unlucky ones? It all seems a little creepy to us, especially when you watch this video of the series, set to the music of Philip Glass and Daft Punk.</p>

The fact that the filter is &apos;normally used by NASA for analyzing stars&apos; ramps up the alien vibes.&quot;</p>
