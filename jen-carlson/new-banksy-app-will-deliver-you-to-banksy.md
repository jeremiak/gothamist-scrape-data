<p>A new iPhone app <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131012081609/http://www.psfk.com/2011/07/discover-banksy-street-art-with-new-location-app.html#ixzz1TQ6reU2D">called Banksy-Locations</a> delivers you directly to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131012081609/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/banksy">the street artist</a>&apos;s work&#x2014;all you need to do is give your current location, and the map will become a guided tour of his nearby pieces. (One blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131012081609/http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/jackalope/2011/07/apple_supports_banksy_art_loca.php">notes</a> that it will likely also become a roadmap for the anti-graffiti set who want to buff out Banksy.) It includes videos, photos, and information about the mysterious artist... but does it know its Banksy from its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131012081609/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/some_pieces_that_could_be_banksys_b.php#photo-1">Fakesy</a>? We paid $1.99 and downloaded the app to find out... but it keeps crashing.</p>
