<p>The Village Voice has dropped their annual Queer Issue, and they&apos;ve put three (allegedly) straight dudes on the cover! What a tease to the issue&apos;s demographic. You know, if you&apos;re into that sort of look. Inside there&apos;s a piece titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094349/http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/guido-gay-down-low-in-jersey/1">The Guido Ideal</a>,&quot; which is about &quot;gay Jersey guidos on the down-low.&quot; But according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094349/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/jersey_boys_queer_shock_kxbOlvAnWqEQ5scuUJFygJ#ixzz0rhF39TOH">the NY Post</a>, cover boys Vinny Gaudagnino, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Mike &quot;The Situation&quot; Sorrentino had no idea they were being photographed for the Queer cover. </p>

<p>We&apos;re guessing this won&apos;t be a problem, however&#x2014;in the past, The Situation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094349/http://www.towleroad.com/2009/12/jersey-shores-the-situation-enjoys-the-attention-of-gay-men.html">has said</a>: &quot;I&apos;ll be honest, I like the attention [from gay men]. I&apos;m flattered if there are guys with different preferences that have crushes on me.&quot;</p>

<p>In the past Pauly D has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094349/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/11/jersey_shore_full_frontal.php">talked about</a> posing full-frontal for <em>Playgirl</em> (which, really, only appeals to gay men)&#x2014;so why did he get the shaft from the Voice cover?</p>
