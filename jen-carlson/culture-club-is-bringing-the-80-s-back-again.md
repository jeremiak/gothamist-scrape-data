</div></div>					<p>Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010238/http://cultureclub.com/">Culture Club</a>, the &#x2018;80s and &#x2018;90s dance megaclub that shut down four years ago? <em>It&apos;s baaack.</em> And tonight they&apos;re celebrating with a little invite-only party that we hear Debbie Gibson is hosting (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010238/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/14/video_of_the_da_3.php">sorry, Tiffany</a>). They tell us, &quot;Culture Club creator Robert Watman has partnered with New York&#x2019;s Pop icon, Debbie Gibson, to be the clubs 80&#x2019;s brand ambassador.&quot; On top of that, designer Nanette Lepore has designed the staff&#x2019;s uniforms.</p>

<p>The new location is at 20 West 39th Street, and will feature Saturday Night Fever dance floors, oversized Rubik&#x2019;s Cubes, original tour memorabilia from Debbie Gibson, homage&#x2019;s to Bon Jovi and larger-than-life images from classic movies like <em>The Breakfast Club</em> and <em>Risky Business</em>. Watman says, &#x201C;Everything about the &#x2018;80s was over-the-top and that&#x2019;s how I envision Culture Club. My goal is to serve those who did not grow up in the &#x2018;80s and those who want to relive the era when everything was just a little bit bigger, louder and brighter.&#x201D;</p>

<p>They&apos;re open for business, so stop by anytime (except tonight!) for your Purple Rain or Gibson Girl novelty cocktail. Until then, practice those dance moves: </p>
