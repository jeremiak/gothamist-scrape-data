Seems their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121042902/http://www.dailycandy.com/all-cities/article/78262/2009-Girls-Gift-Guide">Holiday Gift Guide</a> has a questionable &quot;accessory.&quot; The must-have items they tell their readers to procure this season include a bag, a smaller bag, a camcorder that looks like a Chanel bag, and of course a live, miniature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121042902/http://www.royaldandie.com/photos.php?gallery=2">Royal Dandie piglet</a>. One of these things is not like the other? Should you choose to let them know &quot;that breeding and buying piglets that Paris Hilton will surely get sick of in 10 minutes is unethical, inhumane, and compassion-free,&quot; you can do so by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121042902/mailto:today@dailycandy.com">emailing them</a>. Will already overcrowded animal shelters have some potbellies on their hands next year?</p>
