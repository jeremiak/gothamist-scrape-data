<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141021210238/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/09/angels_accordions.php">Angels &amp; Accordions</a>, the site-specific performance at Green-Wood Cemetery, will take a final bow on October 9th. The dance piece will be performed twice during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141021210238/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/open_house_new_york_1.php">Open House NY</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141021210238/http://www.yournabe.com/articles/2010/10/03/brooklyn_heights_courier/arts/courier-yn_brooklyn_heights-24_angelsandaccordions_2010_10_08_bk.txt">You Nabe</a> reports that it&apos;ll be killed off after that, despite going six years strong now. The event involves dancers dressed in white interacting with tombs, trees and catacombs, with accordions that also serve a practical purpose; choreographer Martha Bowers says, &#x201C;People do get lost, which is why we have the accordions to mark the route. It&#x2019;s crazy to be in the middle of Brooklyn and have no idea which way is out.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Bowers added that the event is &quot;a more gentle, hopeful view of how we include death in life. In this city of the dead, which is so beautiful and quiet, the performance is set up in a way to be timed to walk in a beautiful place and contemplate the richness of living.&#x201D;  As for why the program is ending, she says, &#x201C;You do an event for a certain number of years, it feels like it&#x2019;s time to move on to something else.&quot;</p>
