Yet, on the afternoon of January 12th, one brave tourist decided to sneak in to the building&#x2014;which is where Yoko lives, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151720/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">her husband</a> was fatally shot. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151720/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/prowler_busted_trying_to_visit_yoko_F6AKDEDA2GEqPtcYe5OUJJ#ixzz1BbFaBjwj">The NY Post</a>, Yoko was &quot;alarmed by a housecall&quot; last Wednesday and called the concierge, who contacted the police. 24-year-old Sungno Kim was later found on the roof of the landmark building, where he says he was taking photos of the city. </p>

<p>The NYPD says he entered through the service entrance at 1 West 72nd Street and boarded a freight elevator. We&apos;re guessing they&apos;ve amped up security over there by now.</p>
