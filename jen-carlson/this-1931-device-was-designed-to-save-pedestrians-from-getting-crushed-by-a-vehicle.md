<p>In March of 1931, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727014807/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/this-roller-safety-device-sweeps-away-fallen-pedestrian/">Modern Mechanix</a> magazine featured a new safety device that could be attached to the front of a car or truck. The roller device was meant to prevent death or serious injury when a pedestrian was hit by a moving vehicle. They wrote:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Trucks equipped with <strong>the new safety device will literally sweep a fallen pedestrian before it and thus save him from being crushed to almost certain death beneath the heavy wheels</strong>. The device consists chiefly of a grooved roller mounted on an extension arm in front of the wheels and geared to the engine. On coming in contact with a fallen pedestrian it tends to roll him ahead till the truck can be brought to a stop. Ordinarily, it projects out in front of the car, serving as a bumper, but is released immediately by the driver when there is a possibility of an accident.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>In Paris there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727014807/http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/4192749199/in/gallery-karelmeijers-72157627940622287/">a similar device</a>&#x2014;a &quot;kind of shovel on a car&quot; with the purpose of &quot;reducing the number of casualties among pedestrians.&quot; None of these devices ever caught on, and do we really need to tell you why?</p>
