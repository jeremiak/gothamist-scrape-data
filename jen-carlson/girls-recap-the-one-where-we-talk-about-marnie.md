<span class="photo_caption">&quot;You&apos;re my best friend,&quot; Marnie whispers to her new kitten.</span></p>

<p>Last night (actually, this week the Super Bowl relocated it to Saturday) on <em>Girls</em>, we got our standard 20-something minutes of various characters working their shit out. But let&apos;s just focus on Marnie this time around. You guys, Marnie has become one of the more realistic characters on the show, somehow. Not the most likable, mind you, just a shade more realistic than the others.</p>

<p>Since her fall from... what even happened with her? She lost her art gallery job, moved out of her place with Hannah, and her boyfriend mysteriously left <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223347/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/04/boy_leaves_girls.php">after the actor playing him quit the show</a> over creative differences with Dunham. While many saw last season&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223347/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68cmKBbE_gc">awkward Kanye performance</a> as her rock bottom... we had no idea what was going on behind the scenes: </p>

<p>But it&apos;s a whole new season... and Marnie now lives in a shitty apartment somewhere in Manhattan with her newly adopted cat, and presumably almost no contact with the other Girls. In a search for some realness, some &apos;tear it down to build it back up,&apos; she asks her nemesis Ray to tell it like it is (&quot;I want you to tell me what&apos;s wrong with me. You are someone who likes to tell people what&apos;s wrong them anyway, so... shoot. This is what I need.&quot;). Ray goes full Holden Caulfield and rips into her: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Okay, you ready for this? For beginners, you&apos;re extremely judgmental. You came in here and immediately insulted me and my neighborhood. You come across like you&apos;re better than everyone and you want no part of their lives, and then when you&apos;re excluded from things you&apos;re outrageously offended, and hold on to this grudge. Also you&apos;re unbearably uptight. And you use people, you use people a lot. So much so that even when you try to connect and be sincere it comes across as phony. I think that actually more or less sums it up in a nutshell: you&apos;re a huge fat fucking phony.

<p>But that being said, I still like you. Because behind it all I think you mean well. And I&apos;m old enough to recognize that all of this bullshit comes from a very deep dank dark toxic well of insecurity. Probably created by your absent father. And that allows you to be a sympathetic character.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Since this is a television show, they (spoiler alert) have sex immediately after this on the closest flat surface they can throw their bodies on to. So, in summary: Having sex with a guy you kind of hate? Living in a shitty apartment? With a cat? By yourself? Where are your friends? Where is your life? See, Fallen Marnie is Every Woman... at some point. Not forever. It won&apos;t be like this forever! Probably.</p>
