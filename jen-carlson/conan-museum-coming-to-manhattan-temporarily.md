<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165926/http://gothamist.com/tags/conanobrien">Conan O&apos;Brien</a> returns to New York this month, and he&apos;s ringing in his arrival with a museum dedicated to himself. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165926/http://teamcoco.com/moca">The COCO MoCA</a> will be housed on the 2nd floor of the Time Warner Center from October 24th through November 3rd. Inside, you will find 50 pieces created by artists, each an homage to everyone&apos;s favorite ginger. Here&apos;s a preview, but if you go in person, you&apos;ll also get an audio tour voiced by Conan and Andy Richter, and you&apos;ll be able to experience the Conan Loveseat, an &quot;interactive robotic couch sculpture that talks to fans, hugs them and takes a picture for them.&quot;</p>

<p>Conan will be airing his show live from the Beacon Theatre from October 31st through November 3rd.</p>
