<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520213315/http://www.chashama.org/">Chashama</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520213315/http://chrisrubino.com/">Chris Rubino</a> team up to present, &quot;The Center of Something,&quot; an exhibit centered around the artist&apos;s &quot;take on New York as a destination for both visiting and living.&quot; Since Chashama is in Times Square, the exhibit itself will become a temporary tourist attraction itself. But will the locals or the tourists be the ones flocking to it?</p><blockquote>The exhibit is modeled after the dozens of stores in the neighborhood selling the same inane souvenirs, which play off of tourist&apos;s preconceived images of New York. In an attempt to create new icons for the city, Rubino&apos;s installation will consist of his &apos;souvenirs&apos; as well as hand drawn screenprints that recreate pieces of New York&apos;s everyday scenery, i.e. maps, advertisements, and signage.</blockquote>Catch it before seeing <em>Mamma Mia!</em>, starting May 30th, and don&apos;t forget to fill up on a nice meal from Olive Garden afterwards.<p></p>

<p><em>Running through June 15th at Chashama [112 West 44th St].</em> </p>
