They&apos;re being touted as a &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; opportunity, so here&apos;s your heads up! &quot;For the first time in the history of Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, both attractions will be open on select nights during National Park Week to the general public for tours. This historic undertaking will offer guests not only the tour, but also a first glimpse of Ken Burns&apos; major new documentary on the history of National Parks of the United States.&quot; Park Rangers will also be available for a Q&amp;A; and dinner (which includes one beverage) is part of the $29 price. This will sell out soon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141050/http://www.statuecruises.com/night-tour.html">so get movin&apos;</a>. Just don&apos;t accidentally get locked inside Lady Liberty overnight, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141050/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03E7D7103DE633A25755C0A9629C946597D6CF">these two girls did in 1904</a>!<p></p>
