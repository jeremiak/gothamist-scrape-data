We asked former MTV veejay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022155448/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/30/john_norris_mtv_news.php">John Norris</a> where he was when he found out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022155448/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/the_death_of_kurt_cobain_17_years_l.php">Kurt Cobain died</a>. He tells us:</p>

<blockquote>As un-rock n roll as it sounds, I was standing in Charivari, a one-time super trendy clothing store on West 57th Street, buying a suit for some upcoming event. This being the pre-mobile phone era, MTV called the store and asked to put me on the phone. They let me know the sickening, but sadly, somehow not entirely unbelievable news.  I was back at the studio within fifteen minutes, where we put together several hours of programming, Kurt Loder conducting interviews (including David Fricke who famously called Cobain the &quot;John Lennon of his generation&quot;), while I talked music and intro&apos;d music videos. It is to this day, one of the moments at MTV about which I get asked the most.</blockquote>

<p>Where were you? (We found out watching MTV, of course.)</p>
