<p>Will New Yorkers soon be scaling walls in the landmarked Puck Building on Lafayette Street? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010122435/http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/outdoor-gear-retailer-recreational-equipment-coming-to-kushner-companies-landmarked-puck-building">the Real Deal</a>, REI has inked a deal to move in to a 39,000-square-foot, three-floor space in the building, which will include a bike shop and &quot;Outdoor School&quot; courses, in addition to their gear and other goods. The store is their first in New York City, and will be the first retail outlet in the building in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010122435/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704394704575496261377677230.html?mod=rss_newyork_real_estate">over 100 years</a>&#x2014;they plan to open in the fall of 2011, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010122435/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2010/09/rei-to-open-in-puck-building-next-fall.html">Bowery Boogie</a> points out, &quot;the EMS store on Broadway just around the corner is probably pissed.&quot;</p>

<p>REI&apos;s CEO says, &quot;Our new store in the Puck Building will provide a resource to serve New Yorkers, visitors and community groups eager to enjoy the great outdoors from bike paths and urban greenways.&quot; One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010122435/http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/archives/221741.asp">Seattle blog</a> says: &quot;Cycling is apparently a big deal there.&quot; Indeed, but will we get our own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010122435/http://www.rei.com/stores/11">65-foot climbing wall</a>?</p>
