<p>Did you know the Met is an unfinished work of art? The Metropolitan Museum of Art&apos;s building on Fifth Avenue stands proud with giant columns in the front, and atop those, four giant pyramids of stone slabs. These pyramids were originally meant to be sculpted, but the plan never came to be. </p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092507/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7DD153CF93AA35750C0A96E9C8B63">old NY Times</a> blurb, architect Richard Morris Hunt wanted 31 statues on the facade of the museum, but he died before specifying what those designs above the columns should be. His son suggested they be carved into representations of Music, Architecture, Painting, and Sculpture... but they remain untouched square blocks today.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092507/http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2010/06/unfinished-cornice-of-metropolitan.html">Daytonian in Manhattan</a>, Hunt had already lost his white marble to Indiana limestone during a late 1890s depression, and then in 1901, a year before the museum was finished, there was another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092507/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901">financial panic</a>. As money ran out, the blocks went uncarved, and &quot;the same fate befell the huge circular stone blanks in the Great Hall which Hunt intended to be sculpted out as portraits.&quot; The unfinished blocks are a little rough around the edges, but are accepted as part of the design today.
