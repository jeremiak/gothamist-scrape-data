<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412170903/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/16/flashback.php">we looked back</a> at the in-air plane crash that sent the wreckage of a United Airlines flight onto the streets of Park Slope, and a TWA aircraft onto Staten Island. This December 16th will mark the 50th anniversary of the crash, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412170903/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/50/all_planecrash_2010_12_10_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> revisits it today, noting that there isn&apos;t much of a memorial in the neighborhood, but still some locals left who witnessed the tragedy.</p>

<p>The planes collided at 10:33 a.m., over a military airfield on Staten Island&#x2014;the United flight hit 126 Sterling Place in Park Slope before crashing into 123 Sterling Place. Vito Fiumefreddo was 17 at the time, and ten blocks away; he told the paper, &#x201C;I ran towards it to see what it was all about. I climbed up on a mound of snow and I saw. The stench was horrible. You could smell the burning flesh.&#x201D; All of the 130 souls on board were killed, as well as 6 people on the ground&#x2014;including a doctor who was out walking his dog. Fiumefreddo says bodies were taken to a nearby bowling alley, that became a temporary morgue&#x2014;it&apos;s currently a pool hall on Flatbush Avenue. </p>

<p>While all passengers died (including the 44 on the TWA flight that crashed in Staten Island), 11-year-old Stephen Baltz of Illinois did survive for more than a day. While at Methodist Hospital, Baltz told the doctors, &#x201C;I remember looking out the plane window at the snow below covering the city. It looked like a picture out of a fairy book. Then all of a sudden there was an explosion. The plane started to fall and people started to scream. I held on to my seat and then the plane crashed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Baltz had 65 cents in his pocket, which is part of a small bronze memorial in the hospital&apos;s chapel. A more grand memorial will be unveiled at Green-Wood Cemetery next week&#x2014;it will be 8-feet-tall and made of granite, with the names of all those killed etched into it. The unveiling and a memorial service will take place at the cemetery on December 16th at 9:45 a.m.</p>
