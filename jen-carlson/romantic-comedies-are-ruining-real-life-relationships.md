<p>A new study shows that romantic comedies may be killing the romance in real life relationships. According to the study, women are let down when their men don&apos;t shower them with love, attention and gifts the way professional paid actors do their on-screen love interests. The head of this study surmised, &quot;It seems our love of rom-coms is turning us into a nation of happy-ever-after addicts. Yet the warm and fuzzy feeling they provide can adversely influence our view of real relationships.&quot; </p>

<p>C&apos;mon ladies, in real life we all know that Mel Gibson isn&apos;t going to sweep you off your feet (<em>What Women Want</em> is the 2nd highest grossing rom com of all time). Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101406/http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/cheating-and-infidelity/stats-about-infidelity.html">fact of life</a>: 30-60% of all married couples&apos; relationships involve infidelity. Time to start watching <em>Big Love</em> and coming to terms with the fact that Richard Gere isn&apos;t going to be climbing up your fire escape&#x2014;roses in mouth and despite his fear of heights&#x2014;just to save you from your den of prostitution (<em>Pretty Woman</em> is the 4th highest grossing rom com of all time).
