<p>Gwyneth Paltrow is hawking a white t-shirt on her website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.goop.com/shop/featured/goop-tee.html">GOOP</a> for the price of $90 (+ $10 shipping, making it a cool 100 bucks)... but are you even surprised? She says she &quot;collaborated with Kain Label, creators of the perfect tee, to create a version exclusive to goop. Inspired by tuxedo tailoring, we added grosgrain piping to the shoulders and sides, and shortened the length, modernizing this essential wardrobe staple.&#x201D; The shirt is one size fits all, but in Gwyneth terms that means it &quot;fits US sizes 0-8.&quot; FYI: the average American woman wears a size 12 to 14. Her GOOP collection also includes &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.goop.com/shop/mih-jeans.html">The Marrakesh Jean</a>,&quot; which costs $200.</p>

<p>Here, in no particular order, are a list of Paltrow&apos;s past on-screen characters who would not a) fit in, or b) be able to afford, or c) want these clothes: </p>

<ul><li>Helen in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120148/"><em>Sliding Doors</em></a> is a delivery girl for a restaurant in one of her realities, and would not have been able to afford such a luxury item.
</li><li>Ditto for Abby in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120148/"><em>Bounce</em></a>, who was a struggling real estate agent.
</li><li>Liv in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134630"><em>Duets</em></a>, at least not until she won enough karaoke contests.
</li><li>Michelle in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1103275/"><em>Two Lovers</em></a>, who was a straphanging Brooklynite with a bit of a drug problem.
</li><li>Donna in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264150/"><em>View From The Top</em></a> wouldn&apos;t have liked or have been able to afford these threads.
</li><li>We would like to believe that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/">Margot Tenenbaum</a> would have turned her vintage coat on these items.
</li><li>Lucy in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113851/"><em>Moonlight and Valentino</em></a> was hands down one of Paltrow&apos;s coolest characters, and would have never been caught dead in these items, particularly because they don&apos;t come in black.
</li><li>Rosemary in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256380/"><em>Shallow Hal</em></a> wouldn&apos;t have been able to fit into these pieces of clothing.
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160119040934/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/">Viola De Lesseps</a>: thou must be MAD to think she&apos;d be caught dead in this modern wear.</li></ul>
