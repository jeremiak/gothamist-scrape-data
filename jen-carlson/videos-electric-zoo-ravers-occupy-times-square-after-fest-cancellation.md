<p>After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062613/http://gothamist.com/tags/electriczoo">Electric Zoo</a> cancelled its final day on Sunday following two deaths, 31 arrests, and at least one sexual assault (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062613/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/02/16-year-old_sexually_assaulted_31_a.php">of a 16-year-old</a>), the remaining revelers didn&apos;t want to mourn, or remain silent in the face of tragedy, or think about the ramifications of doing drugs. They just wanted to keep the party going. And where better to roll on Molly and dance to shitty house music than Times Square?</p>
