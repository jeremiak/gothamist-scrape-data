As the interrogation spotlight continues to shine in the faces of the faceless &quot;Board&quot; that made the decision, a press release was sent out to explain what&apos;s going on behind the famous doors. </p>

<p>The Bard Family, who have run the hotel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114549/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/nyregion/19chelsea.html?em&amp;ex=1182398400&amp;en=38258251c2fac138&amp;ei=5087%0A">from Mark Twain to Nancy Spungen</a> to now, have been replaced by a new regime in the form of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114549/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402EFD81038F937A35754C0A9629C8B63">Richard Born and Ira Drukier</a>. You may know them from such buildings as the Maritime Hotel, the TriBeca Grand, the Mercer Hotel, and...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114549/http://www.nyc-architecture.com/CHE/CHE030-PerryWest.htm">this</a>, amongst other ventures. </p>

<p>The press release uses words that insinuate a &quot;modernization&quot; of the building, to counter every one referring to &quot;preservation&quot;. This does not bode well. It starts: &quot;BD Hotels [led by Richard Born and Ira Drukier] has been retained to better preserve, restore and <strong>reinvigorate</strong> the Chelsea Hotel. We are excited to be working with the BD Hotel team in restoring and <strong>rejuvenating</strong> the Chelsea. After conducting an extensive search, we are convinced that there is no one better suited to the dual challenge of pursuing an <strong>ongoing modernization</strong> while at the same time ensuring that the hotel&#x2019;s historic charm and character is both preserved and <strong>enhanced</strong>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The initial contract is a three-year management agreement that will have them managing the hotel&#x2019;s &quot;day-to-day operations, budgeting and accounting, long-term planning, developing and implementing a coordinated renovation plan, and overseeing the street-front retail program.&quot; They&apos;ve also been charged to &quot;create more inviting and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114549/http://starloungenyc.com/room200.html">livelier common areas</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>The press release goes on to say that &quot;long-time Chelsea Hotel manager Stanley Bard, who has been a fixture at the Chelsea for more than 50 years, is expected to have a role at the hotel as will his son David Bard, who also is a member of the Board of Directors.&quot; What this role will be has yet to be made clear to anyone. As for the two who have been put in the Bard&apos;s rightful place, they say, &#x201C;We are honored by the opportunity to burnish and build upon The Chelsea Hotel&#x2019;s unique artistic presence. Given its fabled past and unique status, the Chelsea Hotel can once again become a crown jewel of New York City.&quot; Burnish and build upon? Get ready for a Disney-fied version of a legendary hotel. </p>
