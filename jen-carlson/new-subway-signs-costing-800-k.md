John Montemarano, director of the station signage division, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153905/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/nyregion/10signage.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;We make sure our customers can wake up on June 28 and figure out how the hell to get around.&#x201D; <p></p>

<p>The cost of averting confusion is expected to be around $800,000, and the Crown Heights shop that&apos;s been working on the signs told their employees no vacations until July in order to create everything from stickers to porcelain signs by the deadline. One worker spoke to NYC Transit being a holy grail, and told the paper, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t pass up a job like this.&quot; While Helvetica is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153905/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/30/subway_font_porn.php">official typeface</a> of the system, wouldn&apos;t it be fun to change it up with, say, a little Comic Sans? No?</p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect the old signs to show up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153905/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/07/billys_antiques_owners_subway_sign-.php">Billy&apos;s Antiques</a>, they&apos;re set to be donated to the city&#x2019;s transit archives or sold online.</p>
