<p>Mindy Kaling&#x2019;s new sitcom was picked up for the 2012-2013 television season, and will air on Fox starting later this year. The actress (and producer, and author, and all around multitalent) will star in <em>The Mindy Project</em> (the title will likely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150812/http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/11/fox-mindy-kaling-title/">change</a>) as an OB-GYN &#x201C;who&#x2019;s trying to get her life in order&quot;... and guess what? She&apos;s doing it all in Manhattan. </p>

<p>While &quot;girl getting her life in order in the big city&quot; isn&apos;t exactly a groundbreaking genre, this afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150812/https://twitter.com/#!/mindykaling/status/202141871710015488">Kaling Tweeted</a> the first trailer for the show (it only takes five seconds in to get to a Mayor Bloomberg reference), and it looks pretty great so far! But not everyone is impressed&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150812/https://twitter.com/#!/marcberman/status/202138049038131200">this critic says he</a> &quot;isn&apos;t fond&quot; of the show... but maybe that&apos;s just because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150812/http://jezebel.com/5903382/why-we-need-to-keep-talking-about-the-white-girls-on-girls">he doesn&apos;t feel the show represents <em>him</em></a>?</p>

<p>Speaking of <em>Girls</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150812/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> showed her support for Kaling&apos;s new project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150812/https://twitter.com/#!/lenadunham/statuses/200450783861415937">Tweeting</a>, &quot;I cannot wait to watch every week wearing a pore strip and cheering my head off. Love love love.&quot;</p>

<p>Is this the year real New York women finally find their way to the small screen?<br>
