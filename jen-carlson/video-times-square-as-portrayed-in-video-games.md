<p>The team at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102030830/http://achievementhunter.com/home.php">Achievement Hunter</a> has put together a video montage of how Times Square is portrayed in video games. One of them explains, &quot;I got to thinking what is the place, the location that&apos;s been viewed the most times in a video game. So we looked into it and we found that Times Square has been featured in like a billion XBOX 360 games.&quot; Unsurprisingly they are mostly dark scenes, but watch to the end when you get to see the Hulk throw a taco at the old Times Square Building!</p>
