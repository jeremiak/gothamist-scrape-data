<p>On Monday evening, Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson opened up and transmitted some feelings through social media. And The Rock doesn&apos;t mess with subtweeting&#x2014;on Facebook and Instagram he posted a very clear message to some of his <em>Fast 8</em> co-stars, along with  a video of him gut-punching a guy to the soundtrack of Kid Rock&apos;s &quot;You Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This is my final week of shooting #FastAndFurious8. There&apos;s no other franchise that gets my blood boiling more than this one. An incredible hard working crew. UNIVERSAL has been great partners as well. My female co-stars are always amazing and I love &apos;em. 

<p><strong>My male co-stars however are a different story. Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don&apos;t. The ones that don&apos;t are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses. When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I&apos;m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling&#x2014;you&apos;re right.</strong></p>

<p>Bottom line is it&apos;ll play great for the movie and fits this Hobbs character that&apos;s embedded in my DNA extremely well. The producer in me is happy about this part. Final week on FAST 8 and I&apos;ll finish strong.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>This is The Rock&apos;s first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084821/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/fast_furious_hot_take.php">Fast &amp; Furious movie</a> that he&apos;s filming without the late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084821/http://laist.com/tags/paulwalker">Paul Walker</a>, so someone on set go and wrap their arms around his abs and give him a hug today. Then speculate on which male co-stars are being candy asses: Vin Diesel, Scott Eastwood, Tyrese Gibson, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham are all in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084821/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4630562/"><em>Fast 8</em></a>.</p>
