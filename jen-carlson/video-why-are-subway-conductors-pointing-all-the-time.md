<p>Did you know that MTA Conductors are required to point at the black and white striped boards you see at every station? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104840/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/nyc_subway_conductor_talks_mole_peo.php">In 2011</a>, a conductor explained what was up with all that pointing:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We&apos;re pointing at the conductor&apos;s indication board, which is a zebra-striped sign. If the sign is in front of my window, it means that the entire train is on the platform. They don&apos;t trust us to just look, so required procedure is to point to it at every station before we open the doors. The absolute biggest violation a conductor can make is opening the doors where there isn&apos;t a platform. If that ever happens, the first thing supervision is going to ask you is &apos;Did you point to the board?&apos;&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Some New Yorkers decided to have some fun with this rule recently, standing below the boards with signs that read: &quot;You are not wearing pants right now,&quot; &quot;Shoot the target with your laser finger [bullseye],&quot; &quot;You are dead sexy,&quot; &quot;The 2nd Ave Subway is a lie,&quot; and other things that made our underground guides smile a little during their workday:</p>
