<blockquote>&quot;I think she is a sweet girl... It&apos;s probably exciting to be a crackhead, I wouldn&apos;t say I was a crackhead but I did smoke a lot of crack. I had fun smoking a lot of angel dust. 

<p>Right now I&apos;m a monk. I&apos;m boring, I&apos;m on a green juice fast at this moment so I&apos;m a little high now. I had a double shot of ginger, which makes you a little flighty.&quot; </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Love then <em>commented on the comment</em>, saying, &quot;I&apos;m fairly insulted that he associates me with that drug. What does that mean?&quot; Seems like Russell may have more issues than Courtney right now, but what we <em>do</em> want to know is, why is she so skinny again? She posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514062616/http://twitpic.com/2zpsw0">this photo</a> of herself last night, looking awfully thin.</p>
