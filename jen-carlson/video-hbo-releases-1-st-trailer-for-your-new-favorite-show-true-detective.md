<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175508/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> ending soon, there will be nothing good to watch on TV... <em>or will there?</em> HBO just released the first trailer for <em>True Detective</em>, their new series that <em>finally</em> (we can&apos;t have been the only people waiting for this) brings together Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. (No, no one counts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175508/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131369/"><em>Ed TV</em></a>.) </p>

<p>The two will star in the series, which centers around their detective characters&#x2014;Rust Cohle (McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Harrelson), &quot;whose lives collide and entwine during a seventeen-year hunt for a serial killer in Louisiana. The investigation of a bizarre murder in 1995 is framed and interlaced with testimony from the detectives in 2012, when the case has been reopened.&quot;</p>

<p>The series will premiere in January 2014 and consist of eight episodes, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175508/http://screenrant.com/matthew-mcconaughey-woody-harrelson-true-detective-hbo-scott-168680/">Screenrant</a> reported last year that it will follow &quot;an anthology vein similar to FX&#x2019;s cult-thriller <em>American Horror Story</em>, subsequent seasons of the series may feature a new cast and different storylines.&quot;</p>
