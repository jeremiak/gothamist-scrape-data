<p>Rumors have been floating around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708080149/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/17/an_apple_store.php">for a year</a> as to where the company may set up shop in Brooklyn (with most guessing it would be Downtown), and more recently it&apos;s been rumored that it would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708080149/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/11/wburg_apple.php">in the new Edge complex</a>.</p>

<p>In the past there have been mumblings that the Salvation Army building would become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708080149/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2008/03/williamsburg-food-retail-rumormill.html">a McDonald&apos;s</a>...so if this goes through, consider it a good thing, Williamsburg.</p>
