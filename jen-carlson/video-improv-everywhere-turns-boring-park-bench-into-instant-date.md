<p>We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529110040/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/no_more_no_pants_subway_ride_please.php#photo-1">don&apos;t <em>always</em> love</a> Improv Everywhere&apos;s pranks, but their latest stunt is a perfect example of how endearing their best work can be. The troupe recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529110040/http://improveverywhere.com/2012/04/30/instant-date-2/">surprised a couple</a> on a bench in Central Park with an &quot;instant date&quot; that included sparkling cider, dinner, and an intimate performance by a wind quintet. Just look how happy it made them! Watch it all go down below&#x2014;it will warm even the coldest and deadest of hearts.</p>
