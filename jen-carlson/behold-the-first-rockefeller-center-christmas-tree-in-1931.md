<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206163456/http://gothamist.com/tags/deadtree">Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree</a> has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206163456/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/16/the_tree_has_arrived.php#photo-1">a New York tradition since 1933</a> (when the 30 Rock Plaza opened and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206163456/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/execution_date_set_for_local_tree.php">arboreal bloodlust</a> was in the air), but the first tree actually went up in 1931, while the site was still under construction. </p>

<p>The very first tree you see here was put up and decorated by construction workers. It stood 20-feet high, and according to Daniel Okrent, in <em>Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center</em>, it was adorned with &quot;strings of cranberries, garlands of paper, and even a few tin cans&quot; by Christmas Eve of that year. Okrent also notes that while the men, who by this time were bearing the brunt of the Great Depression, &quot;didn&#x2019;t look fortunate... each was handed proof of his luck: a paycheck&quot; at the wooden crate you see beside the tree.</p>
