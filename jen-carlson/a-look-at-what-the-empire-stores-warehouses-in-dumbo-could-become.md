</div></div>					<p>Earlier this year we saw DoB notices taped onto some shiny glass doors at the Empire Stores Buildings in DUMBO, but when we asked the Brooklyn Bridge Park reps <em>what was going on</em>, we were told, &quot;The glass doors have always been there.  That portion of Empire Store used to be an office for State Parks. The DoB permits are also several years old.  Currently, there isn&#x2019;t any work being conducted.&quot; But soon, there might be...<br>
 <br>
Brooklyn Bridge Park has now published ten design proposals for the waterfront complex, which is made up of &quot;seven landmarked 19th century coffee warehouses between Main and Dock streets with approximately 327,000 square feet of space,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511043400/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2013/04/proposals-for-historic-empire-stores-are-online/">Brownstoner</a>. Click through for a look at the proposals, which include everything from retail and office space to green roofs to A BOXING RING (you can view the complete proposals at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511043400/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/about-us/brooklyn-bridge-park/project-approvals-presentations">Empire Stores RFP Responses Presentation</a> PDF link).</p>

<p>The Community Advisory Council will review the ideas and give their feedback to BBP on April 19th, and a winner will be declared this summer.</p>
