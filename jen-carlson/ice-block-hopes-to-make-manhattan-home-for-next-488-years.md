<p>Artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413015205/http://www.metaphorm.org/ice/">Brian Goggin</a> hopes to bring a block of ice from the Greenland ice sheet and bring it here, to New York City, where it will reside for the next 488 years. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413015205/http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2011/06/goggin_ice_project.php">SF Weekly</a>, it would be kept in a (hopefully rent-controlled!) temperature-controlled room, and is meant to show the effects of global warming. </p>

<p>Keeping with that theme, the team &quot;will take extreme measures to make the expedition &apos;post fuel,&apos; such as using hand tools specially designed for the expedition and as few combustion engines as possible to transport the team, the cargo, and, after extraction, the ice.&quot; You can read more about the concept and their removal and transportation procedure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413015205/http://www.metaphorm.org/ice/#ICEconcept">here</a>.</p>

<p>Goggin picked the number 488 because it was that many years ago that Manhattan was discovered by Captain Giovanni da Verrazzano. Of course.
