<p>Just before 8 p.m. on Monday night the roof of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829212812/http://gothamist.com/tags/190bowery">the historic 190 Bowery</a> (the old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829212812/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_Bank_Building_(New_York_City)">Germania Bank Building</a>) became engulfed in flames. An eyewitness, Chachi at Kings Avenue Tattoo (located just across the street), sent us the below video, saying, &quot;Huge fire... all out now, a small explosion but the fire was contained to the roof and they put it out quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY tells us there were no injuries, but had no other details as of 8 p.m. We&apos;ll update when we know more. </p>

<p>190 Bowery is a landmarked building that just recently sold for $55 million, and was promptly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829212812/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/10/photos_bowery_officially_stripped_o.php#photo-1">buffed of the graffiti</a> and street art that long took over the facade. For decades it was under lock and key of photographer Jay Maisel, who purchased the 72-room building in the 1960s for $120,000.</p>

<p>The building is now owned by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829212812/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/07/landmarked_bowery_mansion_sold_for.php">RFR Holdings&apos; Aby Rosen</a>, who is converting it into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829212812/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/5/17/11691500/photos-190-bowery-nyc-landmark-office-space">&quot;a glitzy office building&quot;</a>&#x2014;renovations began just a couple months ago.</p>
