										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mgondry0409.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101050050im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mgondry0409.jpg" width="130" height="133" class="image-right"> </span>Director, Brooklynite and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101050050/http://www.theonion.com/content/news/michel_gondry_entertained_for_days">cardboard box aficionado</a>, Michel Gondry is offering up some quirky deals on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101050050/http://www.michelgondry.com/">his website</a>. For example, you can get a roll of toilet paper with his very own random thoughts imprinted on it for just $13.95 (2-ply, 500 sheets per roll!). You can also get a replica prop from his movie <em>The Science of Sleep</em>: the disasterology calendar, for just $5.95 (it&apos;s for 2007, but will be accurate again in 2018!). But hands down the most coveted object being offered up (we can&apos;t imagine how long this will last after orders start flooding in) is the hand-drawn, signed portrait of YOU by Monsieur Gondry, based off a photo you submit. The cost? Just $19.95. Quite the deal, even during these recessionary times. We&apos;d really like to see an infomercial-esque video to go along with these items, however.
