                            <p><img alt="php0D9vdTPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002720im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php0D9vdTPM.jpg" width="350" height="272" class="right">Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002720/http://gawker.com/5030531/dead-monster-washes-ashore-in-montauk">Gawker</a> posted a photo of what quickly became referred to as &quot;the Montauk Monster.&quot; Lizzie Grubman jokes were made, spines shivered, conspiracy theorists pondered (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002720/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk_Project">the Montauk Project</a>, anyone?), a new internet superstar was born, and most came to the conclusion that the thing that washed up near the Surfside Inn was a bloated turtle without its shell. Or a monster.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002720/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,395294,00.html">Fox News</a> has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002720/http://gawker.com/5031474/fox-news-discredits-itself-with-wildly-incorrect-its-not-a-monster-reportage">brought in the experts</a> (the full clip is after the jump). Animal Planet&apos;s Jeff Corwin, angered by a Red Sox loss and the stupidity of humans, says the public&apos;s fascination with the creature is unwarranted; what we thought was a beak are really teeth, he says, and clearly what we are looking at here <em>is a raccoon</em>. Or maybe a dog? But definitely <em>not</em> a monster!</p>

<p>As for the <strike>monster</strike> &quot;raccoon,&quot; no one seems to know where it is now; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002720/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/07/the_monster_of_montauk.html">NYMag</a> says it was carted off by an old man declaring he would <em>mount it to his wall.</em> Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002720/http://hamptons.plumtv.com/blog/whats_going/paging_darwin_montauk_%E2%80%9Csea_monster%E2%80%9D_real_or_photoshop_phantasy">PlumTV promises</a> an interview with the photographer, Jenna Hewitt, tomorrow.</p>
