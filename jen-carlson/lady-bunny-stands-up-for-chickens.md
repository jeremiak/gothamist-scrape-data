Located at the intersection of Varick and Spring Streets, it encourages people to &quot;kick the bucket&quot; and states that &quot;sometimes big bright packages contain dirty little secrets.&quot; </p>

<p>The Lady coyly remarks that she doesn&apos;t &quot;quite understand the slogan,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307120616/http://ladybunny.net/blog/2008/07/bun-buns-peta-billboard.html">declares that </a> &quot;at least my fat country ass ain&apos;t selling KFC!&quot; She also notes that PETA isn&apos;t insisting KFC stop serving up buckets of the fried stuff, just that they put an end to &quot;procedures like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307120616/http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/">de-beaking the birds</a> while they are alive.&quot;</p>

<p>While the billboard went up earlier this month, PETA tells us &quot;it was officially unveiled yesterday&quot; when Lady Bunny was back in town.</p>
