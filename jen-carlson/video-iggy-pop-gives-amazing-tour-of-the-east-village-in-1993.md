<p>Here&apos;s a tour of the East Village in 1993, courtesy of local Iggy Pop, who at that time was living in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072506/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christodora_House">Christodora House</a>&#x2014;he had been there three years by the time this was shot (before that, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072506/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/photo_iggy_pop_in_1980s_greenwich_v.php">in Greenwich Village... vacuuming</a>). As he gives the filmmaker a tour of the neighborhood he talks about some of the things he loves there (like the &quot;nice little cafes,&quot; a Chico mural and the better quality graffiti than in the rest of New York, and &quot;oh cool, a cop on horseback&quot;). Watch the full thing below (it&apos;s worth it!)&#x2014;some of the highlights:</p>

<ul><li>On the Psychedelic Church of 9th Street:  &quot;I never got that interested in it. There&apos;s a guy here who took a Swiss girl, and made her in to soup... he used to go to that church.&quot; That would be Daniel Rakowitz, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072506/http://thevillager.com/villager_59/butcheroftompkinssq.html">the Butcher of Tompkins Square</a>.
</li><li>On noise: &quot;Nobody would dare shut you up for making noise, I make as much noise as I want all the time.&quot;
</li><li>On living in a nice apartment:  &quot;It gets up a lot of people&apos;s tree. But fuck it. What the fuck? I&apos;m not a martyr.&quot;
</li><li>On Pedro&apos;s Bakery on 8th and Avenue C: &quot;This is where I eat when my wife&apos;s not in town. I come here and get sandwiches and cake and strong coffee. That&apos;s what I live on.&quot;</li></ul>
