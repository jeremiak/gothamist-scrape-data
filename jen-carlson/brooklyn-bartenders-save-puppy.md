Reportedly Alex Darsey found this little guy on a street corner and was told by witnesses that he had been thrown from a car moments earlier :( </p>

<p>He took the pup, named Walter, to an emergency vet clinic and found he was incredibly malnourished, dehydrated and suffering from a severe case of mange. It&apos;s also believed the previous owners used harsh chemicals to treat the mange, which only burned Walter&apos;s remaining fur and skin. Now Alex and his coworkers behind the bar at Southpaw are pooling their time and money together to make sure their new canine friend recovers.</p>

<p>On a blog they&apos;ve started to chronicle his progress and raise funds for his recovery, they report back: &quot;His body is like a sponge for bacteria and infection, and he is so weak that he cannot fight it on his own. [But] his white blood cell count is high (which means his body is aggressively trying to fight off the infection), and his general condition has improved since he admitted 2 days ago.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316070133/http://helpsavewalter.blogspot.com/">Help Save Walter</a> is the new Tip Your Bartender!</p>
