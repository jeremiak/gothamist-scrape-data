<p>Let&apos;s consider this a win since it could have been <em>Fifty Shades Of Grey</em>, which had a long <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318144800/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/nypl_2.php">waiting list</a> last year at the New York Public Library. Our source from deep inside the NYPL tells us <em>The Hunger Games</em> came out on top as the most popular book overall in 2012, system-wide (all of the branches in Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx). This means everyone from kids to grandparents were checking it out. Below, a list of what else had New Yorkers using their library card last year:</p>

<p><strong>Top Circulating Titles for 2012</strong></p>

<p>DVD: <em>Midnight in Paris</em> <br>
Children&apos;s DVD: <em>Hugo</em><br>
Book checked out by adults: <em>Steve Jobs</em> by Walter Isaacson<br>
Book check out by all ages: <em>The Hunger Games</em><br>
Book checked out by kids: <em>Fly Guy vs. the Flyswatter!</em> by Tedd Arnold</p>

<p><em>The Hunger Games</em> (book 1) was released in 2010, but the movie hit the big screen early last year in March, which was likely the cause of the spike in check outs of the book. This means that <em>Fifty Shades</em> may rise to the top whenever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318144800/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/13/who_should_be_cast_in_the_fifty_sha.php#photo-1">that movie</a> actually gets made.</p>
