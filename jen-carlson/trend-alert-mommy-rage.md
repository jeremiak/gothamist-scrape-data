										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:198px; "> <img alt="denisealbert.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004328im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/denisealbert.jpg" width="198" height="300"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Get out of this woman&apos;s way</span></i></div> If you think getting stuck behind a stroller being carried <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004328/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/subway_douchery_brings_up_undergrou.php">up subway stairs</a> is annoying, then just wait til you hear how annoyed the person lugging around that stroller is at <em>you</em>. The tables are turning! One mom takes to the pages of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004328/http://www.metro.us/us/article/2010/02/16/02/3610-82/index.xml">Metro</a> to vent about non-breeders and her own self-described &quot;mommy rage.&quot; Playing chicken with a double stroller just got <em>serious</em>.<p></p>

<p>Denise Albert warns that if you make her angry, &quot;you will know it.&quot; Her laundry list of complaints with other human beings is all over the sanity spectrum, with totally legit requests, to unrealistic ones. </p>

<p>She wants you to get out of her way when she&apos;s trying to navigate her stroller, to hold the door open, to not sit in front of her kid at the movie theater, to not use the curb ramp unless you have wheels, to not allow your animals or their tongues to come within striking distance of her or her family, and for chrissakes, &quot;if you work in a store, hurry up. I don&#x2019;t always have time for small talk.&quot; Yeah, stop trying to make human connections! Just get Denise her latte and STFU!</p>

<p>If you see this woman, give her a hug*. Sounds like she needs it.</p>
