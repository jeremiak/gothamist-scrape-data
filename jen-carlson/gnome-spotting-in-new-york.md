<p>This is really pretty adorable, it&apos;s like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050515/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ekm_Dj0UzI">the gnome in <em>Amelie</em></a> has come to life and is living in New York City! The unnamed gnome keeps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050515/http://gnomebomb.tumblr.com/">a Tumblr blog</a> chronicling his journeys in this strange city (of course, he also has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050515/http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnomebomb/">Flickr</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050515/http://twitter.com/gnomebomb">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050515/http://www.facebook.com/pages/GnomeBomb/113434348712118">Facebook</a>&#x2014;so schooled in our social networking ways!). </p>

<p>In one of his first posts late last month, he visited Central Park, saying, &quot;My first weekend in this new world.  I could not resist searching out something that would remind me of my home.  It was in between the rock and trees of New York&#x2019;s Central Park, I searched for security and discovered adventure.&quot;</p>
