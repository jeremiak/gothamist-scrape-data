<p>First of all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/business/why-a-back-to-the-future-hoverboard-never-took-off.html">hoverboards aren&apos;t real</a>, but that is the most popular term used to describe those self-balancing scooters that Justin Bieber propels himself forward with. Type &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=hoverboard">hoverboard</a>&quot; into Amazon&apos;s search bar and that is what we are discussing here.<br>
 <br>
Earlier this week, the NYPD&apos;s 26th Precinct tweeted: &quot;Be advised that the electric hoverboard is illegal as per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/ADC/19/1/3/19-176.2">NYC Admin. Code 19-176.2*</a>.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hoveringnypd.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hoveringnypd.jpg" width="640" height="463" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">Here is the tweet we&apos;re referencing, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/https://twitter.com/NYPD26Pct">the NYPD precinct</a> deleted after this article went up.</span></p>

<p>But the code they referenced doesn&apos;t explicitly state that hoverboards are illegal&#x2014;instead, it seems to suggest they <em>are</em> legal:</p><ul><li>&quot;For purposes of this section, the term &apos;motorized scooter&apos; shall mean any wheeled device that has handlebars...&quot; &#x2014; the hoverboards do not have handlebars.<br>
</li><li>&quot;For the purposes of this section, the term &apos;motorized scooter&apos; shall <em>not</em> include electric powered devices not capable of exceeding fifteen miles per hour...&quot; &#x2014; the hoverboards (like the most popular version, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://iohawk.com/">IO Hawk</a>) have a max speed of around 6 MPH.</li></ul>So... hoverboards are legal? Slow down, McFly. It turns out that with new technology comes great confusion. Earlier this year one NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/09/01/motorized-unicycles-legality-confusion/">told CBS2</a>, &quot;We don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;new technology. We don&#x2019;t know.&quot; Helpful. Another officer declared hoverboards were allowed in parks (watch out for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkyLnWm1iCs">open bodies of water</a>!), while another said they were allowed anywhere. Wheeee! But they aren&apos;t, no matter what you think you saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/hover-or-die#.wo1R29vn8">on Buzzfeed</a>.<p></p>

<p>The NYC Department of Transportation, however, has landed on firmer ground when it comes to rules surrounding hoverboards&#x2014;they told us that these devices are in fact illegal. They are considered motor vehicles that cannot be registered with the DMV, which means they&apos;re prohibited in the city (under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://ypdcrime.com/vt/article14.htm#t401">NY State Law</a>, Article 14, sections 401-a and 401-b). Even though they aren&apos;t in the DMV&apos;s list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://dmv.ny.gov/registration/motorized-devices-cannot-be-registered-new-york">expressly prohibited</a> motor vehicles, they are considered motorized self-balancing devices, similar to Segways.</p>

<p>Both the NYPD and the Parks Department have the authority to enforce this rule, and if caught you get fined up to $500. Have you been busted for hoverboarding? Please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">drop us a line</a> and tell us your story.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/hoverboard_overboard.php">A civil liberties lawyer explains why your &quot;hoverboard&quot; is illegal in NYC</a>.</p>

<p><em>*In 2013 the City Council revised <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170110032516/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1326092&amp;GUID=3138BFA9-4D11-4F3B-A06B-9FB3A04511CA">NYCAC 19-176.2(a)</a> to omit everything in that subsection after &quot;for use by disabled persons.&quot; but the fact remains that because these devices do not have handlebars NYCAC 19-176.2 cannot apply to them.</em></p>
