Confusion and heartbreak gripped airports nationwide this weekend after Donald Trump signed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/giuliani_trump_muslim_ban.php">an executive order</a> temporarily barring entry to refugees and visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries (where Trump believes &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/826060143825666051">bad dudes</a>&quot; reside). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/no_ban_no_wall_rally.php">The protesters</a> showed up en masse, as did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/lawyers_immigration_jfk.php">the lawyers</a>, and the ACLU brought it to federal court, where a stay was issued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/right_now_hundreds_rallying_against.php">late Saturday night</a>. That spark of hope the organization gave most of the country was priceless, and they have received a surge of monetary support to keep the battle going.
<p></p>
In an average year, the ACLU receives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/https://twitter.com/dnvolz/status/825854514947317761">a few million</a> dollars in donations, but over the weekend, as protesters gathered around the country, they also opened their wallets to the organization. While their donation numbers have been growing since Trump was voted into office (the weeks after the election garnered them an &quot;unprecedented&quot; $15 million), this past weekend saw a windfall. According to a spokesperson, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/30/the-aclu-says-it-got-24-million-in-donations-this-weekend-six-times-its-yearly-average/?utm_term=.3d98b6bddb59">the Washington Post</a>, &quot;the civil liberties group received more than $24 million in online donations from 356,306 people.&quot;
<p></p>
Anthony Romero, the ACLU&apos;s executive director, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/https://www.yahoo.com/news/aclu-says-it-raised-10-million-since-saturday-201828838.html">Yahoo News</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like this. People are fired up and want to be engaged. What we&#x2019;ve seen is an unprecedented public reaction to the challenges of the Trump administration.&quot;

Prior to last night&apos;s SAG Awards, where pretty much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060807/http://laist.com/2017/01/29/videos_sag_awards_trump_2017.php">every single celebrity</a> spoke out against Trump, and Sarah Paulson called on people to donate more money to the ACLU, the weekend donation number was around $19.4 million.
