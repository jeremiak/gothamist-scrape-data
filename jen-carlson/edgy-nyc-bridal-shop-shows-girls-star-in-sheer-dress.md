<p>Stone Fox bridal shop on Broadway has released their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520013045/http://stonefoxbride.com/collections">2013 line of gowns</a>, which includes one <strike>pageview-friendly</strike> shocking dress called The Jemima. The dress, which is completely see-through (but floor length!) is named after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520013045/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a> star and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520013045/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/we_enjoyed_this_girls_stars_8k_pain.php">accomplished artist Jemima Kirke</a>, and seems to be based on her dress that appeared in the first season of the show. The pro-marriage equality company also released a photo of Jemima in an intimate kiss with a model posing as her new wife... this is all nothing we haven&apos;t seen before, though:</p>

<p>As a sincere aside: the store actually seems pretty awesome, and if we ever walked that plank we&apos;d totally rock <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520013045/http://stonefoxbride.com/collections">that June Carter dress</a>.
