<p>The truth hurts, so we&apos;re just gonna come out and say it: New York <em>is</em> the worst at something. Turns out we have the longest average daily commute (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014201/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/15/commute_1.php">we knew already</a>)... and <em>big deal</em>, right? So we have to sit on the subway a little bit longer&#x2014;it gives us time to catch up on this week&apos;s <em>New Yorker</em>, which is why we aren&apos;t the the dumbest state (hello, Maine). According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206014201/http://pleated-jeans.com/2011/01/24/the-united-states-of-shame-chart/">Pleated Jeans</a>, every state has a statistical skeleton in their closet, and now they&apos;ve put them all into a Unites States of Shame map. At least we aren&apos;t known for our porn usage, ugliness, gonorrhea, or bestiality. Way to go New York! See you on the late, overcrowded, overpriced subway later.</p>
