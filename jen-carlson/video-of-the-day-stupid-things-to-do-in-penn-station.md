										<p>The description to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150313/http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a93_1184938170">this video</a> reads: &quot;This guy is offered $20 to lick the hand rail of a Penn Station New York city train.&quot; That pretty much says it all. </p>

<p>This move is not unprecedented, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150313/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F22">Bart Simpson</a> did the very same thing! His was also in an attempt to win money, though through sympathy by demonstrating his lack of taste buds. How many licks does it take to get to the center of an infectious disease? We&apos;re wagering about one. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150313/http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9703/20/subway.germs">CNN once reported</a> that in order to get any problematic diseases from the train or subway, one would need to lick the pole. </p>
