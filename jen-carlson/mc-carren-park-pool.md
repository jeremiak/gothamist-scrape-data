										<p>Yesterday was one of the first shows of the summer at McCarren Park Pool. We headed over there to check out the venue, and of course the show. We&apos;ll have a review up of Les Savy Fav later on, for now we wanted to give you a look at what the venue is like incase you didn&apos;t get over there. </p>

<p>The venue was huge. Housing a dodgeball court, a slip and slide, a stage, an ice cream truck, beer tents and a ton of people...there was still plenty of space to be comfortable. </p>

</p><p>Related: Tonight at 8pm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130750/http://PoolAid.org/">PoolAid</a> will be having a brainstorm session at Union Pool. From their email:</p>

<blockquote>*Clear Channel/Live Nation is angling for a chokehold on our public pool this summer.  They charge an arm and a leg, you pay through the nose, who reaps the profits?  Not the bands or the community.</blockquote>

<p>This is in reference to the shows this summer that do cost money. Yesterday, however, was the kickoff to a summer of free shows at the pool every Sunday (brought to you by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130750/http://JellyNYC.com/">JellyNYC</a> and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130750/http://thepoolparties.com/">Pool Parties</a>.)</p>

<p>*Update: According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130750/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation">Wikipedia</a>, &quot;on December 21, 2005, Clear Channel completed the spin-off of Live Nation, formerly known as Clear Channel Entertainment. Live Nation is now an independent company and is no longer owned by Clear Channel.&quot;</p>
