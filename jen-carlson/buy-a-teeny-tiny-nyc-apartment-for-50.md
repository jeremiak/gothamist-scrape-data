<p>In 2009, the Queens Museum of Art began <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801203417/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/17/panorama.php">offering up prime real estate</a> on their amazingly detailed panorama. Single apartments went for $50, houses for $250, etc. In all this time, prices haven&apos;t been raised $1, making this the most realistic <em>and</em> unrealistic miniature portrayal of NYC ever created.</p>

<p>They&apos;ve been promoting their latest sales push on the 9,335-square-foot model this week, just in time for Valentine&apos;s Day, or Anti-Valentine&apos;s Day, or mid-February. Giving levels still &quot;range from $50 to &apos;purchase&apos; an apartment, to $250 for a house, and up to $1,000 for a small commercial building or low-rise apartment building.&quot; You can even pick and exact address, which you&apos;ll note upon purchase, if you are particularly sentimental about a time and place.</p>

<p>The panorama was built for the 1964 World&apos;s Fair, and remains one of the most beloved pieces of New York history, celebrated annually at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801203417/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/17/panorama_challenge.php">their big challenge</a>. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801203417/http://www.queensmuseum.org/support/adopt-a-building">purchase a piece of it here</a>, and the recipient will receive a notice over email on February 14th, as well as a printed title deed in the following weeks. Your donation will go towards maintenance of The Panorama of the City of New York.</p>
