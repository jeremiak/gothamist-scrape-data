<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125759/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynflea">The Brooklyn Flea</a> scored some prime real estate for the winter season; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125759/http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2009/12/brooklyn_flea_moves_winter_mar.html">NYMag</a> reports that starting January 9th the market is moving into some nice warm digs at One Hanson Place, aka the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125759/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/23/williamsburgh_savings_bank.php">Williamsburg Savings Bank Tower</a> (last year they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125759/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/08/brooklyn_flea_finds_indoor_digs_for.php">were in DUMBO</a>).
