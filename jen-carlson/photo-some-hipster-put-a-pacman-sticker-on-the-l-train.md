<p>Someone put up this sweet Pacman sticker on the L train and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101338/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1dfzzz/oh_l_train_hipsters_you_fucking_slay_me/">Redditors</a> can&apos;t stop discussing hipsters. Doesn&apos;t it get exhausting, everyone? Can&apos;t we have fun stuff like this around and just enjoy it, no matter who is responsible? Why not just smile and savor a more innocent time when we sat in a beanbag chair playing Pacman on the Atari while listening to Falco? Is it possible to focus on the fact that some stranger just wanted to make other strangers smile? Can&apos;t we just let this sticker do its small part in helping to balance out all the evil in the world with a little bit of goodness? And isn&apos;t it time we started separating the L train from &quot;hipsters&quot;?</p>

<p>Important update: These Pacman stickers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101338/http://instagram.com/p/YwQnIxveIE/">also on the 6 train</a>, blowing this whole &quot;hipster&quot; theory to pieces.</p>
