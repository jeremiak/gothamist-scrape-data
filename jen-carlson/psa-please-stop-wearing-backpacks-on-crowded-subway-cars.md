<p>Lately, more than ever, we&apos;ve encountered the worst sort of subway etiquette offender: that jerk wearing a backpack on a crowded car. How, in 2011, is this still happening? To the people doing this: your backpack is so clearly in the way, taking up valuable space that human beings could fit in to. Here is a simple, and what we believed was a common sense solution to the problem:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Take bag off back.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Place bag between legs, or at the very least, against your legs in the front or to the side.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Pat yourself on the back, which is no longer blocked by a backpack.</p>

<p>While this grievance didn&apos;t make Jayshells&apos; amazing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095945/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/22/subway_signs.php">subway etiquette signs</a>, backpacks were addressed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095945/http://lolnyc.com/post/297254872/se1">this etiquette poster</a>, which stated:</p><blockquote>Subway Etiquette #15: &#x201C;Backpack Depth, Width, Whatever&#x201D; When riding the train during rush hours, it is important to remember that there are other people on board as well. Henceforth, it is not appropriate to be wearing a backpack that is holding your week&#x2019;s worth of laundry and other stuff. Either put it on the ground... or pay for a cab. Backpacks should not be weapons.&#x201D;</blockquote>In Paris, the RATP, the state-owned public transport operator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095945/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/28/even_paris_needs_subway_etiquette_s.php#photo-1">put up public transit etiquette signs</a>, so we contacted the MTA to find out if this is something they&apos;d consider (say, in place of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095945/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/spotted_mta_misspells_bleecker_stre.php">their own &quot;advertisements&quot;</a>). We&apos;ll update when we hear back.<p></p>
