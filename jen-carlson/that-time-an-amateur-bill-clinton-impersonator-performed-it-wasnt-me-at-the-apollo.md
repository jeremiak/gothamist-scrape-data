<p>Did you miss that time when New Jersey resident Mike Ford, dressed as Bill Clinton and with one hand painted red, hit the stage at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512002845/http://gothamist.com/tags/apollotheater">The Apollo</a> in Harlem to belt out &quot;It Wasn&apos;t Me&quot; by Shaggy? We did. But last night Diabo Cody awakened our souls with a link to the YouTube clip, titled &quot;White guy brings down the house at the Apollo,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512002845/https://twitter.com/diablocody/status/317063723468607490">Tweeting</a>, &quot;I have to link to this at least once a year. Sorry/not sorry.&quot; From the ill-fitting suit to the sincere attempt at both a Bill Clinton <em>and</em> Jamaican accent, to the red hand and the audience reaction, it&apos;s amazing in the most subtly perfect way possible. And to think, he did this before YouTube and viral videos even existed&#x2014;for the pure love of the game!</p>
