										<p><img alt="200803lennonj.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150917215858im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200803lennonj.jpg" width="240" height="250" class="right">Yoko Ono is not going to be too pleased with this: it turns out John Lennon was quite happy during his infamous &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; period. The &quot;weekend,&quot; which lasted 18 months (during 1973-75), was a separation from Ono, where he spent nearly two years with the couple&apos;s one-time employee May Pang (in both LA and NYC). </p>

<p>It has long been said that he was depressed during this time, but if Pang&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150917215858/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/arts/music/12pang.html">new book</a> of photographs, <em>Instamatic Karma</em>, is any indication...that wasn&apos;t the case at all. Though Ono is the one who suggested the two become companions during the couple&apos;s troubled times, getting a glimpse at how happy he was during the separation is sure to sting. And a picture is worth a thousand words, right? Well her new book (following up her 1983 memoir, <em>Loving John</em>) is a 140-page collection of photos from the time that she&apos;s been keeping in a shoe box. As for Ono and Pang, the two only recently reconciled (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150917215858/http://www.pr-inside.com/entertainment-blog/2006/12/05/ono-reconciles-with-lennon-mistress/">in 2006</a>).</p>

<p>Fun fact: After Lennon and Pang moved back from LA in 1974, the two rented a penthouse apartment on East 52nd Street. In this apartment, he claimed to have seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150917215858/http://www.ufoevidence.org/Cases/CaseSubarticle.asp?ID=542">a UFO</a>. When a friend urged him to call the police, he said, &quot;I&#x2019;m not going to call up the newspaper and say, &apos;This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night&apos;&quot;. His friend (photographer Bob Gruen) called for him, and the police confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting. The Daily News reported five sightings in the same neighborhood. Where was Pang&apos;s camera on <em>that</em> night?</p>
