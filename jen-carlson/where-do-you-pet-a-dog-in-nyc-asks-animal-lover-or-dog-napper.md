<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060548/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/p4o5g/where_can_i_go_to_pet_dogs_in_nyc/">Reddit NYC poster</a> asked today, &quot;Where can I go to pet dogs in NYC?&quot; Let&apos;s assume this person is <em>not</em> a dog napper, and let&apos;s assume that for whatever reason they don&apos;t want to just walk up to people walking their dogs on the sidewalk. A lot of people in New York want dogs, but as we were reminded in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060548/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/video_sht_new_yorkers_say_really_ha.php">Sh*t New Yorkers Say</a> video, <em>it just wouldn&apos;t be fair</em>. So where do you go to hang out with some other man&apos;s best friend? Some suggestions:<br>
</p><ul><li>You can volunteer to walk dogs at BARC in Williamsburg&#x2014;just check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060548/http://www.barcshelter.org/">the volunteer info</a> on their website. Plus, you&apos;ll feel all good inside because you are doing something nice for the human-less pups!<br>
</li><li>One Reddit poster suggest volunteering at the ACC in East New York, which they note is in need of volunteers. It&apos;s safe to assume that any shelter will be willing to discuss volunteer work with you.<br>
</li><li>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060548/http://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/dogruns">dog parks</a> may seem like a good idea, the law will keep you out if you don&apos;t have a dog. Though you could try your luck at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060548/http://www.fidobrooklyn.org/events/events.html">an off-leash event</a>, or off-leash hours in a park.<br>
</li><li>Get a job, or a second job, at a doggie day care, a doggie spa, or as a dog walker.<br>
</li><li>Better yet, date someone with a dog!<br>
</li><li>Why not just adopt a dog from the shelter? You&apos;d be saving a life! <br>
</li><li>Not ready for a dog, why not adopt a cat? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060548/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/gothamist_cat_battle_which_office_c.php">They&apos;re a Gothamist-approved city pet</a>! Some will even play fetch with you.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Where else can urban dwelling dog lovers sans dogs go to pet some pups?</p>
