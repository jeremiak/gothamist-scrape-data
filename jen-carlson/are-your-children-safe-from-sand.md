The latest casts a dark shadow on sand, following a study by the Environmental Protection Agency who &quot;found those who dig in the sand have an increased chance of gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea, due to fecal matter in the sand.&quot; Sand castle builders and those who enjoy getting buried in the sand are at a greater risk (seriously, it says that). Eh, a little gastrointestinal illness isn&apos;t a bad trade off for sculpting a sweet sand castle... <em>but don&apos;t be fooled</em>, that&apos;s not all you&apos;ll catch, you can also come down with upper respiratory illnesses, rash, eye ailments, earaches and infected cuts. The paper also injects this floating fact into the article for us locals, &quot;Long Island has several outfall pipes that discharge to water near bathing beaches.&quot; Yeah, that&apos;s sewage overflow. So enjoy the beach this weekend everyone, and don&apos;t forget this year&apos;s hottest accessory (pictured).</p>
