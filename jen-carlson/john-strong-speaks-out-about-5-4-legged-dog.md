title: John Strong Speaks Out About 5 4-Legged Dog
---

	
										<p>In case you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223530/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/23/is_john_strong_fighting_for_custody.php">missed the update</a>, the 5-legged puppy that was saved from a life in a freakshow was brought under the knife ahead of schedule to have her extra leg amputated yesterday. Coney Island&apos;s John Strong had been threatening legal action to attain the pup, since he had put a down payment on the canine before the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223530/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/20/pup_saved_from_coney_freakshow.php">current owner Allyson Siegel stepped in</a>. CNN has video of the dog prior to her operation:</p>

<p><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-VEBS9VfVFI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223530oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/-VEBS9VfVFI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></object></p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223530/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/the-5-legged-puppy-and-other-sideshow-tales/">CityRoom</a> paid a visit to Strong, who told them, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t exploit animals. I&#x2019;m saving them from the knife. I treat all my animals with the best care. Some people think her leg should be cut off, but sometimes you got to enjoy what you got. Let God&#x2019;s will be God&#x2019;s will.&quot; After seeing the above video, do you think the pup would have been happy living at a freakshow with an extra leg?</p>
