Instagram feeds were buoyed by photos of the actor being a Regular Guy out on the town in Brooklyn, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321115600/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/have_you_run_into_bill_murray_yet.php">encounters becoming so common</a> that you left the office every evening certain you&apos;d find yourself at a bar in Williamsburg drinking red wine through a straw with the man himself by the end of the night&#x2014;waking up with your own &quot;no one will ever believe you&quot; story. The Bill Murray Invasion of 2013 was great fun for New Yorkers, even those not typically affected by celebrity. And we may be seeing a second coming...<p></p>

<p>Reader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321115600/https://twitter.com/mitchryansucks/status/413413618714415105">Mitch Ryan</a> emailed us this afternoon, saying, &quot;Bill Murray is walking around Williamsburg with a blue beanie on his head... it&apos;s so cute. He was eating lunch on Roebling and I just spotted him walking down Havermeyer.&quot; He added that in addition to the beanie, he was wearing an &quot;army style backpack&quot; and was accompanied by &quot;a younger assistant,&quot; possibly. Ryan wasn&apos;t the only one to spot Murray:</p>

<p>So you know what to do if you see him: take a (non-intrusive) photo and send it our way... or simply enjoy the experience and hope <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321115600/http://thoughtcatalog.com/alex-mann/2013/12/12-insane-things-that-happened-on-my-night-out-with-bill-murray/">there&apos;s a kazoo involved</a>.</p>
