<p>The latest battle in the Fast Food War is centered around budget menus&#x2014;that special place where all your cravings are briefly met without breaking the bank, and all your dignity dies as you hate-eat your meal. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135456/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/burger-king-offer-french-fry-burger-20079589">the AP</a>, Burger King&apos;s new weapon is a $1 French Fry Burger&#x2014;which they hope will &quot;fend off McDonald&apos;s aggressive push for its Dollar Menu.&quot;</p>

<p>The burger&#x2014;packing 360 calories and 19 grams of fat&#x2014;will be available starting in September, and offered through the Fall. And if you somehow haven&apos;t guessed already, it&apos;s a burger... topped with french fries. More specifically, their standard beef patty burger topped with FOUR FRENCH FRIES. Listen, if we&apos;re going to order a French Fry Burger we&apos;re going to need to go all the way with this, Burger King&#x2014;this is &apos;Merica, we need at least 20 fries.</p>

<p>Rumor has it this is only <em>one</em> of their &quot;cheap new concoctions,&quot; so look forward to more lazy frankedfood on the way.</p>
