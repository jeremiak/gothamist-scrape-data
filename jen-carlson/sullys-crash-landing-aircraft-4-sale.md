</div></div>					<p>This is going to make an amazing roadside attraction one day (or perhaps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040822/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/13/google_map_fail_us_airways_flight_1.php">an eatery in Hell&apos;s Kitchen</a>?). The aircraft that Capt. Sullenberger gracefully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040822/http://gothamist.com/tags/flight1549">landed in the Hudson River</a> a year ago is now for sale at auction! </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040822/http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/01/sullys-miracle-on-the-hudson-airbus-for-sale/">Wired</a>, the US Airways Airbus 320 was taken into possession by the insurance company Chartis, who are now looking to unload it. Currently in Kearny, NJ &#x2014;&#xA0;the craft comes in quite a bit of pieces; check out the lot on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040822/http://www.aigaviation.com/aviationsalvage/salvagedetail.aspx?faano=N106US">the auction page</a>. And as the site points out, the formal description on the page doesn&apos;t do justice to what the plane was a part of. It simply says: &quot;Aircraft suffered severe bird strike event resulting in water emergency landing.&quot; And buyer beware! There&apos;s &quot;severe water damage throughout airframe.&quot;</p>

<p>Whoever may purchase the plane won&apos;t be able to fly it &#x2014;&#xA0;on top of it being sort of a &quot;fixer-upper,&quot; there are no engines or avionics. While no price is listed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915040822/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hudson_miracle_plane_being_auctioned_cGNpKHP190XyJUE87Qc2YI">the NY Post</a> points out a similar Airbus A310 recently went for $2.6 million, and yielded $4 million after being sold off piece by piece. And maybe they could get a better price if they had Sully autograph it.</p>
