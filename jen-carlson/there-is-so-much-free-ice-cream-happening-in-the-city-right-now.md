<p>There&apos;s a lot of free ice cream happening lately, and we&apos;re here to make sure you become well acquainted with some of it. It&apos;s not even National Ice Cream Day! (That&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://www.punchbowl.com/holidays/national-ice-cream-day">July 17th</a>, by the way.) Okay so, first up, the USA Network has some very confusing promotion going on today which boils down to them handing out 80,000 free H&#xE4;agen-Dazs Sundae Cones. There will be branded ice cream carts, bikes and scooters, possibly in the Times Square area... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/usa-network-kicks-off-sizzling-summer-with-entertainment-weekly-and-the-haagen-dazs-brand-122730133.html">the details</a> are sketchy, but we&apos;re trying to find out more information and will up date when we do. In the meantime, ring up (or Tweet up, as it were) Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s. Their free ice cream truck is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/25/eat_cetera_9.php">back in the city</a>, and you can <em>beckon them to you</em>. </p>

<p>The truck will be roaming the streets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://www.fastcasual.com/article/182058/Ben-Jerry-s-launches-ice-cream-truck-in-NYC">through July 29th</a>, making scheduled stops at Macy&#x2019;s Fireworks on July 4th, Pridefest, Grand Central Station, and NYC fire stations (every Friday). If you want in but can&apos;t get to them, try Tweeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://www.twitter.com/BenJerrysTruck">@BenJerrysTruck</a> to get them to come to you. They&apos;ll have Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, AmeriCone Dream, Bonnaroo Buzz, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/jimmy_fallon_immortalized_in_ben_je.php">Late Night Snack</a> on board... but alas, no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/13/rumor_mill_is_ben_jerrys_planning_a.php">Schweddy Balls</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://www.meatbeerbabes.com/2011/06/22/ron-swansons-ben-jerrys-flavor-all-of-the-bacon-eggs-you-have/">bacon and egg</a> options.</p>

<p>If ice cream isn&apos;t your thing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150438/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/cool_down_with_these_five_unique_ic.php">here are some other cool options</a> around the city... but they&apos;re gonna cost ya.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&apos;re told that the H&#xE4;agen-Dazs people &quot;are moving around the city from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day (June 22, 23, 28 and 29), focusing on areas with high commuter/tourist traffic like Union Sqaure, Herald Square, Times Square, Soho and Grand Central.  Exact times are hard though because their schedule is sort of fluid.&quot;</p>
