<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408154334/http://www.davematthewsband.com/news/dmb-caravan-comes-governors-island-and-gorge-0">The fest</a>, which seems to be under the Bowery Presents name, will take place from August 26th through the 28th, and tickets will go on sale to the general public this Friday at 10 a.m. </p>

<p>Three-day passes are $195, and to supersize that to a VIP it&apos;ll cost $825, which will get you reserved viewing, special restrooms, complimentary snacks, beer, water and a gourmet buffet dinner each night. But for that hefty sum should you also get a bag of sweet cheeba and your own ferry?<br>
