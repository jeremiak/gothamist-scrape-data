One park-goer says it&apos;s frustrating that the park cops &quot;strictly enforce dog rules, but they turn a blind eye to everything else that takes place in the park&#x201D; -- and ticketing is expected to go up now that the signs are in place. Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000940/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/06/raccoon.php">those raccoons</a> are just walking around like they own the place.</p>
