<p>This weekend the Television Critics Association Awards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170305/http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/08/07/139055549/television-critics-honor-game-of-thrones-mad-men-friday-night-lights">went down</a>, essentially pitting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170305/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> up against <em>Friday Night Lights</em> for the Emmys later this year. On Saturday, Jon Hamm took home Individual Achievement in Drama and <em>Mad Men</em> took Outstanding Achievement in Drama, while Program of the Year went to to amazing and amazingly underrated <em>Friday Night Lights</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170305/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/07/instant_entertainment_friday_night.php#photo-2">catch up online</a>!). </p>
