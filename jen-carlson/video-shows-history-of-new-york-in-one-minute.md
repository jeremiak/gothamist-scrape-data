<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="vidbriefnyc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529114328im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/vidbriefnyc.jpg" width="640" height="370" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529114328/https://vimeo.com/41405908">This video</a> starts with Giovanni da Verrazzano first entering the New York Harbour in 1524, and gives a <em>very</em> brief history of New York through the present day. The video is well-done aesthetically, but, confusingly, it&apos;s not in chronological order. The street grid gets created, then the Twin Towers go up, only to be immediately replaced by the Tribute in Light, and <em>then</em> Central Park and the subway system come along. And do you notice any buildings going up out of order as the skyline is created?</p>
