</div></div>					<p>The MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153843/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/more_fml.php">finally</a> fixed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153843/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/14/fml.php">FML subway signage</a> at 14th Street... except now it&apos;s more F&apos;d up than before! Our photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153843/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> spotted the replacement stickers and tells us:</p><blockquote>&quot;One is a sign on the L platform that leads you to the L, M, M train. And the other is on the stairs and directs you to the L, F, L train. Which makes it more confusing is that those are the stairs that lead you to the 1,2,3 train. <strong>So not only is the sign wrong because it says L,F,L but it&apos;s wrong because it should actually be 1,2,3.</strong> There were tons of people that were confused and kept walking up and down the stairs trying to figure out which train is where.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>
