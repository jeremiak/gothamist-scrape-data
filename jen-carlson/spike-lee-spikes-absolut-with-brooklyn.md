                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpxE3lqZPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305115033im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpxE3lqZPM.jpg" width="85" height="250" class="image-left"> </span>If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305115033/http://gothamist.com/tags/seancombs">Sean Combs</a>-endorsed Ciroc is the vodka of choice in his home borough of Manhattan, then we suppose Brooklyn just adopted Spike Lee and Absolut to represent its buzz. Yep, you can now buy ABSOLUT BROOKLYN for just $24.99 at your local liquor store (the company will be giving $50,000 in sales to Habitat for Humanity for their effort to build affordable and environmentally sustainable housing in Bed-Stuy).</p>

<p>But what does Brooklyn taste like? We&apos;re told &quot;the new flavor is a blend of red apple and ginger and comes in a specially-designed bottle reminiscent of the ubiquitous Brooklyn Stoop Life.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The vodka company has been working on city flavors since 2007, and so far you can get drunk on New Orleans, Los Angeles and Boston. Lee designed the Brooklyn bottle, and also collaborated with spoken word local Lemon Andersen to film a love story to the borough in honor of the launch&#x2014;which is part of a larger &#x201C;Stoop Life&#x201D; movement. <em>Interesting</em>. Let&apos;s hope this movement is working towards allowing us to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305115033/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/08/stoop_drinking_the_saga_continues.php">drink on stoops</a> without getting hassled.<br>
