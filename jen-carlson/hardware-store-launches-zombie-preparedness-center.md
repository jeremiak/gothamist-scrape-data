<p>Hey, New York City hardware stores: it&apos;s time to take a tip from Westlake Ace Hardware in Lenexa, Kansas&#x2014;the store has launched a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193735/http://www.westlakehardware.com/specialties/zombies">Zombie Preparedness Center</a>, for both the living <em>and</em> the undead. They provide tips on rot prevention and how to delay decay, for the undead amongst us; and for humans, they deliver defensive tools and tips on zombie proofing your home. If you&apos;ve read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/colson_whitehead_on_manhattan_being.php"><em>Zone One</em></a>, you know this is something we as New Yorkers need.</p>

<p>For those looking in need of some quick answers, there&apos;s a handy FAQ&#x2014;a helpful resource for both the walking dead and those running from them&#x2014;one zombie asks, Now that I&#x2019;m a zombie, how can I protect myself from fearful neighbors and their &apos;tools-of-defense&apos; (One tip: Something as simple as drapery and blinds can help you remain low key.)</p>

<p>The store is also a Zombie Friendly Business, and now certified by the pro-zombie organization, Zombies Unite.</p>
