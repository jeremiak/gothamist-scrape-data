<p>Hey New York, remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014152445/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">Hurricane Irene</a>? That was a really long time ago, and just like we wouldn&apos;t want to see your Christmas tree up through springtime, we also don&apos;t want to look at your hurricane windows... so it&apos;s about time to rip that stuff off like a Band-Aid. It&apos;s okay, let the fear go, <em>she&apos;s not coming back</em>. (And it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014152445/http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/blog/2009/05/myth_tape_will_protect_windows.html">never going to help</a> you anyway.)</p>
