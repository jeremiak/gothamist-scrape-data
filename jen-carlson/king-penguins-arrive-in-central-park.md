<p>The Central Park Zoo has some new residents: Will, Robert, Lyle and Slappy! The four Texas-born <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311012115/http://www.centralparkzoo.com/look-and-learn/photos/king-penguins.aspx">King penguins</a> have just arrived, and are acquainting themselves with the Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins who already call Central Park home.</p>

<p>King penguins are the 2nd largest penguin species (emperors are the largest), and in this quartet, Slappy seems to be the leader. We&apos;re told the others have been following him around. After all, at 2 1/2, he <em>is</em> the oldest. If you go visit them, get ready for some noise, we hear it&apos;s awfully loud in there because mating season is around the corner.</p>
