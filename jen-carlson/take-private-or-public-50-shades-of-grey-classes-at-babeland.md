<p>NYC&apos;s favorite sex toy shop, Babeland, is hosting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114501/http://fiftyshades.eventbrite.com/">a <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> event</a> (naturally!). The store&apos;s Pamela Doan tells us, &quot;Every other customer at Babeland mentions this book...  It&#x2019;s been very stimulating for New Yorkers!&quot; To help the women of New York recreate the role-playing fantasies played out in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114501/http://gothamist.com/tags/fiftyshadesofgrey">the series</a>, they&apos;re going to toss them all in a room with their lovers, some booze, and some pointers.</p>

<blockquote>If you&#x2019;re curious about how to try out some of the scenes from the book, we&#x2019;ll discuss ways to make your fantasies into reality. At this cocktail party, bring your girlfriends or your lover and get inspired to try new things in the bedroom. Arrive early; the first twenty five guests will receive gift bags filled with toys that are Mr. Grey Approved.</blockquote> 

<p>But Doan tells us that due to customer demand, the shop is also going to host <em>private</em> workshops on the topic, as well, and recently one was held &quot;exclusively for a group of husbands (arranged by their wives) and involved several Very Famous Men.&quot; Our constant badgering of &quot;But WHOOOOO?!?!&quot; got us nowhere, but our money is on Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly.</p>

<p>If you want to attend the group sessions, the first one is being held on May 11th at Babeland SoHo (43 Mercer Street) at 7 p.m., and it&apos;s free. And as for those Mr. Grey approved toys&#x2014;Babeland tells us you should start off with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114501/http://www.babeland.com/store/productdetails.aspx?productid=2768&amp;colorid=1559">Satin Bondage Kit</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114501/http://www.babeland.com/candy-apple-paddle/d/3049_c_126">the Paddle</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114501/http://www.babeland.com/spank-me-baby/d/2993_c_126">Spanking powder</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114501/http://www.babeland.com/store/productdetails.aspx?productid=2009&amp;colorid=1146">Necktie</a>, and for the dedicated: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114501/http://www.babeland.com/store/productdetails.aspx?productid=2002&amp;colorid=1142">Vibrating nipple clamps</a>.</p>
