</div></div>					<p>Think you can escape the blizzard (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407040223/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/26/rare_thundersnow_happening_in_manha.php">thundersnow</a>!) underground? Think again. A few brave souls have transmitted these photographs from the outside world, via Twitter, showing that the snow is even accumulating inside the subway stations! Tonight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407040223/http://twitter.com/#!/caro/status/19183740278284288">Caroline McCarthy</a> wrote that &quot;It snowed INSIDE the Borough Hall subway station&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407040223/http://twitter.com/#!/dwag29/status/19189482611802112">Dana Wagner</a> reported the same thing at the Bay Ridge Avenue R stop. Pretty sure this means we are officially in Code <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407040223/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/"><em>Day After Tomorrow</em></a>. If you spot the white stuff while waiting on your train, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407040223/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> a photo or tag it &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr. In the meantime, we&apos;ll be asking the MTA when they plan to shovel and salt the platforms.</p>
