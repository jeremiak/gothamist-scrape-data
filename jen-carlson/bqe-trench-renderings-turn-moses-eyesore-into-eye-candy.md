</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s been chatter about a park above part of the BQE for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163407/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/bqe_1.php">a little while</a>, and now some renderings have been released which show a section of South Williamsburg&apos;s green transformation. The new park space and possible community center atop the BQE has been championed by Councilwoman Diana Reyna since 2005; she hopes to bring a healthier environment to those living near the six-lane highway.</p>

<p>Reyna and Susannah Drake (of the design studio responsible for these renderings) are using several California studies that linked the proximity of major highways to asthma rates as part of their battle to move the plan forward. They are currently prepping cost-benefit and health analyses while creating a design model for public presentation. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163407/http://www.archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=5086">Arch Paper</a>, &quot;existing park spaces flank the BQE from Broadway to Borinquen Place, and the plan&#x2019;s conceptual drawings show these spaces united by a tree-lined lawn, a baseball diamond, and a soccer field. By enclosing the expressway between South 3rd and 5th streets, the team hopes to significantly reduce traffic pollution and noise, which is ten times that of Park Avenue.&quot; The renderings&#x2014;which everyone seems so very happy in!&#x2014;also show a public swimming pool.</p>

<p>Drake says &quot;the objective is to create a place that will bring the community together&quot;&#x2014;but won&apos;t the hipsters just run everyone out with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163407/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/03/dodgeball_tom.php">their dodgeball</a>? Either way, unless someone parks a Duane Reade up there, this puts one point towards Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163407/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/13/burg_1.php">keeping its soul</a>.
