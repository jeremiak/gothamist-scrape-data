<p>How many cops does it take to deal with one vandal? When it&apos;s a Code Emo&#x2014;a vandal tagging up <em>the</em> Pete Wentz&apos;s wall&#x2014;about 12. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185010/http://evgrieve.com/2011/03/what-happens-when-you-tag-pete-wentzs.html">EV Grieve</a> has photos from the scene outside of Angels &amp; King&apos;s last night (a bar partially owned by the Fall Out Boy), where about a dozen of New York&apos;s Finest responded to its tagged rolldown gate. Allegedly, a man in his 20s tagged the gate when an &quot;owner/manager type from the bar came outside and ran after the tagger, who had a bicycle... he didn&apos;t get far.&quot;</p>

<p>The man was arrested around 6:30 p.m. outside the bar, where a whole scene had formed around him, his fallen bike, spray can, and the many police and detectives that responded to this <em>very important call</em>.</p>
