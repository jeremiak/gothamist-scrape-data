<p>It&apos;s been over a year since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151218013933/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/09/finding_biggie.php">the casting</a> took place for the Notorious B.I.G. movie, aptly called <em>Notorious</em> (much of it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151218013933/http://filminginbrooklyn.com/2008/06/17/notorious-on-fulton/">was filmed</a> in Biggie&apos;s home borough of Brooklyn), and now the biopic is about to hit the big screen. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151218013933/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/07/notorious-big-biopic-soundtrack-features-more-rare-demos-duet-with-biggies-son/">Rolling Stone</a> has the details on the soundtrack, and you can catch the movie yourself in theaters starting January 16th (the New York premiere was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151218013933/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1602266/story.jhtml">last night</a>).

She was taking her glasses off, with a tissue and wiping her eyes. I felt like I won my victory, because I wanted her to feel like her son was next to her. And we hugged.
