<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="MACYSUSHER0413.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075215im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/MACYSUSHER0413.jpg" width="300" height="281" class="image-right"> </span>Macy&apos;s has just announced their first-ever collaboration between &quot;a superstar artist on the design of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075215/http://social.macys.com/fireworks/?cm_mmc=VanityUrl-_-fireworks-_-n-_-n">Macy&apos;s 4th of July Fireworks</a>.&quot; This year&apos;s concept, score and design will all be &quot;curated by Usher,&quot; who first met with the company about the endeavor late last year to begin work on the patriotic pyrotechnic display.</p>

<p>This year the celebration enters its 34th year with the theme: &quot;It Begins With A Spark,&quot; and Usher says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m really excited to add my flavor to the Macy&#x2019;s 4th of July Fireworks, the largest show in America. As an artist, it&#x2019;s important that I expand creatively into new areas. Working on the score and fireworks design has been a great experience that&#x2019;s allowed me to share my voice in a new way. The 4th of July is a collective celebration of freedom and I hope that through the music and visuals, I&#x2019;ve helped express the energy and passion of our nation. I can&#x2019;t wait for the countdown; we&#x2019;re getting ready to surprise the audience with the ultimate Independence Day party.&#x201D; </p>

<p>His 26-minute score reflects his musical tastes, which according to the press release we received includes everyone from Rihanna to Jimi Hendrix to Frank Sinatra. </p>

<p>But why not get a superstar that&apos;s also a real New Yorker for the collaboration? Like one whose first order of business would be moving the fireworks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075215/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/macys_to_screw_over_brooklyn_queens.php">back to the East River</a> where they belong? That&apos;s right... they&apos;ll be on the Hudson <em>again</em> this year. Amy Kule, the event&apos;s executive producer, dropped that little factoid into her own statement: &#x201C;This year Macy&#x2019;s 4th of July Fireworks will be transformed into a giant party in the sky captivating audiences along the Hudson River and on television screens across the country.&quot;</p>
