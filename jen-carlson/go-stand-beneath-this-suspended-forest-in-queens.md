<p>Artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054302/https://twitter.com/heyneff">Michael Neff</a> has created a Suspended Forest, built from the many discarded Christmas trees currently littering the sidewalks of New York. Neff has done this before, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054302/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/video_dead_christmas_trees_lynched.php#photo-1">under the BQE</a>, but this time he&apos;s got a legal space to display the arborcide in&#x2014;no longer in the open air, the space is stuffed with the scent of pine and death.</p>

<p>These were all collected in Brooklyn and installed a few days ago at the Knockdown Center in Maspeth, Queens, where they will remain for the month of January. </p>

<p>Behold, your discarded Christmas trees and yuletide joy are now <em>art</em>.</p>

<p>From the artist:</p><blockquote>Suspended Forest has been shown twice previously in an unauthorized, unused space under the BQE along Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg. Those installations were removed by the city within days. The exhibition at Knockdown Center, on view for a month and configured in a grid, allows for a much different experience, most importantly time for the trees to shed their needles into halos on the smooth concrete floor below. Paired with the subtle pine fragrance of the trees and the opportunity for quiet contemplation, the exhibition encourages repeated viewing.</blockquote><p></p>

<p><em>Knockdown Center is located at 52-19 Flushing Ave in Queens. The opening is Saturday January 9th (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054302/https://www.facebook.com/events/431151743749517/">details here</a>).</em></p>
