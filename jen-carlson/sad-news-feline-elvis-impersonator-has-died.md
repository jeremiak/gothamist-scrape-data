<p>We first met Elvis, a beautiful and extra large Savannah cat, at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815025339/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/cat_fashion_show.php#photo-1">Cat Fashion Show of 2010</a>, held at the Algonquin Hotel. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815025339/http://gothamist.com/tags/catfashionshow">Every year</a> he showed up, decked out to the nines in his custom Elvis wear&#x2014;a favorite amongst those in attendance. So it is with great sadness that we report that Elvis won&apos;t be at next month&apos;s party for Matilda&#x2014;this announcement was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815025339/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=726326990716438&amp;set=a.561893947159744.145379.100000174321818&amp;type=1&amp;theater">posted on Facebook today</a>, and shared by Elvis&apos;s feline friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815025339/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151707461554555&amp;id=51291379554">Matilda</a>, the Algonquin Hotel cat: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sad news to pass on to the cat world. Elvis has passed over the Rainbow Bridge. You have probably heard of Elvis, the Big Savannah Cat and Meow Wear Fashion Model. He has appeared in numerous magazine ads and been in all the Fashion Shows at the Algonquin Hotel and the Westchester Cat Show. Please bow your head for a moment in memory of this beautiful boy, and maybe send your condolences to: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815025339/mailto:savannahcat@frontiernet.net">savannahcat@frontiernet.net.</a>&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This one&apos;s for you, Elvis:</p>
