</div></div>					<p>Today is the 50th anniversary of the night that Marilyn Monroe sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to President John F. Kennedy, Jr. at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523070941/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/flashback_madison_square_garden.php">the old</a> Madison Square Garden, between 50th and 51st Streets. After she performed, JFK took the stage and announced, &quot;Thank you. I can now retire from politics after having had &apos;Happy Birthday&apos; sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way.&quot; To commemorate the night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523070941/http://life.time.com/history/marilyn-monroe-john-kennedy-happy-birthday-1962/#1">LIFE</a> has just published a series of Bill Ray&apos;s rare photos from the event. They write:</p>

<blockquote>35-year-old Marilyn Monroe &#x2014; literally sewn into a sparkling, jaw-droppingly tight dress &#x2014; stood in a spotlight on a dark stage. She took a breath, began to sing &#x2014; and 15,000 men and women who filled the old Madison Square Garden that night knew, simply knew, that they were seeing and hearing something that they would never, ever forget.</blockquote>

<p>Jackie Kennedy wasn&apos;t in attendance that night, and the evening fueled rumors that JFK and Marilyn were having an affair. Marilyn died three months later, leading to certain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523070941/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/marilyn_monroe/9.html">conspiracy theories</a>, and JFK was assassinated the next year.</p>
