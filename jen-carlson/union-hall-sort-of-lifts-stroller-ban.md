The owner, Jim Carden, upset a lot of stroller-pushers when he declared kids would no longer be allowed in the establishment and put up a sign reading: &quot;no strollers please&quot;. He asked nicely, but the Park Slope parents weren&apos;t having it. They rallied together on blogs to gain back the right to booze it up with their babies on board.</p>

<p>They won. Today the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420132853/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/5/31_05state_of_the_union.html">Brooklyn Paper&apos;s Smartmom</a> announces that &quot;the bar will once again welcome in moms and their kids for some downtime (and drinks!) a few afternoons a week.&quot; Prompting the question: &quot;can we all get along?&quot; Most likely the regular bar set won&apos;t be at the bar on the afternoons, but it&apos;s inevitable that they&apos;ll have something to say about it. The problem is mostly with parenting skills, many imbibing baby-watchers don&apos;t, in fact, watch their babies too closely, leaving employees and patrons chasing after their children.</p><blockquote>&#x201C;It was strictly liability,&#x201D; Carden said. &#x201C;A lot of parents are great and mindful. But some are not that attentive to their kids when they&#x2019;re in here. This is a bar with an open stairwell and a bocce court. This is a business and we don&#x2019;t have the staff to police it.&#x201D;</blockquote>While there will be a few &quot;off hour&quot; afternoons that allow the under-aged, there will no longer be &quot;mommy groups&quot;. But we&apos;re sure a much more appropriate venue can be found for such a thing, right? <p></p>
