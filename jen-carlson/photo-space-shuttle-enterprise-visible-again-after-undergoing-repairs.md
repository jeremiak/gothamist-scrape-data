<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328070406/http://gothamist.com/tags/spaceshuttle">Space Shuttle Enterprise</a> &quot;landed&quot; on the Intrepid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328070406/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/07/space_shuttle_enterprise.php#photo-1">last summer</a>, but about four months later it was damaged when the strong winds Hurricane Sandy blew in. Scaffolding had been built around the shuttle for repairs, and now that it&apos;s removed the Enterprise has become visible again. This afternoon we were told:</p><blockquote>&quot;Space Shuttle Enterprise is in view once again at the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, as the temporary scaffolding and cover that had been installed in February was removed on Wednesday. While the space shuttle exhibitremains closed to the public, Enterprise itself is visible from all angles.<br>
 <br>
The scaffold and covering allowed for the minor repair to the Enterprise&#x2019;s vertical stabilizer, which was damaged during Hurricane Sandy when the pavilion lost power and deflated.<br>
 <br>
A new, structured pavilion will be built over the next several weeks as Intrepid prepares to reopen the exhibit this summer.&quot;</blockquote>If you want to catch a glimpse of the Shuttle, head to Pier 86 (46th Street and 12th Avenue) in Manhattan.<p></p>
