</div></div>					<p>The amazing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074919/http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevensiegel/sets/">Steven Siegel</a> has been documenting New York City&apos;s five boroughs (and beyond) for three decades now. Click through for a small sampling of his photos from the 1980s, where you&apos;ll see abandoned cars overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge, a very desolate Bushwick, and even a massive hole in the Manhattan Bridge pedestrian walkway. He recently told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074919/http://www.12ozprophet.com/index.php/news/photographer-steven-siegel-takes-on-the-80s-in-gritty-pre-guiliani-new-york">12 oz. Prophet</a>: </p>

<p>    </p><blockquote>I&#x2019;ve been photographing the streets and subways of New York for the past 30 years. When young people today look at my shots from the 1980&#x2019;s, they are aghast. To them, New York of the 1980&#x2019;s is almost unrecognizable. And they are right.<p></p>

<p>Some older people are nostalgic for &#x201C;the good old days.&#x201D; For example, they remember the Times Square of the 80&#x2019;s&#x2026; And what they remember is not so much the danger but the grittiness and (for lack of a better word) the authenticity. Yes, there was sleaze, but there were also video arcades, cheap movies, restaurants, and weird places. These same people resent the &#x201C;Disney-ification&#x201D; of Times Square and the gentrification of virtually all of Manhattan and many areas of the boroughs, and the loss of cheap housing and local stores everywhere.</p>

<p>Of course, others&#x2019; reactions to these same photos could not be more different. If they&#x2019;re over a certain age, they remember the high crime, the twin crises of AIDS and crack, the racial tension, the lurid tabloid headlines about the latest street crime. They say: It was a nightmare, and thank God it&#x2019;s over. And for people in their twenties who have a negative reaction to these old photos, their reaction is often expressed as: How (or why) would people live here (assuming they had a choice)?</p>

<p>Of course, both views are right.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>We hope to share some more photos from Siegel&apos;s massive collection soon, so stay tuned, nostalgia freaks.</p>
