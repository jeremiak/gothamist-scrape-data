Has anyone seen those disturbing Hep C posters around town? How about the Raconteurs cover art and accompanying posters, also hung around town? A reader just sent in these photos of both with the following questions...

</p><p>&quot;Is the cover art  for The Raconteurs &quot;Broken Boy Soliders&quot; really a cry for help?  Or is it simply The Raconteurs way of supporting a public health campaign?&quot;</p>

<p>The two posters are hanging right next to each other on West Broadway. Bad idea! </p>

<p>As an aside, we love the Raconteurs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522132612/http://www.theraconteurs.com/">website</a>, so 80&apos;s (but in a good, Atari/Commodore 64 sort of way)! </p>
