<p>Around the time the EPA was patting Prospect Park on the back and awarding the space for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075855/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/prospect_park_1.php">its cleanliness</a>... more dead animals popped up by the lake. So far this year there have been dismembered animal parts, a dead duck, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075855/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/31/injured_prospect_park_swan_died.php">dead swan</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075855/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/dead_dog_found_in_prospect_park_lak.php">dead dog</a>, dead turtles and fish... who can keep track? The latest victims include a raccoon, a possum and several gosling.</p>

<p>While the water was tested and said to be fine, some locals question the test results. One man told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075855/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/19/dtg_moredeadanimalsinlake_2010_05_07_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, &#x201C;Mammals should not be dying in the lake.&quot; But the NYC Audubon insists, &#x201C;The Prospect Park lake is in very good condition and the water is in no way dangerous. It&#x2019;s not a pristine Adirondack mountain lake, but it&#x2019;s never going to be.&quot;</p>

<p>Parks Department officials have now promised to conduct necropsies on animals found dead in the lake, if they aren&apos;t too decomposed.</p>
