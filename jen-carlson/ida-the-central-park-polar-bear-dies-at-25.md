<p>Sad news came in late yesterday as it was announced that Ida, one of the Central Park Zoo&apos;s polar bears, was euthanized Friday at age 25 (allegedly living 7 years longer than a polar bear in the wild). She had been in the park since 1987, after being born at the Buffalo Zoo upstate. She had been suffering from a cancer-related liver disease.</p>

<p>Ida is survived by her male companion Gus&#x2014;the duo were the zoo&apos;s oldest couple&#x2014;and yesterday one zoo visitor told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020027/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/04/2011-06-04_beloved_central_park_zoo_polar_bear_ida_dies.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;I knew something was wrong with him.&quot; Though Gus has suffered from depression in the past (even called &quot;the bipolar bear&quot;), yesterday &quot;he just stayed away from everybody.&quot; Recently Gus and Ida got a new &quot;endless pool&quot; to keep them happy and less bored in captivity:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s the couple during happier times, opening presents during the holidays in 2007:</p>

<p>You can visit Gus today (before the zoo closes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020027/http://www.centralparkzoo.com/plan-your-trip/hours-and-rates.aspx">at 5:30 p.m.</a>), and maybe it&apos;s time Rachael Ray visit Gus again and serve him up some more tilapia on a block of ice (yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310020027/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/07/when_its_approp.php">that happened</a>).</p>
