Last night we enjoyed some time with him on the roof of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141914/http://gothamist.com/arts_and_events/hotel_chelsea">Hotel Chelsea</a> where he sang us a &apos;lil song. You&apos;ll be seeing video of that later, but first - get to know the man behind the reputation. He&apos;ll be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141914/http://www.soundfixrecords.com/">Sound Fix</a> tonight at 7pm for a free show, and he was also kind enough to provide some As to our Qs...</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a little about the &quot;blog tour&quot; you&apos;ve been doing?</strong><br>
Well, I decided to film the record live in HD and give a video to one of our favorite music bloggers. The recording was WAY more difficult than I thought it would be but it came out very nice. We had Stereogum, Gorilla vs. Bear and Brooklyn Vegan and some other fantastic bloggers involved. We did this because:</p>

<p>1. it seemed like an original idea<br>
2. it was a nice way to give something to sites we like<br>
3. we are lazy, it seemed easier than actually touring</p>

<p>Al the videos are right <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141914/http://johnvanderslice.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>There are references to 9/11 in some of your songs. Did you find that day changed the tone of the country&apos;s creative output?</strong><br>
I think the US had a collective psychotic episode following 9/11. It so weakened us a people, we allowed a small group of radical industrialists to sell us a preemptive two-front war based on falsified intelligence. Iraq is easy to see as a debacle, but Afghanistan was also a scam right from the get-go.</p>

<p><strong>Please share your strangest &quot;only in New York&quot; story.</strong><br>
Well, I was walking down Bedford Ave in Williamsburg yesterday and I ran into about 10 people i know. This is strange because I live in San Francisco!</p>
