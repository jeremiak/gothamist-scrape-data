<p>About an hour ago there was what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165322/http://mta.info/alert/alertnyct.htm">the MTA</a> was describing as a &quot;subway smoke condition&quot; near West 53rd Street and 7th Avenue. We just received some photos of a manhole fire at that intersection, and NotifyNYC is now alerting straphangers that &quot;the F and V trains are suspended in Manhattan. B and D trains are diverted onto the A line between West 57th Street and West 4th Street.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165322/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/106714/substation-fire-effects-f-v-subway-service/Default.aspx">NY1</a> adds that there has been a &quot;forced evacuation&quot; but no injuries have been reported yet.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> At 2 p.m. NotifyNYC released the following status update. &quot;Due to a previous fire, there is no 4 train service in both directions between 149th Street-Grand Concourse Station and the Crown Heights-Utica Avenue Station. The 7, B, C, D, F, and G trains have resumed service with residual delays.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> As of 4:45 p.m. &quot;4 train service has resumed in both directions between 149th Street-Grand Concourse Station and the Crown Heights-Utica Avenue Station.&quot;</p>
