The tapes have allegedly never been broadcast before, though the transcripts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161620/http://www.amazon.com/All-We-Are-Saying-Interview/dp/0312254644?tag=gothamist03-20">were published</a>.) The interview came out in <em>Playboy</em>, in an issue that hit newsstands on October 6th of that year.<p></p>

<p>What was Lennon&apos;s life like just before he was murdered? He was apparently playing the role of stay-at-home dad and got <em>way</em> into baking bread! He says, &#x201C;I took a Polaroid photo of my first loaf. I was overjoyed, you know. I was that excited by it. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it, it was like an album coming out of the oven on the instant. And every day I was cooking lunch for the staff-drivers, office boys, anybody who was working. Come on up! I love it!&#x201D; He also described his bread to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161620/http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon47.htm">BBC</a> at the time, saying, &quot;It looked great, you know, and it tasted good&#x2014;that was pretty damned good.&quot;</p>
