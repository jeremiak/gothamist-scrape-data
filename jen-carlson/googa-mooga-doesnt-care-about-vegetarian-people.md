<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041304/http://gothamist.com/tags/greatgoogamooga">the Great GoogaMooga</a> was greatly disappointing for vegetarians, especially those who paid for ExtraMooga passes and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041304/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/was_extra_mooga_worth_250.php">were offered almost no options. The weekend-long food and music fest returns on May 17th, and they&apos;ve </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041304/https://twitter.com/GoogaMooga/status/330026848333488128">just released</a> the menus for the vendors this year, so we pulled out our artisanal abacus and did some counting. There are 12 vegetarian options (not including desserts), and of those three of them are Margherita Pizza slices... and one is literally bread and butter. In comparison, there are 48 meat offerings (the full vegetarian list is below, and every menu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041304/http://brooklyn-lineup.googamooga.com/?sort=Food">can be viewed here</a>).</p>

<p>But there&apos;s no reason why non-meat eaters should limit themselves to just 20% of the total food options. Vegetarians, just strap yourself to a chair and watch this educational video a few hundred times before the 17th and you&apos;ll expand your options to a whopping 61! </p>
