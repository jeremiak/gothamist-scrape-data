title: WTF Is Happening In This New Trailer For The Newsroom?
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175534/http://gothamist.com/tags/thenewsroom"><em>The Newsroom</em></a>, Aaron Sorkin&apos;s HBO series that you either love or hate, will be returning on July 14th. The new trailer isn&apos;t a montage of sexist undertones or Sorkinisms,  but rather 90 seconds of in your face overdramatics and metaphors. It also seems to be in a style very reminiscent of <em>Six Feet Under</em>&#x2014;not that that <em>means anything</em>. As for some more concrete information on the upcoming season, the focus in the newsroom will be on the 2012 presidential election, the Trayvon Martin shooting, and the budget crisis. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175534/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/03/04/olivia-munn-is-white-hot-at-newsroom-paleyfest-panel/1961687/">Sorkin said</a> he was reluctant about including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175534/http://gothamist.com/tags/newtown">Sandy Hook</a> tragedy&#x2014;&quot;That&apos;s a tough thing to write about without minimalizing it, exploiting it, spreading Cheez Whiz all over it. Sorry for the bad metaphor, but there are so many land mines to step on. You want to make sure you don&apos;t do it a disservice.&quot;</p>
