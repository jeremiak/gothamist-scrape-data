<p>Sometime around 1973, concerts started taking place at the South Street Seaport at what looks like Pier 17 (which still houses concerts today). The caption on this photo&#x2014;which was taken in June of 1973&#x2014;reads, &quot;Folk singing and dancing has found a new home at the South Street Seaport on the East River near Brooklyn Bridge. Enthusiastic crowds gather several times a week during the summer to enjoy the show and the music, view the harbor boats, and breathe the sea air.&quot;</p>

<p>Recently we looked at how New York&apos;s music festivals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143118/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/festival_fail.php">have been struggling</a> over the past few years&#x2014;but even these days good crowds turn out on a weekly basis to the Seaport for free, live music. It <em>is</em> near a lot of subway lines, after all.</p>
