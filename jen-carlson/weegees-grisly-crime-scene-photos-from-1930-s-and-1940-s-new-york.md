</div></div>					<p>These photographs were all shot by Arthur Fellig and are said to have highly influenced the film noir genre. In fact, in 1945 he published a book of his photographs, called <em>Naked City</em>, which inspired the 1947 film of the same name. He also collaborated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030347/http://www.filmforno.com/?p=34">with Stanley Kubrick</a>, who he knew when they were both struggling photographers in the city.</p>

<p>The press photographer, who also went by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030347/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weegee">Weegee</a>, covered the police beat on the Lower East Side from 1935 to 1946 (his nickname was a nod to Ouija boards, since he often showed up at a crime scene before the cops). He said, &quot;The easiest kind of a job to cover was a murder. The stiff would be laying on the ground.&quot; It&apos;s not for the faint of heart, however, click through for a look at the bad old days, or see them up close and personal.</p>

<p>From January 20th through September 2nd of this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030347/http://www.icp.org/museum/exhibitions/weegee-murder-my-business">the International Center of Photography</a> in New York will be displaying his photographs, which they say &quot;draws upon on the extensive Weegee Archive at ICP and will include environmental recreations of Weegee&apos;s apartment and exhibitions.&quot;</p>
