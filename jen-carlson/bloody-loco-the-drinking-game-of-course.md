<p>This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063631/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloodyloco">Bloody Loco</a> train is going full <em>meme</em> ahead, and someone has gone and created a drinking game, because what this upcoming weekend needed was a drinking game based around a possibly mentally unstable straphanger. The keywords are: Bloody Loco, ASAP, and recognize. And we&apos;ll give you bonus points if you play it to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063631/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHrJN4ZkiBU">this hardstyle remix</a>.</p>

<p>Now, can someone make a Bloody Loco drink? We imagine it shares some ingredients with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063631/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/jimmy_buffet_others_try_to_trademar.php">Tiger Blood</a>, and yes, Four Loko.</p>
