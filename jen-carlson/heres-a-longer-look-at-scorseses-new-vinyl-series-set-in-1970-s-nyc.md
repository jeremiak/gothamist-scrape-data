<p>Martin Scorsese&apos;s new HBO show, <em>Vinyl</em>, is set in the 1970s and has been filming around New York for months. During that time places <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115033048/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/01/maxs_kansas_city_rock_n_roll.php">like Max&apos;s Kansas City</a> have been expertly recreated for the filming of some scenes, much to the delight of nostalgic New Yorkers stuck in 2015.</p>

<p>While we&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115033048/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/06/first_look_at_martin_scorseses_1970.php">one preview</a> for the show, which will premiere in January 2016, here&apos;s a longer trailer that&apos;s just been released. It features Bobby Cannavale screaming passionately about rock n&apos; roll, man.</p>

<p>The show is brought to you not only by Scorsese&apos;s, but Terence Winter and Mick Jagger. It stars Cannavale, Olivia Wilde and Ray Romano.</p>
