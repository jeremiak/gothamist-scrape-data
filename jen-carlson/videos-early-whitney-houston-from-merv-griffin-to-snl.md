<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120214232206/https://twitter.com/#!/Oprah/status/168723679805571072">Oprah Tweeted</a>: &quot;To me Whitney was THE VOICE. We got to hear a part of God every time she sang.&quot; Sadly, that voice became muddled in the last years of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120214232206/http://gothamist.com/tags/whitneyhouston">Whitney Houston</a>&apos;s life, but let&apos;s take a look back to her earlier years. All of the below videos are 100% guaranteed to give you goose bumps, from a 1976 recording of her singing at her Newark church, to the best &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; the country will ever hear:</p>
