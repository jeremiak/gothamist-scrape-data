</div></div>					<p>Have you ever been inside the power station, control room, rafters, clock tower of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515003920/http://gothamist.com/tags/grandcentralterminal">Grand Central Terminal</a>? If you answered &quot;no,&quot; then click through to see what you don&apos;t normally get to see at the station, which turns 100 years old today.</p>

<p>These photos are from a tour in 2011. During this time we also got to check out the long-abandoned Waldorf-Astoria train platform, which allowed VIPs to enter the hotel in a more private manner. Track 61, as its known, had most famously been used by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Today it still houses the train car and private elevator, which were both large enough for FDR&apos;s armor-plated Pierce Arrow car. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515003920/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/photos.php#photo-1">check out that photo essay here</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515003920/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/16/14_photos_of_grand_central_from_bef.php#photo-1">here are more photos of Grand Central</a>, taken before any of us were born.</p>
