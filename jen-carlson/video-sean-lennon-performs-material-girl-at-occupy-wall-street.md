<p>Zuccotti Park is becoming a regular destination spot for musicians, and yesterday evening Sean Lennon was the latest to drop by. Following his short performance with some famous friends, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530112848/http://twitter.com/#!/seanonolennon/status/128244047495176192">he Tweeted</a> to the masses: &quot;Just played, &apos;Material Girl,&apos; by Madonna at Occupy Wall Street w Josh Fox, Dustin Hamman, and Rufus Wainwright! The revolution is televised!&quot; Sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530112848/http://twitter.com/#!/DanielPinchbeck/status/128321374887481344">he didn&apos;t stick around for the General Assembly</a>, but below you can watch video from the performance. (He has also posted some photos on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530112848/http://seanlennon.tumblr.com/post/11856327576/old-friends">his Tumblr</a>.)</p>
