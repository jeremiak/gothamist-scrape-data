The sidewalks were unclogged by tourists and there were no peddlers begging to sketch your caricature or write your name on a grain of rice. The only barkers barking called out, &apos;Girls, girls, girls, one dolla, one dolla, one dolla.&apos;&quot; And of course the ladies and the lack of tourists weren&apos;t the only thing different; he recalls the buildings being lower and constructed of brick, saying, &quot;They were human-sized, manageable.&quot; </p>
