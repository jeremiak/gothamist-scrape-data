<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205164253/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/bomb_squad_circling_marble_cemetery.php">C-4 explosives</a> were discovered at the New York City Marble Cemetery, located (though practically hidden) on 2nd Street in the East Village. A detonating device wasn&apos;t found, however, meaning the blocks of C-4 could not have exploded.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205164253/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/nyregion/12bomb.html?_r=1">the NY Times</a> has some more details, noting that a volunteer discovered the decaying garbage bag filled with 10 pounds of the stuff on Sunday, during Open House NY... but it was actually discovered last May for the first time. A caretaker had discovered it and simply put it under a tree, where it has been sitting for over a year. Cemetery board member Andrew Knox told the volunteer who found the C-4 to toss it in the trash, thinking it was a movie prop or too old to be effective. The volunteer complied, but had second thoughts Monday and called the police. </p>

<p>Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly says he does not believe the aging explosives are linked to a terrorism plot, though he did tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205164253/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bomb_ingredients_in_east_village_Kg57a5UvHT06XrXb90OGrN">the awaiting press</a> that &quot;this amount of material was used in the London bombings in 2005. Inside the building, obviously, it could have caused an awful lot of damage.&quot; He also noted that investigators found a message written in what appeared to be chalk on the sidewalk in front of the cemetery that said, &#x201C;I really hope one of you find this.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The paper notes that the neighborhood is known for its history of political radicalism, and that the Hells Angels clubhouse is just a half block away&#x2014;though their lawyer says they know nothing about the C-4. Another note was found on a police cruiser at the Ninth Precinct station house yesterday, saying, &#x201C;Stop putting Christ on Second Street.&quot; It was signed by Jesus Christ. And with that, the investigation continues...</p>
