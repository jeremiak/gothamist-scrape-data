Just like last year, the people of Ocean Spray will be turning Rockefeller Center in to one of their very own cranberry bogs. The 1,500 square foot free-standing bog will be in the Channel Garden fountains from 10am to 4pm today. Seems like an opportunity for some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141019012948/http://www.flickr.com/photos/eyefruit/50154076/in/photostream/">great shots</a>, if nothing else.
