<p>The 1970s was one of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031149/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/20_minutes_in_1970s_nyc.php">toughest decades</a>, and tourists were being told to avoid subways in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031149/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/the_1970s_pamphlet_aimed_at_keeping.php#photo-1">a &quot;Fear City&quot; pamphlet</a>. Still, it had its charms, and in 1976 the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031149/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/01/disco_listicle.php#photo-1">released a list of 101 things</a> to love about NYC&#x2014;it included the below, some of which you may find on a 2016 list.</p><ul><li>&quot;Being nostalgic about things in New York that never were so great.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;New York&apos;s proximity to Montauk.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;How no one takes the top newspaper off the pile.&quot; <br>
</li><li>&quot;Flipping the change tray in the plastic taxicab divider.&quot; <br>
</li><li>&quot;The coldest wind in the world on 125th Street and 12th Avenue.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Losing yourself in a crowd.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Imagining New York without anyone in it.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;The Brooklyn Museum serving Nathan&apos;s hot dogs.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Looking for a place you know on the dirty restaurant list.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Bags of beer.&quot;<br>
