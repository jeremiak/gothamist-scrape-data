title: West Village Parents Take on the S & M Fest

										<p><img alt="200710streetsm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521101722im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200710streetsm.jpg" width="305" height="400" class="right">Residents of the West Village are calling for the removal of Community Board 2 Chairperson Brad Hoylman and CB2 District Manager Bob Gormley because of two little letters: S and M. The two approved the permit for the S&amp;M; Street Festival, which is set to take place this Sunday on Weehawken Street. </p>

<p>Parents in the area are voicing concern and flyering around Greenwich Village public schools P.S. 3 and P.S. 41 and at Bleeker Playground. An email we received from them stated when they called to complain they were told by District Manager Bob Gormley that their complaint will do no good, however the CB2 Board Members will be in attendance at the fest to monitor it. Maybe they should team up with PETA, surely there will be a lot of leather on parade!</p>

<p>What exactly are ma and pa shielding their kids eyes from? Women will be going topless, and the men are only required to wear a two-inch strip of leather to cover their backsides...but to see the flogging and rope-bondage demonstrations, you&apos;re gonna have to pay up. Seriously, it&apos;s $5 -- but don&apos;t fret parents, they&apos;re carding for that one. </p>

<p>While the families question the fest, this is New York, and it&apos;s just a celebration of the diversity of the neighborhood -- maybe they could take their kids to a movie while it&apos;s going on.</p>
