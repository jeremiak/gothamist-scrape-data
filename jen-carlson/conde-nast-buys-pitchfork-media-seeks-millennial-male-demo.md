They also publish a quarterly magazine, The Pitchfork Review, which they plan to continue under Cond&#xE9;&apos;s roof. </p>

<p>The publishing house, known for titles like Vogue, Vanity Fair, and The New Yorker, announced the acquisition today, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203724/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/business/media/conde-nast-buys-pitchfork-media.html">the NY Times</a>. This will give Cond&#xE9; Nast &quot;a stand-alone music publication with a strong editorial voice,&quot; chief digital officer Fred Santarpia said, adding that it will bring &#x201C;a very passionate audience of millennial males into our roster.&quot; </p>

<p>In a statement, Pitchfork founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203724/https://twitter.com/ryanpitchfork">Ryan Schreiber</a> addressed the acquisition, which takes effect immediately&#x2014;&quot;Pitchfork is incredibly fortunate to have found in Cond&#xE9; Nast a team of people who share our commitment to editorial excellence. Their belief in what we do, combined with their additional expertise and resources, will allow us to extend our coverage of the artists and stories that shape the music landscape on every platform.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Times notes that Santarpia (who did not reveal how much Cond&#xE9; Nast paid for Pitchfork) also made mention of the site&apos;s &quot;thriving live events business... and robust video offerings,&quot; so expect all of that to stick around for the transition.</p>
