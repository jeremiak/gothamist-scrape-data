In 1959 Jack Kerouac appeared on The Steve Allen Show to read from his new book &quot;On the Road&quot;. Prior to reading he explains how he would write on long rolling sheets of paper, and how it took him only 3 weeks to write this book. This is why we love YouTube so much, we would have never seen this otherwise. 

</p><p>Interesting note: The Steve Allen Show was filmed in the Hudson Theater on 44th and 6th, which was granted landmark status in 1987 and is now a part of the Millennium Broadway Hotel complex.</p>
