<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/12/25/godfather_of_so.php">James Brown&apos;s death</a> yesterday, to many, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://nydailynews.com/front/story/483308p-406738c.html">was more than a loss of &quot;the hardest working man in show business&quot;</a>. Reverend Al Sharpton, who toured with him in the 70s and will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=65385">lead his funeral services</a>, says Brown was the father he never had. On top of that Brown also helped Sharpton become a civil rights leader, after Brown&apos;s son (a friend of Sharpton&apos;s) died in a car accident.

</p><p>Sharpton stated yesterday to a crowd at the National Action Network&apos;s House of Justice that Brown &quot;knew that I came out of a one-parent home, and he became my father, and I became like his son.&quot; And who else would be responsible for Sharpton&apos;s unusual hair? Brown took him to his personal stylist prior to a trip to the White House to meet President Reagan. Sharpton stated, &quot;When we got on the plane headed for Washington, he said, &apos;Don&apos;t change your hair like that until I die&apos;.&quot; </p>

<p>In 2005 James Brown was given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Multimedia.jsp?id=m-8459">a statue in Georgia</a>, which he unveiled with Sharpton by his side (pictured).</p>

<p>Reverend Jesse Jackson, who has been friends with Brown since 1955, says his passing on Christmas Day is &quot;almost a dramatic, poetic moment. He&#x2019;ll be all over the news all over the world today &#x2014; he would have it no other way.&quot;</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.nme.com/news/james-brown/25587">many tributes</a> up around the internet on the death of this performer, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=64350">Quiet Riot Drummer Frankie Banali has written a little something</a>. </p>

<p>Brown is survived by his (fourth) wife (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/26/james.brown.widow.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories">the marriage was null</a>), Tomi Rae Brown, and their 5 year old son. In 2004 he threatened to kill Tomi Rae in a dispute in which he threw her to the ground. She is currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2519243,00.html">barred from their mansion in South Carolina</a>. </p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the man himself, in 1996 his autobiography titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175905/http://www.amazon.com/James-Brown-Biography-Doin-Death/dp/071192077X"><em>Doin&apos; It to Death</em></a> came out. </p>
