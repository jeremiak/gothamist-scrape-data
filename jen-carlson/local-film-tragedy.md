Lily Wheelwright, the 24-year old who played one of the two estranged sisters in the film, Rosie, died on March 22nd.</p>

<p>In the film, the twenty-something sisters reunite five years after the death of their parents only to &quot;revisit their treacherous history.&quot; In real life, Ry Russo-Young (the writer-director) and Wheelwright were friends while growing up in the West Village and attending Saint Ann&#x2019;s School in Brooklyn. After high school the two parted ways, only to reunite during the casting process of <em>Orphans</em>. Wheelwright had mentioned a history of drugs to Russo-Young during that time, but there was no evidence of a current problem while filming in upstate New York early last year.</p>

<p>After filming Wheelwright moved to Barcelona and only rejoined the cast in Austin last month for the SXSW Film Festival. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201646/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/14/movies/14orph.html">the NY Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;At the festival, I hung out with her, we saw some movies, went to some parties together, stayed up late and had a fun time,&#x201D; Ms. Russo-Young said.

<p>Ms. Wheelwright returned to New York for her parents&#x2019; 25th wedding anniversary and a 60th-birthday party for her mother. &#x201C;There were people there she hadn&#x2019;t seen in years,&#x201D; Ms. Hicks said. &#x201C;Lily was talking about going for more acting calls and was torn between going back to Barcelona and staying in New York.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then came the news of Ms. Wheelwright&#x2019;s death. Ms. Hicks said the medical examiner surmised that Ms. Wheelwright &#x201C;had a relapse moment real bad.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;It was something that would call to her &#x2014; something in the brain &#x2014; that takes time to get out when they have a relationship,&#x201D; she added, speaking of her daughter&#x2019;s problems.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>On March 26th the following was written on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201646/http://www.myspace.com/ryrussoyoung ">Orphans MySpace page</a>: &quot;Orphans doesn&apos;t usually blog but today is special. We have some very sad news to announce. Lily Wheelwright, one of the orphans in ORPHANS died at the age of twenty-four last week. It was a terrible mistake but we hope her memory can live on with this film. We love you Lily!&quot;</p>

<p>In Lily Wheelwright&#x2019;s memory, a screening of <em>Orphans</em> will be held April 30 at 10 pm at the IFC Center.
