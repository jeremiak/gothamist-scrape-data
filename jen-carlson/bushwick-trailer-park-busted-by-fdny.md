Don&apos;t invite the FDNY over. To go back in time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210954/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/22/trailer_parks.php">in December</a> some alternative-living enthusiasts touted their trailer park paradise housed in a 6,500-square-foot former nut roasting factory in Bushwick. Several media outlets picked it up, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210954/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/02/bushwick_hipsters_seem_to_be_g.html">NY Mag is reporting</a> that earlier today the FDNY busted up the joint. <p></p>

<p>Allegedly they posted signs demanding residents vacate poste-haste. But what tipped them off? Not all that media coverage! They had originally been there a week earlier when gas was leaking from one of the trailers; at that point, the site&apos;s tipster claims one firefighter said: &quot;Why is there a trailer park, with chickens?&quot;</p>

<p>Back in December, however, the Department of Housing and Urban Development was totally cool with the set up, saying they&apos;d only investigate the park if any complaints were made. Where will the artist commune and their chickens go now? We&apos;ll update once we find out!</p>
