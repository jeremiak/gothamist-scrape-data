<p>SURPRISE, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909035701/http://gothamist.com/tags/tacobell">Taco Bell</a> has unleashed the Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Taco ONE DAY EARLY, meaning that any Taco Bell within walking distance of you right now will have them. This plotted-out &quot;surprise&quot; marketing campaign is all hand-crafted to get you even more excited about the transformation of a humble Dorito chip into a functional taco shell. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909035701/https://twitter.com/TacoBell">Tweet about it</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909035701/https://www.facebook.com/tacobell">Facebook about it</a>! And hey, you gonna <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909035701/http://hashgr.am/tacobell">&apos;gram that taco</a>?</p>

<p>Now listen, we&apos;ve gone ahead and pasted the nutritional information below for you, but let&apos;s keep this positive: the Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Taco is actually 10 calories less than your standard Crunchy Taco, and it&apos;s even 10 calories less than the Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Taco, which was released just about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909035701/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/taco_bells_dorito_shell_is_coming_f.php">one year ago</a>.</p>

<p>As we type, one Gothamist Hero has braved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909035701/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/winter_weathering_snow_rain_wind_wi.php">the winds</a> to pick up a few cases of these, along with some of the now more traditional Nacho shell ones (for those of us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909035701/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/its_almost_guacamole_and_canned_sco.php">without the &quot;ranch gene&quot;</a>)&#x2014;stay tuned for our thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A dispatch from the field came in just moments ago, alerting us that the Taco Bell near Union Square is &quot;crowded, though i have no benchmark to compare against; smells sad, spicy.&quot;</p>
