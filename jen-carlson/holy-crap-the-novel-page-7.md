<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324172959/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/holy_crap_writer_posting_novel_offl.php">The novel</a> that&apos;s been posted up around the East Village this week may have been torn down already (by the weather, by passerby, by local business owners that &quot;don&apos;t like the idea&quot;). And despite the press, the author hasn&apos;t stepped forward or delivered more pages to lampposts. So for those who <em>do</em> want to dip into a little bit of it, Joe Schumacher just sent us over this clear photo of page 7, which he spotted on Sunday. Would you want to read more?</p>
