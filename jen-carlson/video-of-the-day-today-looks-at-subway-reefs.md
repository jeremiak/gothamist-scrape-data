---

	
										<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193347/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26184891/vp/27839771#27839771">the Today Show</a> took a look at the subway cars that retire from the underground of New York, and (at the cost of the MTA) are sent to create artificial reefs off the coasts of <em>other cities</em>. (The program may soon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193347/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/10/subway_reefs_for_nyc.php">benefit us</a> as well, however.) Consider the below clip subway-reef-porn, with footage of the old cars being made suitable for the sea, and dumped off barges to meet their final watery resting place.</p>

<p>They also note that Maryland is awaiting a delivery next week (so look out for something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193347/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/21/subway_barge.php">like this</a>), and Lester Holt wonders if there are fish tagging graffiti down there.<br>
