The NY1 anchor has been, as he puts it, waking New Yorkers up for twelve years. Today, however, he&apos;s officially launching his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213226/http://www.patspapers.com/">Pat&apos;s Papers</a> website, which will take his &quot;In the Papers&quot; segment from NY1 and branch it out to cover national news as well. He recently told us about his daily routine, drinking champagne with Martin Short, and his dream job of hosting Jeopardy. Watch your back Trebek!</em></p>

<p><strong>How early do you wake up, and what&apos;s your day-to-day like?</strong> I had settled on 3:17 am for years - but with the Pat&#x2019;s Papers site online I&#x2019;ve had to adjust that in the wrong direction.  It&#x2019;s closer to 2:30 these days.  I get up earlier to get a head start on reading headlines and to get a jump on my NY1 duties.  I&#x2019;m in the door at NY1 just after 4 a.m. and then we&#x2019;re on TV at 5 a.m.  <br>
 <br>
<strong>Do you get approached a lot by fans around the city? What do they have to say?</strong> A dozen years of waking people up makes me pretty recognizable.  A woman ran up to me in the subway on Thursday waving her copy of the New York Post.  She said &#x201C;you were so right about that story!&#x201D;  (She was referring to my comment that it was tough to tell how good <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213226/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/02/bad_idea_jeans_595_jeans.php">the $595 jeans</a> looked on the model without knowing how the model looked in $50 jeans.)  People are very favorable about what we do at NY1 and a lot of them say they like &#x201C;In the Papers.&#x201D;  That type of feedback is really what convinced me to get the patspapers.com website going. <br>
 <br>
<strong>What&apos;s your process for going through all the national papers now for Pat&apos;s Papers?</strong> I hired two freelancers based in Europe to start me off each day.  The idea about Europe was to play the time zones to my advantage instead of asking someone in New York to wake up at 2 am.  They dig through online versions of the papers and come up with a list of possible items.   I handle the New York papers and all of the national papers.  My producer in New York gives me another list of possible items from middle and small market papers.  She pulls in some of the Western papers which aren&#x2019;t typically available until after 6 am.  We&#x2019;re not reading every page of every paper - but we have a pretty solid list of potential links lined up by about 8 am.</p>
