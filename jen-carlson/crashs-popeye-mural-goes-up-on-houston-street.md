<p>Bronx-born graffiti artist Crash (aka John Matos) is the latest to take over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318011514/http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluejake/tags/bowerywall/">Bowery mural </a>on Houston Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318011514/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/new_mural_goes_up_on_houston_street.php">The last mural</a> up there was a very temporary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318011514/http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluejake/8542178245/">Martha Cooper birthday tribute</a>, and before that it was How and Nosm&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318011514/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/new_mural_goes_up_on_houston_street.php">post-Hurricane Sandy piece</a>. Crash&apos;s mural is in his pop art graffiti style, and features Popeye as its centerpiece&#x2014;he&apos;s still working on it now, but it&apos;s set to be complete by tomorrow.</p>

<p>Though Crash has taken part in gallery exhibitions and corporate commissions at this point in his career, he got into graffiti at 13 years old through spray painting the city&apos;s subways in the 1970s.</p>
