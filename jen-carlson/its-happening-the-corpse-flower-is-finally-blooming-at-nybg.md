<p>It&apos;s about a week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032358/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/25/stink_flower_delay.php#photo-1">later than predicted</a>, but the New York Botanical Garden&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032358/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/smell_it_stinky_corpse_flower_set_t.php">Amorphophallus titanum</a>, or Corpse Flower (as seen on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032358/http://laist.com/2016/07/27/gilmore_girls_back_in_november.php"><em>Gilmore Girls</em></a>) is finally blooming. The NYBG sent out an alert just after 5 p.m. Thursday evening to make the announcement, and while they normally close their doors at 6 p.m. you could loosen the purse strings and check out their Summer Concert Evening tonight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032358/http://bit.ly/125-evenings">for a small fee</a>. There will also be cocktails, which ups the chance that someone will fall in the water while trying to take a selfie with this thing. </p>

<p>Or you can watch from home:</p>

<p>It&apos;s expected to last 24-36 hours, and the bloom officially started at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday. The last time the NYBG had one of these bloom was in 1939! Another &quot;fun&quot; fact: it smells like rotting flesh.</p>
