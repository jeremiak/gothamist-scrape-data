										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513223728/http://lostnewyorkcity.blogspot.com/2008/05/strangest-building-in-east-village.html">Lost City</a> visits one of the odder buildings in the East Village today, located at 62 E. 4th Street. Currently two of the five floors house the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513223728/http://duotheater.blogspot.com/">Duo Theater</a>, but the top three levels have gone unused for nearly 40 years. Built in 1889, the current crumbling facade isn&apos;t the biggest mystery -- the architecture is. LC notes:</p><blockquote>There&apos;s all sort of Italianate grandeur in the shapes and lines. But it&apos;s all thrown off by the bizarre, frontal, cylindrical metal fire escape, enclosed by a tubular metal grill. The top floor included a boarded-up space of what looks like a door. But to where? There&apos;s no balcony. And what was the intention of the column-framed open forum on the fourth floor?</blockquote>Paint it pink and it could be the next <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513223728/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/15/a_look_inside_p.php">Palazzo Chupi</a>!<p></p>

It did indeed show adult fare and had the distinction of having Joe Dallesandro (Warhol Superstar) be a projectionist there as well have a revolving door of male clients who visited Dallesandro during the show.&quot; </p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513223728/http://www.warholstars.org/chron/1969.html">Warhol did rent the 150 seat Fortune Theater</a> at 62 East Fourth Street (second floor), placing Gerard Malanga as manager and the one-and-only Jim Carroll as co-manager. Together the group put on a series of hardcore male porn films in what was called Andy Warhol&apos;s Theater: Boys to Adore Galore; all paperwork was being filed under the name: Poetry on Film. Carroll once claimed that Dallesandro made some extra cash on the side sellin&apos; sex in &quot;a small sofa-filled room beside the projection booth.&quot; <em>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513223728/http://www.flickr.com/photos/13269857@N00/57672486">Pictured</a> at right:  Filmmaker Craig Highberger and Jackie Curtis at the Fortune Theater in 1974.)</em></p>
