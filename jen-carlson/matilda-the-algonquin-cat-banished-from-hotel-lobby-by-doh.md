The department has banished the cat from her lobby lounge, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023237/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/meow_trage_at_algonquin_73LjLIUVYEdf5HITLCeroJ#ixzz1eXioAgD5">the NY Post</a>, and she&apos;s now reduced to being on a leash behind the check-in desk, or lounges on a higher floor, away from where food and drinks are being served. A manager also told inspectors that they contained Matilda with an electronic fence.<p></p>

<p>This is the third Matilda at the hotel (though they&apos;ve had ten total since 1932), and she just moved in last winter. But the hotel isn&apos;t holding Bloomberg at fault, they told the Post that guests were abusing here, saying, &#x201C;People seem more aggressive toward her, and she&#x2019;s responding in a way that&#x2019;s not helpful.&quot; Though they did add, &quot;The [Health] department in the past months suggested to us that pets in food-service facilities are no longer commingled.&quot;</p>

<p>Come January 1st, Matilda will have to acclimate to a whole new atmosphere, as the hotel will close for a four month long, $15 million renovation. Hopefully the DOH won&apos;t stop next summer&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023237/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/cat_fashion_show.php#photo-1">cat fashion show</a> from happening. For the record, the Health Department sent us this statement: &quot;According to the New York City Health Code, live animals are not allowed in food service establishments (except for edible fish, shellfish, or crustacean) unless a patron needs a service dog.&quot;</p>
