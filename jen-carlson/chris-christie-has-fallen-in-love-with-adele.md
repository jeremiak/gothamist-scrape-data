<p>Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has been very vocal about his love for Bruce Springsteen, declaring <em>Born To Run</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000250/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/25/chris_christie_born_to_ruin.php">his desert island disc</a>. The feeling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000250/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/video_bruce_springsteen_jimmy_fallo.php">is not mutual</a>, but perhaps he&apos;ll have better luck with an overseas target&#x2014;Christie has now locked his eyes on Adele. RUN ADELE.</p>

<p>When asked about his all time favorite artist last night in Iowa, Christie stuck with Bruce, but then verbally slobbered all over Adele:</p><blockquote>&quot;If I can only have one, it would be Bruce. But I will tell you just as an aside that recently I have kind of like, kind of fallen in love with Adele. I&apos;ve got a little bit of a crush on Adele so, my wife&apos;s OK with it, so we&apos;re all right.&quot;</blockquote>Oh, phew, his wife is OK with it. Wait there&apos;s more:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;As I was driving around Iowa, I have been known with members of my staff to be singing a little &apos;Hello.&apos; But I can guarantee this: You don&apos;t want to be in the car for that. You really don&apos;t want to be in the car for that. My staff is only in the car because I&apos;m paying them to be there.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Everyone in that car needs a raise. Oh, there&apos;s <em>even more</em>:</p>

<blockquote>She&apos;s got this amazing voice right, this incredible voice. But then when you actually listen to her speak, she&apos;s normal. She&apos;s not one of these like prissy kind of like, &apos;Oh, look at me.&apos; I don&apos;t want to give examples because I&apos;ll offend somebody.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>He&apos;s been using both the song &quot;Hello&quot; and its title in his attacks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000250/http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/07/politics/chris-christie-marco-rubio-adele-hello-ad/">against Marco Rubio</a>. Can&apos;t we make at least that stop? (Cc: Adele&apos;s record label/licensing/agent/lawyer/manager.)</p>
