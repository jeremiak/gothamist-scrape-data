---

<p>Amidst all of the iPhone hoopla there was probably more than one incident of unkind words being exchanged around the long lines. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120222164520/http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/03/nbc_news_producer_ge.html">Boing Boing</a> points out one in which a mascot for a hunger-awareness campaign named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120222164520/http://hungrr.com/">Hungrr</a> got assaulted by the NBC News crew! This happened outside the Apple store on 5th Avenue as the mascot was handing out pins for the organization. Hungrr was there buying an iPhone to sell on eBay to raise money for the Northwest Louisiana Food bank, helping Katrina victims.</p>

They managed to get an iPhone prior to being harassed by the crew and the cops, and it&apos;s up for auction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120222164520/http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=220126913661">here</a>. </p>
