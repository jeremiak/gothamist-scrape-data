Recently frontman Adam Duritz answered a few of our questions prior to playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509044207/http://www.countingcrows.com/?em16=1062_-1__0_~0_-1_8_2009_0_0&amp;content=tour_detail">at Summerstage</a> (which goes down this evening at 6). We&apos;ll always love &quot;August and Everything After,&quot; but it speaks volumes that the New Yorker he admires most is Robert Moses.</em></p>

<p><strong>When you first started out, blogs weren&apos;t even around&#x2014;do you keep up with music blogs these day?</strong> I read a few, although I&apos;m sporadic about it., I like Ryan&apos;s Smashing Life, AbsolutePunk.net, Ain&apos;t It Cool News ... Bill Janovitz (formerly of Buffalo Tom) writes great pieces on his Facebook page.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the biggest change as a band from then to now?</strong> Not much really. We all seem the same.</p>

<p><strong>How did the Traveling Circus tour come about?</strong> Two of our guy&apos;s wives had babies last Fall and they both had to leave tour early. Augustana was out with us and they starting filling in on a few songs. We ended up turning the show into a show about all of us playing together as opposed to a show about them filling in here and there. It was just a lot more fun. I decided right then and there that The Medicine Show was the only kind of tour I wanted to do this summer. Hell, I can&apos;t imagine touring any other way ever again to be honest. This is the best thing I&apos;ve ever done. I&apos;m truly proud of it.</p>
