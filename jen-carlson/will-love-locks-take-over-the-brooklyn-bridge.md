										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="php8dsc4TAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040558im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php8dsc4TAM.jpg" width="350" height="262"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040558/http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarpond/4095638466/">sugarpond&apos;s flickr</a></span></i></div> A tradition dating back to... 2004, has now reached Brooklyn by way of Italy. That year a movie called <em>Tre Metri Sopra il Cielo</em> (based on a 1992 novel by Federico Moccia) hit the big screen and included a scene where a couple secured their love (via a lock) to a bridge, and then tossed the keys into the river below. In Italy this has plagued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040558/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/lazio/milvian-bridge.asp">the Ponte Milvio</a>, and now it seems to have made its way over to the Brooklyn Bridge. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040558/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/18/all_brooklynbridgelocks_2010_04_30_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> there are quite a few signs of the tradition secured to the bridge&#x2014;as well as benches, supports and pillars&#x2014;dating back to 2007 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040558/http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=%22brooklyn+bridge%22+lock&amp;m=text">see for yourselves</a>). The locks (which include names and a date) are illegal, as is fastening anything to the bridge, but the paper wonders if the law is enforced by the Department of Transportation.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the DoT to find out if they&apos;re suckers for a little romance, or just blissfully unaware of these small objects being attached to the bridge. We&apos;ll update when/if we hear back. Meanwhile, back at the Ponte Milvio people are now being ticketed for their acts of amore.</p>
