<p>You know how that d-bag you briefly dated while under the influence of Natural Light and JELL-O shots would totally get his dog high by exhaling his schwag weed into its face? That guy was such a jerk, <em>why did you ever even date him?</em> Anyway, today we came across <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070825/http://thedo.gs/?p=3032">this article</a> that he probably wrote, saying it&apos;s totally chill for dogs to get high. According to one local vet sourced in the piece, &quot;it&#x2019;s perfectly ok for your dog to smoke marijuana. He can even take bong hits. He just can&#x2019;t eat it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>As it turns out, &quot;exposing cats and dogs to marijuana can help reduce the suffering from a chronic and painful illness,&quot; just like with humans. One cat owner says, &#x201C;My cat had Leukemia. On his death bed, we blew marijuana smoke into his ears, and he got up, walked around the house meowing, &#xFB01;rst time in a week. We thought he was better, but he crawled into his bed and died later that day. But he did seem to enjoy those last few hours.&#x201D; There&apos;s even something called Medical Marijuana Delivery Systems, LLL developing a pet patch called Tetracan, which will allow ailing pets to absorb marijuana through their skin (so far it will be for cats, dogs, and horses... and we&apos;re guessing their owners). Medical marijuana laws would have to be amended to allow vets to prescribe it in each of the 15 states medical marijuana is currently legal. </p>

<p>We reached out to PETA, and their rep Nicole Dao told us: <br>
</p><blockquote>If the proper administration of marijuana can truly relieve dogs&apos; pain, then they should be given the same consideration that humans in pain are given, with regular doses to help reduce their misery. <strong>But it&apos;s an entirely different matter to amuse oneself by getting the cat drunk or the dog high. In fact, it sounds like something that only a total pothead or moron would do.</strong> It&apos;s like the bar owners who used to keep a chimpanzee in a cage and let the animal smoke cigarettes just to get a laugh out of their patrons: It wasn&apos;t just an unhealthy habit, the bar owners created a nicotine craving in the ape that the animal couldn&apos;t satisfy whenever it hit. </blockquote><p></p>

<p>Since a YouTube search of dogs smoking weed was far too upsetting to pursue after a few minutes, we&apos;ll just go with this to visualize Dao&apos;s point:</p>
