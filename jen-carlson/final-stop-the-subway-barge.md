title: Final Stop: The Subway Barge
---

	
										<p>A reader sent us some photos of retired subway cars traveling by barge to their watery graves. Once hitting the correct latitude they&apos;re dumped overboard to create natural reefs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025195110/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/08/subway_reef_mad.php">Earlier this year</a> the reef program proved to be <em>too popular</em> in Delaware, where subway cars were sent on the MTA&apos;s dime. Reportedly they&apos;re adding tanks, refrigerators, shopping carts and washing machines to the ocean floor in order to expand the reef. </p>
