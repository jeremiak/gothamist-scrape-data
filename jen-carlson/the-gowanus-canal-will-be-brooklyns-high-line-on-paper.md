<p>With a long Superfund process ahead, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051421/http://gothamist.com/tags/gowanuscanal">Gowanus Canal</a> isn&apos;t going to be sparkling with anything but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051421/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">STDs</a> anytime soon. A new design competition can keep hope alive though! And that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051421/http://www.gowanuslowline.org/">exactly what&apos;s happening</a>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051421/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/9/dtg_gowanusdesigns_2011_2_25_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the contest will accept entries from architects who want to spruce the place up, even before the decade is over. A local architect told the paper, &#x201C;The goal is that the entries become food for thought and it allows the community to start to look at the way it wants to have the area developed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>More contests are already planned for the Lowline competition&#x2014;a play on Manhattan&apos;s High Line Park&#x2014;which would find ways for people to enjoy the waterway. Possibilities are limitless, and the contest&apos;s sponsor (the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation) expects to see everything from pedestrian footbridges, to birdhouses, to new signage. </p>

<p>The deadline is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051421/http://www.gowanuslowline.org/register.html">April Fools Day</a>, which sort of seems fitting.</p>
