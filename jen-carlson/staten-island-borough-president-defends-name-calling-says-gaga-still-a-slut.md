										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="gagaSIprez.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601213903im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gagaSIprez.jpeg" width="350" height="239" class="image-right"> </span>Earlier this week Staten Island borough president James Molinaro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601213903/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/25/lady_gaga_10.php">called Lady Gaga a slut</a>&#x2014;but Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer quickly came to her defense. To back up: Molinaro called Gaga a slut because she was spotted smoking a joint on stage in Amsterdam, which he believes is setting a bad example for The Children. Now Molinaro is flapping his trap once again, to come to his own defense&#x2014;he says:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A slut is someone that&apos;s immoral or uses improper conduct. That&apos;s the interpretation in the Random dictionary. So she&apos;s using improper conduct. So she&apos;s a slut. What&apos;s the big deal about it? Are you excited because she&apos;s female? There&apos;s males that are sluts too... Anyone that would expose people that look up to them and who their idol is, to the use of narcotics, to me is a slut, male or female. It doesn&apos;t matter. Let&apos;s assume it was Frank Sinatra that did it&#x2014;of course he&apos;s dead a lot of years&#x2014;a singer of that capability, I would feel the same way.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601213903/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/staten_island_borough_presiden_40.html">SI Live</a> points out, Random House says, &quot;The original sense of this word, which is first found about 1400, is &apos;a dirty, slovenly woman&apos;, and was used with no suggestion of sexual promiscuity... but it is now usually considered to be &apos;a sexually immoral woman.&apos;&quot; Anyway, if Molinaro is so concerned with the kids&#x2014;what is his stance on bullying? What kind of example is he setting by calling names?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gaga is doing amazing things after her label <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601213903/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/lady_gaga_told_to_lose_weight_gains.php">told her to lose weight</a>. Gaga, who had eating disorders for years, is encouraging her fans to embrace their bodies, with what she&apos;s calling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601213903/http://jezebel.com/5946233/bulimia-and-anorexia-since-i-was-15-lady-gaga-responds-to-fat-headlines-with-half+naked-pics-and-a-confession">the Body Revolution</a>. It&apos;s a lot more productive than name-calling.</p>
