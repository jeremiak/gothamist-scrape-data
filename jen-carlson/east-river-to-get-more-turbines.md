<p>Will our lives soon be powered by the East River? A plan to get turbines into the river has been in the works <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110323021654/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/13/east_river_turb.php">for years</a>, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110323021654/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/turning-the-east-rivers-flow-into-electricity/">the NY Times</a> it could be happening soon. The company hoping to deliver the hundreds of electricity-generating turbines have announced they&apos;ve filed for federal approval to build what could be the first tidal power plant in U.S.&#x2014;it would be located off Roosevelt Island. </p>

<p>Verdant Power would like to install 30 tidal power turbines in the river as part of a pilot program, which would transmit energy onto the national grid. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110323021654/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/13/east_river_turb.php">2006 to 2008</a> they installed six turbines, which managed to power some local businesses on the island.</p>
