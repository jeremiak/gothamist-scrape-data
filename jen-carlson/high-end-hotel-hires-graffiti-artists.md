They&apos;ve commissioned artists Joyce Pensato, Nick 1, Vizie and Shinique to deck the walls of an adjacent building it recently bought, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522092024/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hip_hotel_the_place_to_spray_y33b4fBPby7wnv3gW8r3xJ">the NY Post</a>. Vizie told the paper, &quot;The only real unifying theme is the colors, black and white,&quot; but his section is &quot;a tribute to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522092024/http://gothamist.com/tags/dashsnow">a friend who died</a> over the summer.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The final collaborative masterpiece (which will apparently include a portrait <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522092024/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/11/boutique-hotel-commissions-graffiti-camouflage/">of Homer J. Simpson</a>) is slated to be done by November 10th, and will be up for a year before something new takes its place. Unless <em>uncommissioned</em> street artists take it over by then.
