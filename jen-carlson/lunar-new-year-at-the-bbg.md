<p>As well reported by now, New York&apos;s botanical gardens are facing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140510/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/08/cutbacks_at_zoo_aquarium_and_botani.php">massive budget cutbacks</a> as part of Gov. Paterson&apos;s proposal, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140510/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/nyregion/22funding.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">the NY Times</a> reports today that both the Queens and Bronx gardens have already been canceling programs. But now you&apos;ve got a chance to help bail out the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.</p>

<p>This Sunday the BBG will be holding their annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140510/http://www.bbg.org/vis2/2009/lunarnewyear/">Lunar New Year Celebration and Flower Market</a>, which includes performances, hands-on workshops, plant tours and more celebrating the cultures of China, Korea, and Vietnam. In addition, they&apos;ll set up &quot;a cut-flower market that sells gorgeous flowering plants considered lucky for the New Year!&quot; Rumor has it that the big Lunar New Year flower market in Chinatown might be canceled this year, so Sunday may be your only chance to pick up the lucky flowers.</p>
