<p>Although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152748/http://gothamist.com/tags/jeffmangum">Jeff Mangum</a> has performed some solo shows recently, Neutral Milk Hotel (with the original lineup) hasn&apos;t played in public for 15 YEARS. So today&apos;s news that they are reuniting this year for a tour had us feeling many feelings and levels of joy we&apos;ve never experienced. So far only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152748/http://walkingwallofwords.com/tour.html">a handful of shows</a> have been announced, for later this year, but there&apos;s a promise of &quot;more to come,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152748/http://pitchfork.com/news/47783-neutral-milk-hotel-reunite-for-tour/">Pitchfork</a> has confirmed that &quot;this touring lineup will consist of Mangum, Scott Spillane, Julian Koster, and Jeremy Barnes, the lineup that came together following the release of <em>On Avery Island</em> in 1996.&quot;</p>
