</div></div><p>Last night tens of thousands of fans were let down after the Black Eyed Peas and Taylor Swift supershow in Central Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612053015/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/black_eyed_peas_concert_canceled_fa.php">was cancelled due to the weather</a>. (While the rest of New York City made fun of them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612053015/https://twitter.com/#!/search/black%20eyed%20peas">on Twitter</a>.) The sky is now clear and new information is arising, or rather, amazing quotes from devastated fans. Like the 55-year-old man who told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612053015/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/black_eyed_cloud_XyiPRnGAuiBX4sz8MN1S1J#ixzz1Osjw3jKe">the NY Post</a>, &quot;Life is full of disappointments.&quot; Another told the paper, &quot;I was annoyed because it said rain or shine. I didn&apos;t realize that meant &apos;no thunderstorms.&apos;&quot; Yes, because nothing says &quot;common sense&quot; like holding a concert outdoors with a 60,000 person crowd, electrical equipment, and a lightning storm.</p>

<p>Another fan described the event as a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; thing... but is it? The Robin Hood Foundation, who were behind the show, released this statement: &#x201C;The heat wasn&#x2019;t going to stop them, the rain wasn&#x2019;t going to stop them, but the lightning-it stopped them. It came down to safety for everyone. Organizers are hoping to reschedule, so ticket buyers should hold onto their tickets. Robinhood.org will have information in the next week or so.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Black Eyed Peas <em>did</em> technically play last night, however, performing acoustically to a much smaller crowd under a tent. The person who took this video says, &quot;No auto tune, tiny stage, one mic, one guitar&quot;&#x2014;so, you&apos;ve been warned.</p>
