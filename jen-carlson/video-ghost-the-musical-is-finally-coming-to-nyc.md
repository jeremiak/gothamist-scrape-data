<p>Earlier this year we saw the trailer for <em>Ghost: The Musical</em>, but were quickly disappointed when we saw the show was only running in London. Well now we&apos;ve received word in our inbox that &quot;the supernatural power of love&quot; is coming to Broadway&apos;s Nederlander Theater in April, 2012. We sent the trailer around the Gothamist office to find out if this would be a good show for our annual, mandatory Gothamist theater field trip... and things aren&apos;t looking so good:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;I hope the producers have prepared for Patrick Swayze&apos;s &apos;Ghost&apos; to descend upon theatergoers and warn them of the grave danger that will come from seeing this. And no, I wouldn&apos;t see it. Except if I get stoned with Whoopi Goldberg beforehand.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;That subway scene looks amazing or awful&#x2014;I can&apos;t decide!  But it doesn&apos;t look like it has any flying spiders or singing Mormons, so not sure if I&apos;ll definitely see it.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;Cheesy, but I DO like glitter. And there is a lot of that. But really, casting a blond, curly-headed Demi? It just seems wrong.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;Let me liveblog it for you, in S&apos;s: Sparkly! Shirtless! Silly! Stupid! Seriously?&quot;
</li><li>&quot;I hope they sell replicas of the underwear that Patrick Swayze knew Demi Moore wrote her name on.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;No Whoopi? No thank you.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>The production will be directed by Tony Award winner Matthew Warchus (<em>God of Carnage</em>), and will have a brand new, original score by Grammy Award winners Dave Stewart (half of the Eurythmics) and Glen Ballard (Michael Jackson&apos;s Man In The Mirror, Alanis Morisette&#x2019;s Jagged Little Pill). Bruce Joel Rubin, who wrote the original screenplay, has adapted it for the stage. No word on who is in charge of clay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003202615/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFzFj7Mlit4&amp;feature=related">but there better be someone in charge of clay</a>.</p>
