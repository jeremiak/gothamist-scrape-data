<p>The folks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141105111253/http://twitter.com/NewYorkology/status/9543704662">at NewYorkology</a> spotted this Staten Island Ferry toy (what every child wants!) at City Store today. Can you spot the problem? There haven&apos;t been cars allowed on the ferry since 9/11/2001, but this toy comes with three cars (and a photo showing them on the ferry). Oversized cars at that&#x2014;proportionally <em>these are all wrong</em>. There&apos;s an elf out there that needs to be fired.</p>
