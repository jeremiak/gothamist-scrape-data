					<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620195904/http://www.barbiemedia.com/news/detail/152.html">Barbie announced</a> the arrival of 15 new Ken dolls, and on top of &quot;featuring three body types&#x2014;slim, broad [some are calling this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620195904/http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-ken-body-style-20170620-story.html">dad-bod</a>] and original&#x2014;and a variety of skin tones, eye colors, and modern fashion looks,&quot; they also have hairstyles that may suggest a certain regionalism. Namely, this one with the man bun. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="manbunken17.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620195904im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/manbunken17.jpg" width="640" height="392"> <br> <i> More like 2015 Ken, amirite?</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Lisa McKnight, Senior Vice President of Barbie, explains: &#x201C;Evolving Ken was a natural evolution for the brand and allows girls to further personalize the role they want him to play in Barbie&#x2019;s world.&#x201D; For example, the role of the narcissistic tool in Brooklyn that Barbie dates despite the man bun expertly groomed atop his head screaming at her to run away.</p>

<p>A publicist tells us, &quot;We found inspiration for our Ken looks from everywhere&#x2014;from Brooklyn to Barcelona. As a brand that has always reflected the times, Ken with a man bun is a natural fit... and he&#x2019;s heading to Brooklyn!&quot; </p>

<p>That&apos;s right, you can meet this plastic stereotype at Brooklyn Roasting Company at 25 Jay Street in DUMBO on Wednesday, as the coffee house &quot;has teamed up with Barbie to give away free Man Bun Ken dolls to customers rocking a man bun.&quot; We regret to inform all involved that man buns are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620195904/http://www.gq.com/story/why-i-cut-my-man-bun">no longer a trend</a>, and that this Ken doll has officially buried them 6-feet further into the ground. Still, if you want to <em>ironically</em> pick one up, be sure to hashtag your photos of it with #ManBunKen. </p>

<p>For now, you&apos;re going to have to make your doll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620195904/https://www.romphim.com/">his own romphim</a> as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620195904/http://www.barbiemedia.com/images/2017.html">we spotted zero</a> in the collection of images for Mattel&apos;s new Fashionista collection.<br>
