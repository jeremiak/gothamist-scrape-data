</div></div>					<p>There are plenty of photos showing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043140/http://gothamist.com/tags/marilynmonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> in her glamorous Hollywood attire, but there may even be more of the sex symbol... reading. Even a dip in the shallow end of Monroe&apos;s candid video footage and photo archives will show you that side of her, and now you can see what books the former Mrs. Arthur Miller always had her nose in. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043140/http://www.openculture.com/2013/03/inside_marilyn_monroes_personal_library.html">OpenCulture</a>, when Monroe died in 1962 she left around 400 books behind, &quot;many of which were later catalogued and auctioned off by Christie&#x2019;s in New York City.&quot; Now on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043140/http://www.librarything.com/catalog/marilynmonroelibrary">LibraryThing</a> you can get a look at 262 of those books&#x2014;her collection included <em>Ulysses</em> by James Joyce, <em>Crime And Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky, <em>Bound For Glory</em> by Woody Guthrie, <em>The Roots Of American Communism</em> by Theodore Draper (a risky title to keep around given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043140/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/28/fbi_files_reveal_new_details_about.php">that whole FBI thing</a>), <em>The Bible</em>, <em>How To Travel Incognito</em> by Ludwig Bemelmans, <em>The Little Engine That Could</em>, and Jack Kerouac&apos;s <em>On The Road</em>. She also had a number of books that spoke to a more domestic life, including <em>The Joy of Cooking</em>, <em>Baby &amp; Child Care</em> by Dr. Benjamin Spock, and one guide to flower arranging.</p>

<p>Upon the release of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043140/http://www.amazon.com/Fragments-Poems-Intimate-Notes-Letters/dp/0374533784"><em>Fragments: Poems, Intimate Notes, Letters</em></a>  in 2010, Sam Kashner wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043140/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/11/marilyn-monroe-201011?currentPage=all">in Vanity Fair</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;Several photographs taken of Marilyn earlier in her life&#x2014;the ones she especially liked&#x2014;show her reading. Eve Arnold photographed her for Esquire magazine in a playground in Amagansett reading James Joyce&#x2019;s Ulysses. Alfred Eisenstaedt photographed her, for Life, at home, dressed in white slacks and a black top, curled up on her sofa, reading, in front of a shelf of books&#x2014;her personal library, which would grow to 400 volumes. In another photograph, she&#x2019;s on a pulled-out sofa bed reading the poetry of Heinrich Heine.<p></p>

<p>If some photographers thought it was funny to pose the world&#x2019;s most famously voluptuous &apos;dumb blonde&apos; with a book&#x2014;James Joyce! Heinrich Heine!&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t a joke to her. In these newly discovered diary entries and poems, Marilyn reveals a young woman for whom writing and poetry were lifelines, the ways and means to discover who she was and to sort through her often tumultuous emotional life. And books were a refuge and a companion for Marilyn during her bouts of insomnia.&quot;</p></blockquote>Click through for a look at some of those photos, which have become just as iconic as Monroe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043140/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/06/movie_flashback.php#photo-2">standing over a subway grate</a>.<p></p>
