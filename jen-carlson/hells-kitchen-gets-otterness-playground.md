<p>Hey did you know Tom Otterness makes playgrounds? Just one of his many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419065546/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/15/otterness.php">quirky hobbies</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419065546/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/05/01/rent_at_silver_towers_or_its_playground_will_hunt_you_down.php">Curbed</a> points out that the massive Silver Towers rising on Eleventh Avenue in Hell&apos;s Kitchen have launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419065546/http://www.silvertowers.com/">a website</a>, which promises future tenants an Otterness playground for the kiddies. But wait, this thing looks familiar! Yep, he&apos;s made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419065546/http://www.tomostudio.com/exhibitions_play.html">that same playground</a> before. In fact, if you&apos;ve got the cash, he&apos;ll make one for you, too.</p>
