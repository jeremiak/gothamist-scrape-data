The MTA, perhaps seeing it as a way to brainwash unhappy customers, oversaw the project.<p></p>

<p>Did the cards help create Stepford Straphangers, totally okay with fare hikes and delays? No. But the MTA&apos;s Christopher Boylan, says: &#x201C;God knows people want to feel good, they want to feel up, they want to feel positive. If I can make a couple of customers smile a day, that&#x2019;s nice.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The artist, Reed Seifer, says, &#x201C;I like that maybe not everyone&#x2019;s going to see it. Or maybe one day you just look and say, &#x2018;Oh.&#x2019; It exists between the card and the person who receives the card.&quot; What word would you put on the back of a MetroCard?</p>
