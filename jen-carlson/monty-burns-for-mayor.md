<p>Move over Bloomberg, there&apos;s a new billionaire in town, and he&apos;s just as old, white and male. His big plans include bringing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225063827/http://burnsformayor.com/transportation.html">subway fares</a> down to a nickel by including cattle and bulk freight transportation through our underground system. Don&apos;t ask questions, it just makes sense! And who can naysay his plan to sell Staten Island to New Jersey?</p>
