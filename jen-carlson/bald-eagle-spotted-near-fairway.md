<p>A Bald Eagle spotting isn&apos;t unheard of in New York City&#x2014;but it&apos;s still neat to see one milling about in Harlem instead of, say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208085308/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/469327845/">behind bars</a> at the Bronx Zoo. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208085308/http://yojimbot.blogspot.com/2010/02/harlem-eagle.html">One blogger</a> recently spotted one heading to Fairway, saying: &quot;Since the opening of the Harlem Piers I have always appreciated its close views of Hudson River bird traffic, all the while knowing that Bald Eagles sometimes ply these fish rich waters. So today, as I was about to head into Fairway, I scanned the rough ice and to my surprise, found a bald eagle in almost complete adult plumage.&quot; (Maybe he knows where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208085308/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/central_park_coyote_on_the_loose.php">that wiley coyote</a> is.)
