<p>Chinese artist and activist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508163655/http://gothamist.com/tags/AiWeiwei">Ai WeiWei</a> is bringing his Sunflower Seeds installation to New York City for the first time, at an exhibit opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508163655/http://hyperallergic.com/44116/ai-weiwei-sunflower-seeds-mary-boone/">on Saturday</a> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508163655/http://maryboonegallery.com/">Mary Boone Gallery</a> (and running through February 4th).</p>

<p>The installation is comprised of millions of hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds, which made their debut in 2010 at the Tate Modern in London. At that time, the installation was actually interactive until it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508163655/http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/oct/18/sunflower-seeds-tate-modern-health-safety">dubbed toxic</a> when exhibition-goers frolicking in piles of seeds created a fine ceramic dust storm. The dust was &quot;easily breathed into the lungs of art aficionados,&quot; and visitors were banished to an observation deck after that.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect to roll around in the seeds, and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508163655/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/chinese_artist-activist_ai_weiwei_r.php">having been prohibited</a> from leaving China for a year, don&apos;t expect to see Ai Weiwei there either. Here&apos;s a little more about the piece:</p>
