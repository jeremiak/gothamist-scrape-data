The establishment was recently the subject of an undercover report by Animals&apos;Angels USA, the results of which have just been released (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926201539/http://banhdc.org/animalsangels.pdf">PDF</a>). The protesting group included members of the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn carriages, who asked how &quot;the Dickensian conditions could be allowed to exist.&quot;</p>

<p>The prominent issues found during the investigation included &quot;complete lack of fire safety, lack of a ventilation system, the size and condition of the stalls, toxic ammonia-saturated air and stifling hot temperatures&quot; Regarding fire safety, one speaker noted that if a fire were to occur on the ground floor, the steep ramps would act like a chimney, bringing the smoke to the upper floors where horses are tethered to feeding troughs. </p>
