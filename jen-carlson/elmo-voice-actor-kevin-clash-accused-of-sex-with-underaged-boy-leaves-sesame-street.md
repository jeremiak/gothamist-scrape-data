<p>Kevin Clash, the man behind <em>Sesame Street</em>&apos;s Elmo (and the subject of the highly acclaimed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005154749/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/psa_being_elmo_is_now_on_netflix_in.php"><em>Being Elmo</em></a> doc), is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old young man. While Clash has now taken a leave of absence from the show in light of the allegations, he denies the charges.</p>

<p>The accuser, who is now 23-years-old, recently met with Sesame Workshop&apos;s lawyers, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005154749/http://www.tmz.com/2012/11/12/elmo-kevin-clash-sex-sesame-street-underage-boy-allegations/">told TMZ</a> that the accuser approached them in June, and &quot;This was a personal relationship, unrelated to the workplace. We took the allegation very seriously and took immediate action.&quot; </p>

<p>Clash and the young man began their relationship seven years ago, when Clash was 45&#x2014;and while he admits to the relationship, he insists nothing of a sexual nature happened until the young man was of age. Clash says, &quot;I had a relationship with [the accuser].  It was between two consenting adults and I am deeply saddened that he is trying to make it into something it was not.&quot; </p>

<p>The accuser&apos;s lawyers are from Andreozzi and Associates, the same firm that represented one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005154749/http://gothamist.com/tags/JerrySandusky">Jerry Sandusky</a>&apos;s victims. They have accused Sesame Workshop of trying to &quot;discredit the victim in order to protect its employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters. This approach places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of a young man.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding Clash&apos;s departure from the show, Sesame Workshop says the performer &quot;has taken actions to protect his reputation.  We have granted him a leave of absence to do so.&quot;</p>
