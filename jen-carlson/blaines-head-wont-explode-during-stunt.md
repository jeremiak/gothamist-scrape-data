The idea is simple enough: hang upside down over Wollman Rink for 60 hours; Blaine has already been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117114015/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/14/david_blaine_wants_fans_to_come_han.php">practicing at a gym</a> and was up to 8 hours at the last check-in. While hanging upside down, in some people&apos;s opinions, has its health benefits (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117114015/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20014253,00.html">Rosie O&apos;Donnell does it</a> to treat depression!), a doctor told The Daily News, <strong>&quot;His head is not going to explode, but it could cause some problems with the blood flow to his brain. I wouldn&apos;t do it, and I wouldn&apos;t counsel anyone else to do it.&quot;</strong> So far the 35-year-old endurance stuntman hasn&apos;t suffered from his practices, but he did note: &quot;This is a lot more difficult than it looks.&quot;</p>
