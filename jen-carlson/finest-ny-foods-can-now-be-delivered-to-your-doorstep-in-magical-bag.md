<p>With so many food artisans around town, it&apos;s impossible to find the time to get all of your canned, pickled, brewed, and sea salted goods! Step in: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170000/http://www.samplrs.com/">Samplrs</a>. The new business launched with their first delivery this week. Here&apos;s the idea behind their simpler sampling program:</p>

<blockquote>We created Samplrs to provide food artisans a distribution channel through which to promote their products and to provide decidedly interested customers with a new way to discover amazing food from the comfort of their own home (or office!). 

<p>Each month, you&#x2019;ll receive a Samplrs Tote containing 4-5 full-sized products from New York&#x2019;s finest up-and-coming local food artisans. Each Samplr will include anything from cookies and chocolates to spreads and sauces, along with a card containing product descriptions and pairing suggestions.</p></blockquote><br>
The site is regularly updated with new merchants and products (as well as events, because the organizers also want to introduce you to the people making this stuff). The service costs $29.99 a month, and you can cancel at any time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170000/http://twitter.com/#!/to2/status/108614079173771264">Looks like</a> the first batch included artisanal jerky, salsa, cookies, oatmeal, and a muffin. You can follow them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170000/http://twitter.com/#!/samplrs">on Twitter</a>, but you&apos;ll probably be signing up for the service yourself after a few mentions of the &quot;mind blowing&quot; cookies.<p></p>
