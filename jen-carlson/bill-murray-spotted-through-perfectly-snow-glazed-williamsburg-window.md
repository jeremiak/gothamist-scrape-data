<p>The elusive Bill Murray, Brooklyn&apos;s own adopted rare snowbird, was digitally captured roaming the borough this week after all. There were a number of sightings of the actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023014001/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/18/bill_murray_spotting_in_williamsbur.php">in Williamsburg yesterday</a>, which set off the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023014001/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BillMurrayWatch&amp;src=hash">#BillMurrayWatch</a> alarm for a second time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023014001/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/05/city_continues_to_be_enraptured_by.php#photo-1">this year</a>. But like good <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023014001/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/25/ask_a_native_new_yorker_is_it_ok_to.php">respectful New Yorkers</a>, no one <em>seemed</em> to Instagram the moment... </p>

<p>Today, however, reader Chelsea Williams reached out to let us know she spotted him while she was enjoying lunch at Samurai Mama on Grand Street around 2 p.m. on Wednesday. She tells us, &quot;I was having lunch... sitting by the window. Bill stopped in for a moment, and then stood outside for awhile with his assistant, I&apos;m guessing. It was truly wonderful!&quot;</p>

<p>This is exactly how a Bill Murray spotting should unfold. Quick, dreamlike, and through an ice-glazed window... which slowly starts to melt as the perfect moment forms on either side of it.</p>
