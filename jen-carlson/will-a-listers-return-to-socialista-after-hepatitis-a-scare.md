title: Will A-Listers Return to Socialista After Hepatitis A Scare?

<p><img alt="socialista.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103255im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/socialista.jpg" width="250" height="334" class="left">This past week things got stirred up at celebrity hotspot Socialista with a bit of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103255/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/21/socializing_at.php">a Hepatitis A scare</a>. Amongst the hundreds urged to get vaccinated were celebrities who attended actor Ashton Kutcher&#x2019;s 30th birthday party at the bar; those on the Hepatitis A-list included Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. </p>

<p>When health officials checked out the joint, they found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103255/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4330347&amp;page=1">no traces of soap</a>, meaning the infected bartender was handling garnishes and glasses to the patrons with unclean Hep hands! No word yet on which celebs are in for a bevy of un-stylish symptoms (yellowing of eyes and skin, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea) for the next month. </p>

<p>One patron, after getting vaccinated, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103255/http://www.wnbc.com/news/15389731/detail.html?dl=headlineclick">WNBC</a>, &#x201C;I just can&#x2019;t believe that in a restaurant as fancy as it was, that they would have this problem. It&#x2019;s kind of a pain in the butt to come out here and deal with this but you have to do it.&#x201D; Still, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103255/http://www.nypost.com/seven/02242008/news/regionalnews/90_hep_a_hotspot_shots_99065.htm">only around 90 of the reported 800</a> went in to get the city&apos;s free shot. </p>

<p>As patrons play the waiting game to see if their health will take a turn for the worst, Socialista will also be holding their breath to see if the club gets a bad rep for this. At least one regular told The Post &quot;It&apos;s so hard to get in there in the first place, then you finally make it in and this happens. It&apos;s not worth it.&quot; Another vowed never to return, saying &quot;It&apos;s pretty messed up. We should at least get a refund.&quot; Armin Armiri, who runs the club, says they plan to stay open and are concerned for their customers. </p>
