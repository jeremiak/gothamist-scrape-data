<p>Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s baby bump was put into questions recently after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081730/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/11/the_internet_wonders_if_beyonces_ba.php">this video</a> showed her belly going flat. The rumors eventually reached TMZ and ABC, forcing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081730/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/10/beyonces-baby-bump-blooper/">the singer to respond</a>, saying the rumor was &#x201C;Stupid, ridiculous and false.&#x201D; But perhaps her best response of all was unspoken, when she bared her belly in a bikini earlier this week (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081730/http://www.usmagazine.com/healthylifestyle/news/beyonce-bump-201169">see photos here</a>). </p>

<p>B didn&apos;t, however, respond to the allegations that she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081730/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/pretty_convincing_video_that_beyonc.php">stole dance moves</a> for her new &quot;Countdown&quot; video&#x2014;but who really cares, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081730/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/07/video_have_you_heard_beyonces_new_v.php">that video is amazing</a>!</p>
