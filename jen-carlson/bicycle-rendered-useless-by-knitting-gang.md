<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000721/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/20/magda_sayeg_knittaplease.php">Magda Sayed</a> and her team of merry knitters&#x2014;collectively known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000721/http://www.magdasayeg.com/home.html">Knitta Please</a>&#x2014;are back in the city. Over the past year they visited to add colorful, knitted adornments to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000721/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/knitta_please_hits_montague_street.php">Brooklyn Heights</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000721/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/10/knitta_hits_the_standard.php">Standard Hotel</a>. This time around they&apos;re getting even craftier, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000721/http://nycthe.tumblr.com/post/787944173/knitta-please-elizabeth-street-south-of-broome">NYC the Tumblr</a> spotted this knitted bicycle! </p>

<p>Sayed has allegedly been in town all week, if you spot some of her work, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000721/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us your photos</a> or tag them with &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr! This one was spotted on Elizabeth Street just south of Broome.</p>
