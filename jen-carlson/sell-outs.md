										<p>Just a reminder incase you didn&apos;t see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143123/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/archives/2004/06/30/sell_outs.php" target="_blank">this post</a> last month: Gothamist has missed far too many sold out shows to know that buying tickets ahead of time is imperative. In that vein, every month or so we&apos;ll make it a point to update you with a list of shows we think may sell out. This way you can buy tickets ahead of time and avoid that last minute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143123/http://newyork.craigslist.org/tix/" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> surfing.  </p>

<p>Here is a list that will get you through August (and a couple remainding in July), please post a comment if there are any shows we may have missed! </p>
