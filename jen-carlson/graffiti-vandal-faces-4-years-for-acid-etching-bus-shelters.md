According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107085940/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/02/18/2011-02-18_graffiti_artist_faces_prison_for_etching.html">the Daily News</a>, 19-year-old Brooklynite Alexander Thompson etched his tags (GEAR and G7) into a Queens bus shelter with acid and got a 42-count indictment. Yesterday&#x2014;when it was reported that vandalism was up last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107085940/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/grafitti_are_complaints_down_unless.php">in Queens</a>&#x2014;he was told he faces four years in prison for damaging 21 glass bus shelters in 2009 (racking up $5,100 in damages during that time).<p></p>

<p>Queens District Attorney Richard Brown declared, &quot;We will not allow such individuals to mar the beauty of our city&quot; (bus shelters <em>are</em> beautiful, after all), &quot;or threaten to return us to the days when our transit system and our highways and buildings were covered with graffiti.&quot; </p>

<p>He&apos;s likely referring to the &apos;80s, when the Vandal Squad, Mayor Koch and New York&apos;s finest were up against all those kids carrying spray cans&#x2014;check it out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107085940/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/31/video_of_the_da_106.php">in this video</a>.</p>
