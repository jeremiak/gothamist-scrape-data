<p>It took 40 years, but earlier today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027025525/http://gothamist.com/tags/sesamestreet">Sesame Street</a> was honored with their own corner of New York (64th and Broadway, to be exact). We&apos;re told, &quot;On the eve of the program&#x2019;s big birthday, a temporary street sign was unveiled and a Mayoral Proclamation bestowed by the City of New York, proclaiming November 10 Sesame Street Day.&#x201D; Do we get off for that?</p>

<p>The show&apos;s creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, said: &#x201C;Sesame Street reaches children around the world, but without a doubt, New York City is its home. It&#x2019;s wonderful for the city to recognize where it all began.&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027025525/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/06/happy_birthday_sesame_street.php">How will you celebrate</a>?</p>
