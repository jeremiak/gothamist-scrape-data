<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpxgfYjrAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230933im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpxgfYjrAM.jpg" width="229" height="300" class="image-right"> </span>Earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230933/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/09/send_us_your_snow_photos.php?gallery0Pic=7#gallery">we ran a photo</a> from the LIFE magazine archives showing the above snowy scene on 5th Avenue and 48th Street in 1947. In the background of the photo was something unusual: a house. Not a very old house for the time, either&#x2014;more like a brand new one you&apos;d see in the suburbs around then.</p>

<p>So what&apos;s the deal, right? We asked the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230933/http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2010/02/model-homes-and-dream-house-on-fifth.html">Inside the Apple</a> folks if they had some information about it, and it turns out they did! They report back: &quot;It is almost certainly a prefabricated five-room &apos;cottage&apos; put up by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230933/http://www.spence-chapin.org/">Spence-Chapin</a> Adoption Agency <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230933/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E13FA345E17738DDDA90A94DA415B8788F1D3">in December 1947</a>. According to the Times, the house&#x2014;valued at $12,000&#x2014;was to not only &apos;serve as headquarters for [the agency&apos;s] fund drive&apos; but also would be raffled off at the end of the campaign.&quot; A Times article described that intersection as &quot;Fifth Avenue&apos;s suburban corner...where country cottages are displayed for good causes.&quot;</p>

<p>By the next year the house you see was gone and a new one was built; this time in conjunction with the release of the film <em>Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House</em>, starring Cary Grant. In the story, Grant&apos;s character flees New York City to build his dream home&#x2014;but in real life, he got to have both... at least for marketing purposes. Before the film hit the big screen, General Electric and other manufacturers built nearly identical &quot;Dream Houses&quot; across the country (blueprint pictured)&#x2014;NYC&apos;s was on this corner. More information on the dream homes can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230933/http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=pf_output.cfm&amp;file_id=9031">here</a>.</p>
