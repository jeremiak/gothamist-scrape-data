title: Laird Hamilton Surfs the City
---

<p>Base to torch, Lady Liberty is approximately 70&apos; taller than most of the waves surfer Laird Hamilton rides; yesterday when he paddled around her he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150949/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080515/lf_nm_life/hamilton_pix_dc">declared</a>, &quot;The Statue of Liberty is pretty big. I&apos;m glad it didn&apos;t fall on me.&quot; </p>

<p>Hamilton was in town to launch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150949/http://business.transworld.net/2008/04/04/laird-hamilton-and-steve-barrys-launch-surf-skate-clothing-line/">his new clothing line</a>, Wonderwall, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150949/http://www.wcbs880.com/pages/2201124.php">a jaunt</a> around the Statue of Liberty. Even though he&apos;s used to riding the biggest waves in the world, we&apos;re guessing the Hudson River was terrifying on a whole new (dirty) level.</p>
