                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="posterboy0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131014083904im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/posterboy0110.jpg" width="200" height="280" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131014083904/http://gothamist.com/tags/posterboy">Poster Boy</a>, real name Henry Matyjewicz, is up to his old tricks again. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131014083904/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/subway_ad_slicer_cuts_loose_again_sVFbhZsN69Uj4SU505EGuJ">the NY Post</a>, while he <em>has</em> been making good on his community service after pleading guilty to defacing subway ads&#x2014;he&apos;s started up at his old tricks again! </p>

<p>Matyjewicz was arrested on January 22nd at 3:20 a.m. when a cop spotted him slicing up ads at the Jefferson Street L train station in Bushwick. He allegedly tried to sweet talk to officer saying it was his first time trying his hand at the mash-ups, but once his name was run through the system it was clear he was lying.</p>

<p>The paper also mentions that he was arrested for turnstile jumping in December, on the day he pleaded guilty to his defacing deeds. Currently the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office is aiming to get him sentenced to jail this time around. But that would be a shame, because those <em>Valentine&apos;s Day</em> subway ads are just <em>asking</em> to be messed with!</p>
