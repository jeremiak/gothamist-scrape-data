<p>A team of humans, including city planners, have designed a miniature city for cats, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103642/http://www.fluxfactory.org/projects/kitty-city/">Kitty City</a>. The <em>meowtropolis</em> will have its ribbon cut on June 1st, at which time tons of adoptable cats will take over (the event on Saturday runs noon to 6 p.m.).</p>

<p>The 1,700-square-foot cat city is more than an awesome way to get orphaned cats into forever homes, however. The city, which is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103642/http://www.fluxfactory.org/">Flux Factory</a> in Queens, was created in workshops over five weeks as a way to &quot;encourage shared decision-making power and challenge the way we think about the urban environment.&quot; It features buildings, thoroughfares, parks, water, transportation, and sanitation systems, housing, commercial and cultural districts, and a Museum of Natural Cat History!!!!</p>

<p>Next can we let cats take over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103642/http://www.queensmuseum.org/exhibitions/visitpanorama">the panorama</a>?</p>
