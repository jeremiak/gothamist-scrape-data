He finally sat in front of a judge this morning, prepared to fight for all our rights to imbibe outdoors. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173731/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/6/32_6_gk_kimber.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that &quot;the long-awaited trial will have to wait a few more days,&quot; after Judge Jerome Kay stepped down from the case. Kay says he followed press coverage and felt that by being familiar with story and the neighborhood (and the stoop itself) he &quot;would give the appearance that I could not be fair, pro or con.&quot; The case is allegedly going back to the bench next Tuesday, as judgment falls to the hands of another. What side will he or she fall on? Dun Dun Dun! A boozy borough waits with bated breath.</p>
