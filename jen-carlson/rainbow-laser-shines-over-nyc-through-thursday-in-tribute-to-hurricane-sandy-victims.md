<p>Did you see a rainbow laser in the sky last night? It was courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407125435/http://artproductionfund.org/">The Art Production Fund</a> and will be there through Thursday night. The laser, created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407125435/http://yvettemattern.com/">Yvette Mattern</a> and called &#x201C;Global Rainbow, After the Storm,&quot; is a tribute those affected by Hurricane Sandy, which coincides with a fundraising drive for Waves for Water and the New York Foundation for the Arts&#x2019;s Emergency Relief Fund.</p>

<p>The laser beams are oriented so they shine in the direction of the neighborhoods that were hardest hit by the storm in Brooklyn and Queens, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407125435/http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680979/a-35-mile-laser-rainbow-illuminates-new-york-as-a-memorial-to-sandys-victims?utm_source=twitter#1">FastCo</a> they are situated in the Standard Hotel on the High Line. The lights can be seen for 35 miles.</p>
