<p>Johnny Gallagher, Jr.&#x2014;who you may know as John Gallagher, Jr., or Jim Harper from <em>The Newsroom</em>, or Moritz Stiefel from &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;&#x2014;is about to drop his new album, <em>Six Day Hurricane</em>. This is Gallagher&apos;s debut album, and he&apos;ll be celebrating its release at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427041107/http://rockwoodmusichall.com/">Rockwood Music Hall</a> on Monday the 18th (tickets are sold out, but he&apos;ll be back in early February). Gallagher has a long history with Rockwood, and their recording arm will be releasing his album.</p>

<p>While you may have seen him strum a guitar a couple of times on <em>The Newsroom</em>, Gallagher&apos;s debut effort is different from anything he&apos;s done on screen or stage before. The nine tracks kick off with an Elvis-influenced burst and streamline into a country rock oeuvre best heard from a barstool.</p>

<p>Yesterday Gallagher, who recently moved to Brooklyn, gave us a little preview for our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427041107/http://gothamist.com/tags/gothamisthouse">Gothamist House series</a>&#x2014;give a listen.</p>
