<p>According to an internal email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103731/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/5763099/roseland-ballroom-historic-nyc-venue-closing-in-april-breaking">obtained by Billboard</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103731/http://gothamist.com/tags/roselandballroom">Roseland Ballroom</a> will be shutting its doors in April 2014. The venue opened in the 52nd Street spot in 1958, but they had been operating out of a different nearby space starting in 1919 after moving to NYC from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>While Billboard says the venue is &quot;a favored&quot; one by bands, it certainly hasn&apos;t always been for fans&#x2014;the sound, overpriced drinks, the overbearing security, and the always nightmarish egress were amongst its downsides. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103731/http://twitter.com/johndelsignore">John Del Signore</a> recalls the cattle chute that followed most concerts, with &quot;security yelling at you to leave immediately after the show to be squeezed into the long death march through the lobby and narrowing hallway to the doors.&quot; (They almost confiscated his drugs once, but he outwitted them.)</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear at this time <em>why</em> the venue is closing, but we&apos;ll update when we have more information. We&apos;ve reached out to LiveNation, who books the space, to confirm and for further comment.</p>
