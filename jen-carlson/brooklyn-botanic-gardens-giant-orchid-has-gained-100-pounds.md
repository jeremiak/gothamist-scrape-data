</div></div>					<p>Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140201/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/20/giant_orchid_blooms_at_the_bbg.php">that huge tiger orchid</a> (ahem, Grammatophyllum speciosum) that was taking over the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in 2008? It&apos;s still there, and our inside sources tell us that, despite this type of plant rarely blooming in captivity, it has gained a gorgeous 100 pounds! That puts it at around 300 pounds, and with a current diameter of 12 feet (the stems can reach 15 feet in length). </p>

<p>The BBG tells us a little more:</p><blockquote>In 2010, Aquatic House curator David Horak and other horticulture staff repotted the orchid, wrangling the 300-pound plant into a new wooden basket created by a BBG volunteer out of a rot-resistant tropical wood; the specimen&#x2019;s new vessel is one of many factors that likely contributed to this unprecedented bloom.</blockquote>The tiger orchid blooms only once every two to five years, and its blooms are expected to last through mid to late December. Click through for a preview, but go see this monster for yourself in the BBG&apos;s Robert W. Wilson Aquatic House in the Steinhardt Conservatory.<p></p>
