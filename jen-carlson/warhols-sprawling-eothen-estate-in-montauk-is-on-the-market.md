</div></div>					<p>The Rolling Stones spent some time there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111854/http://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?phrase=warhol%20montauk&amp;family=editorial&amp;sort=newest&amp;page=1&amp;excludenudity=false">in the 1970s</a>, as did John Lennon, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor. Before Andy Warhol bought it in 1971, this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111854/http://gothamist.com/tags/montauk">Montauk</a> compound&#x2014;called Eothen (meaning &quot;from the east&quot;)&#x2014;belonged to the Churches, better known as the Arm &amp; Hammer family. After the NY Times published an article on the place in 2006, called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111854/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/travel/escapes/08warhol.html">The Unsold Warhol</a>,&quot; J. Crew CEO Mickey Drexler scooped it up for $27 million. </p>

<p>Sadly, Drexler didn&apos;t keep things quite the same, and the property underwent extensive renovations, and now includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111854/http://artfcity.com/2015/06/24/j-crew-ceo-to-sell-andy-warhols-former-estate-with-confederate-flag/">a framed confederate flag</a>. Which you can burn in your beach bonfire. </p>

<p>The property, a historic 6 cottage beachfront compound, is back on the market&#x2014;it includes Carl Fisher-designed barns, acres of land, a swimming pool, a tennis court, sprawling views, sweet privacy, and a kitchen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111854/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/05/photo_chef_keith_richards_cooking_i.php">Keith Richards once cooked in</a>. </p>
