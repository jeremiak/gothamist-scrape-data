<p>For <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160421115455/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/arts/design/pride-prejudice-promotion-mr-darcy-rising.html">whatever reason</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160421115455/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jul/08/mr-darcy-statue-pride-and-prejudice">promo</a>), there&apos;s a giant sculpture of Colin Firth-as-Mr. Darcy in a lake in England right now, and it reminded us that we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160421115455/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/dear_giant_rubber_duck_please_come.php">never get anything cool</a> in our bodies of water (unless you count <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160421115455/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">gonohorrea</a> or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160421115455/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/that_time_central_park_had_an_iroqu.php">misguided publicity stunt</a>). So, we&apos;ve taken the liberty of placing the romantic hero in the East River, blocking the view of the horrendous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160421115455/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/18/verizon.php">Verizon Building</a>&#x2014;please feel free to place him in Central Park, the Gowanus, your bathtub, or wherever your heart desires:</p>

<p>Our in-house Jane Austen scholar, Jen Chung, would now like to point out that the miniseries lake scene being portrayed here &quot;ruins the moment (WHICH IS NOT IN THE BOOK). You need to point out only Colin Firth does this&#x2014;Matthew McFayden doesn&apos;t, and Lawrence Olivier sure as hell never did. Sending you a photo of the passage from <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em>... nothing about wet shirt.&quot;</p>

<p>But, still... <em>swoooon</em>:</p>
