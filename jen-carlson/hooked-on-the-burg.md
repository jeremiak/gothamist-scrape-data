										<p><img alt="2006_07_arts_burgep.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195753im_/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/tien/2006_07_arts_burgep.jpg" width="250" height="190" align="right" hspace="5">We honestly didn&#x2019;t expect to love internet sitcom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195753/http://www.theburg.tv/">The Burg</a> as much as we do. &#x201C;Making fun of hipsters&#x2026;<em>so</em> original,&#x201D; we thought. But you know what, it&#x2019;s a really good show, and it &#x201C;works&#x201D; somehow. With music by local bands playing in the background, the show is a great snapshot of Brooklyn (even if it&#x2019;s a small, hilarious, thumbnail photo). </p>

<p>The latest episode (the third one so far) is up now and has the characters dealing with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195753/http://theburg.tv/blog/2006/07/28/bar/">finding a new cool bar</a>. By bringing beer to offices, bathrooms, gyms they set up makeshift bars (until, of course, the &#x201C;bar&#x201D; becomes too popular, then they move on). The last we see them they&#x2019;re at &#x201C;Temple on Wythe&#x201D;. </p>

<p>We want to see the cast deal with the McCarren Park Pool &#x201C;situation&#x201D; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195753/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/07/31/mccarren_park_p.php">beer lines</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195753/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/05/25/mccarren.php">Live Nation</a>, etc). Spring would certainly have strong opinions on the whole Clear Channel thing. As would our favorite character, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195753/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=68414071">Jed</a>. (We would add him as a MySpace friend, but we&#x2019;re not sure if it&#x2019;s cool or not to add fake people.) </p>
