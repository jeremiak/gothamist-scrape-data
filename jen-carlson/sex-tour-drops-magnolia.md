In case you forgot, this is where&#x2014;while eating a cupcake outside&#x2014;Carrie first tells Miranda about Aidan. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174706/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5CJAXZxJXA">Relive the magic</a>.)</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174706/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704032704575269072386452544.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal</a>, the shop couldn&apos;t fulfill the needs of the tour&#x2014;the On Location Tours rep told the paper, &quot;It was an issue of supply and demand.&quot; The tourists are now given sweets from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174706/http://www.billysbakerynyc.com/">Billy&apos;s Bakery</a>, and the bus stops along Bleecker so fanatics are welcome to make a dash to Magnolia for a photo opp.</p>

<p>Magnolia owner Steve Abrams didn&apos;t acknowledge Billy&apos;s, saying, &quot;We don&apos;t know where they get them. But wherever it is from,<strong> they are obviously not providing an authentic experience to their customers.</strong>&quot; His store has since released a &quot;Carrie&quot; cupcake, which is vanilla cake with pink buttercream icing and a sugar daisy.</p>
