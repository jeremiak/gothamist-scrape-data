					<p>In the February 1959 issue of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152219/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_(magazine)"><em>Holiday</em> magazine</a>, an essay on Truman Capote&#x2014;titled &quot;A House In The Heights&quot;&#x2014;begins with his now-famous quote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152219/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/25/brooklyn_heights_residents_offended.php">that&apos;s plastered around</a> his old neighborhood: &quot;I live in Brooklyn. By choice.&quot; </p>

<p>His Brooklyn Heights neighborhood has transformed a great deal since Capote lived there in the 1950s. His old home (which he didn&apos;t own, though that didn&apos;t stop him from claiming otherwise) at 70 Willow Street is now undergoing a massive renovation by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152219/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/21/truman_capotes_brooklyn_heights_hom.php">its current owner</a>, who has already stripped the classic yellow paint from its facade. The once-quiet streets now see a steady stream of tourists toting selfie sticks. And the old abandoned piers on the waterfront are now part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152219/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynbridgepark">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a>, and house soccer fields, basketball courts, and other amusements.</p>

<p>Two years ago the son of photographer David Attie, who shot the photographs for the <em>Hoilday</em> magazine piece, unearthed some of his dad&apos;s old negatives. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152219/http://blog.mediander.com/truman-capotes-love-letter-to-brooklyn/">Mediander blog</a> noted there were 800, to be exact, located in a manilla envelope marked &quot;Holiday, Capote.&quot; Eli Attie gathered them all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152219/https://www.amazon.com/Brooklyn-Personal-Memoir-photographs-David/dp/1936941112">for a book</a>, in the forward to which he wrote: &#x201C;These were the coolest pictures of Capote I&#x2019;d ever seen, framed like shots from a Hitchcock movie. The still young, steely-eyed scribe looks like he&#x2019;s creating his own mythology right in front of the camera.&quot; This morning Eli told us of his favorite: &quot;That shot of Capote beneath the stairs&#x2014;my jaw just hit the floor.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to describe his feelings about discovering the images: &quot;Weirdly, even though these photos were taken years before I was born, and before my parents had even met, it was like discovering some hidden little secret about my own past.  Despite the fact that I&apos;d never known these photos existed, they immediately felt very personal to me, like the results of some kind of artistic DNA test.&quot;</p>

<p>The photos are all outtakes for Capote&apos;s Brooklyn piece for <em>Holiday</em>&#x2014;meant to give a sense of life in Brooklyn&#x2014;which Attie was asked to visually document. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152219/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/arts/design/a-sons-sleuthing-a-fathers-archive-and-capotes-vanished-brooklyn.html?_r=0">The NY Times</a> recently described that shoot: &quot;In the spring of 1958 a young photographer named David Attie was led through the streets of Brooklyn Heights and to the Brooklyn waterfront by an unexpected guide&#x2014;33-year-old Truman Capote.&quot;</p>

<p>Part of Eli Attie&apos;s finds are now on display at the Brooklyn Historical Society, following decades of being buried in boxes. You&apos;ll get to see Capote&apos;s Brooklyn Heights in them, one that doesn&apos;t exist anymore.</p>
