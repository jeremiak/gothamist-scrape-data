<p>This one time in 2006 this guy tried to get me to enter into a threesome with him and another woman at Motor City Bar, who ended up being a hooker (&quot;That guy next to that lady is staring at us and hasn&apos;t talked this entire time and I think he may be her pimp,&quot; I told my friend). The hooker was also trying to make some extra money by selling us coke, which I learned from her during a run-in in the bathroom. I also learned during this bathroom break that she was a transvestite. This is the Lower East Side that&apos;s currently dying, some may argue, and now one hub of such seedy activity, cheap drinks, and dirty vibes is shutting its doors: according to rumors and reports, Motor City Bar will close as early as next month.</p>

<p>A tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120119/http://evgrieve.com/2013/02/reader-report-motor-city-bar-is-closing.html">told EV Grieve</a> that &quot;the lease is up at the end of the month for the rock-and-roll flavored bar at 127 Ludlow Street... the bar is expected to close at some point between March and June.&quot; Motor City Bar has been at that spot for 18 years. A call placed to the bar today went straight to voicemail.</p>

<p>Earlier today word got out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120119/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/les_mainstay_pink_pony_closes_forev.php">Pink Pony has closed</a>, forever. And in the past month the Living Room has announced its closure as well, though they are likely just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120119/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/29/pianos_expanding_the_living_room_mo.php">relocating to a new space</a>.</p>
