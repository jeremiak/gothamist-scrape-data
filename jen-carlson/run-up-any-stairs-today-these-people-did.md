</div></div>					<p>Earlier today we walked up a total of 40 subway stairs (with a 45 minute break/train ride in the middle) and no one gave us a medal upon completion. Meanwhile, over at the Empire State Building, 400 runners conquered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140318095244/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/31/crazy_in_shape_people_to_run_up_emp.php">1,576 stairs</a> and when <em>they</em> were done they got medals and their photos taken. Thomas Dold of Germany ran up all the stairs in the shortest amount of time, 10 minutes and 10 seconds. Not bad Thomas, but you still didn&apos;t beat the 2003 record of 9 minutes and 33 seconds! </p>

<p>Former Met Darryl Strawberry even took part, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140318095244/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/133173/runners-scale-esb-stairs-for-good-cause">NY1</a>, but his finish time hasn&apos;t been printed anywhere, and there&apos;s no photographic evidence to be found!</p>
