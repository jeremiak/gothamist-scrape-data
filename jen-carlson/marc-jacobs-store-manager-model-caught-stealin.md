<p>It appears no one was the wiser at the 385 Bleecker Street shop, as other employees there stated, &quot;We&apos;ve all been wondering where he went . . . He was a good manager.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Avila, he admitted to the crime saying he&apos;d &quot;been doing it for a while,&quot; after another manager at the store noticed some missing money and reported when he failed to return it. He&apos;s now being chargd with grand larceny and is held on a $2,000 cash bail which he has failed to post. </p>
