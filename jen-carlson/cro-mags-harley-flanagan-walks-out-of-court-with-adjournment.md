<p>In July <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224195732/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/06/two_stabbed_during_cbgb_fest_show_a.php">word of a stabbing</a> at Webster Hall quickly spread during the first ever CBGB Festival, and it turned out that the assailant was former Cro-Mags bassist Harley Flanagan. Word was that Flanagan stabbed Mike &quot;The Gook&quot; Couls, the current Cro-Mags bassist, during a show the band was playing at. A witness told them, &quot;Flanagan was acting weird right before the incident... Next thing I know he&apos;s in the VIP area stabbing people!&apos;&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224195732/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/13/cro-mags_harley_flanagan_talks.php">Flanagan later said</a> he was defending his own life.</p>

<p>The NYPD had determined that Flanagan had a 5&quot; knife with which he slashed Couls twice (he also bit him on the arm), and slashed Berardo once on the left eye.</p>

<p>This morning Flanagan had his day in court, and it was much less dramatic. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224195732/http://www.nynatives.com/content/harley-flanagan-webster-hall-attack-adjourned">NY Natives</a> reports that he walked out of 100 Centre Street with an adjournment, noting, &quot;There will be no further action on the matter until December 5, 2012.&quot; Stay tuned...</p>
