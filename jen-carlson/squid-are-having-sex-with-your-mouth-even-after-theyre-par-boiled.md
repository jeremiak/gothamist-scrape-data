<p>Last night Neil Gaiman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501160646/https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/213444127357026304">Tweeted a link</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501160646/http://www.science20.com/squid_day/squid_your_plate_could_inseminate_your_mouth-91085">this article</a>, noting, &quot;Is there a polite way to warn people that cooked squid can still have sex with their mouths? Probably not.&quot;  The article itself, titled &quot;That Squid On Your Plate Could Inseminate Your Mouth,&quot; refers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501160646/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21834723">a study</a> about a woman eating squid and experiencing &quot;severe pain&quot; and a &quot;pricking, foreign-body sensation&quot; in her mouth. When she went to the doctor, he removed &quot;twelve small, white spindle-shaped, bug-like organisms,&quot; aka SPERM BAGS.</p>

<p>The sperm bags, or &quot;spermatophore,&quot; contain an ejaculatory apparatus, which expels sperm mass forcefully into, in this case, your mouth. This can happen with raw squid, obviously, but shockingly it can also happen with a cooked squid... or at least parboiled. (And yes, there are places that serve raw squid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501160646/http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=raw+squid&amp;find_loc=new+york%2C+ny&amp;ns=1#find_desc=%22raw+squid%22">right in this very city</a>.)</p>

<p>In typical Western squid prep, the internal organs are removed, and the muscle is the only thing served, so there&apos;s no worry of the cephalopods getting &quot;frisky&quot; with you. Though it&apos;s unclear if this can happen to those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501160646/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/04/live_octopus.php">eating live octopus</a>.</p>

<p>At press time, it&apos;s also unclear if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501160646/http://gothamist.com/tags/doordine">Do or Dine</a>&apos;s Justin Warner was orally violated by this squid:</p>
