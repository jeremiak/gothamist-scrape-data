<p>The landmarked building that formerly housed Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133213/http://www.venueview.com/gage_tollner/files/panel_02b.htm">Gage &amp; Tollner</a> gets to travel back in time today. It was one of the longest running restaurants in New York, with its location at 372 Fulton Street keeping its doors open from 1892 to 2004 (it opened at 303 Fulton Street in 1879). The space has been empty since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133213/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/13/arbys.php">controversial Arby&apos;s</a> fast food joint <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133213/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/arbys_4.php">moved out</a> (less than half a year after moving in); before that the space housed a TGIFriday&apos;s. But things are about to change, at least temporarily... according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133213/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2011/02/23/thursday-feb-24-filming-locations-in-los-angeles-new-york-atlanta-and-more-including-spider-man-new-years-eve-and-joyful-noise/">this location schedule</a>, <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> will be filming there today. </p>

<p>Back in the day, the restaurant attracted the likes of Mae West, Diamond Jim Brady, and Jimmy Durante. The restaurant even has some ties to the mafia, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133213/http://lostnewyorkcity.blogspot.com/2008/02/mob-hangout-like-marco-polo-really-mob.html">Lost City</a>, &quot;the grand old eatery Gage &amp; Tollner was once owned by a Goodfella!&#x2014;Joe &apos;Marco Polo&apos; Chirico possessed the property for the few years before the place went under.&quot; Which may explain this mafia luncheon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133213/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/25/nyregion/testimony-cites-steven-seagal-and-seafood-not-a-shakedown.html?ref=juliusrnasso">Steven Seagal</a> attended in 2001.</p>

<p>Since <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> features corrupt politicians, mobsters, and even the common folk during the Prohibition period, it&apos;s likely Gage &amp; Tollner is about to become a nice little speakeasy. And finally, we can exorcise the ghosts of past curly fries.</p>
