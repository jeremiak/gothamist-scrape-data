Their crime? Weapons possession, attempted assault, menacing and harassment.</p>

<p>Late last month the friends were out in a snowstorm and hit officer Adonis Ramirez, who was not in uniform at the time. According to the teens, Ramirez then pulled a gun, and 19-year-old Christian Perez tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505161816/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/03/10/2010-03-10_this_has_snowballed_outta_control__pals_busted_for_beaning_cop_with_snow.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;I thought he was some drug dealer who was going to shoot me in the head and walk away. We only hit him once, and it was by mistake.&quot; They nearly got laughed out of Central Booking when they said they were in there for a snowball.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ramirez claims he was struck with <em>several</em> snowballs as he was walking to his car; he also says the group was taunting him. They allegedly called him a &quot;bitch&quot; and said &quot;Let&apos;s jump him.&quot; Somewhere between pulling his gun out and having them arrested, he called 911 for backup.</p>

<p>While the Bronx district attorney doesn&apos;t plan to drop charges, the friends are preparing to slap the city with a $10 million suit. Their lawyer says, &quot;You would think that the NYPD would focus on real crimes and not on young men playing in the snow during a nor&apos;easter.&quot;</p>
