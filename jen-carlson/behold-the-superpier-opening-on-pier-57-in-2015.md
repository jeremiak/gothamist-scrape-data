<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516000904/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/11/pier_57.php">been a while</a> since we last heard about any movement on the Pier 57 front, but today Youngwoo &amp; Associates (the firm developing the pier) announced that it will henceforth be known as: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516000904/http://www.superpier.com/">SUPERPIER</a>. The Sharknado of piers. The Cloverfield of developments. The pier to pier all piers.</p>

<p>SuperPier is located at West 15th Street in Hudson River Park, and will feature a new Riverfront Spa and Beach Club from Andre Balazs (he of The Standard and Chateau Marmont). Other major anchors will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516000904/http://www.brooklynboulders.com/">Brooklyn Boulders</a>, who will bring climbing <em>without harnesses</em> to the adventurous patrons of SuperPier; and Opening Ceremony, who will have a multi-level retail store in repurposed shipping containers. Are you getting the vibe yet? Young Woo says they are building a &quot;powerhouse for creative people.&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
Expect SuperPier&#x2014;which will also house restaurants, film, art, and more&#x2014;to open in the Spring of 2015, when the renovation of the 12 acres of raw space is complete. And stay tuned for more on the historical inspiration behind SuperPier, a name that comes to us from 1952!</p>
