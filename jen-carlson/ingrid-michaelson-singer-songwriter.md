Last year one of her songs was featured in the season finale of Grey&apos;s Anatomy (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103124/http://youtube.com/watch?v=sSRdGe_-WFo">video</a>), only to be followed by another one of her songs being picked up for an Old Navy ad (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103124/http://youtube.com/watch?v=gaQr-4AZojc">video</a>). Needless to say she went from getting write-ups in the Staten Island Advance, to getting them in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521103124/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/nyregion/18singer.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">the NY Times</a>. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>With plans to leave the Island to further conquer the world, she plays a sold out show at Webster Hall this Friday. We recently asked her some questions...and found out she&apos;s a fan of brevity.</em></p>

<p><strong>Last year your songs were heard on both an Old Navy commercial and an episode of Grey&apos;s Anatomy, which came first?</strong><br>
Grey&apos;s came first. A music supervisor found me.</p>

<p><strong>How were you approached by both outlets?</strong><br>
On MySpace.</p>

<p><strong>How long were you making music before all of this happened?</strong><br>
About 4 years. I was doing theatre before then.</p>

<p><strong>What clubs were you playing in New York before taking the stage as headliner at places like the Bowery Ballroom?</strong><br>
The Knitting Factory, The Bitter End, Rockwood Music Hall, CBGBs.</p>

<p><strong>What is the music scene like on Staten Island?</strong><br>
Small but very supportive.  All genres.</p>

<p><strong>How has the community there embraced you since your success?</strong><br>
I get write ups in the local paper (the Staten Island Advance) a lot!</p>

<p><strong>Do you think you&apos;ll stay on Staten Island?</strong><br>
I plan on moving to Brooklyn so I am still near my family.</p>
