Did you know that in Brooklyn Heights, there&apos;s a fake brownstone leading into the underground? They report that the three-story building &quot;looks like any other on the cobblestone block, but it isn&#x2019;t. It leads directly down to the nation&#x2019;s largest subway system. If you opened the door [to exit], you would find yourself on a stoop, which is just part of the fa&#xE7;ade.&quot; (Kind of like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093055/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/10/sesame_street_1.php?gallery0Pic=1#gallery">Sesame Street</a>?) The Heights in particular is home to many secret exits, unknown to most except for some locals. If you want to find the brownstone, it&apos;s the one armed with silent alarms, motion detectors and other hidden security. Better stick to the regular way out. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093055/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/04/13/brooklyn_heights_townhouse_is_actually_a_decoy.php">Curbed</a> threatens our city&apos;s security by posting photos of the decoy brownstone!</p>
