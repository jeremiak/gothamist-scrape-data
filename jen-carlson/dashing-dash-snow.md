Cell phone and email-less, the only way to get in touch with him is to yell from the street below his Bowery apartment. &quot;Lorax-like, he won&#x2019;t come to the window to let you see that he sees you: He has a periscope he puts up so he can check you out first.&quot; If that fails, you could get in touch with one of his best friends, Dan Colen and Ryan McGinley, who have helped perpetuate the myth behind the man.</p>

<p>McGinley took a photo of him called &quot;Dash Bombing&quot; which was part of a show at the Whitney. It shows &quot;Snow out on a ledge, tagging a building in the night sky, Manhattan spread out below him. It&#x2019;s an image of anarchic freedom, one that seems anachronistic and almost magical in this city of hermetically sealed glass-cocoon condo towers. It&#x2019;s as if Snow were an animal&#x2014;prevalent in the seventies, now thought to be extinct&#x2014;that was spotted high over the city.&quot; A pretty good description of the 25 year old. But by far, the best part of this article describes a scene from a hotel room on Piccadilly when the two were in London for a show:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They had to flee it in the middle of the night with their suitcases before it was discovered that they&#x2019;d created one of their Hamster&#x2019;s Nests, which they&#x2019;ve done quite a few times before. To make a Hamster&#x2019;s Nest, Snow and Colen shred up 30 to 50 phone books, yank around all the blankets and drapes, turn on the taps, take off their clothes, and do drugs&#x2014;mushrooms, coke, ecstasy&#x2014;until they <em>feel</em> like hamsters.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>We&apos;re speechless (just like hamsters). But like it or not (and we kinda like it), Snow is an integral part of Downtown New York, as much as he is a part of the art scene. Check out this piece he wrote for his downtowny friends at Paper magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525054701/http://www.papermag.com/?section=article&amp;parid=1002">in 2005</a>. It&apos;s  accompanied by photos he took with, &quot;a camera that I made of wood, palm leaves and cocaine. It takes film, which I make myself as well, and it works wonders.&quot; </p>

<p>Not exactly something you&apos;d expect from a kid who&apos;s family includes a brother named Maxwell who dated an Olsen twin and a mother who has charged the highest rent ever for a Hamptons home ($750,000 a season). But of this part of his family, he says he is cut off, or more accurately, &#x201C;Cut off. Scumbags.&#x201D; But according to McGinley, his art world grandmother &quot;is the best...She&#x2019;s always taking care of us...Getting us drunk.&#x201D; And when Snow says he doesn&apos;t really talk to his dad, McGinley chimes in, &#x201C;You do talk to your dad! We&#x2019;ve all hung out with your dad!&#x201D; So the confusion behind Snow continues, it seems, and we also kinda like that. More on the whole scene at New York Magazine&apos;s current &quot;Warhol&apos;s Children&quot; issue. We shredded ours to make a Hamster Nest, see you in four days.</p>
