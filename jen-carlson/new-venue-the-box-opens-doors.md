As previously reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308112240/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/10/27/venues_they_are.php">in the New York Times article</a>, now more information comes to us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308112240/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/11/tonights_queens_of_the_stone_age_show_is_atnew_nyc_venue_the_box.html">via BrooklynVegan</a>, who reports that the first show will be there tonight (a Zune-sponsored event featuring Queens of the Stone Age).</p>

<p>The NYT&apos;s article (which you can still read online <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308112240/http://www.wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?t=11219">here</a>) stated that &quot;another new Lower East Side club on the horizon is the Box, a 5,000-square-foot room on Christie Street whose owner, Simon Hammerstein &#x2014; a grandson of Oscar &#x2014; said he intended to open in the next two months with theater and music performances. Booking agents say it will be a likely competitor to Joe&#x2019;s Pub, the stylish cabaret at the Public Theater.&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds like the place will be pretty amazing. And this is from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308112240/http://www.theboxnyc.com/">their website</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Box is located at 189 Chrystie Street, a 1935 two-story brick building between Stanton and Rivington Streets, with a stage door on Freeman Alley. One hundred years ago, this area was legendary for its vaudeville palaces, theaters and dime museums; THE BOX will bring the excitement and energy of those concert saloons and burlesque halls back to the neighborhood.

<p>The Box is an intimate restaurant and theater, with two bars and a stage.  A flexible design and top-notch sound system allow us to present all types of live entertainment: bands, shows, parties, private functions, and special events.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The multi-functional venue will also put on the first production of Jack Kerouac&apos;s &quot;Beat Generation&quot;, the play he wrote in 1957 after &quot;On the Road&quot; came out. No casting has been announced yet, but look for it in early 2007. </p>
