</div></div>					<p>Last night photographer Katie Sokoler dropped by the High Line to grab us some shots of the newly-opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100722/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">Phase II</a> <em>after dark</em>. She reported back today, saying, &quot;Since there&apos;s a lawn now, it&apos;s just full of couples making out and rolling around. I zoomed in on this shot and saw this girl totally grabbing onto this guys crotch with all these people around!&quot; Is the lawn destined to become the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100722/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/28/even_platos_retreat_sex_club_had_ru.php">Plato&apos;s Retreat</a>, and more importantly: is there a way to sanitize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100722/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/27/barefoot_in_the.php">the grass</a> each day, or maybe cover it in latex?</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more G-rated shots of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100722/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">the park</a> after dark, and check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100722/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/10/high_line_park_in_photos_night_move.php?gallery0Pic=7">Sokoler&apos;s gorgeous night shots</a> from High Line Phase I.</p>
