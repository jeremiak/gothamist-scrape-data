<p>The new J.J. Abrams movie which is still listed as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122021928/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277/">Untitled</a>, but is unofficially being referred to as <em>Cloverfield</em>, was filming on the Lower East Side yesterday and last night. Did anyone catch it? The monster movie is due out January 18th, 2008 - and this past week Abrams spoke of the somewhat mysterious project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122021928/http://movies.ign.com/articles/808/808901p1.html">at Comic-Con</a>. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I just want to say I want a monster movie. I want a great monster movie. I&apos;ve wanted a monster movie for so long, and I was in Japan a year ago with my son who is eight, and all he wanted to do was go to toy stores - so I know he&apos;s my son. And we went to the store and there were still all of these Godzillas, and I thought we need our own monster. We need a monster movie - not like King Kong. I love King Kong - King Kong is adorable - and Godzilla is a charming monster, but I wanted something that was just insane and intense.

<p>&quot;So we decided to make this movie and we&apos;re making it for you now, and it&apos;s almost done shooting,&quot; Abrams continued. &quot;I watch dailies and I&apos;m more excited about the movie itself than the trailer, which has gotten an amazing response and I can&apos;t thank you enough.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The trailer was first seen before the <em>Transformers</em> movie in early July, and due to it&apos;s Blair Witch-like quality and the secretiveness surrounding it - fans have been worked into a frenzy! Abrams promised at Comic-Con that over the next six months a &quot;real trailer,&quot; poster and more footage would be released, along with the title. For now, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122021928/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/33332">some websites</a> cracking clues, and the official site is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122021928/http://www.1-18-08.com/">www.1-18-08.com</a>. The main characters also have MySpace pages, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122021928/http://www.myspace.com/robbyhawkins">here&apos;s one</a> (check his &quot;Top 8&quot; for the others). </p>

<p>You can watch the trailer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122021928/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzfNQkwwT3c">here</a>.
