According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184254/http://www.sogoodblog.com/2012/02/16/doritos-locos-tacos-debuting-1201-march-8th/">reports</a> coming directly from inside the Taco Bell headquarters, the Doritos Locos Taco will be available nationwide starting at 12:01 a.m. March 8th. Which is the perfect time considering a lot of bad decisions and alcohol will have to lead up to procuring one of these.
