<p>Late yesterday afternoon, a man decided to take a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173638/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike</a> across the Brooklyn Bridge automobile level, operating on a level of terrifying stupidity. Our tipster AB Moss was riding on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173638/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/13/rites_of_spring_brooklyn_bridge_bik.php">pedestrian level</a> when he passed the man, alerting him that he was Doing It Wrong&#x2014;the man responded, &quot;I noticed.&quot; After some cars fly by him he gets some help from pedestrians above, who lift him and the bike to safety, like angels.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time this has happened&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173638/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/27/photo_citi_bike_rider_takes_the_bro.php">in June</a>, a woman made it all the way across the bridge on a Citi Bike, though she was biking at &quot;the least deadly time.&quot;</p>
