<p>The part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210151958/http://gothamist.com/tags/jdsalinger">J.D. Salinger</a> has been cast for an upcoming film about the author, titled <em>Rebel in the Rye</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210151958/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396558/">Nicholas Hoult</a> will star in the biopic, which was written by its director Danny Strong, and will focus on Salinger&apos;s younger years, leading up to his breakthrough novel <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>. You know, when Salinger was less of a recluse and more of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210151958/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/14/salingers_former_date_kisses_tells.php">a ladies&apos; man</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210151958/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/nicholas-hoult-to-play-author-jd-salinger-in-rebel-in-the-rye-1201581935/">Variety reports</a> that the script was adapted from the Kenneth Slawenski biography <em>JD Salinger: A Life</em>. </p>

<blockquote>The story will explore his rebellious youth, the bloody front lines of World War 2, enduring great love and terrible loss, a life of rejection to the pages of <em>The New Yorker</em> and his writer&#x2019;s block&#x2014;which led to a spiritual awakening.</blockquote>

<p>Upon the biography&apos;s release, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210151958/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/books/11salinger.html">the NY Times</a> called it &quot;evocative,&quot; but added that it&apos;s &quot;flawed&quot;&#x2014;&quot;It draws liberally from Salinger&#x2019;s letters and a memoir by his daughter, Margaret, is flawed by a tendency to assume direct correspondences between the author&#x2019;s life and work.&quot;</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Hoult was in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> and has appeared in a number of <em>X-Men</em> movies. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210151958/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834960/">Strong</a> is possibly best known as being the creator of the TV series <em>Empire</em>, though has also worked on <em>The Hunger Games</em> and <em>The Butler</em>.</p>
