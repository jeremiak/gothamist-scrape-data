It could have been MTA worker Michael Martin sneaking away from his duties to write down the latest line in his screenplay (or for the latest screenplay he was hired to write, <em>New Jack City 2</em>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308055139/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=9&amp;aid=82758">NY1</a> reports on Martin&apos;s rise from the underground to the mainstream.</p><blockquote>Martin was a subway conductor, and after totaling his car in an accident, entered a screen-writing competition, hoping to win enough money to buy a new one.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I wasn&apos;t trying actually to break into Hollywood,&quot; said Martin. &quot;I mean, it&apos;s weird to say. I was really just trying to win a car.&quot;</p>

<p>As it turned out, Martin did not win that competition, but he won something better -- the attention of a Hollywood producer, who began shopping his script.</p></blockquote>His screenplay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308055139/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210042"><em>Brooklyn&apos;s Finest</em></a>, is a drama that delves into the lives of some of the borough&apos;s police department, and is currently making its way to the big screen. The cast includes Don Cheadle, Richard Gere and Ethan Hawke and is being directed by Antoine Fuqua. As for Martin, the Brooklynite only recently left his transit job to focus more on his blossoming screenwriting career, though he credits his former duties to giving his creative voice authenticity, saying, &quot;When you see the movie, any angry insults that people throw out, I heard it, being a conductor.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The movie is being filmed in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, one location being the Van Dyke Houses in Brownsville, close by to where Martin grew up. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308055139/http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20080327/120663275700.html">Yahoo Movies</a> reported on the writer earlier this year, saying that he had moved out to L.A. but became homesick for New York. Upon returning to his roots, he has been awarding neighborhood kids equipment they can use to make their own movies. </p>

<p>Hopefully there will be a subway ad campaign for this one when it comes out!</p>
