										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpofvubsAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312050550im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpofvubsAM.jpg" width="265" height="300" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312050550/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/20/lou_reed_1.php">Earlier this year</a> Lou Reed ranted and raved over the proposed $346 million Sanitation Department facility on Spring Street. Now it&apos;s <em>Mad Men</em>&apos;s John Slattery (aka Roger Sterling) who is, well, mad over the city&apos;s plan, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312050550/http://www.nydailynews.com/real_estate/2009/10/11/2009-10-11_untitled__2mad11m.html">the Daily News</a> notes &quot;would consolidate three sanitation districts, open up park space elsewhere, get trucks off the street into a garage and provide direct access to the West Side Highway.&quot;</p>

<p>But the common man&apos;s garbage in the backyard of celebrity homes?! (Reed and Slattery are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312050550/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/03/18/tower_o_garbage.php">joined by</a> Laurie Anderson, Michael Stipe, James Gandolfini, Kirsten Dunst, Casey Affleck, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly.) Slattery supports a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312050550/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/07/10/revised_hudson_rise_challenges_garbage_garage_anew.php">new design</a> by local architect Stas Zakrzewski, which is allegedly less of an eyesore and would cut the plan down to house only two districts; Slattery says it is environmentally smarter and could bring the pricetag down by $32 million to $72 million. </p>

<p>While he didn&apos;t mention if he was a part of the lawsuit against the city, he told the paper why he&apos;s speaking out against the facility, saying: &quot;There are a lot of families in the neighborhood, and they haven&apos;t been taken into account in the designing of this facility. The air quality, the traffic, the noise [are all] going to be affected. There are people who have been living here for years. It&apos;s not a bunch of wealthy people who are just complaining that their views are going to be blocked. It&apos;s the actual livability of the neighborhood.&quot;</p>
