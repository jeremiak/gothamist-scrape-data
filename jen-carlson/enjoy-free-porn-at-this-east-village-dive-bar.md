<p>Last Friday we (yes, we, as in all of the Gothamist editorial team) found ourselves at the Double Down Saloon for a few after work refreshments... though not one of us braved the $4 cups of &quot;Ass Juice&quot; that the East Village mainstay is probably best known for. While there, not only did we observe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221116/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/13/google_glasses_spotted_in_the_east.php">a patron donning Google Glasses</a>, we also saw an amazingly diverse collection of pornography screening on several television screens. There was little person porn, animated porn, classic old school porn, porn with plotlines... all running on a smutty, infinite loop. </p>

<p>The added value of free porn is not a new thing; Double Down has been doing this for many years&#x2014;it used to be projected on the wall, and sometime around 2011 they dabbled with the horrifying nightmare fuel that is clown porn. But as they&apos;ve fine tuned and curated their on-screen collection, 5 out of 5 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221116/http://www.yelp.com/biz/double-down-saloon-new-york">Yelpers agree</a>: the porn is awesome...</p><ul><li>&quot;Double Down made me remember how much I love 80s porn. Those blondes with the big oversprayed hair and the gripping storylines from a time when things were simpler.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;The porn was strong on the next visit. Full blow jobs, money shots, Grand Ma action, and hentai.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Loved the porn.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;The porn is awesome!&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;The porn that was on while I was in there was actually pretty good.&quot;</li></ul>As one Yelper points out, this is one way to keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221116/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/02/babies_in_brooklyn_bars_makes_it_to.php">babies out of bars</a>. And now you know where to go if things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221116/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/video_nyers_still_enjoying_constitu.php">ever get weird at your local library branch</a>.<p></p>
