<p>This morning U2 headed up to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232330/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/27/u2_to_rock_fordham_u.php">Fordham University</a> to wake up the faculty and students with a relatively small, and very early concert. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232330/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/u2-sneaks-into-fordham-and-fans-follow/?apage=1">CityRoom</a> reports that security was tight, but five hairdressers from Michigan managed to smooth talk their way in. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232330/http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=7021274">ABC News</a> has a video of the anticipation leading up to the 5-song set, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232330/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10yjNn315rI">aired live on GMA</a>. If these kids seem a little too excited to hear all the new tunes, remember they were born during the Achtung Baby/Zooropa era, just as the band&apos;s frontman turned spectacle and began donning rockstar sunglasses everywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232330/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03062009/entertainment/u2_rock_out_at_fordham_158326.htm">The NY Post</a> reports back with some video, and notes that Bono told the audience of eager students: &quot;We formed a rock &apos;n&apos; roll band so we could get out of college. Maybe if it looked like this, or felt like this, things could&apos;ve been different.&quot; And with that, U2apalooza is <em>nearly</em> over. Tonight they&apos;ll play their last Letterman show, and tomorrow morning that stretch on West 53rd will no longer be named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232330/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/03/u2s_temporary_street.php">in their honor</a>.</p>
