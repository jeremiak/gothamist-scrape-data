<p>A reader took the above photo, and tells us he &quot;saw the truck as I came out of the Vernon-Jackson 7 train station in Long Island City&quot; last Friday evening. Wonder what the cargo is! Meanwhile, the real subway had some A-list cargo yesterday, as common straphangers spotted Madonna taking New York City public transportation! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103082640/http://www.tmz.com/2010/09/08/madonna-new-york-city-subway-train/">TMZ</a> has the photographic proof of the Material Girl riding the rails.</p>
