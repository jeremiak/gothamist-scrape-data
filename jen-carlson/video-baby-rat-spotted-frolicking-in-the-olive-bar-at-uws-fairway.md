<p>Earlier this month we watched in horror as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235521/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/video_rat_shops_for_produce_at_fair.php">a rat scurried around the aisles</a> of the Fairway on 74th Street and Broadway. At the time, a spokesman of the store said that nearby construction was likely to blame, and their Quality Control team and senior management were &quot;in the process of conducting a thorough investigation and taking immediate steps to remedy the problem.&quot; That video, caught by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235521/http://myupperwest.com/">My Upper West</a>, was filmed just after midnight, and the blog noted that there were other rats spotted in the store that night. And now those rats seem to have made a baby! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235521/http://glennherman.com/first-hand-report-of-rat-or-mouse-infestation-at-fairway-market-nyc-video/">Glenn Herman</a> caught new, horrifying footage at the store showing what looks like a baby rat frolicking on top of the olives in the olive bar! We never trusted those open olive bars.</p>

<p>Herman notes that he took the video just this morning (Wednesday the 26th) around 12:20 a.m., adding:</p><blockquote>&quot;I was surprised that a man next to me jumped away from the produce and started gesticulating wildly. He explained that there was a mouse or rat walking all over the tops of the produce. I discovered a small rat or mouse happily hanging out in the olive bins. He was walking all over the produce. The night manager and a clerk were discussing how they knew about the problem and that the exterminator was coming.&quot;</blockquote>In response to a letter he wrote to the store, a manager responsed, &quot;It will be addressed immediately. Please accept our sincere apologies.&quot; Surely that Upper West Side Fairway isn&apos;t the only place this is happening (which is actually the most horrifying part of all this), but their customers do certainly know how to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235521/http://laughingsquid.com/the-dangers-of-vertical-video-syndrome/">hold their phones correctly</a> to shoot some sweet video!

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A Fairway spokesperson tells us,  &quot;We believe the incident was caused by the massive construction that is happening throughout the immediate vicinity of the store, and which has been well documented in the press. In fact, we have done an exhaustive top to bottom review of our store and determined that the problem is definitely an external one.  So, we are now taking comprehensive measures and spending thousands of dollars to fully remedy the situation so it doesn&apos;t happen again.&quot;</p>
