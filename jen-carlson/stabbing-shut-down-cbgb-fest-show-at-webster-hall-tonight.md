<p>Just after 8 p.m. tonight two people were stabbed at Webster Hall while attending the Cro-Mags and Sick Of It All show for the CBGB Festival. We&apos;ve reached out to the festival&apos;s organizers and will update when we hear back with more details. In the meantime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103118/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8727984&amp;rss=rss-wabc-article-8727984">ABC News</a> is reporting that EMS and police responded, the bands were told to break down, and the concert was stopped.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103118/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2012/07/stabbing-causes-cancelation-of-webster-hall-hardcore-show/">Bowery Boogie was at the show</a>, and reports that &quot;all hell broke loose upstairs&quot; and &quot;Harley Flanagan, founding member of the Cro-Mags stumbled into the VIP lounge with a knife. Security mobilized in a hot minute and beat the shit out of him. It took no less than six beefy dudes to control the madness. Blood was everywhere, and bone protruded from his shin.&quot; Flannegan was reportedly taken away by the NYPD in handcuffs after he &quot;stabbed some dude in the chest.&quot;</p>

<p>The two victims were reportedly transported to Bellevue hospital, and their conditions are unknown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103118/http://www.cbgb.com/">CBGB Festival</a> is scheduled to go on through the 8th, and will be held at 40 different venues, with two stages being set up in Times Square tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103118/http://hornsuprocks.blogspot.com/2012/07/founding-member-of-cro-mags-stabs.html">Horns Up Rocks</a> reports that Flannegan stabbed Mike &quot;The Gook,&quot; current Cro-Mags bassist. A witness told them, &quot;Flanagan was acting weird right before the incident... &apos;I talked to him outside minutes before it happened and I knew something was going to go down. He was like a fucking lunatic outside... Next thing I know he&apos;s in the VIP area stabbing people!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> The CBGB Fest has released the following statement: &quot;We are saddened to learn about the events that occurred last night at Webster Hall.  Our primary concern is always the safety and experience of New Yorkers, music fans and the general public.  Naturally we will fully cooperate with law enforcement while hoping for the speedy recovery of those injured.  </p>

<p>Live music can be incredibly uplifting, empowering and positive. We don&#x2019;t feel the actions of one person should overshadow four amazing days and nights of events that include Saturday&#x2019;s historic and unprecedented free concerts in Times Square and Central Park.&quot;</p>
