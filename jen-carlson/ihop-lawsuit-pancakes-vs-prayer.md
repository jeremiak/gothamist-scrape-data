										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ihoplaw0910.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092345im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ihoplaw0910.jpg" width="130" height="96" class="image-left"> </span>Everyone knows IHOP (there are plenty in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092345/http://www.ihoplocator.com/results.aspx">the boroughs</a>) for their pancakes, but what about for their <em>prayer</em>? Yeah, not so much, and they will <em>never</em> be known for their prayer if IHOP has anything to do with it. The pancake house is serving up a hot plate of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092345/http://www.kansascity.com/2010/09/14/2224629/ihop-the-pancake-maker-sues-ihop.html">lawsuit</a> to the International House of Prayer for trademark dilution and infringement. The restaurant has been around since 1973, while the Kansas City church has only been around since 1999... though we&apos;re <em>pretty sure</em> Jesus came before the Rooty Tooty Fresh &apos;N Fruity. </p>

<p>Anyway, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092345/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/archives/2010/09/ihop_sues_ihop.php">Village Voice</a>, the restaurant got fed up with the church when they began to serve food and started talking of plans to &quot;construct a $150 million world headquarters, complete with a 5,000-seat conference center and IHOP University&quot; (which already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092345/http://www.ihop.org/Groups/1000067918/International_House_of/University/Audience/International_Students/International_Students.aspx">exists</a> on some level).</p>
