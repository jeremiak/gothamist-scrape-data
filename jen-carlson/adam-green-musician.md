Green also stands on his own as a solo performer; he just released his latest album Sixes &amp; Sevens, and tomorrow night celebrates it with a performance at Town Hall (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301135030/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0300404D96816399?artistid=957332&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1">tickets</a>). </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Recently he told us about some of the old East Village anti-folk hangs, getting 900 bucks to play on The View, his appearance on Cash Cab, and how he&apos;d like it to be legal to drink on the streets of New York.</em> </p>

<p><strong>As a pioneer of the Lower East Side anti-folk scene, how have you seen the neighborhood and music scene changed since you started out?</strong> The antifolk thing had been going on way before I heard about it.  When I was a young man I used to hang around on St. Marks place with a kid named Matt who was bulimic.  We would go see crummy bands play at Coney Island High.  The bartender there was named Paleface and he was a folksinger.  He was a bigshot in those days because he had a record deal with Polygram.  He used to make fun of me because I had contracted crabs in the bathroom stall at Rye Playland.  I guess Avenue A is completely different.  The only place that&#x2019;s still around from the olden days is Odessa.  I was really sad when they closed Alice&#x2019;s Restaurant. </p>

<p><strong>How was it reuniting with Kimya for the performances around the release of the <em>Juno</em> soundtrack?</strong> The main performance that we did was on The View. I thought the whole thing was a little displacing.  General Colin Powell&#x2019;s enthusiasm for our group was probably the only thing that got me through it.  They gave me a year&#x2019;s supply of Caf&#xE9; Bustelo for playing. Anyways I got a check for $900 with Mickey Mouse&#x2019;s head printed on it.  Me and my girlfriend couldn&#x2019;t figure out why Disney was sending me money.  It turns out that they own The View.  But I&#x2019;m glad that they don&#x2019;t censor what Whoopie says. </p>
