<p>Drones are definitely not allowed in our subway system, but here in New York City <em>we don&apos;t care for rules</em>. Below, watch one law-breaking citizen drag his young daughter into a life of crime by operating a drone <em>inside</em> of a subway car. [Correction: this part of the video was not filmed with a drone, sneaky bastards.] That moment comes to a quick end as the drone soon emerges from the Halsey Street station, flying over the streets of Bushwick, and eventually hovering over 345 Eldert Street, where a choreographed scene unfolds against the setting sun.</p>

<p>The video is not totally random&#x2014;that music you hear is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001435/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/11/video_revisit_hbos_1980s_city.php">the vintage 1983 HBO theme</a>, to which the video pays homage.</p>
