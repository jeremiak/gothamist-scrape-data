When the boy was just 8 years old, he lovingly leapt into his aunt&apos;s arms when she arrived at his birthday party, a show of affection that injured her wrist.  Connell, who lives on the Upper East Side, is now seeking $127,000 in damages, and just testified at Connecticut Superior Court. The sole defendant in the case is the child, who hails from tony Westport, CT.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095544/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/aunt-sues-nephew-12-breaking-wrist-greeting-article-1.2394889">the Daily News</a>, she told the court, &#x201C;I live in Manhattan in a third-floor walkup so it has been very difficult. And we all know how crowded it is in Manhattan.&quot; And in addition to the hardship New York City&apos;s urban density has inflicted on her injured wrist, Connell testified, &quot;I was at a party recently and it was difficult to hold my hors d&#x2019;oeuvres plate.&quot;</p>

<p>The lawsuit states that &#x201C;the injuries, losses and harms to the plaintiff were caused by the negligence and carelessness of the minor defendant in that a reasonable eight years old under those circumstances would know or should have known that a forceful greeting such as the one delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff could cause the harms and losses suffered by the plaintiff.&quot; </p>

<p>Connell explained the &quot;forceful greeting&quot; as the boy running towards her and jumping in the air so she could catch him, which caused them both to tumble to the ground. &#x201C;I remember him shouting, &#x2018;Auntie Jen I love you,&#x2019;&quot; Connell recalled.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095544/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/boy-12-trial-conn-breaking-aunt-wrist-article-1.2395756?a">The Daily News</a> reports that &quot;a Connecticut jury needed just 25 minutes Tuesday to decide against&quot; Connell. The boy&apos;s lawyer stated that the only thing he was guilty of was &#x201C;trying to give his aunt a hug on his birthday.&#x201D;</p>
