										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:272px; "> <img alt="billboard0212chels.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140505im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/billboard0212chels.jpeg" width="272" height="195"> <br> <i>via 1010 WINS</i></div> A few of photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140505/ttp://www.kwpf.com/">Kenneth Willardt</a>&apos;s images are currently taking up some space alongside the Yancey Richardson Gallery in Chelsea, and one of them shows a real life naked lady. The 8 x 10 image is called out today by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140505/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/02/17/offensive-or-art-chelsea-billboard-features-nude-woman-floating-in-water/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">CBS New York</a>, who say some people find it offensive... however, no one is actually quoted in their piece as finding it offensive&#x2014;just where <em>are</em> these prudes blushing with rage?<p></p>

<p>The image (and it&apos;s important to note that, despite the CBS headline, this <em>isn&apos;t</em> a billboard, it&apos;s an 8&apos; x 10&apos; street level display) shows a naked woman floating in water, and according to one man that CBS talked to, it&apos;s not even remotely offensive. He says, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t find anything inappropriate about it at all, it&#x2019;s a beautiful naked woman&#x2026; a nice thing to walk by in the morning. <strong>She&#x2019;s not voluptuous so I feel like it&#x2019;s not offensive.</strong>&#x201D; Ah, so that&apos;s it, if this lady had bigger knockers <em>then</em> it&apos;d be offensive.</p>

<p>So what do you think, more or less offensive than what we&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140505/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/24/calvin_klein_billboard.php#photo-1">Calvin Klein put up</a> over the years?</p>
