In the &apos;90s the shop began hosting a unique art show, which integrated various artists&apos; pieces into the shelves amongst the hardware supplies (watch a video about it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170630/http://www.cresthardwareartshow.com/gallery.html">on PBS)</a>. After a hiatus, they brought the show back this past weekend with a grand celebration, and we highly recommend checking it out. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170630/http://www.cresthardwareartshow.com/">The Crest Hardware Art Show</a> runs through July 11th; now, meet the manager/co-curator...</em> </p>

<p><strong>What is the Crest Art Show all about? How and when did it begin?</strong> The Crest Hardware art show is all about taking love for my community, my love of art, my love of hardware and welding them together to bridge a gap in this continually changing city, but Williamsburg in particular. It began in the early nineties with an artist named Gene Pool asking for some window space. We gave him an inch, he took a mile. By mile I mean 5000 square feet of retail space. Which is actually only 280 feet short of a full mile. Sorry, that&apos;s the hardware end speaking.</p>

<p><strong>How long had it been on hiatus for before this past weekend? What spurred the decision to bring it back?</strong> The last show was in 1999, way too long of a hiatus. It had been on the back burner as far as my to do list goes. A couple of things were in front of it, like building the outdoor garden center. Now that thats been up and operating in it&apos;s second year I had the time needed to make sure this years art show was bigger and better than the last. Living, working and partying in Williamsburg I see what many of these people are capable of creating first hand. Many of these artists are my regular customers and I feel Eric Haze put it best when he spoke about the show. He simply said, &quot;It&apos;s about putting something back into the soil.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Is it just once a year, or can people find art in there all year round?</strong> The show ends July 11th. But I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if 3 or 4 pieces stay a little longer or become permanent fixtures.</p>

<p><strong>As co-curator, how were you involved in the show this year?</strong> I started putting this together in January. Gene Pool had a lot of contacts for artists that had participated in past shows. Some emails were obsolete, some phone numbers were changed, but through the magic of Google we corralled quite a few. The excitement in their voices from hearing the good news was a huge catalyst for me. From that point I started reaching out to some of the newer people in the area that may not have even heard of the shows past success. After a short explanation, they were game.</p>
