</div></div>					<p>Chris Rock has been sitting on this Clinton Hill townhouse sine he purchased it in the early 1990s, renting it out all along. And now you have a chance to live in the three-story space at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013320/http://www.trulia.com/homes/New_York/Brooklyn/sold/1000414975-239-Waverly-Ave-Brooklyn-NY-11205#photo-5">239 Waverly Avenue</a> for just $7,950. It includes a two-car garage, a 23-foot by 23-foot terrace, stain-glass windows, an antique wood-burning, and <em>another patio</em>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013320/http://www.celebuzz.com/photos/chris-rocks-brooklyn-townhouse-rents-for-8k-a-month/chris-rock-brooklyn-3/">Celebuzz</a>, here&apos;s the layout: &quot;<strong>The ground floor</strong> has a two-car garage and private apartment with a large living area, bedroom and bathroom. And if that wasn&#x2019;t enough, this level also has a private patio with a grill. <strong>The second floor</strong> opens to a massive 23-foot by 35-foot space, bathroom and a huge kitchen with only top-of-the-line features like a marble countertop and brand new Viking/Bosch stainless steel appliances. <strong>The top floor</strong> [has a] master suite lined with sun-filled windows; antique wood-burning stove/fireplace; huge walk-in closet; and bathroom with double sinks, marble floors and stain-glass window.&quot;</p>

<p>Oddly, when it was for rent in 2011, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013320/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2011/10/rental-of-the-day-239-waverly-avenue/">Brownstoner</a> noted a much higher $10,500/month pricetag, for what they deemed a &quot;special carriage house.&quot; And two years before that it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013320/http://streeteasy.com/nyc/rental/502199-townhouse-239-waverly-avenue-clinton-hill-brooklyn">$15,000/month</a>!
