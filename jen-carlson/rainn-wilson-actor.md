Naturally the two were destined to enjoy a forced five minute phone conversation with each other. Max, now an expert at the short-form talk show, managed to fit in a lot during that time &#x2014; including tales of Rainn&apos;s old Williamsburg digs, and his entire philosophy on life.</em> </p>

<p><strong>You&apos;re one of the judges in this Nikon 140 second short film contest. Just to give a leg up to any contestants reading this interview, is there anything they can throw in their films you can guarantee will please you, specifically? </strong> Maybe a guest appearance by Oprah. Or the New Moon cast. Try to stay contemporary. A decapitation would be awesome. </p>

<p><strong>You&apos;re also a contributor to the contest. All young actors get involved with short films when they&apos;re starting out, so is there anything that you made you&apos;d be embarrassed to see the light of day now?</strong> Oh there are so many things. So many things. It&apos;s ridiculous. I literally yesterday got a phone call that some distribution company wants to release this independent film that I did 10 years ago. I&apos;m not even gonna say the name. It&apos;ll remain nameless because there might be a law suit. It&apos;s one of the worst movies I&apos;ve ever seen. And I think they literally think that if they put my face on the cover of the DVD box that they will actually be able to sell a few thousand or even a few hundred units of this absolutely worst worthless piece of dreck.  </p>

<p>But there&apos;s so much that I&apos;m embarrassed to be a part of. Recently a friend from seventh grade sent my first film I directed that we did with a little Super 8 camera, with a bunch of us pimply seventh graders in Shoreline, Washington.. </p>

<p><strong>If you had to boil down all 5 and a half seasons we&apos;ve seen so far of the Office into a 140 second short film, what would make it in there?</strong> I think you could do a great one with all the &quot;That&apos;s What She Saids&quot;.</p>
