<p>A lengthy FBI report on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122130/http://gothamist.com/tags/whitneyhouston">Whitney Houston</a>, spanning from 1988 through 1992 (the year <em>Bodyguard</em> was released), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122130/http://vault.fbi.gov/whitney-houston">has been made public</a>, and focuses on admirers trying to get in touch with the singer during her peak years of fame. The file describes the late Houston as the victim, and includes a number of letters from one fan in Vermont who writes that he is in love with the singer. The letters were sent to Houston care of Arista Records on West 57th Street, and read, in part: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I should have send this at the beginning of this letter. I am in love with Miss Whitney Houston. I have been in love with her since March of 1986. I have tried to forget what I feel towards her a few times, I have gotten mad at her a few times, a few of the letters have not been very nice. I have gotten so mad and desperate.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>In another, he eerily writes:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I like children and small animals, sometimes I will just sit and watch children playing or I will watch birds or squirrels as they hunt for food. I live sort of across the street from a playground and sometimes I will just sit and watch the kids play.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, the author of the letters gets upset by Houston&apos;s marriage:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I saw a headline for an article in one of those things in the supermarket saying that you were married already. I am sure they made it up but I almost broke down right then and there and I have still been sick for the last several days. I cannot stop thinking about it and I just shake and feel sick in my gut. Miss Whitney, why can&apos;t you answer me. I am afraid of what I might do because it now seems like a rational choice to send copies of letters to those trash things so that they could print the story and maybe I can get an answer from you. I do have two ideas that are not as bad as that and if I do not meet you by the end of April I will try them both. They would take a while to explain and so I am not going to both.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to say he will write letters to everyone connected to Houston, including family, and try to get on a talk show with her. Another letter says he &quot;might hurt someone with some crazy idea and not realize how stupid an idea it was until after it was done.&quot; 66 letters were sent over the course of 17 months. </p>

<p>Another fan was living in Brussels, Belguim, and was tracked down by investigators who traveled there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122130/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/whitney_houstons_fbi_file_rele.html#incart_m-rpt-1">NJ.com</a> notes that &quot;the unnamed Dutch man allegedly sent threatening tapes or correspondence to Houston.&quot; That man &quot;pledged there would be no further attempts on his part to communicate in any way with Houston.&quot;</p>
