<p>Yesterday SFist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151918/http://sfist.com/2013/01/22/the_mason_jar_salad_movement.php">asked if The Mason Jar Salad Movement</a> was a real thing&#x2014;in return, we asked how this didn&apos;t originate in Brooklyn, where the mascot is a mason jar filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151918/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/mayonnaise_store_opens_in_brooklyn.php">artisanal mayonnaise</a>. No matter what coast this originated on, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151918/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/293914954527019008">after a long inner-battle</a>, we have decided to be PRO mason jar salads. Sure, you will probably have to deal with the burden of bringing a bowl to the office to transfer it into at lunch time, and you may be judged by co-workers who view your mason jar packaging as too hip or precious, but at least your salad won&apos;t be soggy. After you procure some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151918/http://www.amazon.com/67000-Ball-Mason-Jar-12-pack/dp/B000BWZ7QO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358976052&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=mason+jar">large mason jars</a>, remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151918/http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2012/06/vegan-salad-in-jar-make-ahead-bliss.html">these crucial layering tips</a>:</p><ul><li>Dressing, or more liquified ingredients, go on the bottom.<br>
</li><li>Next comes the heavy ingredients: quinoa, chickpeas, lentils, cauliflower, pasta, onions, cucumber, etc. (Keep in mind, this layer will probably get submerged in the dressing.)<br>
</li><li>Up next are the greens&#x2014;arugula, kale, butterhead lettuce, whatever your stomach desires!<br>
</li><li>On top of that comes the croutons, seeds, nuts, hard-boiled eggs, tofu.<br>
</li><li>Need more color? Top it off with edible flowers and/or fruits.</li></ul>And don&apos;t stop at salads, you can even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151918/http://www.thekitchn.com/oatmeal-in-jars-a-week-of-stee-143623">put oatmeal in there</a>! It&apos;s liberating, isn&apos;t it?<p></p>
