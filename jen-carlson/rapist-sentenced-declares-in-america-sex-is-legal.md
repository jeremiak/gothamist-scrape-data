										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="rapist1009.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154857im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/rapist1009.jpg" width="320" height="240" class="image-left"> </span>The 30-year-old fake livery cab driver who raped one woman, and attempted to rape another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154857/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/19/cabbie_1.php">last February</a>, was sentenced to 15 years behind bars yesterday. Make that 15 years and 30 days. Torkieh Sadagheh reportedly cried upon hearing his sentence, but when that got him no sympathy, he went the outburst route &#x2014; which got him an extra month in the slammer for contempt of court. </p>

<p>He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154857/http://www.wpix.com/news/local/wpix-livery-cab-driver-jail-for-rape,0,5409997.story">reportedly</a> &quot;wept, berated the judge and even attempted to switch attorneys&quot; &#x2014; at one point declaring the judge was &quot;worse than Hitler&quot; and that the two women were &quot;defiling my constitutional rights!&quot; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154857/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/10/14/2009-10-14_after_in_america_sex_is_legal_outburst_rapist_gets_15_years.html">the Daily News</a> he went on to say that &quot;The first one was a prostitute and the second one I drove home.&quot; He had picked the women up at different times during the night near Scores on West 28th Street, where one was a dancer. </p>

<p>Sadagheh&apos;s last attempt at... something, was to yell: &quot;In America sex is legal!&quot; The judge declared him to be &quot;a selfish, manipulative, narcissistic predator,&quot; and said he probably deserves more than 15 years.</p>
