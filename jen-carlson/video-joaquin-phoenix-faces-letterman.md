										<p>Last night Joaquin Phoenix was face-to-face with David Letterman again after not appearing on the show since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175254/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/12/joaquin_phoenix_on_letterman.php"><em>this</em> happened</a> last year:</p>

<p>So last night the actor was back on Letterman, clean-shaven and apologizing (<em>sort of</em>) for the last time he was a <em>Late Show</em> guest. They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175254/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1648488/20100923/story.jhtml">both claimed</a> Letterman himself was not in on the hoax, and the actor told the host, &quot;You&apos;ve interviewed many, many people and I assumed that you would know the difference between a character and a real person, so&#x2014;but I apologize. I hope I didn&apos;t offend you in any way.&quot; He also thanked Letterman, saying, &quot;We&apos;d hoped to come on a talk show, and I was looking for a beat down, and I got one... I want to thank you for that.&quot; Here&apos;s a clip:</p>
