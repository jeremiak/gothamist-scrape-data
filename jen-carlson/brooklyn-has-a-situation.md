<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="situationcyclones.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724035348im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/situationcyclones.jpg" width="200" height="118" class="image-left"> </span>Even the Brooklyn Cyclones aren&apos;t immune to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724035348/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> cast. The team announced that on July 21 they&apos;ll be hosting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724035348/http://www.brooklyncyclones.com/news/topstories/index.html?article_id=804">&quot;Jersey? Sure!&quot; Night</a>, which will include a giveaway of mesh jerseys featuring the team&#x2019;s mascot, Sandy the Seagull, fist-pumping! And that&apos;s not even the best part...</p>

<p>The team has invited Mike &quot;The Situation&quot; Sorrentino to try out after finding out that in an effort to &#x201C;impress the ladies&quot; he falsely professed that he was a back-up third baseman for them! Your move, Situation.</p>

<p>Pop culture phenomena aside, Cyclones General Manager Steve Cohen doesn&apos;t think Jersey has the best shore, he says, &#x201C;We still think the Coney Island shore is the best in the Tri-State area, but we&#x2019;re willing to give Jersey its due... at least for one night.&#x201D;</p>
