title: Video Exclusive: Girl Walk // All Day, Chapter 5 (Featuring Some Dangerous Vespa Dance Moves!)
---

	
										<p>Here&apos;s your premiere of the latest chapter (the fifth!) of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211626/http://gothamist.com/tags/girlwalkallday">Girl Walk // All Day</a> film. This one brings you from Chinatown (where Tai Chi meets Lil Kim) to Times Square to the Williamsburg Bridge, where you&apos;ll meet some young kick ass dancers. Also, we highly recommend you never try dancing on a moving Vespa in New York City traffic, which you&apos;ll also see in this chapter. Enjoy!</p>
