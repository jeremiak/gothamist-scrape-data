<p>82 years ago today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://gothamist.com/tags/empirestatebuilding">Empire State Building</a> opened to the public. Let&apos;s gaze upon her beauty, and learn a little more about the ol&apos; gal.</p>

<ul><li>On May 1st, 1931, President Herbert Hoover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/empire-state-building-dedicated">dedicated</a> the Empire State Building by pressing a button from the White House that turned on the building&apos;s lights. But this was just symbolic... the lights were <em>actually</em> turned on by someone in New York.
</li><li>The site of the Empire State Building was also the site of the old Waldorf-Astoria, which was demolished for its construction.
</li><li>John Jacob Raskob (of General Motors) was the main man behind the Empire State Building, and legend has it he had two requirements of the architects: for the building look like a pencil and for it to be the tallest on earth. 
</li><li>The 103rd floor is closed to the public, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/06/empire_state_building.php#photo-1">we&apos;ve been up there</a>... and it&apos;s terrifying. So, bravo Raskob.</li></ul>

<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://www.essential-new-york-city-guide.com/empire-state-building-facts.html">Some say</a> he held a pencil up to architect William Lamb and asked, &quot;Bill, how high can you make it so that it won&apos;t fall down?&quot;
</li><li>The idea for the building was born <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/empirestatebldg.htm">out of a competition</a> between Raskob and Walter Chrysler to see who could build the tallest structure. 
</li><li>While the ESB started later, it only took just over a year to build, giving the Chrysler Building less than a year to be the tallest in the city&apos;s skyline.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The building is 1,250 feet high (1,454 feet to the top of the lightning rod). When it was completed it was the world&apos;s tallest skyscraper, and it kept that title until the World Trade Center took it over in 1972.
</li><li>It became the tallest building in New York City and New York State on September 11th, 2001. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://gothamist.com/tags/1wtc">1WTC</a> is the tallest.

<ul><li>And it has a long-term, complicated relationship <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/lightning_crashes.php#photo-1">with lightning</a>:</li></ul>

<ul><li>All in all it cost about $40 million to build.
</li><li>It was built during the Great Depression, and for a while only 25% of office space was rented out.</li><li>The original intent was that it was to be used as a mooring mast and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/realestate/26scapes.html">depot for zeppelins</a>, but that proved to be, you know, totally dangerous. Here&apos;s what that would have looked like:</li></ul>

<ul><li>On a foggy July 28th, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith, Jr., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/28/flashback_b-52_hits_empire_state_bu.php">crashed into the north side of the building</a> between the 79th and 80th floors. 14 people were killed.
</li><li>On May 1, 1947, 23-year-old Evelyn McHale leapt to her death from the observation deck of the building, and photographer Robert Wiles took this photo, leaving some to call her death &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://kottke.org/08/07/the-most-beautiful-suicide">the World&apos;s Most Beautiful Suicide</a>.&quot;</li></ul>

<ul><li>Over 30 people have since committed suicide by jumping off the building. But the first occurred before its completion, by a worker who had been laid off. 
</li><li>The fence around the observatory terrace was put up in 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span.
</li><li>On a happier note: it is so romantic!</li></ul>

<ul><li>Tonight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145452/http://www.esbnyc.com/current_events_tower_lights.asp">the building lights</a> will not be shining in celebration of itself.
