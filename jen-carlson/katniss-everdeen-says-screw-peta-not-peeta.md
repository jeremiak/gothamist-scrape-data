<p>It seems that actress Jennifer Lawrence channeled her bad-ass, animal-spearing <em>Hunger Games</em> character Katniss Everdeen during a recent interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421145408/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/cover-story-excerpt-jennifer-lawrence-20120328">Rolling Stone</a>. In their latest issue&#x2014;the 21-year-old graces the cover&#x2014;she discusses her short history of on-screen animal cruelty, like when she ripped out a squirrels innards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421145408/http://www.metacafe.com/watch/mv-P8xy/skinning_squirrels/">in <em>Winter&apos;s Bone</em></a>. When discussing that scene, she told the magazine: &quot;I should say it wasn&apos;t real, for PETA. But screw PETA.&quot; But maybe she just meant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421145408/http://thehungergames.wikia.com/wiki/Peeta_Mellark">Peeta</a>?</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted PETA, and president Ingrid Newkirk told us this morning, &quot;She&#x2019;s young and the plight of animals somehow hasn&#x2019;t yet touched her heart. As Henry David Thoreau  said, &apos;The squirrel you kill in jest, dies in earnest.&apos;  We are told that this squirrel was hit by a car, but when people kill animals, it is the animals who are &apos;screwed,&apos; not PETA, and one day I hope she will try to make up for any pain she might cause any animal who did nothing but try to eke out a humble existence in nature.&quot; Might we suggest a campaign featuring Lawrence, mockingjays and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421145408/http://thehungergames.wikia.com/wiki/Muttation">wolf muttations</a>?</p>
