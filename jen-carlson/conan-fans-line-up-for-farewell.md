Jimmy Fallon will be taking over, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165948/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/19/fallons_new_studio_is_sue_simmonss.php">in a different studio</a>, so tonight is the last chance to lay your eyes on the Late Night set as you know it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165948/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/94301/fans-brave-the-cold-to-get-tickets-to-final-conan-show/Default.aspx">NY1</a> is reporting that fans of the host have been lined up in the cold in hopes of scoring tickets to the final show. One told them, &quot;I just love Conan and I&apos;m really sad he&apos;s leaving and I&apos;m really excited to see the show. I know it&apos;s going to be amazing and I just absolutely had to be at the last show.&quot; People, he&apos;s still going to <em>be on television</em>. Another fan said, &quot;We went to the show yesterday. Then, once we got out, we got back in line.&quot; They caught <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165948/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/09/conan_stalker_f.php">that priest</a>, <em>right?</em></p>
