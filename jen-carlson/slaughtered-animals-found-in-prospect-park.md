										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="garbag1010.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075713im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/garbag1010.jpg" width="200" height="247" class="image-left"> </span>Just in time for Halloween, the mysterious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075713/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/prospect_park_2.php">animal massacres</a> in Prospect Park have returned, and they&apos;re more gruesome than ever! Earlier this week, local man Alex Gurevich found two bags in the park&#x2014;one filled with animal guts and the other with a beheaded and gutted deer or goat carcass! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075713/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/43/dtg_butcher_2010_10_22_bk.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that the bags were found at the edge of the park near Parkside Avenue and Parade Place, just 30 feet from each other.</p>

<p>Gurevich&#x2014;who allegedly smelled the bags before spotting them&#x2014;told them, &#x201C;I initially thought it was a dog.&quot; He believes that this latest incident is part of a Santeria ritual&#x2014;however, the animal parts that have been found have not been surrounded by the usual items involved in such rituals (grains, money, food). </p>

<p>Other dead animals found in the park this year have included a duck, a swan, a raccoon, a possum, several goslings, a dog, turtles and fish&#x2014;some died of natural causes, others <em>at the hands of man</em>. We&apos;ve contacted Eugene Patron at Prospect Park for comment, and he said they&apos;re currently trying to find out more about the incident.</p>
