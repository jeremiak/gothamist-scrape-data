										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="SMnew21713baldwin2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145922im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SMnew21713baldwin2.jpeg" width="350" height="301"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> <span class="photo_caption">via Getty</span></i></div> On Sunday night Alec Baldwin told us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145922/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/17/alec_baldwin_accuses_ny_post_photog.php">in an exclusive interview</a> that the NY Post would be coming down on him the next day, accusing him of calling one of their hired paparazzi a racist slur. While he assumed it would be the N word, the tabloid ended up throwing him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145922/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/18/alec_baldwin_3.php">on the front cover</a> with an allegation that he called their photographer a &quot;coon,&quot; amongst other things. However, a source who has heard the audio tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145922/http://www.tmz.com/2013/02/18/alec-baldwin-video-nyc-racism-reporter-video/#ixzz2LM4XcchF">TMZ</a> that &quot;there is NO mention of a racial slur on the tape.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Post has yet to produce the audio they claim proves Baldwin slung the racial slurs, and yesterday, when we spoke to Baldwin again, he told us, &quot;I am fascinated that the Post seems to have cameras everywhere... and handheld still cameras that have a video capacity&#x2014;most paparazzi I know can shoot both with the same camera. And here we have a young woman there with a microphone and a camera, and they seem to have the capacity to record everything, and they can&apos;t seem to produce an example of me saying a racial epithet.&quot; We sat down with Baldwin  last night, and will have more from that discussion later today.</p>

<p>The Post, however, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145922/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/alec_on_the_run_trF2Iup7rArpULIUipO22J?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">sticking to their story</a>, and today reports that the NYPD&#x2019;s Hate Crime Task Force has launched an investigation into the matter. Detectives reportedly spoke at length to both Baldwin and the photographer, G.N. Miller, yesterday following the incident. What the Post likely has&#x2014;and they make note of it today&#x2014;is a recording of Miller recounting the incident with the reporter after it occurred, telling her, &#x201C;He said some foul shit about my mom. He kept calling me a name, coon.&#x201D;</p>

<p>We contacted the Hate Crimes Unit this morning but they would not comment on the matter.</p>
