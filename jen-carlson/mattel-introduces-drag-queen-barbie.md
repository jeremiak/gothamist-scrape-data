<p>She&apos;s plastic, and she&apos;s <em>fabulous</em>. Mattel has unveiled their latest Barbie, and she&apos;s a man, baby. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030230906/http://designtaxi.com/news/353320/Mattel-Commissions-Drag-Queen-Barbie/">The company commissioned</a> NYC design team The Blonds to create their first Drag Queen Barbie, which will hit shelves just in time for Christmas later this year.</p>

<p>The Barbie doesn&apos;t have a Ken Bump or an Adam&apos;s Apple, she&apos;s just a regular Barbie, but with some decedent clothing. The doll does, however, come with a higher price tag than most&#x2014;$125&#x2014;but this is part of a collector&#x2019;s edition. (You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030230906/http://www.barbiecollector.com/shop/doll/blonds-blond-diamond-barbie-doll-w3499">pre-order here</a>.)</p>

<p>Drag Queen Barbie (real name: Blond Diamond Barbie) will come dressed in a white faux-fur coat, and a jeweled corset dress. Now, where are the LGBT Barbie and Ken?</p>
