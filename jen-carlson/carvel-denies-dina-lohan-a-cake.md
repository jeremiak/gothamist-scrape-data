										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_06_dinacookie.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172113im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2010_06_dinacookie.jpg" width="208" height="190" class="image-right"> </span>Where to begin! First off: Carvel gives VIP ice cream lovers special Black Cards. That is pretty amazing in and of itself, but <em>this</em> story is about Black Card holder Dina Lohan, mother of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172113/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindsaylohan">Lindsay</a>. </p>

<p>While shopping for an ice cream cake for her son Cody&apos;s birthday in East Meadow, NY yesterday, mama Lohan handed over her Black Card, only to have it confiscated by an employee. She explained the embarrassing incident to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172113/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/06/exclusive-scoop-cops-called-dina-lohan-ice-cream-store">RadarOnline</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;The shop assistant said, &#x2018;Do you have I.D.?&apos; Next minute he he grabbed my arm and took my card and held it hostage and wouldn&#x2019;t give me the cake! This guy was crazy! Four cop cars showed up, there&#x2019;s a police helicopter over head and this guy makes it seem to the cops that I&#x2019;m trying to use a stolen credit card&#x2014;and for what? Over a free ice cream?!&#x201D;&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Apparently all the Lohans have Black Cards, and Dina had accidentally grabbed her daughter Ali&apos;s. While the employee stood strong for a while, insisting it was not her card, he eventually caved&#x2014;but not without a fight. He told Lohan, &quot;You can have the card, but you can&#x2019;t have the cake!&quot; Carvel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172113/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/dina-lohan-fight-over-ice-cream-got-heated-1.2030784?p=">has apologized</a> for the incident, but notes that it was Lohan who called the cops in.</p>

<p>The starlet&apos;s mom says, &quot;It just shows how we get treated so much worse than regular people.&#x201D; Hmm, maybe if you didn&apos;t go around flashing your fancy Black Carvel Card and referring to the rest of us as &quot;regular people&quot; in the press, this wouldn&apos;t be happening?</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The Carvel Ice Cream Black Card is totally real&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172113/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/17/carvel_black_card_is_real_lohans_ab.php">here&apos;s Carvel&apos;s statement about the Lohans&apos; abuse of the coveted card</a>.</p>
