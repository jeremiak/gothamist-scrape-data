title: Think You're Making $250K In Manhattan? Think Again

<p>Those buzzkills at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304184740/http://money.cnn.com/news/storysupplement/economy/cost_of_living/">CNNMoney</a> created a Google Map that shows what it <em>really means</em> to have $250K/year&#x2014;which the White House says is a mark that someone is wealthy. Since cost of living is different in various cities, however, that is a sweeping generalization. In some parts of Texas and Florida it may be accurate, but here in New York City (and more specifically, in Manhattan) the local equivalent is $545K. Meaning that is how much you&apos;d have to make to maintain the same lifestyle as someone living in, say, Missoula, Montana. On the upside, you don&apos;t live in Missoula; their fresh air is <em>so</em> overrated anyway.</p>
