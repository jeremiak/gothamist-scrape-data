For reasons of vital national security, we can&apos;t tell you about the super secret headliner until 12 a.m. the morning of the show (you&apos;re gonna love her/him/them/it, promise!)... but we can tell you the openers RIGHT NOW. Just scroll down for a look at the opening lineup. <p></p>

<p>And note: along with all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428170540/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/brooklyn_bazaar.php#photo-1">live music, food, drink, and vendors</a>, there will also be downtime music provided by DJ Mikey Palms (Chances With Wolves). As always, the event takes place from 6 p.m. to midnight (avoid the line by getting there EARLY), at 45 North 5th Street in Williamsburg, and it&apos;s FREE.<br>

<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428170540/https://soundcloud.com/tinyvictories">TINY VICTORIES</a></strong>: NPR says this band&apos;s songs are &quot;full of smart, catchy electro-pop hooks with subversive production details to keep listeners guessing. There&apos;s real depth to Greg Walter&apos;s voice, as well as a natural, organic feel to the music.&quot; </p>

<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428170540/http://danfriel.com/">DAN FRIEL</a></strong> (ex-Parts and Labor) creates sounds that have been described as &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;wonderful,&quot; and Pitchfork gets specific, calling his music &quot;a heaving mass of static beats, monolithic distortion, and bending, diving tones.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="www.facebook.com/deadstarsmusic"><strong>DEAD STARS</strong></a> &quot;play melodic alt-rock and shoegaze straight from the early-&#x2018;90s,&quot; says Fuse... so obviously we love them.</p>

<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428170540/http://www.reverbnation.com/screaminrebelangels">SCREAMIN&apos; REBEL ANGELS</a></strong> features a feisty redhead (Laura Rebel Angel) who is described as the product of what would happen &quot;if Screamin&apos; Jay Hawkins and Ruth Brown had a baby raised by Wanda Jackson in a John Waters film, that hell kitten would be Laura Rebel Angel.&quot;</p>
