<p>NY1 anchor (and recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129032859/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/pat_kiernans_dreams_come_true_on_li.php">Live! With Kelly co-host</a>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129032859/http://gothamist.com/tags/patkiernan">Pat Kiernan</a> has been hosting trivia nights at the Bell House in Brooklyn recently, and they always sell out really fast, so here&apos;s your heads up for the next one, which will take place on April 24th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129032859/http://www.trivworks.com/">TrivWorks</a> (who organize the events) says this will be a &apos;90s pop culture night, so in an effort to help you get into the mindset of the host, we asked Kiernan about some of his favorite &apos;90s things. </p>

<p><strong>Song:</strong> Backstreet Boys, &quot;I Want It That Way&quot;</p>

<p><strong>New York Event:</strong> It&apos;s impossible to pick a favorite but two that jumped to mind are the transformation of city (particularly crime rate) under Rudy Giuliani, and Mark Messier&apos;s promise to deliver a Stanley Cup win.</p>
