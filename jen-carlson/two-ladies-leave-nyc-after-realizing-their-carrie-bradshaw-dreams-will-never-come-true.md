<p>The 31-year-old Carrie-coulda-been Julia Allison (who was once &quot;famous&quot; in certain corners of The Internet) has announced via this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406102101/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/carrie_away_F2mbhFEqbCj9cC52y8wAFO">NY Post</a> article that she left New York City last year with her best friend (also &quot;a Carrie&quot;) and no one even noticed. And if she couldn&apos;t be Carrie Bradshaw IRL, then NO ONE CAN. From her new digs in Los Angeles, she warns &quot;a new generation of women&quot; about trying to Single White Female Ms. Bradshaw in real world NYC. She wonders, for instance, if fans know...<br>
</p><ul><li>...that rent-controlled apartments like Carrie&#x2019;s are hard to come by?<br>
</li><li>...that you&apos;ll have to use your Prada stilettos to kill the cockroaches?<br>
</li><li>...that eventually that douche from JP Morgan you&apos;re dating will replace you with a younger model?<br>
</li><li>...that you&apos;ll probably max out your credit cards on drinks, cabs, and clothes?<br>
</li><li>...that you&apos;ll never find four friends to get together every week for brunch?<br>
</li><li>...that you&apos;ll have to carry groceries UP STAIRS?<br>
</li><li>...that New York is &quot;fucking exhausting&quot; and will eventually <em>eat your soul</em> if you even have one?</li></ul><br>
Allison claims Carrie Bradshaw&apos;s New York City is just &quot;a strange new world you will never visit except on TV&quot;... and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406102101/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/do_over_carrie_bradshaw_math.php">we remain shocked</a> that it took anyone this long to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406102101/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/young_writer_who_moved_to_nyc_finds.php">figure that out</a>. If she didn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406102101/http://blog.juliaallison.com/2008/02/journey.html">password protect the video</a>, we would now insert her lip-dubbed version of Journey&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos;,&quot; for irony&apos;s sake.<p></p>
