<p>There can never be too many New York City maps, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113540/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/thats-one-big-map-of-m-a-n-h-a-t-t-a-n/">City Room</a> points out collage artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113540/http://michaelalbert.com/">Michael Albert</a>&apos;s latest creation&#x2014;a print of which costs 50 bucks online, though he generously handed them out for free this past weekend on a corner in downtown Brooklyn. </p>

<p>The design is comprised of letters he stocked up on from ads and commercial packaging, which the site points out creates a ransom note aesthetic. Including everything from street names to neighborhoods to stores and subway stops, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113540/http://www.scribd.com/doc/19743038/Michael-Alberts-Collage-Map-of-Manhattan">view the entire map here</a>. He declared, &#x201C;I did spell one thing wrong. I won&#x2019;t tell you what it is&quot;&#x2014;however, since making that claim some some of the city&apos;s citizens have picked up on a few more typos.</p>
