Claire Cavanah is the co-owner, but she&apos;s also a Park Slope mom...so naturally the borough&apos;s first Babeland is landing right in her own nabe. So far the neighbors have greeted them with an unexpected level of excitement, and today the Park Slope outlet of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529212701/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/29/babeland_lands.php">Babeland will finally open its doors</a>. Recently Cavanah told us about the shop&apos;s history, the neighborhood-specific events planned and what products she think will fly off the shelves in the Slope.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Babeland turns 15 this year, where was your first shop in New York, and how did people react when it came to the neighborhood?</strong> Our first location in New York opened in 1998 at 94 Rivington Street on the Lower East Side. We had a warm welcome in the neighborhood from the LES Business Improvement District, other merchants and residents. We were a little nervous about the synagogue across the street, but it turned out to be a nice relationship. We were committed to being good neighbors and fitting into the community. There was only one incident about a window display. The Rabbi complained because it contained boxer shorts. We took it down.  </p>

<p><strong>How has the Park Slope reaction been pre-opening?</strong> It&#x2019;s been very friendly. I think the comments on blogs and message boards have been a good gauge of resident&#x2019;s feelings and it&#x2019;s been overwhelmingly positive. People on the block have been stopping in to say hi as we&#x2019;ve been working on the store these past few weeks, I couldn&#x2019;t have asked for a warmer welcome.  </p>

<p><strong>Will the Park Slope store differ from other Babeland stores in any way?</strong> No, same great selection and customer service. As we meet more of our customers, we&#x2019;ll tailor the selection to what they want. Our program of events will be more neighborhood-specific, though. We&#x2019;re doing more social events- Babeland Brunch once a month, crafting, date night, wine and chocolate tasting- and a monthly series focused on what it means to be a sex-positive family with guest speakers. It&#x2019;s an intimate space, conducive to interactive, informal events. In addition, we&#x2019;ll offer some of our most popular workshops, like How to Please Your Man.  </p>

<p><strong>Do you have any stand-out crazy customer stories?</strong> Well, there was a guy whose fetish was to dress as an infant who would come into the store once a week. He would wear a cloth diaper, suck on a pacifier and clutch a rattle. He would look at all the merchandise, read the books, just hang out. I guess he felt comfortable in the store.  </p>
