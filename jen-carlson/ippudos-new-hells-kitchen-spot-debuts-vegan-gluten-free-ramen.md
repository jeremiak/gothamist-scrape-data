<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174031/http://www.ippudony.com/">Ippudo</a>, the no-reservations ramen hotspot in the East Village, has expanded to Hell&apos;s Kitchen, and Wednesday night they threw an invitation-only preview of the new Ippudo Westside at 321 West 51st Street. We weren&apos;t there, so we&apos;ll be standing on line with everyone else when it opens in July, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174031/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/08/jared_blake_scharff_saturday_night.php"><em>Saturday Night Live</em> guitarist</a> Jared Scharff was on hand, and we asked him to tell us about the vegan, gluten-free noodle soup that will be served there, called Shojin Ramen.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;As a self proclaimed &apos;ramen whore&apos; or &apos;ramen enthusiast&apos; (reads in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174031/https://twitter.com/ScharffIsHere">my twitter bio</a>) I have never experienced a ramen quite like it. The flavors felt like they came from another universe. The tomatoes were bursting with the brightest tomato taste I have ever witnessed. While I was a little nervous about the gluten-free noodle, I was happily surprised. Between the interesting flavor of the broth and unique umami profiles (land, sea and mountain) it was a dish that was highly entertaining and delicious.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>It may not be the <em>only</em> vegan, gluten-free ramen in NYC, but it&apos;s certainly the only ramen with vegan, gluten-free gold leaves in it. (We&apos;re guessing that was just for the fancy preview party.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174031/http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/ippudos-brings-its-ramen-to-midtown/?_r=0">The NY Times</a> notes that Ippudo&#x2019;s &quot;global noodle master&quot; Fumihiro Kanegae spoke about the new offering, explaining: &#x201C;In the East Village, I realized that some customers couldn&#x2019;t have our ramen because they were vegan.&quot;</p>

<p>Ippudo Westside is set to open sometime next month.</p>
