<p>The 24-year-old Queens native <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041559/http://awkwafina.com/">Awkwafina</a> is BACK, and she&apos;s brought more acid-tongued rhymes with her. This time she&apos;s directing her hate at Mayor Bloomberg (previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041559/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/video_let_awkwafina_tell_you_about.php">she trashed transplants and also <em>your vag</em></a>). Below, she wonders if her giant margaritas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041559/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">will also get banned</a> in the Nannystate (&#x201C;Hey Mayor Mike Bloomberg, help me understand... Our giant margaritas are going to get banned... Please don&#x2019;t take my freedom, my giant margarita&#x201D;). This may be the first time Bloomberg&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041559/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/29/bloomberg_on_el_bloombito_cayate_so.php">El Bloombito</a>&quot; Spanish and 311 have been sampled in a song. Brava, Awkwafina! </p>
