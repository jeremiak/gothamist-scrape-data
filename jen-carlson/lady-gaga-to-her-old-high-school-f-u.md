										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ladygaga0610a.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130016im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ladygaga0610a.jpg" width="200" height="301" class="image-left"> </span>In 2004 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130016/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> (then better known as Stefani Germanotta) graduated from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130016/http://www.cshnyc.org/">Convent of the Sacred Heart</a> on East 91st Street at 5th Avenue. She once told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130016/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/55653/">NY Mag</a> of the private all-girls school (where students had to wear uniforms), &#x201C;We were good girls, but we weren&#x2019;t nerdy like the girls at Chapin. We were the girls that guys still wanted to date junior year of high school, because we hadn&#x2019;t had sex or given blow jobs yet.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Long gone are the good girl days, however, and today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130016/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/agog_at_gaga_style_of_revenge_2ykp1SCjjoABfmp0js6zdP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> reports that Gaga went back to her alma mater this week to attend her sister Natali&apos;s graduation. </p>

<p>Despite it being her big day, the superstar&apos;s sister wasn&apos;t the one in the spotlight&#x2014;Gaga showed up in see-through pants, those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130016/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/lady_gaga_1.php">chopine-esque shoes</a>, and a beekeeper hat. She then took the opportunity to perform a special show for the grads... or rather, a musical &quot;F U&quot; to the school she hated so much. </p>

<p>The paper notes that she was an outcast because of her &quot;driving ambition,&quot; and a source told them, &quot;Part of going to the graduation in that outfit was her showing the bullies that she has emerged like a swan, she has made something of her life and has found the freedom to express her creativity.&quot;</p>
