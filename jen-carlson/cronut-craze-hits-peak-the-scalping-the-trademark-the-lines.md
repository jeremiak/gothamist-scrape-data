<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160508124720/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/fine_lets_talk_about_nycs_out-of-co.php">The Cronut</a> was only born a few weeks ago, but it&apos;s growing up so fast. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160508124720/http://dominiqueansel.com/">Dominique Ansel</a> created the half doughnut-half croissant in his pastry laboratory, and sells them for $5 each at his SoHo bakery (not a bad deal considering how labor intensive it is to make these). The city has gone so <em>mental</em> for the treat, that Ansel has put a limit on how many one person can buy (6), and has even trademarked the name.... you can&apos;t even say &quot;Cronut-inspired.&quot; It&apos;s smart, but a bit ridiculous... especially considering there have been croissant-doughnut hybrids out there for decades.</p>

<p>And now, your cronut update:</p>

<p><strong>THE NEW CRONUT FLAVOR</strong><br>
It&apos;s.... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160508124720/http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/05/new-cronut-dominique-ansel-lemon-maple.html">lemon</a>! The new cronut will be &quot;very light,&quot; and rolled in coarse maple sugar with a lemon glaze. It debuts this weekend, on Saturday. (The original will still be available, which features a rose glaze and sugar, and Tahitian vanilla cream filling.)</p>

<p><strong>THE LINE</strong><br>
The line has been starting around 6 a.m. now, and the bakery doesn&apos;t even open until 8 a.m. But after the doors swing open, word on the street is that things move fairly fast. And there&apos;s no special treatment, even Hugh Jackman was spotted waiting on line.</p>

<p><strong>THE DOSSANTS</strong><br>
Meanwhile, the craze has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160508124720/https://twitter.com/MoVidaBakery/status/339960115824300033">hit Australia</a>, but since Ansel has now trademarked the name Cronut, they&apos;re calling them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160508124720/http://www.goodfood.com.au/good-food/eat-out/doh-australia-fries-its-own-sweet-sensation-20130522-2k06f.html">Dossants</a> there.</p>

<p><strong>THE CRONUT BLACK MARKET</strong><br>
Now things get real ugly. People are offering cronut pick-up and delivery services on Craigslist (while others are even selling them right outside the bakery for people who don&apos;t want to wait on line&#x2014;sometimes for as much as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160508124720/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/cronuts-sugar-bombs-sweetness-article-1.1359260">$30 each</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160508124720/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/for/3839191589.html">One Craigslist poster</a> says they&apos;ll deliver a minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 cronuts to your door in Manhattan for $20 per Cronut, in Queens for $40 per Cronut, and in Brooklyn for $30 a cronut. That is $200 for 5 cronuts if you live in Queens. This person should be arrested and sent to cronut jail.</p>

<p>Is cronut crime next? Everyone, be safe and keep your cronuts out of view.</p>
