<p>This morning Woody Allen was spotted on the Upper East Side, filming his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174838/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334873/">new untitled film</a> starring Cate Blanchett, Peter Sarsgaard, and Alec Baldwin. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174838/https://twitter.com/sittingshotgun/status/245170875463254016">One fan</a> spotted the director and snapped the above photo, noting they were on &quot;60-something&quot; at the time</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174838/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2012/09/09/monday-september-10-filming-locations-in-ny-montreal-chicago-l-a-more-including-the-hangover-3-castle-white-house-down-gossip-girl-the-good-wife/">OLV</a>, &quot;There are signs for &#x2018;WASP 2012&#x2032; on E 53rd between 5th and Madison in NYC... for the new Untitled Woody Allen Movie, also filming around 64th and 5th Ave.&quot;</p>

<p>The film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174838/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/woody_allens_next_movie_will_be_fil.php">won&apos;t be</a> totally set in New York City, however, for the most part the production will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174838/http://sfist.com/2012/04/13/woody_allens_next_movie_will_be_fil.php">be in San Francisco</a>. In the recent past, Allen has said, &quot;I could do another 50 pictures about New York, but I can&apos;t afford to do it. New York itself is very inspiring... I&apos;m full of ideas about wanting to do stories about the city.&quot; Maybe he could launch a Kickstarter?</p>
