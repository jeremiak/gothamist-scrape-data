<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130659/http://gothamist.com/tags/franklloydwright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> was born on this day in 1867, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130659/http://moma.org/">the Museum of Modern Art</a> has announced, on what would have been his 149th birthday (if humans lived that long), that they will be hosting a massive exhibition dedicated to the architect next year. The exhibition will be called &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking the Archive.&quot; And there&apos;s a lot to unpack...</p>

<p>There will be 450 works on display (from June 12th to October 1st, 2017) bringing you through his career, from the 1890s through the 1950s&#x2014;this will include architectural drawings, models, building fragments, films, print media, furniture, tableware, textiles, paintings, photographs, scrapbooks, and television broadcasts... hopefully they mean this one: </p>

<p>Some of the works have never been publicly exhibited. From MoMA&apos;s announcement:</p><blockquote>Structured as an anthology rather than a comprehensive, monographic presentation of Wright&apos;s work, the exhibition is divided into 12 sections, each of which investigates a key object or cluster of objects from the Frank Lloyd Wright Archive, interpreting and contextualizing it, as well as juxtaposing it with other works from the Archive, from MoMA, or from outside collections. The exhibition seeks to open up Wright&apos;s work to critical inquiry and debate, and to introduce experts and general audiences alike to new angles and interpretations of this extraordinary architect.</blockquote>And remember Frank Lloyd Wright&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130659/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/15/frank_lloyd_wrights_all-glass_build.php">St. Mark&apos;s glass tower</a> that never happened? Here&apos;s his model of it, which will be just one highlight of the retrospective:<p></p>
