										<p><img alt="IRSgraph.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221425im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/IRSgraph.jpg" width="350" height="350" class="right">Now that the glory days <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221425/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/07/bk.php">of moving to Brooklyn</a> after being priced out of Manhattan are all but gone, the question remains: where <em>do</em> Manhattanites move? </p>

<p>The above I.R.S. graph is based on net migration and shows a clear trend; while Staten Island seems to be a last resort for the priced-out set, The Bronx has attracted more Manhattanites than Brooklyn since the beginning of the decade.</p><blockquote>From 2001 through 2006, over 23,380 Manhattanites relocated to the Bronx. <p></p>

<p>Every year, the Bronx led the three other outer boroughs in net gains of Manhattanites. That includes Brooklyn, traditionally perceived as the natural next stop in a priced-out Manhattanite&#x2019;s real estate evolution.</p></blockquote>Is it time to scan those Bronx <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221425/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/rfs/">real estate listings</a>? Maybe not. Just last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221425/http://westbronxnews.blogspot.com/2007/04/brokers-thoughts-on-bronx-real-estate.html">brokers seemed a bit concerned</a> and disenchanted about the borough&apos;s real estate bubble, one saying, &quot;The North Bronx north of Fordham Road is overrated. To me it doesn&apos;t make a difference if you are North or South Bronx, it is still low- to middle-income.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Prices are still on the rise, however -- in just one year (February 2007 to February 2008) condos in parts of The Bronx (&quot;Riverdale, Parkchester and Spuyten Duyvil are the three most popular Bronx neighborhoods for home seekers in New York City&quot;) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221425/http://www.multihousingnews.com/multihousing/content_display/industry-news/e3i971e2029d1878b2a265116b6adf80682">went up 11%</a>. </p>

<p>Before packing your bags, there could be a better borough for you; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221425/http://nymag.com/realestate/vu/2008/04/45967/">NYMag</a> recently checked out Suburban Jungle Realty, which is like a dating service but for homeowners and cities -- will you and The Bronx fall in love?</p>
