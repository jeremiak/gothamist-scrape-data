<p>We&apos;re back with yet <em>another</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094452/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">Guess The Year</a> challenge, with a focus on one of our favorite subjects: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094452/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/15/have_you_seen_any_suburban_homes_in.php">suburban homes in NYC</a>. There aren&apos;t too many clues pointing towards what era this was taken in, however, so let&apos;s focus more on location this time. Can you guess what borough, or even better, what neighborhood this is? </p>

<p>We&apos;ll update later with the answer, down to the exact address, as well as the date and the current street view. (P.S. If you cheat, we won&apos;t get mad, but we WILL be disappointed in you.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 5:10 p.m.:</strong> This photo was taken in 1937, at 805 27th Avenue (at 9th Street) in Astoria, Queens. The area now looks something more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094452/http://binged.it/NVL5SZ">like this</a>: </p>

<p>The photo is from the New York Public Library, and you can see some more photos from that area in 1937 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115094452/http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?keyword=astoria+queens+1937&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0">in their collection</a>.</p>
