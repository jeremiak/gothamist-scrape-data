										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hammgram0112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831012332im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hammgram0112.jpeg" width="640" height="514" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It&apos;s nearly Valentine&apos;s Day, and nothing says romance like the adulterous Don Draper of <em>Mad Men</em>. Enter: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831012332/http://hammogram.com/">Hamm-O-Gram</a>! These people are offering to send you, or the one you love, a Hamm-centric love note for five bucks a pop. They say the Hamm-o-gram is &quot;like a classic telegram, where you send a special someone a transcribed message, usually in letter form. Except this message is always a picture of handsome actor Jon Hamm (with a lil&apos; somethin&apos; extra).&quot; </p>

<p>They wouldn&apos;t send us a real example, only the above, noting, &quot;for your own safety, this Hamm-O-Gram has been simulated. Were we to send you a photo of an actual Hamm-O-Gram... you&apos;d dissolve into a sweaty ball of writhing sexual energy, and who can get work done in that state!&quot; TRY US. </p>

<p>While you can most definitely create a Hamm-o-gram yourself (send us one please?), a portion of the $5 you shell out will go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831012332/http://www.acaringhand.org/">A Caring Hand</a>.</p>
