<p>The Brooklyn native, and unapologetic porn pioneer behind <em>Screw</em> magazine, Al Goldstein, died in New York this morning at the age of 77. He had been in a New York hospital this week, and his lawyer, Charles C. DeStefano, said the cause may have been renal failure. Goldstein was no stranger to health problems (suffering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045410/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/70052/">a stroke</a> and a seizure in the past ten years). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045410/http://www.theawl.com/2013/12/al-goldstein-1936-2013">The Awl</a> described the almost indescribable Goldstein as &quot;an incredibly intelligent and hilarious man crippled by self-hatred, an inside-out Woody Allen, a lecherous troll from out of the Qumran caves.&quot;</p>

<p>There was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045410/http://observer.com/2013/12/al-goldstein-is-not-dead/">some confusion</a> earlier this week when Goldstein&apos;s friend, Penn Jillette from Penn &amp; Teller (who paid for Goldstein&apos;s old Staten Island apartment), Tweeted that he was visiting him &quot;as he dies in the hospital&quot;: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&apos;m in NYC. Today I visited my hero and friend Al Goldstein as he dies in the hospital, and tomorrow night I celebrate Lou Reed&apos;s Life.

<p>He later explained that Goldstein had not yet passed, but was not doing well: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>My buddy and hero, Al Goldstein is NOT dead. He is unresponsive and not doing well, but he is alive. Try to stop the rumors. Thanks.</p>&#x2014; Penn Jillette (@pennjillette) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045410/https://twitter.com/pennjillette/statuses/412626933701025792">December 16, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>When his magazine debuted in 1968, the manifesto was unyielding&#x2014;it read, in part: &#x201C;We promise never to ink out a pubic hair or chalk out an organ. We will apologize for nothing. We will uncover the entire world of sex. We will be the Consumer Reports of sex.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But Goldstein had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045410/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/books/review/Heller.html?pagewanted=all">quite a life</a> even before his dirty mag days: &quot;Before founding <em>Screw</em>, Goldstein was a radio car driver for Walter Winchell, a photographer for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (he was once jailed in Havana), a press photographer for Pakistan International Airlines (he accompanied Jackie Kennedy on her goodwill tour of Pakistan in 1962), and an industrial spy for a large corporation.&quot; He also turned up on New York&apos;s public access channels, later in life:</p>

<p>His life was filled with many ups and downs and twisted turns, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045410/http://www.amazon.com/I-Goldstein-My-Screwed-Life/dp/1560258683">enough for a book</a>, and at different points he found himself living on a floor in Queens, a VA hospital, Rikers, a townhouse on East 61st Street, Florida (where a lawn statue was in the shape of a middle finger), the aforementioned Staten Island apartment, and a nursing home in Cobble Hill.</p>
