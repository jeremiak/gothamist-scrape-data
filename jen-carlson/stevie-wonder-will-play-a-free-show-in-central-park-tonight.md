<p>Stevie Wonder is headed back out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083703/http://www.jambase.com/Articles/126162/Tour-Dates-Stevie-Wonder-Songs-In-The-Key-Of-Life-Fall-Tour">on tour</a> this fall, with a stop at Madison Square Garden on November 24th (tickets on sale this Friday). This is technically an extension of his Songs In The Key Of Life tour that started last year. Before the next set of big shows, however, he&apos;s doing a few promotional pop-up shows&#x2014; one took place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083703/http://dcist.com/2015/08/stevie_wonder_to_play_free_concert.php">in D.C. this morning</a>, another in Philly this afternoon, and finally he&apos;ll hit Summerstage in Central Park tonight at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The shows are free, but tickets will be needed&#x2014;a ticket link is expected to go live shortly, and we&apos;ll update here when it does. (Update: <strike><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083703/https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/937107">tickets will be here</a>.</strike> Tickets sold out in 30 seconds.)</p>

<p>Wonder has been a master of promotion since the 1970s, when he decorated Times Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083703/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/12/stevie_wonder_vintage_promo.php">with this colorful billboard</a> and brought the press up to a Massachusetts recording studio to hear his new album, <em>Songs In The Key Of Life</em>.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a full performance from 1972, but only expect a few songs in Central Park tonight... unless he ends the day with a full set.</p>
