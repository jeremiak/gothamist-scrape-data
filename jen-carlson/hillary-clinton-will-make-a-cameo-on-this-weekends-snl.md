<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="phphlfy2ZAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209185853im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phphlfy2ZAM.jpg" width="350" height="338"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Poehler as Hillary and Hillary as Hillary</i></div> There have been a lot Hillary Clintons on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209185853/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>SNL</em></a>. Jan Hooks, Ana Gasteyer, Amy Poehler, and most recently Kate McKinnon have impersonated Clinton on the show&#x2014;portraying Hillary as First Lady, Hillary running for Senate, Hillary the Senator, Hillary the Secretary of State, and now (again) Hillary the Presidential candidate. <p></p>

<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209185853/http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/07/07/cnn-exclusive-hillary-clintons-first-national-interview-of-2016-race/">CNN asked</a> who did her favorite portrayal: &quot;You&#x2019;re not going to get me to pick one or the other. I think I&#x2019;m the best Hillary Clinton, to be honest.&quot; (See McKinnon&apos;s below.) And indeed, Clinton herself has already appeared as herself on the show, alongside Tina Fey&apos;s Sarah Palin and Poehler&apos;s Clinton in 2008. And this Saturday she is scheduled to return.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209185853/http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/01/hillary-clinton-saturday-night-live/?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">the NY Times</a>, the &quot;top-secret appearance&quot; has not been confirmed by her campaign, but she allegedly &quot;turned down the chance to give the keynote address to the influential Human Rights Campaign&quot; in order to make it happen. </p>

<p>On the show, she will reportedly play herself alongside McKinnon&apos;s Hillary during the cold open&#x2014;the Times reports, &quot;In the proposed skit, Mrs. Clinton would likely poke fun at herself for trying to appear more authentic while carefully plotting her path to the presidency.&quot;</p>
