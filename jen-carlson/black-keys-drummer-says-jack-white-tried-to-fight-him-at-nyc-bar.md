<p>Over the weekend, Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney claimed, through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222054514/http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/09/jack-white-the-black-keys-patrick-carney-fight/">a series of tweets</a>, that Jack White tried to fight him while he was at his favorite NYC bar.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I&apos;ve never met Jack White. Until last night. He came to a bar in NYC I go to a lot with a few friends and tried to fight me. I don&apos;t fight and don&apos;t get fighting, but he was mad!!! He is why I play music. The bully assholes who made me feel like nothing. Music was a private non-competitive thing. Not the best drummer, but a passionate one. But anyway, Jack White. A 40-year-old bully tried to fight the 35-year-old nerd. It might get loud, but it might also get really really sad and pathetic. Basically Billy Corgan&#x2019;s dumb-ass Zero t-shirt in human form.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>In response, White released a statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222054514/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/14/patrick-carney-jack-white-fight-nyc-bar">to EW</a>, directed at Carney: &#x201C;Nobody tried to fight you, Patrick. Nobody touched you or &#x2018;bullied&#x2019; you. You were asked a question you couldn&#x2019;t answer so you walked away. So quit whining to the Internet and speak face to face like a human being. End of story.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Carney has now taken down all of the tweets except one, and on Monday morning he tweeted that he talked to White for an hour and: &quot;he&apos;s cool... all good.&quot;</p>

<p>White also addressed the incident on Twitter, saying he had respect for Carney as a musician:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#x201C;From one musician to another, you have my respect Patrick Carney.&#x201D; -Jack White</p>&#x2014; Third Man Records (@thirdmanrecords) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222054514/https://twitter.com/thirdmanrecords/status/643447376770797568">September 14, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>This is just the latest in a see-saw feud between the musicians, which began in 2013 when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222054514/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jack-white-slams-black-keys-frontman-in-leaked-emails-20130802">emails written by White were leaked</a> during his legal issues with ex-wife Karen Elson, who was attempting to get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222054514/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/05/jack-white-karen-elson-countermotion">a restraining order</a> at the time. The emails read, in part, &quot;My concern with [Keys&apos; frontman Dan] Auerbach is because I don&apos;t want the kids involved in any of that crap. That&apos;s a possible 12 fucking years I&apos;m going to have to be sitting in kids chairs next to that asshole with other people trying to lump us in together. He gets yet another free reign to follow me around and copy me and push himself into my world.&quot;</p>

<p>A year later he <em>sort of</em> apologized during an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222054514/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jack-white-apologizes-to-black-keys-meg-white-in-detailed-letter-20140531">Rolling Stone</a>, where he said, &quot;I wish the band the Black Keys all the success that they can get.&quot;</p>
