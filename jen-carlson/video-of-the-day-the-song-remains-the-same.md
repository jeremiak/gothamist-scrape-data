										<p>As Led Zeppelin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175714/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/arts/music/13zepp.html?hp">announced last week</a> that they would play a reunion show in London, those outside of the UK wonder if they&apos;ll embark on a worldwide reunion tour. The one-off show is in honor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175714/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/15/ahmet_ertegun_1.php">Ahmet Ertegun</a>, and will include John Bonham&apos;s son Jason on drums. </p>

<p>The band is no stranger to New York, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175714/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/16/physical_graffi_1.php">one of their album covers</a> was shot on St. Mark&apos;s Place, and their 1976-released live concert film was comprised of three shows at Madison Square Garden. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175714/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_Remains_the_Same_%28film%29#Original_filming">Apparently</a> &quot;the band members wore exactly the same clothes to facilitate seamless editing of the film, except for John Paul Jones who wore three different sets of attire on each of these nights, which created continuity problems.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175714/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075244"><em>The Song Remains the Same</em></a> could now be more than just a song, album and concert film -- it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy if they come back singing all the same tunes. Here&apos;s a clip from that show...</p>

<p>Some more footage from a February 7th, 1975 show in New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7FewICETyA">is here</a>. Let&apos;s hope they make it back, even if it won&apos;t <em>really</em> be the same.</p>
