<p>Crest, the best hardware store/art hub in the world, is hosting their 2nd Annual Pumpkin Carving Contest and Party tomorrow night. The event is free if you aren&apos;t carving a pumpkin, and in return <em>for nothing</em> you&apos;ll get free drinks, free food (from the Meat Hook), and music. For those who want to try their hand at carving a pumpkin, it&apos;ll cost five bucks&#x2014;because there are sweet prizes at stake. Just don&apos;t pick up the carving knife if you&apos;ve had too many of those free drinks... did we mention there will be cider and rum?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224234410/http://cresthardwareartshow.com/wordpress/">More details here</a>! And we&apos;ll be there taking photos, so check back for that. This is also a good time to note that if you see any amazing jack o&apos; lanterns or Halloween decorations out there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224234410/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us a photo</a>, or tag your photo &quot;Gothamist&apos; on Flickr!</p>
