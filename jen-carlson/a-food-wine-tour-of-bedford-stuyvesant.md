It may come down to personal taste, and if you like really thin crust pizza, you may really enjoy it here. We can personally tell you that their brunch pizza (who doesn\'t love a pizza with an egg on it?) is pretty great, and affordable, and their sandwiches are even better. Just be sure to dine in, as they don\'t excel at delivery.\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\n\<em\>Nice PIzza is located at 340 Franklin Avenue\<\/em\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_11'] = photo;</script>
