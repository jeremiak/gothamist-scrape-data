Stop feeding them! Senator Bill Perkins reminds: &quot;Rats don&apos;t grow the food that they eat on the subway, and they don&apos;t buy it, either. We as customers, unfortunately, are the ones that are feeding, and thereby breeding the rodent infestation problem we have.&quot; Perkins has been rallying for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170215/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/01/can_we_conquer_rats_by_banning_food.php">ban on food</a> in the subway system, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170215/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/129581/straphangers--habits-feeding-subway-rat-population--officials-say">NY1</a> visits his fears that MTA  budget cuts, and no food ban, could lead to a real <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170215/http://gothamist.com/tags/ratdemic">ratdemic</a>.<p></p>

<p>The MTA has cut down on cleaning crews in the subway system, and now there are fewer than 1500, a 4% cut from last year... and with these cuts they expect things to get dirtier. So now it&apos;s up to us (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170215/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/train_pigs.php">and these people</a>)&#x2014;a new ad campaign is rolling out and it&apos;s aimed at the everyday straphanger, though NYC Transit president Thomas Prendergast notes that &quot;customers don&apos;t like to hear that they&apos;re, quote-unquote, the cause of the problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Prendergast added that &quot;There&apos;s a lot of difficult jobs in New York City Transit, and the cleaner&apos;s job is one of the most difficult ones.&quot; And as a Union rep pointed out to NY1: &quot;I want the riders to understand, that sometimes you see a cleaner trying to catch his breath or taking a break, it&apos;s because he or she is truly overworked.&quot; Indeed... but do you think they snack down there during their breaks?</p>
