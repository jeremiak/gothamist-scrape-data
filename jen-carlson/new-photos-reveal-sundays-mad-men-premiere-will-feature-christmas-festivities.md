</div></div>					<p>We&apos;re less than a week away from the two-hour season premiere of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145445/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, and since Matthew Weiner decided against sending out screeners to the press this year, we&apos;re left to pick up every crumb of a clue he tosses on the internet. The latest is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145445/http://blogs.amctv.com/photo-galleries/mad-men-season-6-episode-photos/episode-1-2-don.php">this series of photos</a> from the premiere, which very clearly show that we&apos;ll be joining up with Don Draper and friends during Christmastime... <em>but of what year?</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145445/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/things_to_remember_from_the_last_se.php">As we&apos;ve pointed out already</a>, when we left the Mad Men last it was March 1967, and Weiner has said, &#x201C;I am going to skip ahead in time. I won&#x2019;t say how long, but the first two episodes are a movie unto themselves. And they do foreshadow what&#x2019;s going to happen in the season. They do tell a story of the period and root you where you are in these people&#x2019;s lives. But a lot has changed when the season opens up. A lot has changed.&#x201D; So far teaser photos released by AMC and some paparazzi shots still have the cast firmly planted in the late 1960s... but what we&apos;ve seen so far could be photos from <em>just the premiere</em>, as these are, and it&apos;s possible after the premiere we&apos;ll jump further ahead in time.</p>

<p>Click through for a look at the cast as you&apos;ll see them in the premiere&#x2014;which is called &quot;The Doorway&quot;&#x2014;on Sunday... both Roger and Sneaky Pete are sporting sick sideburns!</p>
