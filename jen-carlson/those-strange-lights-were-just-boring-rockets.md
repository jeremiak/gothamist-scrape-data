title: Those Strange Lights Were Just Boring Rockets

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_9_rocket.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131729im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2009_9_rocket.jpg" width="224" height="219" class="image-left"> </span>There was a lot of chatter about strange lights in the sky last night, from the Bowery to Queens, with one tipster saying, &quot;My boyfriend and I were eating dinner on our roof across from the New Museum and saw a strong point of light that slowly emitted a wash of light that grew then receded until it totally faded away. It was definitely NOT a chopper plane or anything we&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; This took place around 8 p.m., prime time for an alien invasion. </p>

<p>Leave it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131729/http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/20/strange.lights/index.html?eref=rss_topstories">to CNN</a> to kill the buzz for E.T. hopefuls; this morning they report that while the &quot;series of spooky lights above parts of the northeastern United States Saturday sparked a flurry of phone calls to authorities&quot; it was just a little ol&apos; rocket experiment, according to NASA. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re thinking a government subsidized rocket experiment is even more terrifying than our Alien Overlords making contact, or that this is all <em>a lie</em>, look into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131729/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5c70kyT4UI">this spinning wheel</a> and rest assured; &quot;Keith Koehler said the Black Brant XII Suborbital Sounding Rocket was launched to study the Earth&apos;s highest clouds. The light came from an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket&apos;s fourth stage about 173 miles high.&quot; Rest easy Americans, no aliens to see here. Conspiracy theorists welcome in the comments section...</p>
