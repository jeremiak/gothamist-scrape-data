<p>Hey guys, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s in town doing that month-long, open-air art show that you&apos;ve been reading about here and everywhere&#x2014;this is a really fun, well done, free, street art scavenger hunt <em>so just try to enjoy it.</em> A new piece is going up every day, and Banksy has been lurking in the shadows amongst us this whole time (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/new_dramatic_banksy_piece_goes_up_o.php#photo-1">working under tarps</a> just before dawn to get the pieces up)&#x2014;but until now, no one&apos;s heard from him. </p>

<p>The man of mystery (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/388008246943809536">is maybe a woman</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1034538/Graffiti-artist-Banksy-unmasked---public-schoolboy-middle-class-suburbia.html">QUESTION EVERYTHING</a>) just did a very rare interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140/http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-10-09/art/banksy-better-out-than-in-new-york-residency-street-art-graffiti">the Village Voice</a>. Here&apos;s what we learned: </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smbushwick1013.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smbushwick1013.jpg" width="350" height="288" class="image-right"> </span><strong>THIS MONTH LONG SHOW IS ... FOR FUN (As It Should Be)</strong>: &quot;There is absolutely no reason for doing this show at all. I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached. There&apos;s no gallery show or book or film. It&apos;s pointless. Which hopefully means something.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>BANKSY LIVES HERE (FOR) NOW:</strong> He won&apos;t say where <em>obviously</em>, but so far all of his pieces have been downtown or in Brooklyn.</p>

<p><strong>SPOTS ARE PICKED ON A WHIM:</strong> While there was a plan to use specific spots, which were scouted out months ago, some of the city&apos;s streetscape had already changed by the time Banksy was ready to start the show. So now &quot;the plan is to live here, react to things, see the sights&#x2014;and paint on them. Some of it will be pretty elaborate, and some will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall.&quot; And the pieces aren&apos;t totally premeditated either: &quot;To be honest... I&apos;m figuring a lot of this out as I go along. Which is one way to keep it fresh, I suppose. The idea to make a stencil saying &apos;The Musical&apos; only came up when I saw the &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/new_banksy_goes_up_in_bushwick.php">Occupy&apos; graffiti</a>.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>HE&apos;S NOT SELF-DISSING:</strong> While some think Banksy ruins his own pieces, he says, &quot;I&apos;m not defacing my own pictures, no. I used to think other graffiti writers hated me because I used stencils, but they just hate me.&quot; Most of his pieces here have been immediately tagged or buffed. This morning a reader sent us this photo of his Red Hook piece, which has now been plexiglassed... sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072140/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/08/the_guy_who_keeps_tagging_the_banks.php">after Omar tagged it</a>:</p>

<p><strong>ON &quot;SELLING OUT&quot;:</strong> &quot;I started painting on the street because it was the only venue that would give me a show. Now I have to keep painting on the street to prove to myself it wasn&apos;t a cynical plan. There&apos;s no way round it&#x2014;commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist. We&apos;re not supposed to be embraced in that way. When you look at how society rewards so many of the wrong people, it&apos;s hard not to view financial reimbursement as a badge of self-serving mediocrity.&quot; (He goes more in depth about this in the interview.)</p>

<p><strong>ON NEW YORK CITY:</strong> &quot;New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse. We all want to prove ourselves here. I chose it for the high foot traffic and the amount of hiding places. Maybe I should be somewhere more relevant, like Beijing or Moscow, but the pizza isn&apos;t as good.&quot;</p>
