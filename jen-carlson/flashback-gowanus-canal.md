</div></div>					<p>Sure, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142816/http://gothamist.com/tags/gowanuscanal">Gowanus Canal</a> may be a pollution-plagued strip of water running through Brooklyn <em>now</em>, but it used to be a busy cargo transportation hub! And before the canal, early settlers farmed on the shorelines of what they called &quot;Gowanes Creek&quot; after Gouwane, sachem of the Canarsee, a local Lenape tribe. Some older facts about the now-Superfunded Canal:</p>

<ul><li>New York Legislature authorized the construction of the Gowanus Canal in 1849
</li><li>The Gowanus Creek had to be dredged to create the Canal, which could not begin until 1867
</li><li>United States Army Corps of Engineers Major David Douglas was hired to design the (1.8 mile long) canal, which was complete by 1869
</li><li>By 1910, one local described the water as &#x201C;almost solid&#x201D; with sewage (the next year a flushing tunnel was created)
</li><li>As the South Brooklyn region grew, waste water sanitation became an issue, and at one point all the sewage from buildings drained downhill into the Gowanus
</li><li>Industrial pollutants, storm run-off and sewage filled the Canal, which locals at the time dubbed &quot;Lavender Lake&quot; because of its unnatural color
</li><li>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was the first site where chemical fertilizers were manufactured
</li><li>The body of water was dredged daily to keep waters navigable, a system that was abandoned in 1955 due to the cost
</li><li>The Canal now has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142816/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">gonohorrea</a></li></ul>

<p>This timeline <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142816/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/57886/">in NYMag</a> tracks the pollution piling up in the water, and you can take a more in-depth look at the Canal at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142816/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/gowanuscanal/gowanuscanal.html">Forgotten-NY</a>, where there are more current photos of the area (including a look at the pumping station that was eventually built).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Brooklyn Public Library asked we take down their photos, so check out the rest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142816/http://iii.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/search/X?SEARCH=gowanus+canal&amp;m=k&amp;SORT=R">here</a>.</p>
