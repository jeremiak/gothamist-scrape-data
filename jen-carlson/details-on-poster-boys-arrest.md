First off, they identified the street artist as 27-year-old Henry Matyjewicz, and go on to report that he &quot;was busted after an undercover officer overheard him bragging to a girl about his exploits at a party.&quot; That&apos;s so 21 Jump Street! Allegedly he was held on $750 bail and &quot;charged with counts of criminal mischief, graffiti and possessing a tool to make graffiti. He was also held on a warrant for shoplifting in Manhattan last August, court records show.&quot; When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085429/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/posterboy_street_artist.php">we talked to him</a> a week before this incident, we asked if he&apos;d ever been arrested&#x2014;he told us, &quot;Yeah. Never for art related crimes though. What have I gotten away with? That&apos;s the real question.&quot; What happens now? Our sources tell us that things should settle down &quot;in a couple of weeks.&quot;</p>
