Seems the neighborhood still has its drug roots, the addicts just have Oscars on their mantles now. </p>

<p>Last year O&apos;Neal landed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140725044842/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001575">a role on <em>Rescue Me</em></a> playing Denis Leary&apos;s alcoholic sister, and reportedly nailed down some other on-screen work as well; she credited her turn-around to leaving Los Angeles. So when she was caught just blocks from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140725044842/http://www.forwardbuilding.net/">her Lower East Side luxury condo</a> buying drugs at 7:30 p.m. last night, she told the officers &quot;I&apos;m researching a part - I&apos;m doing this for a part.&quot;</p><blockquote>&quot;The source said detectives found a pipe on O&apos;Neal, daughter of actor Ryan O&apos;Neal. The pipe and screen were clean.<p></p>

<p>&quot;Then she said she&apos;d been clean for two years, and that she&apos;d just came out today,&quot; the source said.</p>

<p>&quot;Can&apos;t we just forget about this?&quot; the sources said she begged detectives.</p></blockquote>Hauled off from Clinton and Grand Streets to the Seventh Precinct, she was reportedly held overnight in custody and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, as her dealer was charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance.<p></p>

<p>The now 44-year-old O&apos;Neal first burst onto the scene in her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140725044842/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070510/awards">Oscar-winning role</a> in <em>Paper Moon</em> at just 10 years old, but was also being raised in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140725044842/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6254330">chaotic, drug-fueled atmosphere</a>. After her divorce from John McEnroe in 1992, he received custody of their three children as O&apos;Neal developed a heroin problem. </p>
