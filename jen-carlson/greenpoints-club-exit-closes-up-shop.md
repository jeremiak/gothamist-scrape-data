Owner Mariusz Kupiec told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628042811/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/3/33_03_ac_club_exit.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re just tired with the scene.&quot; That scene has become a rowdy one over the years, with regulars even admitting &quot;they&#x2019;ve come to expect a punch or two thrown by closing time every weekend.&quot; Recently those punches have, at times, even escalated into gunfire! Perhaps the next person to take over the space should turn it into a tea lounge or yoga studio.</p>
