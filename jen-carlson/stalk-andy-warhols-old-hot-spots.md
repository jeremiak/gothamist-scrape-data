<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001543/http://gothamist.com/tags/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a> scholar Thomas Kiedrowski is launching a new walking tour series based around the artist titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001543/http://newyork.untappedcities.com/2011/10/02/untapped-exclusive-group-andy-warhol-sites-tours-with-thomas-kiedrowski/">Andy Warhol&#x2019;s New York City: Four Walks, Uptown to Downtown</a>. According to Untapped (who are collaborating with Kiedrowski), it&apos;s all about &quot;bringing enthusiasts to sites Andy Warhol frequented, lived or worked. See Warhol&#x2019;s Factories, galleries that launched his career, places where he dined and shopped and former homes of his friends such as Halston and Edie Sedgwick.&quot;</p>

<p>The three hour tour costs a whopping 50 bucks, and will take place on Saturday, October 15th (rain or shine), with the group meeting at a secret location at noon that day. Only 15 people will be accepted for the tour, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001543/http://newyork.untappedcities.com/2011/10/02/untapped-exclusive-group-andy-warhol-sites-tours-with-thomas-kiedrowski/">act now</a> if you want in. Or you could just buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001543/http://www.littlebookroom.com/warholnyc.html">Kiedrowski&apos;s book</a> and go on your own adventure.</p>
