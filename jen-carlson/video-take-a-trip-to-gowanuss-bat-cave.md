										<p>Over the summer Max Touhey delivered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020421/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/gorgeous_radiohead-soundtracked_vid.php">a gorgeous video</a> of the soon-to-be-demolished <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020421/http://gothamist.com/tags/admiralsrow">Admiral&apos;s Row</a>, set to the sounds of Radiohead. Now Touhey has sent us over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020421/https://vimeo.com/49752542">his latest work</a>, which stars the Rapid Transit Central Power House in Gowanus, better known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020421/http://www.bluejake.com/2010/02/return-to-the-batcave.html">the &quot;Bat Cave.&quot;</a> Look out for cameos from the Simpsons, a raccoon, and hypodermic needles! Your musical companions this time around are Ratatat: </p>

<p>Touhey tells us, &quot;It&apos;s not as easy as it used to be [to get inside] but I&apos;ve found that where there&apos;s a will, there&apos;s a way. Going on the Gowanus Canal side I think is easiest but the tradeoff is sizable because I always risk falling into the grimy canal. It hasn&apos;t happened yet though!&quot;</p>
