<p>An internet meme has met the MTA, albeit briefly. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153854/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/20/mta_to_cut_v_line_save_some_buses.php">new changes to the transit system</a> led to new signs marking some stations, the agency was forced to put the letters F, M, and L together at 14th Street and 6th Avenue. Surely, this wasn&apos;t the first time the letters FML met the letters MTA&#x2014;though until now they&apos;ve likely only come together in straphanger&apos;s heads or transmitted through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153854/http://twitter.com/KyleEllis/status/14984912439">Twitter feeds</a>&#x2014;but the agency doesn&apos;t seem to want it so, you know, <em>in your face</em>. And with that, NYCT&apos;s Charles Seaton told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153854/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/on-second-thought/">CityRoom</a>, &#x201C;As soon as we became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153854/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20007547-36.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20">aware of it</a>, we were going to change it. We thought there was a certain population out there who might recognize it, even though we didn&#x2019;t, obviously.&#x201D; </p>

<p>He also noted that the cost would be minimal, and that they&apos;ll just move the L stickers below the F and M. But, but... <em>how will that fit</em>?</p>
