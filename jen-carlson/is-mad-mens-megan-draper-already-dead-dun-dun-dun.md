<p>This is the season of conspiracy theories on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235146/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>. Who is Bob Benson? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235146/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/a_mad_men_conspiracy_theory_is_mega.php">Is Megan Draper Sharon Tate?</a> Is Don dead? And now: <em>Is Megan Draper dead?</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235146/http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2013/06/reading-too-much-into-mad-men-evidence-that-megan-draper-is-already-dead/">Dustin Rowles of Uproxx</a> went down the rabbit hole and makes a pretty convincing argument that Don&apos;s wife has been dead this whole season, a theory that&apos;s been batted around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235146/http://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/">certain corners</a> of the internet since the season&apos;s first episode, set in Hawaii. (Or Heaven. Or Hell.) Even if you don&apos;t believe the hype, it&apos;s sort of fun to dip your toes into the dark side, so here are the Cliffs Notes on this latest theory (beware spoilers if you aren&apos;t caught up):</p>

<ul><li>Don has always hallucinated the dead (his brother, Anna Draper), and in this week&apos;s episode he not only hallucinated Private Dinkins, but also Megan. Is he dead himself in this scene, while face down in the swimming pool? Is he high and just hash-hallucinating Megan? Is Megan dead and coming to him in a vision? Oh god this is already <em>so tiring</em>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In that scene, Megan tells Don, &quot;I live here.&quot; Where? <em>The afterlife maybe.</em>
</li><li>In next week&apos;s scenes, Megan shows up, but you <em>could</em> view her appearances as someone who is already dead. Don seems surprised to see her in their apartment. She&apos;s wearing red and black, the colors of violence and death, and also the colors of Lane&apos;s tie in the episode where he commits suicide. Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235146/http://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1fstlw/what_i_noticed_about_megans_appearance_in_the/">one Redditor</a> believes it may be a flashback scene.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Also in the upcoming episode, someone is shown at the apartment door, which Don opens. Rowles wonders: &quot;Could be Dr. Rosen, coming to offer his condolences, or perhaps a detective, coming to ask questions about the murder, or worse: Revealing to Don what he was just informed by the hallucination of Megan. &apos;Mr. Draper, did you know that your wife was pregnant?&apos;&quot;
</li><li>If she is dead, she likely only just died when Don was in California, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235146/http://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1frljv/compelling_evidence_megan_is_already_dead/">one Redditor</a> theorizes that &quot;if she was murdered, it will be more along the lines of the murder of Kitty Genovese,&quot; who was killed in her New York apartment complex in 1964, after none of her neighbors called the police. The poster also points out that  a NY Times article from that time, called &quot;Thirty-Eight Who Saw Murder Didn&apos;t Call the Police,&quot; was written <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235146/http://poeticjustice1101.blogspot.com/2012/10/thirty-eight-who-saw-murder-didnt-call.html">by Martin Gansburg</a>. You know, ALMOST JUST LIKE MICHAEL GINSBERG.
</li><li>So if Megan was murdered, who did it? Grandma Ida? Dr. Rosen? Bob Benson? <em>Betty?</em></li></ul>

<p>The season is definitely heavy on death and the second chances <em>thing</em>, regardless of any conspiracy theories. And in &quot;reality,&quot; these characters are probably all still alive and will just go through the normal ups and downs of life until eventually dying, alone, as we all will (spoiler). So let&apos;s focus on the living: Why isn&apos;t anyone talking about Ginsberg probably being a schizophrenic?</p>
