<p>Luckily, we can never tire of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171452/http://gothamist.com/tags/muppets">the Muppets</a>, so it&apos;s totally fine with us that they&apos;ve been jamming this new movie down our throats for nearly a year now. In their latest move to captivate the audience prior to the big opening day (Thanksgiving), the fun-loving creatures have channeled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171452/http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/1132049/exclusive_the_muppets_do_twilight_in_three_new_posters.html">their darker side</a>. Their new posters have them dressed up as characters from another movie coming out <em>this</em> week, <em>Twilight: Breaking Dawn</em>, which our little cousin tells us is the first part of the two part big screen finale for that series. Are you on Team Edward, or Team Green (that&apos;s Kermit, of course)? </p>

<p>Before their big screen return, you can still catch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171452/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/13/in_which_we_enter_jim_hensons_fanta.php">the Muppets at the Museum of Moving Image</a>, through January 16th.</p>
