<p>Sometimes it feels as though iPhones are being wasted on the wrong generation, something that becomes quite apparent when you search YouTube for any concert footage before the device became ubiquitous. What if those who stood in front of stages in the 1960s and &apos;70s were holding up the glowing mechanism to capture a legend-in-the-making playing an intimate show? Sure, it would have taken away from those experiencing the moment, <em>but at least we&apos;d be able to see it now</em>. On the other hand, it&apos;s the rarity of videos like the one below, showing a young <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145733/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> strumming his acoustic in 1972 New York City, that makes them even more amazing&#x2014;a treasure in the black hole of the internet, and something you don&apos;t see every day.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145733/http://www.openculture.com/2013/02/watch_bruce_springsteen_perform_growin_up_as_an_opening_act.html">OpenCulture</a>, this video was shot at Max&apos;s Kansas City in 1972, when Springsteen was the solo opening act for folk godfather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145733/http://gothamist.com/tags/InsideLlewynDavis">Dave Van Ronk</a>. After Sam Hood (who booked the venue) introduces the &quot;very special talent,&quot; you&apos;ll hear him playing &quot;Henry Boy,&quot; which the 23-year-old tells the audience is about &quot;being new in town.&quot; That song is followed by &quot;Growin&apos; Up,&quot; which appeared on his debut studio album, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145733/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greetings_from_Asbury_Park,_N.J."><em>Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ</em></a>, the next year.</p>

<p>This is apparently the only footage from the show that night, August 10th&#x2014;to be exact, which Doris Abrahams also performed at.</p>
