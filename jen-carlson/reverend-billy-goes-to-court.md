<p>Yesterday the Rev faced the judge and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529170021/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/nyregion/26billy.html?ref=nyregion">The NY Times</a> reports that in court &quot;the prosecutor told Judge Tanya Kennedy that Mr. Talen&#x2019;s offense had been to shout the familiar lines beginning with &apos;Congress shall make no law&apos; while standing just three feet from the officers, and to ignore their requests to stop. The prosecutor, Mary Weisgerber, said his behavior was &apos;obnoxious&apos; by any standard.&quot;</p>

<p>Talen defended himself with the aforementioned video, saying he was 15 feet away from the officers. Meanwhile his lawyers defended him saying harassment is defined as not having a legitimate purpose -- but reciting the First Amendment at a rally is quite legit. By the end of the day the district attorney&#x2019;s office was given until October 15th to respond, and a new court date is set for November 14th. If sentenced Reverend Billy could end up with 15 days in jail.</p>
