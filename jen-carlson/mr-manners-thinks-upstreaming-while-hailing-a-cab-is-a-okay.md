<p>Henry Alford, who has written for the New York Times and Vanity Fair, has just released his book on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111849/http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette">etiquette</a>, titled, <em>Would It Kill You to Stop Doing That: A Modern Guide to Manners</em>... and the New Yorker has some tips for his fellow urban dwellers. Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111849/http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/metrolife/would-it-kill-you-to-stop-doing-that-new-york/">Thirteen</a>, he got in to one of the most despicable actions one often witnesses on the streets of New York: upstreaming. You know, when you are trying to hail a cab and another person, or group of people, walk just ahead of you to hail one first (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111849/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/subway_11.php">teenagers</a> probably do this a lot). </p>

<p>Turns out, Alford thinks this is just fine, at least in certain cases. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>It is my belief that if indeed you are in great need of a cab&#x2014;you&#x2019;re late for an appointment, or it is raining, or it is two in the morning and you are standing on a dicey part of Flatbush&#x2014;then it is permissible to walk upstream of another party that is also hailing a cab, as long as you walk far enough upstream that that party cannot see you. Well, at least not glare at you.</blockquote>

<p>But... the person you are stealing a cab from is also standing in the rain on a dicey party of Flatbush!</p>
