---

<p>There&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141812/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/10/its_national_etiquette_week_be_nice.php">a lot of etiquette</a> that New Yorkers ignore day to day: from the subway, to the sidewalks (to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141812/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/lets_bring_back_these_anti-spitting.php">spitting on sidewalks</a>), to how to act in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141812/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/12/its_still_national_etiquette_week_h.php">museum</a>, to properly using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141812/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/13/its_still_national_etiquette_week_h_1.php">the office bathroom</a>.
