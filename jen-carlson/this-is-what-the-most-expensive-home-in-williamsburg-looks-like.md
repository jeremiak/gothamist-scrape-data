</div></div>					<p>The most expensive home <em>ever</em> in Williamsburg is reportedly housed inside of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022135/http://www.theoosten.com/">the Oosten</a>, at 429 Kent Avenue. </p>

<p>According to Halstead broker Robert Lynn, who shared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022135/https://www.halstead.com/sale/ny/brooklyn/williamsburg/429-kent-avenue/condo/13157721">the listing</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022135/http://nypost.com/2015/08/26/billyburg-penthouse-sets-neighborhood-record/">the Post</a>, the 5,000+ square-foot penthouse is in contract for its full asking price of $6.49 million. This would make it the priciest pad to ever sell in the neighborhood, if the deal goes through. One perk you get for that much money is an &quot;all expenses-paid trip to Amsterdam for a personal design consultation with Piet Boon.&quot; You also get two terraces, a hot tub, a garage, and go fuck yourself.   </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="PH315.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022135im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/PH315.jpg" width="640" height="214" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The Oosten&apos;s website further describes their duplex penthouse options as coming with &quot;5-6 bedrooms with en-suite baths... top-floor kitchens with terraces and plunge pools, and private elevators that take you down to your own private garage. The gracious master suite has his + hers closets.&quot; The building itself (which is an area that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022135/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/101_bedford_speedo_ready.php">likes its amenities</a>) has two lobbies, a 24-hour concierge, a courtyard, a landscaped rooftop with reflection pool, a lap pool, a gym, and a spa.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115022135/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/08/27/65m_oosten_penthouse_poised_to_set_a_williamsburg_record.php">Curbed</a> notes that the &quot;current record holder of Williamsburg&apos;s priciest home is 330 Wythe Avenue, where unit 8J sold in an off-market deal for $5 million last year.&quot; Pathetic.</p>
