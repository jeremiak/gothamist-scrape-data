<p>Could you imagine being in a plane, gazing out your window into the sky, and spotting the Aurora Borealis, flickering its hazy green hue right in front of you? That is THE DREAM. And it happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206190651/https://twitter.com/pcwilliams">Paul Williams</a> recently when he was flying from London to New York. Once he saw what was going on (which wasn&apos;t a total surprise to him, as he&apos;s a bit of an Aurora hunter and knew he may spot it while in flight), Williams &quot;balanced my camera on a rucksack and left it snapping away out the window.&quot; He left with nearly 800 photos, which he put together in this video... at one point, a meteor shoots through the sky, because life is magic.</p>
