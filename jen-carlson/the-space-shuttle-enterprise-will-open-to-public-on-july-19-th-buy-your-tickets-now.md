<p>The Space Shuttle Enterprise can still be seen (at least for the rest of this week) if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510023418/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/psa_you_can_still_see_the_shuttle.php">drive by the hangar</a> it&apos;s being housed in at JFK Airport. After that it will be prepared to make its move to the barge that will bring it down the Hudson River to the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum in June. But when will you be able to get an up close look at the big hunk of historic NASA machinery? The museum released a statement today announcing that the Shuttle will be on view to the public starting July 19th.</p>

<blockquote>The Space Shuttle Enterprise is scheduled to open to the public at its new home at the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum on Pier 86 on Thursday, July 19. <strong>Enterprise will be placed in a temporary, climate-controlled and fully-accessible Space Pavilion located on Intrepid&#x2019;s Flight Deck</strong> until a permanent exhibit facility is built.</blockquote>
