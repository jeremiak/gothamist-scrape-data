										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="dunhamgirls0412a.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224557im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/dunhamgirls0412a.jpeg" width="350" height="262" class="image-right"> </span>There is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224557/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-girls-20120413,0,7394163.story">smart criticism</a>, and there is Andrea Peyser at the NY Post. Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224557/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> and Judd Apatow&apos;s show <em>Girls</em> finally premiered on HBO, after months of hype-filled praise. And the show <em>does</em> live up to the hype, finally giving real, albeit privileged, &quot;girls&quot; a spotlight on the small screen. But Peyser is not a fan&#x2014;in her latest vitriolic rant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224557/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/you_go_girls_far_far_away_AW8AH7YeDPQfBWdRzLLQ9K#ixzz1sDfY8CQU">Peyser calls the show</a>  &quot;<em>Sex And The City</em> for ugly people,&quot; and the show&apos;s creator and star, Lena Dunham, &quot;a fat chick.&quot; Some of her more disgusting quotes are below:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;Somehow, she manages to beg the guy to engage in an ordinary sex act, which is visible to the viewer in all its dimpled ugliness.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;The true message behind &apos;Girls&apos; is: If you want to succeed in big, bad New York, you don&#x2019;t have to be beautiful or thin.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;One good thing might come of this &apos;realistic&apos; series: No girl from Podunk, Neb., will ever again dream of moving to this city.&quot;</li></ul>

<p><em>Someone&apos;s</em> got her granny panties in a bunch this morning! Peyser&apos;s main problem seems to be that &quot;a fat chick&quot; is getting laid, though she does touch upon &quot;every cast member [being] an heiress.&quot; And of course, there&apos;s always going to be backlash to something that&apos;s been dragged through the hype machine for months, but sprinkling your &quot;review&quot; with bold-print body-shaming and judging entertainment by the social background of the artists sure is a slippery slope.</p>

<p>(And if you missed the show, you can watch it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224557/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQfvq9RfM0">on Youtube</a>.)</p>
