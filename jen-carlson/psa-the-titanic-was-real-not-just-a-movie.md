<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141203064756/http://gothamist.com/tags/titanic">Titanic tragedy</a> will turn 100 years old this week, and all of the media coverage surrounding the sad anniversary seems to have shocked some people who never knew the Titanic was anything more than a movie. Below, a few gems from real life humans who have somehow escaped all knowledge of the historic event until recently&#x2014;prior to this month, they had no idea the ship was real, and that it sunk, like, IRL.
