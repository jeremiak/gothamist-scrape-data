title: Sound Fix Lounge is Closing, Again

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpFO9snNAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505174418im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpFO9snNAM.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="image-left"> </span>It seems like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505174418/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/18/sound_fix_shuts.php">just yesterday</a> that Sound Fix Lounge (the bar/venue attached to the record store) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505174418/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2009/01/soundfix_lounge.html">in Williamsburg</a> was being shut down, only to be joyously reopened soon after. Well kids, now your precious Sound Fix is being taken away again! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505174418/http://thecomicscomic.typepad.com/thecomicscomic/2009/01/sound-fix-is-the-new-rififi.html">Reportedly</a> &quot;the license to serve booze will go bye-bye a little over a month from now&quot; (and we all know comedy, nor music, work without alcohol). Word is that &quot;the owner simply didn&apos;t want to fight the neighbors on this any longer.&quot; One of whom is allegedly Teresa Polonski, who works for Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, and as speculated last time she may have brought the Mayor&apos;s task force down on the venue.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505174418/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/23/max_silvestri_comedian.php">Max Silvestri</a>, who draws a crowd there each week for his comedy night Big Terrific, confirmed that &quot;neighbors were not fans of a very quiet bar that always closed by midnight. It&apos;s a shame, because I think people were really starting to count on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505174418/http://www.soundfixrecords.com/pages/videos">Sound Fix Lounge</a> as a place to go for consistently great and surprising comedy. But twenty-somethings laughed and drank PBR before Sound Fix, and I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll keep doing that. We are definitely going to find a new home for Big Terrific. We&apos;re not sure where yet, but we hear Times Square is amazing and a perfect spot for alternative comedy.&quot; But that place isn&apos;t even off the L.</p>

<p>Expect a closing date sometime at the end of February. In the meantime, this Saturday you can catch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505174418/http://www.loneydear.com/">Loney, Dear</a> (seriously one of the quietest bands on earth) play for free at the lounge. They&apos;ll go on early (like many acts there have), so the performance will likely not even disturb Polonski as she washes the blood from her hands.</p>
