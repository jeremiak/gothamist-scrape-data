</div></div>					<p>Since bikes are on our brain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160130230002/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/map_of_the_day_here_are_your_citibi.php">today</a>, we thought we&apos;d dip into the NYC Municipal Archives again to check out some old school, two-wheelin&apos; New Yorkers. Click through for a look back at cyclists in 1927 through the &apos;40s, a good hundred years after the first bicycles were being introduced to the public (though who knows when that guy in photo #3 was riding around, there&apos;s no date given).</p>

<p>You won&apos;t notice many bike lanes in these photos, even though the city did have them back then&#x2014;Brooklyn&#x2019;s Ocean Parkway became home to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160130230002/http://www.nycbikemaps.com/spokes/ocean-parkway-bike-path/">the first bike lane</a> (it&apos;s still there) on June 15th, 1894.</p>

<p>Another fun fact: did you know that the bicycle was recognized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160130230002/http://www.annielondonderry.com/womenWheels.html">by 19th-century feminists and suffragists</a> as a &quot;freedom machine&quot; for women? In 1896, Susan B. Anthony told New York World, &quot;Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel... the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.&quot; The bike craze in the late 1800s also helped liberate women from corsets&#x2014;so ladies, hug a bicycle today for that.</p>
