<p>The elusive artist Yayoi Kusama has stepped out of the shadows and into a colorful spotlight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513003715/http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibition/yayoi-kusama-9/">at David Zwirner Gallery</a>. Her new exhibition is titled &quot;I Who Have Arrived in Heaven,&quot; and it just opened at the West 19th Street spot, where you&apos;ll find 27 new large-scale paintings, a video installation, and <em>two</em> infinity rooms. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513003715/http://www.wallpaper.com/art/yayoi-kusamas-i-who-have-arrived-in-heaven-at-david-zwirner-gallery-in-new-york/6935#w4SFDqufCmQfpe06.99">Wallpaper</a>, &quot;Unveiled for the first time, &apos;Infinity Mirrored Room&#x2014;The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away&apos; is a cube lined with mirrored panels and a reflecting-pool floor that rebound multicoloured light from suspended LEDs. The lights flicker on and off repeatedly, evoking the dual sentiments of time standing still and going on forever.&quot; There is another mirrored infinity room called &quot;Love Is Calling.&quot;</p>

<p>Nic Garcia stopped by and told us that the rooms are &quot;surreal and amazing! They&apos;re encased in mirrors. The light room you&apos;re only allowed in for 40 seconds, [it&apos;s] pretty spectacular&#x2014;it&apos;s so beautiful, especially the light show&quot; aspect. He added they&apos;re not as interactive as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513003715/http://gothamist.com/tags/rainroom">Rain Room</a>, but the Rain Room didn&apos;t have polka-dot tentacles! </p>

<p>There are lines for the exhibit, though, so they have that in common&#x2014;it will only be open through December 21st so go, go, Instagram!</p>
