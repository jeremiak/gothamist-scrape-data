They&apos;re asking for a 19% fare increase, on top of an increased base rate&#x2014;meaning you would rack up a $3 bill before the vehicle was even put into drive. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004146/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/05/2010-11-05_unfare_taxi_proposal_19_hike__53_to_jfk.html">the Daily News</a>, to put it in passenger terms, a 5-mile cab ride (which they describe as a trip to Times Square from the Financial District) would jump from $12 to $15.<p></p>

<p>A year ago there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004146/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/02/drivers_riders_call_fare_increase_u.php">an MTA surcharge</a> added to the base fee of a cab ride; this latest increase, however, was proposed by the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade&#x2014;though there&apos;s no guarantee their proposal will be passed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. The group represents 3,500 of the 13,000 yellow cabs in the city, and they say fare hikes are the only way to fix their budget gap. Sounds like someone is learning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004146/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/07/itll_take_a_lot_of_swipes_for_new_1.php">from the MTA</a>! </p>

<p>The group doesn&apos;t stop with the fare increase, however, they&apos;ve got a whole wish list&#x2014;if their proposal passes as is, here&apos;s what we&apos;re looking at:</p>

<ul><li>Getting a cab will cost $3, raised from $2.50 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004146/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/raising_hail_for_riders_ldnZNyGWB11XQLlHAlKq0K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz14Q08tWta">the NY Post</a> reports that doesn&apos;t include the 50 cent MTA tax from last year)
</li><li>Flat fee to JFK Airport will increase to $53, from $45
</li><li>The meter will be adjusted for waiting in traffic&#x2014;right now it&apos;s 40 cents every 1/5 mile the cab moves, that would change to every 1/6 mile
</li><li>Currently per-minute idling clicks are charged at speeds of 12 mph or less, that would be changed to 10 mph or less.</li></ul>

<p>Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004146/http://gothamist.com/2004/03/31/taxi_fare_hike_passed.php">in 2004</a>, there was a 26% increase, and in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004146/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/25/taxi_fare_hike.php">2006</a> the TLC approved an 11% increase&#x2014;but a spokesman for the group says, &quot;Operating costs have continued to increase over the last six years.&quot; Maybe those cyclists are on to something&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004146/http://gothamist.com/tags/bikelane">bike lanes</a> for all!</p>
