<p>This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163229/http://pagesix.com/2015/08/12/prepare-for-another-rose-shortage-this-fall/?_ga=1.147678455.112495035.1432131367">the NY Post</a> ran an alarming story about how a French winery is facing a ros&#xE9; shortage, and is in fact on its &quot;last few containers&quot; of the pink stuff. This news was reportedly broken to Ed Burns, <em>to his face and without warning</em>, at a party in the Hamptons. But it&apos;s a tale we&apos;ve heard before...</p>

<p>Last year we saw a similar story play out, when we witnessed one local Hamptons woman, Mitzy, react to similar news of ros&#xE9; supplies running dangerously low. &quot;God help us all,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163229/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/27/rose_shortage.php">Mitzy whispered into a conch shell</a>. But God can&apos;t help Mitzy, or any of us winos.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s try to make sense out of this, though. <em>Why are there even ros&#xE9; shortages anyway?</em> We turned to Mike at Village Wine Imports, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163229/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/23/the_best_rose_for_your_buck_comes_i.php">the company behind VRAC</a>, which has blessedly brought boxed ros&#xE9; to a liquor store near you.</p>

<p>Mike says that most companies stop importing ros&#xE9; early, &quot;so as not to have stock going into winter, when people aren&#x2019;t drinking it, and customers want current vintage&#x2026;.so companies like mine don&#x2019;t want to be stuck. We generally stop import around June/July.&quot; But in more recent years, as ros&#xE9; has become more popular, &quot;this has changed and we are now keeping stock longer&#x2026;.but Labor Day is perhaps the next line companies have drawn for last import.&quot; </p>

<p>On top of an import stop date, &quot;the other variable is that sales have been through the roof, so supply is in most likelihood running out. Also, 2014 was not an especially large crop&#x2026;.further adding to the shortage.&quot;</p>

<p>As for VRAC, Mike believes they&apos;ll be good for the season&#x2014;&quot;I have enough stock to take us until at least Halloween/Thanksgiving, perhaps longer. We had predicted and planned for an increase.&quot;</p>
