Developed in response to a new generation of filmmakers who were producing works outside the studio system, the series presented independent and experimental films that reflected many of the key issues of the day, from the Vietnam War, drugs, and the Black Panthers, to homosexuality and the women’s liberation movement.\" But they\'ve also kept up with the times! And with that, they\'ve expanded their curation to include movies about low-level insurance agents who spend the weekend on \"Hampton Island\" with their dead boss, Bernie. Yes, you can watch the film \<a href=\"http://whitney.org/Events/MyTurnWeekendAtBernies\"\>at The Whitney\<\/a\> next Thursday, June 30th.\r\n\<p\>\r\nUntil that day, watch the trailer. Remember how funny it was when Bernie was being dragged along by the boat and Andrew McCarthy is all, \"do you hear something?!\" This movie really does belong amongst the greats; sadly it\'s not on Netflix Instant, but you can rent it for just $2.99 \<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Weekend-At-Bernies/dp/B0032KUX8E/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1308690802&sr=1-1\"\>on Amazon Instant\<\/a\>!\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\n\<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"510\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YCTgcZ6ImsQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\>\<\/iframe\>", "credit":""};

In this one, Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman are back, and Bernie is still dead. Check out the trailer below. Honestly, we\'ve never made it through the full movie, but there\'s always time! Until you\'re dead. Like Bernie. Then you\'ve lost your shot at seeing this movie.\r\n\<p\>\r\n\<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"510\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlCADShkhjk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\>\<\/iframe\>", "credit":""};
