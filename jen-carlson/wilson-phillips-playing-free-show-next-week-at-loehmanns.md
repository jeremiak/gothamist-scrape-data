title: Wilson Phillips Playing Free Show Next Week... At Loehmann's
---

	
										<p>Ever since the 1990 classic easy listening jam &quot;Hold On&quot; was featured in <em>Bridesmaids</em>, the Wilson Phillips gals have held their own while back in the spotlight. On Monday they&apos;ll release a new album, titled <em>Dedicated</em>, and their reality show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152411/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2049577/"><em>Still Holding On</em></a>, is coming back for another season. And New York City, they&apos;re showing us some love, too&#x2014;the trio will be performing a free show next week at... off-price clothing retailer Loehmann&apos;s. Guess it seems kind of fitting? You can check out Carnie Wilson, Wendy Wilson and Chynna Phillips at the store, located at 101 7th Avenue at 16th Street, between 5 and 7 p.m. next Thursday. Until then, enjoy:</p>
