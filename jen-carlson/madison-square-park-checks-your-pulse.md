<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007123301/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/30/tree_huts.php">the Tree Huts</a> still in place, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007123301/https://www.madisonsquarepark.org/">Madison Square Park</a> Conservancy will add another element to the outdoor space: Rafael Lozano-Hemmer&#x2019;s Pulse Park. The interactive light installation will be on view starting October 24th and run through November 17th, only visible from dusk to 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how it works: visitors&#x2019; heart rates will be monitored by two heart rate sensor sculptures, and will activate two hundred theatrical spotlights, which in turn create &quot;a pulsating matrix of light across the central Oval Lawn of the historic park.&quot; Hey MSPC, how about pumping Jose Gonzalez&apos;s cover of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007123301/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4_4abCWw-w"><em>Heartbeats</em></a> while all of this is going on?</p>
