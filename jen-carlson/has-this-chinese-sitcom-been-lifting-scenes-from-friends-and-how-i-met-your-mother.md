<p>Some viewers of a Chinese sitcom called <em>Ipartment</em> are criticizing the show, which is in its third season, for ripping off <em>Friends</em> and other U.S. popular sitcoms. The show follows the daily lives of a group of friends who live in two neighboring apartments in a Shanghai tower block, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233054/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9455776/Chinese-sitcom-accused-of-scene-stealing-from-cult-American-TV-series.html">The Telegraph</a>. </p>

<p>The characters have some similarities&#x2014;there&apos;s a Ross type, who lectures at a university... though he could also be a Ted Mosby, as critics say entire scenes have been lifted from not only <em>Friends</em>, but <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>. The show&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233054/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPartment">Wiki page</a> describes the premise as being &quot;loosely based on the American sitcom <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> (without the past tense), with factors borrowed from <em>Friends</em>, <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, <em>CSI</em> and <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>&quot;&#x2014;interesting formula? </p>

<p>One viewer told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233054/http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/725277.shtml">Global Times</a>, &quot;I thought it was shameful to do this. It is an insult to the American TV producers and an insult to the screenwriters and producers of original Chinese TV shows.&#x201D; The criticisms are being heard, as the show&apos;s producers have acknowledged stealing jokes, and offered to compensate the original writers with 10,000 yuan ($1,569) for every 1,000 Chinese characters of material. A spokesperson said, &#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t copy the American sitcom. Our creation is not plagarism but more a homage to the American sitcom.&quot; Here is an episode with English subtitles: </p>
