The book, a collection of the mash-up artist&apos;s finest subway ad scrambles, is called <em>Poster Boy: The War of Art</em>&#x2014;and it hits bookstores on March 10th. The description reads: &quot;His cut and slash mash-ups of subway platform billboards only exist in New York City, but Poster Boy&#x2019;s artful and funny appropriations of advertising have gotten him attention the world over.&quot; Maybe he&apos;ll make enough to post bail next time he&apos;s arrested!</p>
