<p>According to a poster on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000944/http://www.brooklynian.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=620014%23620014">Brooklynian message board</a>, around 7 a.m. today, &quot;during the off leash dog hours, a music group was doing a photo shoot in the Long Meadow of Prospect Park. A golden retriever puppy, being naturally curious, wandered over and interrupted their photo shoot. <strong>One of the band members grabbed the puppy by its collar and kicked it.</strong>&quot; While there&apos;s no photographic evidence of the vague incident on the board, if this is true, it is our duty to find out who this band, and photographer, are. Anyone know anyone who wears vests and goes four buttons deep unbuttoning their shirt?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000944/http://www.myspace.com/surefireband">The band is called Surefire</a>, and they haven&apos;t yet responded to our request for comment.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> The band&apos;s singer, Ben Rice, has responded. His full comment is after the jump, wherein he explains that there was a golden retriever, but claims they only gave its owner a hard time.</p>
