</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520042110/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/22/miss_subways.php">Recently</a> the former Miss Subways got together to reminisce about their days as pageant title holders, and now they&apos;re getting their very own exhibit. &quot;Artist Fiona Gardner and writer Amy Zimmer recently caught up with some of the winners of the Miss Subways pageant, held in New York City between 1941 and 1976, to find out where these former transit beauty queens are today. Their resulting show, &#x2018;Meet Miss Subways,&#x2019; presents ten subjects, years later, but once again wearing their victory sash.&quot; The exhibit will be at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520042110/http://www.rushartsgallery.org/">Rush Art Gallery</a> through May 30th.
