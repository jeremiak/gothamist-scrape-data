title: Video: John Hodgman Takes Shots At Park Slope
---

	
										<p>Last night John Hodgman took the stage at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040659/http://www.bricartsmedia.org/events/eugene-mirman-pretty-good-friends">Celebrate Brooklyn</a>, and explained a few of the lesser known facts about his neighborhood of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040659/http://gothamist.com/tags/parkslope">Park Slope</a>. A little history lesson: &quot;<strong>Park Slope as a community was founded in 1990, by exiles from Manhattan. They came seeking an opportunity to practice their simple religion of gutting Brownstones, and breeding, and consuming luxury goods.</strong> The founding members wanted to live in peace with the people who were here, the less affluent, more ethnic Park Slopers. There&apos;s no way we could have known that double-wide strollers and small vineyard white wines from Oregon would give all those people small pox. No way, that&apos;s in the past. They&apos;re gone now, we&apos;re here, let&apos;s move on, no one is to blame.&quot;</p>
