When the city within the city is Grand Central Terminal, we set the DVR right away. Tonight on the National Geographic Channel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424125349/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/insidegrandcentral/">Inside Grand Central</a> airs at 8pm. </p>

<p>When we used to commute through GCT everyday for a few years, we always knew there was more to it than we were seeing. Tonight&apos;s show will bring us beyond the brick and mortar to show us inside the hidden tunnels, mysterious elevators, secret railways and the terminal&apos;s secret operations run from 10 stories below the main concourse. </p>

<p>The structure is always adapting to the times as well. Currently the &#x201C;East Side Access&#x201D; project is being worked on, this new underground development will bring in an additional 80,000 commuters from Long Island (just what we need. zing!). So get a glimpse at what the largest railstation will look like in 2012, as well as at all of its historical nooks. </p>
