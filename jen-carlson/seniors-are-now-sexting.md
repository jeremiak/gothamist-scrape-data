And we&apos;re not talking high school seniors, we&apos;re talking <em>your grandparents</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919054155/http://wcbstv.com/health/sexting.text.messaging.2.1463211.html">WCBS</a> reports that the 50 and older crowd may have even started the trend years ago. One older sexter says, &quot;The world is becoming ageless. There is no expiration date on sexy.&quot; However, she says the seniors are more apt to send sensuous over blatantly sexual message, and the only other difference is that &quot;you need reading glasses to see what the heck they&apos;re saying.&quot; <em>Also</em>, this all hit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919054155/http://www.aarp.org/family/love/articles/sexting_not_just_for_kids.html?cmp=NLC-WBLTR-CTRL-111309-F1">AARP</a> newsletter late last year, where the article begins: &quot;When Roger gets to an intimate stage with a woman these days, it usually doesn&apos;t take long until the sexy photos start.&quot; O-M-Gross.... or O-M-Good for them?</p>
