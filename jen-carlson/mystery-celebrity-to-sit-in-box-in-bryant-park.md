										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="inabox0710.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305224723im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/inabox0710.jpg" width="325" height="241" class="image-left"> </span>This is sort of weird. Every Friday from July 23rd to August 13th, from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., a celebrity will be sitting inside of a box in Bryant Park. The people behind the box, an experimental troupe called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305224723/http://www.artpartytheatercompany.com/">Art Party Theater Company</a>, invite one and all to step inside the box to find out which famous face is hiding away in there&#x2014;but you&apos;ll have to sign a non-disclosure agreement first. </p>

<p>Artistic Director Mary Birnbaum told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305224723/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/18/2010-07-18_jack_black_in_a_box_find_out_at_city_park.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;We invite lots of speculation about who the celebrity will be. It&apos;s someone probably everybody knows and someone that probably everyone likes&quot; (though there&apos;s no promise the person inside is an A-lister). She noted that the group will generate buzz and attention to the project by having 30 or so performers acting as star-struck fans, on top of a red carpet and velvet ropes&#x2014;tourists are going to eat this shit up quicker than you can say T.G.I. Fridays.</p>

<p>The 8&apos; x 8&apos; box is called Starbox, and will be situated by the park&apos;s fountain terrace. Lindsay Lohan should inquire about serving part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305224723/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/08/andrea_peyser_wants_lindsay_to_go_f.php">her jail sentence</a> in there&#x2014;it&apos;s probably about the size of her cell.</p>
