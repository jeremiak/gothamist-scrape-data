<p>There are some holidays that should be celebrated daily: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/25/tap_that_box_of_franzia_its_nationa.php">National Wine Day</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/today_is_drink_wine_day.php">National <em>Drink</em> Wine Day</a>, and National Lobster Day. The latter is coming up TOMORROW, and we wanted to give you time to prepare so that you may eat a breakfast, lunch, <em>and</em> dinner that incorporates the delicious sea creature. We&apos;ll help:</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Start the day off with a Lobster Eggs Benedict at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=lobster+eggs+benedict&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY">one of these fine establishments</a> (pick the one with the most stars next to it!). Or you can cook at home; check out this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://www.almanac.com/recipe/lobster-omelette">Farmer&apos;s Almanac</a> recipe for a Lobster Omelette, which includes butter, cheese, <em>melted</em> butter, whipping cream, and flour, amongst other things (like lobster). Why not, if you&apos;re eating lobster for breakfast you might as well turn it up to 11 (if there were a gluttony meter).</p>

<p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Eat a lobster roll! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php">Here are 13 of our favorites</a> available in the city. Right now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://www.urbanlobstershack.com/index2.html">Urban Lobster</a> has a $10 lobster roll lunch special, and they deliver! Which is helpful because you won&apos;t want to move after all that butter you had at breakfast.</p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong> For dinner why not treat yourself to the new four course for $15 extravaganza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/02/red_lobster_stretches_its_claws_add.php">at Red Lobster</a>... just kidding! Save that for National Cheddar Biscuit Day. Instead, go to a real restaurant, <em>or</em> pick up a fresh lobster on your way home. Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616205925/http://www.yumsugar.com/Get-Cracking-s-National-Lobster-Day-315457">how to pick the perfect one</a>:<br>

</li><li>Tender lobsters tend to be under 2 pounds.<br>
</li><li>Females have a more delicate flesh and are lighter. The males have larger claws and narrower tails.<br>
