<p>At press time, we are pretty certain that no New York City establishment has created and sold a Grilled Cheese Doughnut, and yet we still seem to think we are the center of the universe. Over in Cincinnati, however, a little place called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627175835/https://www.facebook.com/4TomAndChee">Tom + Chee</a> has received national attention for the creation,  which consists of a glazed doughnut split down the middle, and grilled in butter (cut side down) with some American cheese. What&apos;s more: it only costs 3 bucks ($4 if you want to add a fancier cheese, like Brie).</p>

<p>In 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627175835/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/06/when_will_bacon_donut_burger_come_t.php">we wondered</a> <em>why God why</em> the bacon doughnut burger wasn&apos;t in the city yet, and less than a year later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130627175835/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/halal_donut_burger_is_america.php">it arrived</a>! So, consider this post our tossing another penny in the fountain, closing our eyes real tight, and hoping for another miracle. </p>
