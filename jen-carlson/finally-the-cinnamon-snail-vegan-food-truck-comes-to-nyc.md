</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ve been patiently keeping an eye on The Cinnamon Snail&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610011230/http://twitter.com/#!/veganlunchtruck">Twitter feed</a> in hopes that one day the New Jersey-based vegan food truck (which won <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610011230/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/25/solber_pupusas_take_top_vendys_hono.php#photo-1">a Vendy this year</a>) would make its way to NYC... and this weekend we got word from chef Adam Sobel that it&apos;s all happening, people. </p>

<p>Starting in mid-November, Sobel and his Snail crew will start serving Manhattan and Brooklyn 4 to 5 days a week (and they still plan to serve their Jersey customers, though now just 2 days a week). Sobel says the truck took nearly two years to get properly licensed to serve in New York&#x2014;and he&apos;s now taking suggestions on what neighborhoods they should serve first. </p>

<p>As of now, they&apos;re &quot;planning to experiment with serving different NYC neighborhoods throughout the week.  The initial places you will find the truck are: Flatiron District, Lower East Side, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint. Some locations will be for brunch and lunch, and other locations will be dinner and late night locations.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, no more being teased by alerts like, &quot;white chocolate glazed pumpkin twists will be on board,&quot; and photos like these on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160610011230/http://www.facebook.com/theCinnamonSnail">their Facebook</a>. As for their menu, the truck serves up everything from breakfast items, gourmet sandwiches, raw food, and fresh vegan donuts and pastries&#x2014;with everything made fresh from organic, seasonal, and local ingredients.</p>
