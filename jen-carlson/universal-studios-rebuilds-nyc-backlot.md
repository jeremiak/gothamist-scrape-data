</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s a <em>new</em> New York City, and it&apos;s in Los Angeles. Universal Studios has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310050920/http://laist.com/2010/05/27/universal_studios_hollywood_re-open.php">finally unveiled</a> their new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310050920/http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/newyorkstreet.shtml">Manhattan backlot</a>, after the original burned down in 2008. Director Steven Spielberg was on hand for the unveiling (he helped design the new set), and was also one of the first to arrive when the fire began two years ago. He called it an inferno and recalled &quot;the flames were hundreds of feet into the air and everything was coming down quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>The new four acres features 13 blocks (just like the old one) and includes parts of Central Park, Wall Street and Broadway. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310050920/http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local-beat/Universal-Backlot-Open-95058794.html">NBC-LA</a>, &quot;New York Street has been the setting of countless commercials, television shows and movies,&quot; and can even be transformed, through an art director&apos;s creative touch, to London or Paris. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310050920/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/28/2010-05-28_untitled__studio28m.html">The Daily News</a> has another good shot of the newly unveiled streets, can you find anything inaccurate in the photo?</p>
