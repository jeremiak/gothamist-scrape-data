										<p>Frances Bean Cobain has been under the radar since distancing herself from mom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030330/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> years ago, but a new photoshoot she did with Hedi Slimane is throwing her back into the spotlight. The only daughter of Love and Kurt Cobain is turning 19 later this month&#x2014;just eight years younger than her father when he killed himself. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030330/http://stereogum.com/779022/frances-bean-cobain-all-grown-up-2/photo/">Stereogum</a> dubs her new look as &quot;goth, inked, and gorgeous,&quot; and notes she&apos;s been dabbling in the art world. Last year, on top of inheriting 37% of her father&apos;s estate, she debuted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030330/http://www.laluzdejesus.com/shows/2010/Fiddle-Tim/Fiddle-Tim2010.htm">a collection of her work</a>&#x2014; titled &quot;Scumfuck&quot;&#x2014;at a gallery in LA, under the pseudonym &quot;Fiddle Tim.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if she&apos;s still interested in more gallery shows, but she does keep a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030330/http://twitter.com/#!/gofackadawg">private Twitter account</a> under the name &quot;Fiddle Tim&quot;&#x2014;and according to her bio she&apos;s living in London.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The photos have been removed at the request of the photographer, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030330/http://www.hedislimane.com/diary/">you can see them all here</a>.</p>
