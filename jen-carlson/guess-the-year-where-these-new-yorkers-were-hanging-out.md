<p>Can you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228043129/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">guess the year</a> this photograph was taken, and guess where exactly these gents were hanging out? As always, we&apos;ll update later with the answer and more details.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This photo, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228043129/http://collections.mcny.org/">the Museum of the City of New York</a>, was taken in 1900 at the Casino Cafe in Central Park. The caption reads: &quot;Bar, bartenders, customer and photographs on the walls with ornate architectural detail.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228043129/http://www.nypap.org/content/central-park">Central Park Casino</a>&apos;s original building was designed by Calvert Vaux and &quot;intended to be a place for refreshments [a Ladies Refreshment Pavilion]. In the 1920s, it became a prime nightclub for wealthy socialites.&quot; As with many things in New York, eventually Robert Moses demolished it, claiming the Casino &quot;catered to a wealthy clientele (with menu prices greater than the bill of fare at the Plaza Hotel), and thus was an inappropriate use of a public park. He also claimed financial mismanagement by concessionaire Sid Solomon and the Dieppe Corporation.&quot; It was replaced with &quot;a playground laid out on a concrete pad,&quot; and today is the site of Rumsey Playfield/the Summerstage concert series.</p>
