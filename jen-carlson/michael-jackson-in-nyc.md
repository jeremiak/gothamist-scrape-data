This was during the time when he was doing The Wiz movie and before that. I knew Michael because he used to come to the show all the time and hang out backstage with me. Michael was really, really shy. But back then, I was aggressive. I was determined I was gonna be his girlfriend. He didnât know, but I was. When he had his place on Sutton Place [in Manhattan], I would spend the night and I would do his laundry. It was Tide. I should do a Tide commercial, huh? And I even cooked for him â even though I couldnât cook. But you know what? Even as bad as it was, Michael was such a gentleman, he still ate it.â", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_10'] = photo;</script>

</div></div>					<p>If you were outside last night you likely heard some Michael Jackson tunes blasting in homage to the late King of Pop. MTV even took a break from their reality programming to play his classic videos all night, and fans gathered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808144407/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/101373/fans-mourn-sudden-death-of-michael-jackson/Default.aspx">at the Apollo Theater</a> for an impromptu memorial (The Jackson 5 performed there in 1969).</p>

<p>Click through for some photos of Michael Jackson in New York over the years, including some images from the Studio 54 days. Did you know that a 10-year-old Anderson Cooper, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808144407/http://gawker.com/5302762/anderson-coopers-studio-54-memories-with-michael-jackson">in his words</a> &quot;for some odd reason,&quot; attended the nightclub with MJ? Hopefully he&apos;ll divulge more about the evening, and why he was there at such a young age&#x2014;though it was likely his mother Gloria Vanderbilt was somehow involved.</p>
