										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="smwingman0212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820151006im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smwingman0212.jpeg" width="300" height="285"> <br> <i>Your new wingman</i></div> While New York&apos;s single women are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820151006/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/rent-a-gent.php">Renting-A-Gent</a> to help them with tasks, what&apos;s the city got to offer the single <em>man</em>? Enter: Rent-A-Wingman, or rather &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820151006/http://www.giltcity.com/newyork/wingmannyc">The Professional Wingman</a>, a service that the Gilt Groupe is offering you at a cost of $185 (a bargain at a half off rate from the original $370 cost). That kind of dough will supply you with the perfect bro to land you that special someone... and wait, it&apos;s for women, too!<p></p>

<p>The Wingman you&apos;ll be getting is one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820151006/http://www.theprofessionalwingman.com/">Thomas Edwards</a>, who over the past three years &quot;has coached hundreds of Romeos and Juliets, from teenagers to seniors, on the fine art of making connections.&quot; You can try to get a session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820151006/http://www.theprofessionalwingman.com/coaching-programs">through his site</a> as well, since the Gilt Groupe special is currently sold out. But maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820151006/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/28/wingman_for_hire_promises_to_help_y.php">this Queens-based player</a> can be your spare wing until Edwards is available?</p>

<p>If and when you do score some time with Edwards, you&apos;ll get a two-hour wingman session out, a one hour phone strategy session, and one month of full email support, which will &quot;help create meaningful interactions with potential romantic interests.&quot; This is just a Judd Apatow movie waiting to happen. </p>

<p>And now, meet Edwards:</p>
