<p>Sure, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225105920/http://gothamist.com/tags/fiftyshadesofgrey"><em>Fifty Shades Of Grey</em></a> is selling well, and is probably the most checked-out book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225105920/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/nypl_2.php">in the library</a>, but what about those who want to enter the leather-clad world in a safe way yet without all the tedious <em>reading</em>? YouPorn (yes, it&apos;s like YouTube for porn) says that New Yorkers have been seeking out Christian Grey-approved pain via their service, and there&apos;s been a big increase in these searches since April. They write in: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;According to statistics compiled by a prominent online adult entertainment website, it appears that New Yorkers&#x2014;both men and women&#x2014;are locking themselves in their own &#x2018;Red Room of Pain&#x2019; to download BDSM-related videos. On a global scale, BDSM-related searches swelled 67% from April to June this year. In New York that number exploded by 89.7%.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>They went on say, &quot;New Yorkers spanked the competition,&quot; leaving us with no porn puns of our own.</p>

<p>On a related programming note, Gothamist will be featuring more NSFW BDSM-related videos in the months to come!</p>
