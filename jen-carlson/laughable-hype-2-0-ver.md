Thanks to everyone who came out to Pianos last night for our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/06/27/laughable_hype_3.php">Laughable Hype</a> comedy show! Above are pictures of 4 of the 5 comedians that performed (we didn&apos;t take a picture of Todd Barry because we thought he&apos;d call us out for doing so). 

</p><p>Thank you to all of the comedians: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://eugenemirman.com/">Eugene Mirman</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://azizisbored.com/">Aziz Ansari</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://toddbarry.com/">Todd Barry</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://www.danielkitson.com/">Daniel Kitson</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://johnmulaney.com/">John Mulaney</a>. Daniel Kitson was a last minute addition and we couldn&apos;t be happier he could join us. Since we&apos;re more music than comedy, we&apos;ll just say this, he was like...the Arcade Fire of comedians. Luring us in to his well crafted tales of everyday life, leaving us with cheeks hurting from laughing so hard. If you want to catch him before he heads back cross the pond, you can do so tonight (and only tonight!) at his &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://www.britsoffbroadway.com/wobbly_stories.htm">Stories for the Wobbly Hearted</a>&quot; show. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224145/http://www.ticketcentral.com/showdetails_f.asp?i=792">Tickets and info here</a>.</p>
