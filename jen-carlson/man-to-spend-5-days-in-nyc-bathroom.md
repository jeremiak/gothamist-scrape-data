										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="markbathroom0810.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325221140im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/markbathroom0810.jpg" width="325" height="258" class="image-right"> </span>Move over, David Blaine. This guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325221140/http://gothamist.com/tags/markmalkoff">Mark Malkoff</a> is attempting the unthinkable! He&apos;s going to live in his New York City bathroom for <em>five days</em>. He claims this is to combat his internet addiction, so he won&apos;t be bringing his iPhone or laptop in with him&#x2014;he will, however, be bringing with him this list of things to accomplish during his stay.</p>

<ul><li>read &#x201C;Gravity&#x2019;s Rainbow&#x201D;
</li><li>memorize all U.S. Presidents in order
</li><li>memorize the location of every country in the world
</li><li>write letters to family and friends telling them I love them
</li><li>learn how to sew on a button 
</li><li>finish book proposal
</li><li>read friend&#x2019;s screenplay
</li><li>memorize the Sermon on the Mount
</li><li>learn how to knit
</li><li>finger paint
</li><li>write a list for his wife, &#x201C;99 Reasons I Love My Wife&#x201D;
</li><li>learn how to play &#x201C;Every Rose Has It&#x2019;s Thorn&#x201D; on guitar</li></ul>

<p>He&apos;ll start his lock-in on August 23rd at 11:30 a.m., and won&apos;t be coming out for 120 hours; he tells us his wife &quot;is not thrilled&quot; about this (hopefully they have two bathrooms!). The experience will somehow be documented visually, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325221140/http://markmalkoff.com/blog/?p=203">stay tuned</a> for that. In the meantime, if you had to spend five days in your bathroom, what would you bring with you?</p>
