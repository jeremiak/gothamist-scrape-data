<p>In a series of Tweets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144422/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/5908212/drake-slams-rolling-stone-philip-seymour-hoffman-kanye-west">this week</a>, Drake expressed his feelings about the recent Rolling Stone cover going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144422/http://gothamist.com/tags/philipseymourhoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, when it was supposed to go to him. In Tweets that have since been deleted, he wrote: &quot;They took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue.&quot; Naturally, he was criticized for his, and has now posted a response on his website, titled, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144422/http://octobersveryown.blogspot.com.au/2014/02/tough-day-at-office.html">Tough Day At The Office</a>&quot;&#x2014;it reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;With today being the 5th anniversary of So Far Gone I figured it&apos;s fitting to return to it&apos;s place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day. I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip [sic] Seymour Hoffman. He is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication. 

<p>My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed. The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable (on the magazines behalf), but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating. They ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not. I would have waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but I just wasn&apos;t given that option and that made me feel violated. </p>

<p>I apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person. Today I was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly. These days are the worst ones. Waking up after a great night in the studio and it&apos;s your day to be picked apart. After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment. I once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way. I respect Rolling Stone for being willing to give a kid from Toronto a shot at the cover. I guess this is a day to learn and grow.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
