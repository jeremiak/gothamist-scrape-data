<p>This video is NSFW, and even if you aren&apos;t at work, you don&apos;t want to watch it. Basically, a man pulls his penis out of his shorts and starts, you know, touching it... all as the ladies across the way film him. In the interest of calling this subway perv out, we&apos;ve captured the best screenshot we could of his face and placed it here, on the internet. Should you have the misfortune of running into this guy while underground, please do take a better photo of his face before deboarding.</p>
