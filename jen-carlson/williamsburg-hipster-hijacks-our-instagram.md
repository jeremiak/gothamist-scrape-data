<p>In March <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004649/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/i_hate_being_single.php">we introduced you to</a> Rob Michael Hugel, and his new web series <em>I Hate Being Single</em>, which&#x2014;insofar as it deals with the Brooklyn &quot;Youngs&quot; and relationship issues&#x2014;is <em>sort of</em> the like a boys version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004649/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">HBO&apos;s <em>Girls</em></a>. Tonight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004649/http://ihatebeingsingleseries.tumblr.com/">the show&apos;s finale</a> is getting a screening treatment over at IndieScreen in Williamsburg, and we thought it might be fun to have Hugel (who created and stars in the show) take over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004649/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/26/photos_were_on_instagram_now_are_yo.php#photo-1">our Instagram</a> on the occasion, for an exclusive, never before seen look at Williamsburg, a neighborhood which has <em>never been Instagrammed before</em>. He started things off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004649/http://instagr.am/p/KnJMlDLEH3/">with the above photo</a>, noting, &quot;I think these 2 were secretly talking to each other [at] The Blue Stove off Graham.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If you want to attend the finale, you can buy tickets ($10) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004649/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/246876">right here</a>. The episode itself is only about 10 minutes long, but there will be bonus videos, cameos by web series stars like Morgan Evans (The Untitled Web Series), Ann Carr (The Actress), Elaine Caroll (Very Mary Kate) and more... including original music from <em>I Hate Single</em>&#x2019;s very own composer, Jake Zavracky. You can catch up on the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004649/http://ihatebeingsingleseries.tumblr.com/">here</a>, and check out the trailer below:</p>
