										<p>Transit nerds, you are going to <em>love this</em>. The MTA has posted this time lapse video on YouTube, saying: &quot;The Corona Subway Yard in Queens is home to the 7 subway fleet. Each weekday morning between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m., 27 trains leave Corona Yard to provide service to the Flushing Line&apos;s 450,000 customers. The 27 trains join five already in service to provide 32 trains during the peak hours.&quot;</p>
