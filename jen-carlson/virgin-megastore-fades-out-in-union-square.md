Yesterday was the last day the doors were open to bargain hunters, who only had about two tables of remaining merchandise to browse (allegedly stocked with plenty of Jonas Brothers memorabilia). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405062807/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/arts/music/15virgin.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">The NY Times</a> reports on what was &quot;the last large-scale record store in New York City,&quot; saying that while the closure isn&apos;t surprising, it is dispiriting. One analyst told the paper, &#x201C;The Titanic that is physical media started slowly sinking in 2000.
