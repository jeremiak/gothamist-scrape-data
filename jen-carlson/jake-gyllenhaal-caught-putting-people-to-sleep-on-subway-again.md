<p>According to photographic evidence, Jake Gyllenhaal rides the subway at least twice a year, and every time, he has a very calming effect on fellow straphangers (unlike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235529/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/22/maggie_gyllenhaal_rides_the_4_train.php">his sister</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235529/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/07/jake_gyllenhaal_spotted_on_the_q_tr.php">Earlier this year</a> the actor was spotted on the Q train with a man sleeping next to him, and just this month another snoozefest was caught on camera&#x2014;the latest guy even got arm on leg contact. Adorable! How many more times does this have to happen before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235529/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/people-sleeping-on-the-subway-next-to-jake-gyllenh">Buzzfeed</a>&apos;s &quot;People Sleeping On The Subway Next To Jake Gyllenhaal&quot; thing becomes a meme?</p>
