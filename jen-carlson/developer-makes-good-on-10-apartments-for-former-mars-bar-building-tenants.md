<p>Years ago, developer BFC Partners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012819/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/13/the_end_of_mars_bars_is_nigh.php">made a sweetheart deal</a> with tenants of the building that housed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012819/http://gothamist.com/tags/marsbar">Mars Bar</a>, promising them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012819/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110612/REAL_ESTATE/110619975">$10, tax free, two bedroom apartments</a> in their brand new development. And now, the tenants are preparing to move in.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012819/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424127887323528404578453113485617342.html?ru=yahoo?mod=yahoo_itp">Wall Street Journal</a> reports that &quot;nine long-term tenants of two small buildings on 2nd Avenue struck deals to buy cooperative units in a new 12-story building, known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012819/http://www.gf55.com/projects/apartment.php?id=13a">Jupiter 21</a>.&quot; Yes, it&apos;s a nod to Mars Bar&#x2014;&quot;Jupiter follows Mars,&quot; Donald Capoccia of BFC noted. &quot;Rents on the building&apos;s market-rate apartments, including some with twin terraces, will range from $3,000 to $10,000 a month... Some higher-floor apartments have views from the Manhattan Bridge to the Empire State Building.&quot;</p>

<p>One woman who lived in the previous building for decades told the paper, &quot;I am grateful they didn&apos;t give us lowlifes apartments in the back. I feel hugely entitled to this luxury apartment, but I feel completely unworthy of it at the same time.&quot;</p>
