<p>When we asked the men of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033709/http://gntlmn.com/">GNTLMN</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033709/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/11/5_tips_for_new_york_men_from_the_gn.php">for some tips for New Yorkers</a>, they added one for the ladies, too: do not wear kitten heels, ever. The site&apos;s co-founder Wesley Verhoeve even went on to tell us, &quot;My favorite quote about women&apos;s shoes is &apos;kitten heels are the mullet of shoes.&apos; The problem is that all they are is comfortable, while doing nothing to lengthen the leg... and if comfort is important then wear cute flats!&quot; This kitten heel comment turned out to be as controversial as their firm stance against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033709/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/should_ever_men_wear_square-toed_sh.php">square-toed shoes for men</a>, so we took to the streets and the fashionable ladies of a few glossy mags to see where <em>women</em> come down on the kitten heel issue. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033709/https://twitter.com/swerdle">Alexis Swerdloff</a> of Paper Magazine says, &quot;The phrase &apos;kitten heels&apos; makes my skin crawl the same way a word like &quot;panties&quot; does... The bottom line is that they are just not that flattering&#x2014;and generally make a normal, nice leg look kind of stubby. That said, I never love a &apos;should not&apos; when it comes to fashion, and if someone feels like sporting a generally unflattering, stumpy heel&#x2014;more power to her!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033709/https://twitter.com/farankrentcil">Faran Krentcil</a> of Nylon Magazine echoed the sentiment, saying, &quot;It&apos;s hard to say &apos;never&apos; in fashion&#x2014;there&apos;s enough variety out there that many trends, kitten heels included, can look quite cool.  Personally, I&apos;m a big fan of Calvin Klein and Diane von Furstenberg&apos;s leopard print versions, which look killer peeking out of a wide-leg jean or even with a red wool pencil skirt and a plain white tee.  It&apos;s true kitten heels can easily go wrong, especially if they&apos;ve got over-the-top ornaments like frilly bows on them.&quot;</p>

</li><li>&quot;They&apos;re different. If they go with your outfit, they could work.&quot; - Allie from Long Island<br>
</li><li>Older women tend to buy them&#x2014;aged 30 or 40. I don&#x2019;t wear kitten heels. I&#x2019;m really short so if I choose to wear heels, they have to be really high.&quot; - Nube, a salesperson at Forecast Footwear (from the Bronx)<br>
</li><li>Teenage girl from Connecticut: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like kitten heels and wouldn&#x2019;t wear them. If other people wear<br>
them, I wouldn&#x2019;t judge them for it, but they have to work it!&#x201D;<br>
</li><li>&#x201C;All heels look good. I love a woman in heels.&#x201D; - Bored-looking boyfriend waiting on girlfriend in Top Shop<br>
</li><li>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve actually rolled my ankle every time I wore them. And I just don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re flattering. Yeah, they look good on <em>Mad Men</em>, but I just hate them.&#x201D;<br>
</li><li>&quot;I just recently switched to kitten heels. I&apos;m 27 and I&apos;m starting to realize many of my aunts have knee and ankle problems from walking in flats. I see a lot of people who can&apos;t walk in their platform shoes around the Upper East Side. It&apos;s like, why would you walk in them if you don&apos;t have to? Also, part of the reason I only switched now is that I&apos;m from California, and there it&apos;s like, you take off a shoe, you get in your car and drive, and when you&apos;re on the way to work you might be standing up for a total of 50 feet.&quot; - Kate from Upper East Side<br>
</li><li>&quot;These are a decade old. I got them in Venice. Have you ever tried to walk down a cobblestone street in high heels? Some kitten heels are not very attractive. These are glam and very comfortable, though. If it weren&apos;t for shoes like this, women would be killing themselves. I&apos;m a photojournalist, however, and when I&apos;m actually out in the field I wear combat boots.&quot; - Carol Allen Storey, who was wearing kitten heels</li></ul>Feel free to log your opinion on this Important Fashion Matter below:<p></p>
