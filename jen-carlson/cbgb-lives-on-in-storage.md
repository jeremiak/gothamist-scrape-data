<p>Sure, the awning lives on at the new Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Annex <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831132059/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/22/rock_n_roll.php">in SoHo</a>, but the bar is now held in a trailer in Connecticut, and the rest in a 3,000-square-foot storage space in Williamsburg. But wait, it gets more depressing! The club&apos;s old manager, Louise Parnassa-Staley, along with the former barman (son-in-law of the late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831132059/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/29/checking_in_wit.php">Hilly Kristal</a>) are also in the storage space, running what&apos;s left of the business, including CBGB Fashions, from the same desk that used to greet the venue&apos;s audience.</p>

<p>Parnassa-Staley told the paper, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s sad, but it&#x2019;s not really dismal. It&#x2019;s quiet here, you know. And there&#x2019;s no rats.&#x201D; <em>There&apos;s always an upside.</em> As for what will become of the venue&apos;s remains, they&apos;re exploring &quot;what to do with the club&#x2019;s vast trove of paperwork,&quot; which includes set lists, band contracts and other documents that have become a part of New York&apos;s music history.</p>
