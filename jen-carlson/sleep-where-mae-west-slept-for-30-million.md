                            <p>Did you know Mae West was born in Brooklyn? Back in 1893 the star was born right in Bushwick, to a prizefighting pop and a model mom. In her younger years she lived in Woodhaven, Queens, Williamsburg <em>and</em> Greenpoint. However, once she made a name for herself via the Vaudeville stage and the Hollywood screen, she was on to greener pastures. Namely, 266 West End Avenue in Manhattan, where she eventually moved.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216073215/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/06/11/buy_mae_wests_old_upper_west_side_mansion_for_30_million.php">Curbed</a> her mansion is now on the market for $30 million; for all that cash you&apos;ll get a ballroom, a library, conservatories, a sauna, a steam room, an elevator, and whatever else is housed in the 14,000 square feet. That&apos;s quite a markup since it was last purchased in 2004, for a measly $1.2MM.
