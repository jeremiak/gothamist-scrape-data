<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="120MINSmtv.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042221im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/120MINSmtv.jpg" width="365" height="272" class="image-right"> </span>MTV is finally doing something right, they&apos;re bringing back <em>120 Minutes</em>, the show that should have formed the network that eventually turned its back on music for Snooki. <em>Anyway</em>, it&apos;s sort of making a comeback. Today we received a press release that it will return to MTV2 as an on-air monthly show later this year, and as a weekly online show called <em>120 Seconds</em> (attention spans have changed) on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042221/http://www.mtvhive.com/120">MTV Hive</a> beginning tomorrow.</p>

<p>On top of bringing the series back, they&apos;ll be bringing original host Matt Pinfield back; who says, &quot;I am elated and proud to be part of bringing back one of the most influential and longest running music shows in the network&apos;s history. Everywhere I go, people from all over the world-talk about how much 120 Minutes shaped their musical tastes and how much they missed it.&quot;</p>

<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042221/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/07/matt_pinfield_dj.php">we interviewed Pinfield</a> in 2009, he told us a great Radiohead story from the time, recalling: &quot;one of the most amazing and satisfying days for me was when Thom Yorke came in to give us gold records for The Bends. It took a long time to get there. But when they came in and handed us the gold records in our music room that day, Thom Yorke walked up to us and said, &apos;I know you guys took a lot of shit for staying behind this and backing us on this record. And I just want you to know how much it means to us.&apos; And Thom Yorke actually broke into tears before he walked out of the room. He was literally in tears.&quot; Check out Radiohead on <em>120 Minutes</em> below, as well as some other clips.</p>
