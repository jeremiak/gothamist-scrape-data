<p>What to expect: while there&apos;s no swimming (unless you are <em>very</em> brave), you&apos;ll get the standard sandy set-up, along with food, libations, skee ball and mini golf! And as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233954/http://eater.com/archives/2009/05/opening_report_13.php">Eater</a> noted just prior to the opening, &quot;they&apos;ll be serving up Schnack&apos;s fish and chips, fish tacos, Motz burgers, beef, soy, and beef with bacon dogs, roasted corn, and chicken wings.&quot; Today the beach is open from noon to 10 p.m.</p>

<p>And stay tuned for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233954/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/24/water_taxi_beach_coming_to_governor.php">Governors Island beach</a>, set to open on July 4th.</p>
