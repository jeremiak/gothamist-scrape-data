										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lohanbaby0510.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102022916im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lohanbaby0510.jpg" width="300" height="187" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102022916/http://gothamist.com/tags/milkaholic">Lindsay Lohan/E-Trade war</a> wages on. The lawyers for the company&#x2014;which she is suing for using her first name in a commercial she claims parodies her partying ways&#x2014;has turned to internet commenters to help them. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102022916/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/tot_shots_at_lindsay_9ptyzScuUmndynj989MpnN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, lawyers for the company have filed hundreds of pages detailing Lohan&apos;s drinking and drugging... pages that include comments from websites. They claim this is not to prove she already defamed herself, but simply to prove she lives in Hollywood and not with her mother on Long Island, where the lawsuit was filed (the company is aiming to get the court battle moved to Manhattan). However, mom Dina says, &quot;This is the whole reason we are suing them&#x2014;for demeaning Lindsay. They are just proving how they operate&#x2014;they play dirty.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the comments used states that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102022916/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindsaylohan">Lohan</a> is &quot;a pot-stirring, lazy, irresponsible, disrespectful little drama queen,&quot; while another calls her a &quot;train wreck,&quot; and another wonders how she pays for her cocaine. Not that we&apos;re siding with the train wreck, but, if there&apos;s a lawyer in the house, please explain how this is merely to prove she lives in California...</p>
