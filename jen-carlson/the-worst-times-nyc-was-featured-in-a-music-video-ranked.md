title: The Worst Times NYC Was Featured In A Music Video, Ranked
---

	
										<p>New York City is a fantastic cinematic backdrop, but over the years it has been improperly used as such in the music video medium. Various artists have taken our city and turned it into a joke. Below, please find the worst music videos featuring NYC, all of which were either released in the 1990s, or feature Limp Bizkit.</p>

<p><strong>1. Spice Girls &quot;2 Become 1&quot;</strong> (1996) &#x2014; The Spice Girls were a very famous band at this point that could have just spent money on filming this video in the real NYC and not Green Screen NYC.</p>

<p><strong>2. Pet Shop Boys &quot;New York City Boy&quot;</strong> (1999) &#x2014; To be fair, the song is worse than the video.</p>

<p><strong>3. Limp Bizkit &quot;Nookie&quot;</strong> (2001) &#x2014; This video features Fred Durst being followed around by female fans in Long Island City, Queens. And then he gets fake arrested by the NYPD.</p>

<p><strong>Limp Bizkit&apos;s &quot;Rollin&apos;&quot;</strong> (2001) is tied for 3rd &#x2014;&#xA0;This video was filmed atop the south tower of the World Trade Center, and is intercut with clips of Durst driving around Manhattan in a Bentley.</p>
