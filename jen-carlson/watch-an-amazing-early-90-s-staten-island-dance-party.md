                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="SIPARTY.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072350im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SIPARTY.jpg" width="640" height="475" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072350/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/50_reasons_why_staten_island_deserv.php">so many reasons to love Staten Island</a>, but this video may be the #1 reason to love Staten Island. Let it take you back to the early &apos;90s, awkward dances, mom jeans, mock turtle necks, scrunchies, accents, perms, a tapered short pant... if it weren&apos;t for the Vanilla Ice track this could easily be the 1980s. Anyway, it&apos;s got everything... even a totally out-of-the-blue mention of an anti-abortion rally&#x2014;which is apparently part of some weird Staten Island comedy routine. </p>
