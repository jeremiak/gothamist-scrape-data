While someone took the time to shatter a window to get in, the only thing that was taken was a cell phone. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519223205/http://thevillager.com/villager_326/scoopysnotebook.html">The Villager</a> reports that his 2nd Avenue home is just around the corner from the 3rd Street Men&apos;s Shelter, where it&apos;s suspected the thief resides. The paper notes a broader issues with the shelter, saying that muggings, car break-ins and drugs are becoming more rampant problems in the area. One community board member, Elinor Tatum, was recently at the Marble Collegiate Cemetery and &quot;was shocked to see all the 40-ounce beer and vodka bottles littering the graveyard, which she is sure were tossed out of the shelter&#x2019;s windows.&quot; She told the paper: <strong>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to see it going back to the way it was in the late &#x2019;80s.&#x201D;</strong></p>
