										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0509eriverfishing.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618005439im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0509eriverfishing.jpg" width="140" height="133" class="image-right"> </span>The New York State Department of Health recently started drawing attention to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618005439/http://www.health.state.ny.us/environmental/outdoors/fish/hudson_river/advisory_outreach_project/">Hudson River Fish Advisory Outreach Project</a>, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618005439/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2009/05/the_deadliest_c.html">FreeWilliamsburg</a>. The site has a photo of a Parks Department sign, taken at the North 5th Street pier behind the Northside Piers development, which actually alludes to the fact that one can eat what they catch from the East River without a trip to the ER. Well, there are some caveats, the sign reads: &quot;Pregnant women, women of childbearing age, and children under 15 years old should not eat fish or eels caught in these waters.&quot; Reassuring, no? So what goodies can be hooked in the river? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618005439/http://www.nycfishing.com/eastriver2.html">NYC Fishing</a>: bass, blues, stripers, snappers and flounder. Well, it&apos;s probably better than whatever you&apos;d find in the Gowanus, but maybe not at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618005439/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/28/gone_fishin_in.php">Prospect Park</a>.</p>
