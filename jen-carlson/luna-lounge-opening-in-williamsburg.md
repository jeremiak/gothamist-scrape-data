The story starts out, &quot;Before I knew who Elliott Smith was, I knew him as this very quiet guy that had discovered the bar (at Luna) and would stay there till closing or near closing most nights, writing constantly in a journal with some kind of dark whiskey drink on the rocks or straight-up in front of him; he always had some kind of bourbon or something like that in front of him. Week after week after week.&quot;</p>

<p>We hope the Luna Lounge in Brooklyn will have a little bit of whatever the feeling was that drew Smith (pictured, at Luna) in to the original bar, and even if it doesn&apos;t - we&apos;re anticipating the opening none the less.</p>

<p>The Lower East Side club that housed the first shows of bands like Interpol, The Strokes and Stellastarr* and comedy nights with Janeane Garofalo and Sarah Silverman, will reopen on Friday night in Williamsburg. From the press release:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We are very excited to be able to recreate ourselves here in Williamsburg and to be completely embraced by this community of musicians and artists,&quot; says Luna Lounge co-owner and booking agent Rob Sacher. &apos;We have been working quietly on this building for over a year and have taken our time to build a world class music venue for the people of New York City.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The opening night will include a show by The Comas and Falcon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025919/http://www.lunalounge.com/schedule/current">with many more shows to follow</a>. You can find the new location <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025919/http://www.google.com/maps?q=361+Metropolitan+Ave,+Brooklyn,+NY+11211&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=15&amp;ll=40.714541,-73.955841&amp;spn=0.016199,0.047679&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr">at 361 Metropolitan Avenue at Havemeyer Street</a>. And note that the nightclub will be open weekends in January and early February with a full schedule starting in the spring. And as noted by Rob <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025919/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/12/29/looking_forward.php#comment-953589">in our comments</a>, &quot;I will be booking Luna, not Live Nation. However, the folks at LN will be helping me out and will book a show or two each week.&quot;</p>
