In a new tell-all book, Halperin claims that the Fame Monster is unhealthily obsessed with her weight, has done every drug in the book, and wears elaborate costumes and wigs in order to cover up her red blotches and hair loss, all caused by Lupus. This all translates to sensational headlines, like The Superficial&apos;s: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320023726/http://www.thesuperficial.com/lady-gaga-lupus-eating-disorder-drugs-ian-halperin-07-2011">Lady Gaga Is Dying</a>.<p></p>

<p>In a recent interview with Star, Halperin&#x2014;who investigated Gaga over the course of a year&#x2014;says, &quot;Those who have worked with her on tour reported to me that Gaga barely ate for weeks at a time to fit into her costume. She is sick and obsessed with her weight. One friend told me, Gaga will stare at herself in the mirror for hours on end, analyzing and critiquing her body. It&apos;s an unhealthy obsession.&quot; Gaga <em>did</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320023726/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/SummerConcert/lady-gaga-admits-testing-borderline-positive-lupus/story?id=10805293">once say</a> very directly: &quot;Pop stars should not eat.&quot; Role model!</p>

<p>Moving further into the downward spiral, Halperin says that Gaga&apos;s drug use, which started over a decade ago, has included heavy use of everything from cocaine to ecstasy to heroin; a friend claims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320023726/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/07/lady-gaga-ian-halperin-tell-all-explosive-revelations-drugs-diet-accusations">&quot;she&apos;s a walking time bomb.&quot;</a></p>

<p>And what about those crazy costumes? They&apos;re not all in the name of fashion, claims the journalist&#x2014;allegedly, <strong>&quot;Her lupus is far worse than she lets on. Part of the reason she wears wigs and makeup is because her hair is falling out and she&apos;s covered in red blotches, both side effects of the disease.&quot;</strong> Gaga admitted to being &quot;borderline positive&quot; for Lupus last year on Larry King (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320023726/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm-dKXFADR4">video</a>).</p>

<p>Halperin declares that the superstar has &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320023726/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/gaga_7.php">morphed into this caricature</a> called Lady Gaga, who isn&apos;t even a real person. The girl known as Stefi to her friends and family has all but disappeared.&quot;</p>
