<p>Last year the early stages of what could have turned into a very expensive habit began to form, as I purchased $5 glass bottles of rose water on weekly basis for two weeks. Rose water is very good, and does <em>not</em> taste like potpourri or your grandmother&apos;s perfume, as some unfortunate souls seem to believe. I don&apos;t know how to explain the flavor, exactly, but it&apos;s more of a crisp floral refresher. Anyway, it is goddamn delicious. Put rose water in everything, I say. </p>

<p>And now it appears they are. A trend by any other name would... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616054327/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/05/unicorn_lawsuit.php">probably just get you a lawsuit</a>, after all. </p>

<p>Doughnut Plant just announced two versions of a rose water doughnut (which you can only get through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616054327/https://www.foodkick.com/">FoodKick</a>); at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616054327/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/11/best_ice_cream_2017.php">one ice cream shop</a> in NYC offers a rose flavor; and recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616054327/http://laist.com/2017/05/03/bia_rose_latte.php#photo-1">LAist reported on a rose latte</a> being served up in Los Angeles. It&apos;s made with rose petals that are left to steep for three days in a cane sugar and water base, which is then added to milk and Klatch Coffee espresso, and topped with an edible rose petal and a dusting of rose powder. </p>

<p>After seeing that, I immediately began my search for a similar version of this rose latte in NYC, but have so far come up short. It appeared that Cafe Grumpy sold a rose latte with a coffee base, but when I dropped by this week I was told they are no longer on the menu. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="roselattesm.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616054327im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/roselattesm.jpeg" width="350" height="308"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> The rose latte/Rose Petal Milk Tea from Grace Street. (Photo by Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> In the meantime, it was recommended that I try out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616054327/http://www.bygracestreet.com/">Grace Street</a>&apos;s rose latte in Koreatown, which has a tea base. A manager there told me that the official name is the Rose Petal Milk Tea, and it&apos;s made with the following ingredients:<ul><li>Our own blend of Ceylon and Assam tea steeped and chilled overnight<br>
</li><li>Battenkill Valley Creamery milk (or macadamia, almond, or soy milk alternatives)<br>
</li><li>Organic edible rose petals (fresh for ice drinks &amp; dried for hot drinks)<br>
</li><li>Rose syrup</li></ul>This rose latte, or whatever you would like to call it, was one of the best things I&apos;ve ever had to drink in my entire life. The tea flavor definitely comes through, as does the rose, and while it&apos;s a little on the sweet side (for someone like me who doesn&apos;t love sweets), it wasn&apos;t sweet in an overpowering way. Bonus: the price is a pretty reasonable $4.82 before tax ($5.25 after tax). <p></p>

<p><em>Get your Rose Latte (aka Rose Petal Milk Tea) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616054327/http://www.bygracestreet.com/">Grace Street</a>, located at 17 W 32nd St (btw 5th and Broadway)</em></p>
