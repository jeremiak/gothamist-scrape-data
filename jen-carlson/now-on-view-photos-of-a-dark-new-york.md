                            <p>If you aren&apos;t impressed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206020517/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/26/the_met_opens_roof_shows_off_sculpt.php">the rooftop installation</a> at The Met, then head inside for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206020517/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId={4F9E1DE0-D720-40FF-ACF3-ACFA8C4673A7}">Night Vision</a> exhibit (which also just opened). &quot;At the turn of the last century, night photography came into its own as an artistic genre. Modern camera artists were captivated by the many moods of electric light: the softly shining globes of street lamps, glittering skyscraper fa&#xE7;ades, dazzling neon signs, the intimate chiaroscuro of lamplit rooms.&quot; This made New York the perfect subject, though the exhibit also includes photos from all over the world. Click through for a look at Little Italy&apos;s Feast of San Gennaro circa 1948, and that time a man&apos;s decapitated head was found next to a cake box.</p>
