<p>This Friday night, Chiara de Blasio, Santigold, Carla Miller, DJ Rekha, Sarah Landeau, and Kathleen Hanna will be honored by the Willie Mae Rock Camp For Girls. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326175254/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2411910">You should probably buy tickets</a>, and hope that some of their magic rubs off on you at the intimate affair being held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326175254/http://williemaerockcamp.org/events/a-little-bit-of-rhythm-and-a-lot-of-soul/">at Roulette</a>.
