</div></div>					<p>While the death rattle has been audible for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/14/time_square_wit.php">quite some time</a>, Viacom only officially announced Total Request Live&apos;s retirement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/16/trl_1.php">in September</a>, and yesterday they officially faded to black.</p>

<p>So while the corpse of Total Request Live is barely cold, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/share-your-memories-of-total-request-live/">the NY Times</a> just isn&apos;t ready to say goodbye. They&apos;re asking their readers to send in their fondest memories of Carson Daly &amp; Co. (who knew the Gray Lady and MTV teen screamfest had a crossover audience?). </p>

<p>How is everyone else coping? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://jezebel.com/5090509/trl-goes-out-with-a-craptastic-bang">Jezebel</a> commemorates the end of a &quot;mediocre era&quot; with a look at the finale fashions; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-ettrl1712183300nov17,0,1036022.story?track=rss">the Daily News</a> recaps the star-studded event (which included appearances by Snoop Dogg, Beyonce, Justin Timberlake and...you get the picture); and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://greasyguide.com/2008/11/16/my-pics-from-inside-the-trl-finale-beyonce-50-cent-justin-timberlake-and-more/">Greasy Guide</a> documents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://greasyguide.com/2008/11/16/my-pics-from-inside-the-trl-finale-beyonce-50-cent-justin-timberlake-and-more/"><em>the scene</em></a>.</p>

<p>What&apos;s that...what&apos;s <em>our</em> favorite TRL moment? Probably that time Justin Timberlake was made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020812/http://gothamist.com/2006/09/13/weirdest_moment.php">to identify animal mating sounds</a>.</p>
