title: Get Your Royal Wedding On... Literally, With These Things
---

	
										<p><em>The Royal Wedding is just a few days away, so hopefully you have already purchased your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151953/http://www.starstills.com/products/Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-%28Royal-Wedding-2011%29-Lifesize-Cardboard-Cutout-%7B47%7D-Standee.html">Prince William and Kate Middleton Lifesize Cardboard Cutout</a> so you can pretend that you are spending the couple&apos;s special day with them. Tomorrow we&apos;ll have a full roundup of where you can witness the magical union <em>live</em> (aka at 5:30 a.m. EST on Friday) right here in NYC, but first we wanted to give you a heads up on some Royal Wedding must-have memorabilia. Because we don&apos;t want you to look like an idiot in front of the other Royal Wedding enthusiasts when you show up for The Big Day later this week. (You&apos;re welcome.) Click through for our top five Royal Wedding wearables.</em></p>
