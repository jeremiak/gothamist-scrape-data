<p>The documentary <em>Good Ol&apos; Freda</em>, centered around the teenage secretary of The Beatles, was named after a snippet from the band&apos;s 1963 Christmas record, which they made annually for their fan club. On the record, after George Harrison thanks Freda (&quot;Nobody else has said anything about our fan club secretary... Freda Kelly in Liverpool&quot;), the other Beatles are heard yelling in the background: &quot;Good ol&apos; Freda!&quot; This audio runs over the opening credits of the documentary (which we have mentioned before: you can watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526081531/http://www.amazon.com/Good-Ol-Freda-HD-Kelly/dp/B00F0CNQ8Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387826804&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=good+ol+freda">on Amazon</a>!). That was their first Christmas album, and six more would follow. Below you can listen to all of them (each one features both banter and music) from 1963 through 1969&#x2014;things get expectedly next level in 1967, around the time they were visiting the Maharishi and things were Getting Weird.</p>

<p>Following the final 1969 album, an LP compilation of all seven was released in 1970. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526081531/http://www.openculture.com/2013/12/listen-to-the-beatles-christmas-records.html">OpenCulture</a>]</p>
