Some highlights: cast member Baya was asked why Red Hook bar owners banned them, to which she replied, &quot;They knew that we were coming and didn&#x2019;t like the idea of it. It&#x2019;s understandable. When you go to a small place, it&#x2019;s really intrusive to have a huge camera crew come in.&quot; Meanwhile, with much of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102303/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/05/real_world_part_two.php">the cast still here</a>, Ryan tells of their big city New Year&apos;s Eve plans, saying, &quot;I thought, Hey, let&#x2019;s all get together. We want to do the whole Times Square experience. I know it&#x2019;s going to be crazy. I&#x2019;ve heard horror stories. But I&#x2019;m looking forward to doing it&quot; (TONY clues them in on locals not ever doing that). But Mormon Chet <em>continues</em> to steal the spotlight when he asks the mag: &quot;What&#x2019;s that show, where the girls are doing the kick-ups? They&#x2019;re very limber. Very limber. And that&#x2019;s very important to me. <strong>The day I have sex I&#x2019;m hoping it&#x2019;s with a girl who has a little maneuverability.</strong>&quot; (*Shudder*) Watch out Rockettes! The season starts airing on MTV next month, but for now let&apos;s all take a look back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102303/http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=11885&amp;title=the-mad-real-world-introduction">The Real World Hoboken</a>.</p>
