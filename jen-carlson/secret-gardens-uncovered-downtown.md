</div></div><p>There&apos;s a new secret garden downtown! Well, sort of. Richard Pasquarelli has just installed the first portion of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414170213/http://www.downtownny.com/reconstruction">Secret Gardens</a> public art project, a 5-foot-high, 1,000-foot-long vinyl mesh installation of &#x201C;secret&#x201D; backyard and garden scenes. This a a joint project by the New York City Department of Transportation&apos;s Urban Art Program and the Downtown Alliance&#x2019;s Re:Construction program, which installs temporary artworks at construction sites throughout Lower Manhattan. Beats looking at blue construction walls! Check it out along the site of the Chambers Street road reconstruction project, between West and Greenwich streets, as well as a more recently unveiled stretch from Greenwich Street to West Broadway.</p>
