<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="philfloat0211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601011457im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/philfloat0211.jpg" width="633" height="439" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Earlier today we talked to Heather Feather, one of the organizer&apos;s behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601011457/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/11/celebrate_phil_collins_day_with_a_p.php">tonight&apos;s Phil Collins Day Parade</a> (by the way: Happy Phil Collins Day, everyone!). She gave us a little background on the holiday, saying it began back at her high school in Washington as a reaction to Valentine&apos;s Day, as she &quot;watched with disgust and awkward sadness as the halls of our high school filled with red balloons and thorny roses.&quot; Today marks the 5th ever Phil Collins Day, and Feather thinks it will be the biggest yet. And we&apos;ve got <em>total coverage</em> people, our photographer will even be on hand at tonight&apos;s parade, so we suggest you clock out early and get started on your Phil float! </p>

<p>Tonight, Feather had just expected a few friends at the parade, but now says &quot;it&apos;s spread to all corners of the world wide web.  And as exciting as that seems, it also makes me a little nervous.  I hope, that for all who come tonight, that they come to enjoy everything that Phil represents, and to have a great time.  To eat pizza, to drink Phil Collins drinks, to make Phil masks, and to enjoy this homemade parade.&quot;</p>

<p>For total preparation, head to Moves (214 Franklin Street), where they&apos;ll be offering a Phil Collins mask making session, and be sure to enjoy a Phil Collins themed pizza (In the Pear Tonight) at Paulie Gee&apos;s! For the aforementioned Phil Collins drink, head to the parade afterparty at Shayz Lounge (130 Franklin Street). Let&apos;s make this the best Phil Collins Day <em>ever</em>&#x2014;get thee to Franklin Street by 7:30 to take part in the parade, here&apos;s a little motivation:</p>
