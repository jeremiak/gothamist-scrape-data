										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpikHZr7PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002837im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpikHZr7PM.jpg" width="350" height="213" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday staff at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002837/http://www.gaycenter.org/">Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center</a> in Manhattan were greeted by a burned rainbow flag hanging outside as they arrived at work. The NYC Anti-Violence Project (AVP) tells us the NYPD were contacted immediately and their Hate Crimes unit is now handling the investigation, with help from the AVP. </p>

<p>The LGBT&apos;s Glennda Testone said in a statement: &quot;We at the Center will not stand for anyone who thinks they can come into our community and try to intimidate us. We work hard to create a safe environment and provide a safe space for all LGBT New Yorkers. Hate and intolerance against us will not be accepted in New York, and it is so important the Center is a safe space in our city. It is sad that such incidents still happen in this day and age.&quot; Manhattan Borough President Scott M. Stringer also addressed the hate crime, which he called &quot;a cowardly attempt at intimidation,&quot; saying such acts would not be tolerated.</p>

<p>The flag burner was caught on their surveillance video, but they are also asking for additional tips, which can be directed to the police at 1-800-577-TIPS.</p>
