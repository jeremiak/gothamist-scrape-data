										<p>As SXSW&apos;s music fest kicks off today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110314/http://thelmagazine.com/">The L Magazine</a> has announced the first annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110314/http://www.northsidefestival.com/">Northside Festival</a>. Taking place from June 11th through the 14th, think of it as our very own version of the Austin fest. All shows will take place in the venue-saturated area of Williamsburg and Greenpoint and is being touted as &quot;a four-day celebration of the independent music and art scene that thrives here...with live music being held at nearly every venue in the area (including some that haven&apos;t even opened yet), and art events at some of the most relevant galleries in the neighborhood.&quot; Unlike CMJ, this will all be in two neighboring &apos;hoods, making nearly every event within walking distance from the other.</p>

<p>Sounds good, right? As you&apos;ll notice at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110314/http://www.northsidefestival.com/2009/03/first-showcases-announced/">the festival&apos;s website</a>, Gothamist has a showcase at the event. Save the date; ours is being held at Public Assembly on Saturday June 13th. We&apos;ll have two stages, with staggered set times so you don&apos;t miss anyone. And since we&apos;ve already got some of the acts booked, we thought we&apos;d make the first announcement right here. So far at our show, you&apos;ll be getting sets from Aaron Behrens, who you may know as the frontman of Ghostland Observatory, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110314/http://www.myspace.com/caleparksmusic">Cale Parks</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110314/http://www.myspace.com/henrywolfemusic">Henry Wolfe</a>. Stay tuned for many more announcements!</p>
