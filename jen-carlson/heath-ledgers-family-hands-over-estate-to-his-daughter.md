Now Ledger&apos;s father has publicly declared that every cent of the estimated $20 million estate (originally left to his sisters and parents) would go to Matilda, telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072522/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20229472,00.html">People</a> magazine that was the plan &quot;from the moment my boy passed away.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072522/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,429502,00.html">Fox News</a> notes that &quot;Williams&apos; father [Larry Williams, one of the world&apos;s best-known stock market traders] has previously challenged the grieving Ledger family to publicly state the value of their son&apos;s fortune.&quot; Meanwhile, TMZ is reporting that the ReliaStar Life Insurance Company, who wrote Heath Ledger&apos;s $10 million life insurance policy is in June of 2007, is &quot;being sued after claiming the actor&apos;s death might have been a suicide, even though officials concluded it was accidental. Lawyers for Ledger&apos;s daughter say it&apos;s a transparent ploy to avoid paying the money.&quot;</p>
