title: Hypnotic Video Takes You Gliding Through Early Morning NYC
---

	
										<p>Someone (update: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165119/http://paultrillo.com/">Paul Trillo</a>) took 41 photographs while traveling through the streets of New York City between the empty-ish hours of 3 and 7 a.m., and compiled them into this rather hypnotic and relaxing video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165119/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lA3-cJgN6I">for Nokia</a>. We took the liberty of taking out their generic ambient music, and added our own. But since, rather confusingly, we only have <em>MTV Party To Go</em> compilations on our office computers, it was slim pickins. So just sit back, relax, and pretend you&apos;re cruising down a main drag in Manhattan in 1991, when Color Me Badd&apos;s &quot;All 4 Love&quot; was pumping over the radio airwaves. </p>
