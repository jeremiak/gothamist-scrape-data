Looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154236/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/03/25/aziz_ansari_comedian.php">Aziz Ansari</a> has transitioned from blogs to television, and we couldn&apos;t be more psyched for him! Along with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer, Ansari is one third of the Human Giant team. The series will air on MTV in early 2007. Jason Woliner will direct and produce. We can&apos;t wait!

<blockquote>&quot;MTV said Wednesday it has given the green light to &quot;Human Giant,&quot; a sketch comedy series described as a collection of &quot;recklessly hilarious, fast-paced, hard-hitting short films.&quot;

<p>First seen online, short clips including &quot;Shutterbugs&quot; and &quot;The Illusionators&quot; have gained a cult following, according to MTV, which added that &quot;Giant&quot; also has gained a large audience in the New York comedy scene through live shows at the underground club Upright Citizens Brigade.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
