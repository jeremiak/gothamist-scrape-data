<p>Taxi TV is ear-shattering enough but at least there&apos;s an easily accessible &quot;off&quot; button. Sometimes, however, your driver may provide the entertainment. As part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324095611/http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rights.shtml">Taxicab Rider Bill of Rights</a>, passengers have a right to control the volume of music&#x2014;it states you have the right to &quot;a noise free trip: no horn honking or radio.&quot; But, you know, it happens... and sometimes (like when alcohol is involved, mostly) it can even be sort of fun to whip through the city streets with a stranger behind the wheel while the music is turned up to 11. <em>But not all the time.</em> One man took this below video from the back seat of a cab this week to document the volume of the music the cab driver was playing&#x2014;turns out you <em>can</em> go past 11 on the volume control!</p>

<p>There&apos;s only a handful of things to do in this case (&quot;hey, can you turn the music down?&quot;), and apparently one option is to document it. However, it was around 1 a.m., so maybe the music was keeping the driver awake!</p>
