Things aren&apos;t looking so hot at Brooklyn club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://www.clubstudiob.com/">Studio B</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/12/for_sale_dolce_vita_studio_b_a.html">Grub Street</a> is reporting it&apos;s on the market &quot;for $1 million and a $22,000-per-month rent.&quot; The club, based on Miami&apos;s Studio A, has been hitting roadblocks all along since opening in Greenpoint two years ago. But so far <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/29/studio_b_2.php">neighbor complaints</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/studio_b_1.php">stop work orders</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=4662">Miss Heather</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/24/bartops.php">illegal rooftops</a> haven&apos;t been able to shut the doors for good...until now? Promoter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://www.justined.com/">Justine D</a> also shared her departure from the establishment in an email today, explaining: &quot;I&apos;ve been busy making the transition from STUDIO B to an amazing new venue called (LE) POISSON ROUGE.&quot; Currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070708/http://www.clubstudiob.com/calendar.html">their calendar</a> runs through the end of January.</p>
