<p>In 1979 Andy Warhol snapped a shot of the actress with his Polaroid camera, which is now going on auction at the Children&apos;s Museum of the Arts this Thursday. The 3-inch by 4-inch snapshot is <em>not</em> the one in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913133614/http://www.amazon.com/Andy-Warhol-Polaroids-Celebrities-Self-Portraits/dp/8391307522">his Polaroid book</a>, and is already valued at more than $8,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913133614/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/03/warhol-and-his.html">Reportedly</a> the artist&apos;s Polaroids were used for his eventual silk-screen portraits. Warhol had &quot;intended his Polaroids to serve as time-capsule glimpses of a specific era &#x2014; namely, the &apos;70s and early &apos;80s when he was at the height of his fame.&quot;</p>

<p>There will plenty more up for auction, as well, including works of art by David Byrne, Yoko Ono and John Waters.
