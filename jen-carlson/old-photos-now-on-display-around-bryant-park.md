<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113624/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/bryant_park_1980s.php">we took a look back</a> at some old photos of Bryant Park during its more troubled years, when junkies and hookers ruled the grounds. Now Bryant Park is putting their sordid (and not-so-sordid) past on display, in celebration of their 20th anniversary. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113624/http://blog.bryantpark.org/2012/05/20-years-of-bryant-park-exhibit.html">They say</a>:</p><blockquote>The last twenty years have marked a dramatic change in the condition and perception of Bryant Park. In the late 1980&apos;s the park was dangerous, rundown and under used. Today it is home to lush gardens, a carousel, a world class restaurant, as well as hundreds of events and programs. As we celebrate the transformation of the park from neglected to beloved, we&apos;re looking back on the park&apos;s history through photos, stories, and more. You may have been following our 20th Anniversary series on the blog, and now many of these elements come to life in a custom photo exhibit on the park&apos;s perimeter fence.</blockquote>They promise photos from the Bad Old Days, as well as their more cleaned-up era&#x2014;all of which will be on display through  through June 29th. And might we recommend that after checking it out, you enjoy a glass of wine at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113624/http://bryantpark.org/things-to-do/southwest_porch.html">Southwest Porch</a>? We recently dropped by and were pleasantly surprised by their heavy pour on an $8 glass.<p></p>
