<p>Yesterday we briefly discussed Murray sightings in the office&#x2014;each one seems so unique, like he&apos;s giving every person he encounters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143323/https://twitter.com/klassyfucker/status/359775201891856384">a special little gift</a> for them and them alone. </p>

<strong>Jen:</strong> No one asked you <br>
<strong>Jen:</strong> And the Village Voice saw him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143323/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/07/we_bet_on_horses_with_dinowalrus.php">at Belmont</a>. And also he was at whatever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143323/https://twitter.com/CameronCRussell/status/359763789052256257">this is</a>. <br>
<strong>John:</strong> I feel like people shouldn&apos;t be allowed to tweet about Bill Murray unless there&apos;s a pic <br>
[...Time Passes...]<br>
<strong>Jen:</strong> I think that one day our independent bookstores will be 90% bullshit Tumblr books. <br>
<strong>John:</strong> Better cash in! <br>

<p><strong>John:</strong> Bill Murray was a half fucking block from my apartment. Now my rent&apos;s going to go up again.<br>
<strong>Jen:</strong> and WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT BILL MURRAY SIGHTINGS today.</p>

<p>At press time, 5 out of 9 Gothamist staffers in the office have Bill Murray stories&#x2014;one involving a night of karaoke, one involving a Seu Jorge concert, one that can never be repeated, one from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143323/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/16/poetry_walk_2010.php#photo-1">the 2010 poetry walk</a>, and one of him on set. What about you?</p>
