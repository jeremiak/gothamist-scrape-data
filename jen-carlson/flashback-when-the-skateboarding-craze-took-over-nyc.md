</div></div><p>Back in the 1960s, photographer Bill Eppridge documented the new fad: skateboarding. This was for LIFE magazine&apos;s cover story, for their May 14th, 1965 issue&#x2014;the text <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120226195428/http://www.gstatic.com/hostedimg/3ddf3a47d38df507_large">on the cover</a> read &quot;The craze and the menace of skateboards,&quot; and featured a photo of Pat McGee, the national girl&apos;s skateboarding champ of the time.</p>

<p>According to the internet, skateboarding was born sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, with the first manufactured skateboards ordered by a Los Angeles surf shop. But the popularity of skateboarding didn&apos;t happen until the 1960s, a decade which even saw the birth of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120226195428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarder_Magazine">Skateboarder Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>Now&apos;s a good time to revisit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120226195428/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/02/video_nyc_as_seen_from_the_bottom_o.php">what it looks like to be a skateboard in the city</a> these days, and here&apos;s more on the skateboarding scene here:</p>
