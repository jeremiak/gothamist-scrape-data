<p>It&apos;s Winterfest time at the Central Park Zoo. The annual winter-themed holiday program features thousands of twinkling lights, festive greenery... and giant polar bears tearing presents to shreds! The fest will run the first three Fridays and Saturdays in December, during which time the zoo will be open until 6:30 p.m.; visitors can expect to see snow leopards, polar bears, and penguins receiving gifts on those days. Spoiler alert: inside each wrapped box are fishsicles and fruit! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002321/http://centralparkzoo.com/plan-your-trip/events-calendar/presents-to-the-animals.aspx">More details here</a>.</p>
