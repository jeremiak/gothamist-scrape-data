										<p>Want to see the development of Midtown Manhattan happen right before your very eyes in just one minute? Click play below to see the area at Central Park South and 5th Avenue grow over a 165 year time span. The video was put together by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409184155/http://cubecities.blogspot.ca/2013/07/midtown-manhattan-growth-animation-1850.html">Cube Cities</a>, who point out, &quot;The 1920s was a busy decade in the history of Manhattan&apos;s development. The 1940s and 1950s were comparatively slow, but development leaped forward again in the 1970s only to slow significantly in the 1990s.&quot;</p>
