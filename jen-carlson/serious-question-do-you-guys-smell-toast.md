<p>Last month Adam Kuban <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230959/https://twitter.com/akuban/status/205655612149858306">Tweeted</a>, &quot;The Astoria Toast Smell is possibly a thing&#x2014;Gothamist should investigate. Woke up this morning to it.&quot; In Astoria, residents even started tracking the toast smell back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230959/http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?PHPSESSID=8b7b3f4819a2742c3495a69e53c35661&amp;topic=2604.msg25166#msg25166">in 2006</a>. The thing is, we were smelling it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230959/https://twitter.com/Gothamist/status/205735683254530048">in Brooklyn</a> a few weeks ago, too... and then we smelled it in Manhattan, meaning this thing has traveled through at least three boroughs. After it didn&apos;t return for a few days, however, we decided to move on&#x2014;until this morning, when it returned. </p>

<p>Here at Gothamist HQ we&apos;re getting strong toast scents wafting through the windows every hour or so, lasting about 5 to 10 seconds each time, then disappearing. One Gothamist staffer pinpointed it down to smelling specifically like &quot;toasted English muffins.&quot; </p>

<p>Please let us know if you have smelled toast around town, and if so, when and where. New York, this may just be our new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230959/http://gothamist.com/tags/maplesyrupsmell">Maple Syrup smell</a>.</p>
