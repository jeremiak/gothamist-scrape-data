<p>Maybe it&apos;s time to revisit the Depthscraper? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230035532/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/06/01/depthscrapers-defy-earthquakes/">Modern Mechanix</a>, back in 1931 some of Japan&apos;s engineering brains were devoted to creating earthquake-proof structures. Noting that tunnels and subterranean structures suffer less in seismic tremors, they proposed the Depthscraper, &quot;whose frame resembles that of a 35-story skyscraper of the type familiar in American large cities; but which is built in a mammoth excavation beneath the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>Basically it is like a movie villain&apos;s underground lair, or the place that rich and/or famous people get to go when they are chosen as the people to keep the human race going prior to an impending apocalypse. </p>

<p>At the time, Modern Mechanix wrote that &quot;the logic of the Depthscraper is convincing and, although such construction appears too costly for most residences in a district where land values are not excessive, for business buildings it offers a degree of safety against earthquakes (as well as hurricanes) not to be disregarded in a country which is subject to them incessantly.&quot;</p>

<p>In New York, we&apos;ve had our own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230035532/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/23/earthquake_in_virginia_shakes_manha.php">share of earthquakes</a>, with one 5.5 magnitude earthquake happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230035532/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/flashback_nyc_earthquake_of_1884.php">in 1884</a>. Not to mention John Armbruster at Columbia University&apos;s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory has maintained that we can expect an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 here once a century, and in March noted we were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230035532/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/more_nyc_earthquake_fearmongering.php">long overdue</a>.</p>
