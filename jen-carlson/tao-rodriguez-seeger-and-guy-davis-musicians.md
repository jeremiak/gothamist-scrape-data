This weekend he and his grandad will be joined by Seeger&apos;s longtime friend, bluesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134118/http://www.guydavis.com/">Guy Davis</a> (son of Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis). You can see the trio at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134118/http://bbg.org/vis2/2008/chilepepperfiesta/">Chile Pepper Festival</a>...but first, get to know them a little better.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your musical history? When did you begin to play? Tao:</strong> I played my first concert in Hiroshima for half a million people when I was fourteen years old.  My grandmother joked as I walked off stage, &quot;It&apos;s all downhill from here!&quot;  We were in Japan on a family trip and as always my grandpa paid for vacations by doing a few concerts.  We were invited to perform for the annual peace rally in Hiroshima on Aug 6th to commemorate the dropping of the bomb.  I&apos;ll never forget walking out onto that stage to an ocean of humanity.</p>

<p><strong>Guy:</strong> I first picked up a banjo at age of 8. The guitar and harmonica came at 15 or 16.</p>

<p><strong>When did you start playing with your Pete? Tao:</strong> That concert in Hiroshima was more or less when I started playing with my grandpa.  I was on his case about singing songs in Spanish with a bad accent.  I grew up in Nicaragua speaking English and Spanish so I&apos;m fully bilingual.  I was adolescent and snotty but he turned that around on me and said, &quot;If it sounds so bad, why don&apos;t you come up here and help make it sound a bit better!&quot;  I replied, &quot;How hard could that be?&quot; We&apos;ve been playing together ever since.</p>

<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Though I was present at a Clearwater meeting in Chinatown in the early 70&apos;s, and started hanging out with the folk music revival crowd in &apos;75 or &apos;76, it wasn&apos;t until 1977 that one day, Toshi took a snapshot of Pete and me. Pete told me that they were going to let me do some opening slots for him. Shortly after that, I was introduced to people like Malvina Reynolds, Fred Helleraman, Harold Levanthal and Moe Asch.</p>

<p><strong>Did he give you any advice? Tao:</strong> He&apos;s never been much of an advice giver.  I think he prefers to live his life the way he wants and to let people learn what they will from his example.  At least that&apos;s the way it&apos;s always been between us.</p>

<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Pete transposed one of Woody Guthrie&apos;s sayings and told me to &quot;Take it easy, but TAKE it.</p>
