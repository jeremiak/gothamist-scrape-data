title: Is This SoHo T-Shirt Stand The New Banksy?
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090336/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> hasn&apos;t posted today&apos;s piece yet, which means a few things: people whose job is to report on every day&apos;s new piece <em>have not left their desk all day</em>, and wild speculation about everything that seems remotely Banksy-ish is getting emailed to us. So far today we received everything from this pile of loose flowers and leaves in LIC...: </p>

<p>...to this T-shirt stand, which was set up at Crosby and Broadway earlier today (it&apos;s gone now):</p>

<p>If we had to choose, we&apos;d go with the T-shirt stand. We&apos;re pretty skeptical, as Banksy doesn&apos;t like to repeat his ideas, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090336/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/video_fake_banksy_stand_in_central.php">a lot of Fakesys</a> have popped up since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090336/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/13/video_banksy_set_up_a_pop_up_booth.php">his Central Park stand</a>... but the man in the photo doesn&apos;t <em>not</em> look like one of his crew members: </p>

<p>Could it all be related to this group that showed up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090336/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/banksy_says_latest_greenpoint_piece.php#photo-1">the Greenpoint piece</a> on Sunday? Probably not, since the stenciling is different.:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090336/http://instagram.com/notexactlyblue">Nic Garcia</a>, who has been following the Banksy pieces all month, tells us he heard this man has been seen at all the pieces this month... which could mean that he&apos;s either a fan, or a Banksy team member. He added,  &quot;The wait is the only thing that makes me even entertain this idea&#x2014;the fact this stand was there on the same day as such a late drop. But it&apos;s possible he&apos;s not posting a teaser about a potential piece [going up] tonight because when he posted a teaser about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090336/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/new_banksy_is_at_elizabeth_and_hous.php">the Reaper</a> the spot got blown the hell up and he got caught going in and out.&quot;</p>

<p>We emailed Banksy&apos;s publicist to confirm or deny that the t-shirt stand as an original Banksy, but have not heard back... which could also mean it&apos;s real.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This definitely isn&apos;t today&apos;s piece&#x2014;his new piece was announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090336/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/29/photo_new_banksy_piece_goes_up_in.php">around 3:30 p.m.</a>, and is a painting sitting inside the Housing Works on East 23rd. And Banksy&apos;s publicist has now confirmed that this t-shirt sale was a FAKE.</p>
