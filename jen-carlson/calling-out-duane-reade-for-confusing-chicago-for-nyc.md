title: Calling Out Duane Reade For Confusing Chicago For NYC

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523113910/http://gothamist.com/tags/duanereade">Duane Reade</a> is a New York City shop to its very foundation, founded in 1960 by brothers who opened three stores here, with a warehouse located between Duane and Reade streets. These days the chain has even branded their products as NYC-centric, with bar codes in the shape of city landmarks, trail mixes named after different neighborhoods, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523113910/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/duane_reade_wins_over_williamsburg.php">Brooklyn beers on tap</a>. So how is it that they&apos;ve confused Chicago for New York City? And how upset should we actually get about this? Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523113910/http://newyork.untappedcities.com/2011/10/07/duane-reade-mistakes-chicago-for-new-york-city/">Untapped NY</a>, they&apos;re calling the store out after spotting this sign in one of their Midtown outposts, which shows many well known places around the city... and one questionable photograph:<br>
</p><blockquote>I was stumped by one photograph. It depicted a statue with a gothic building in the background. Despite my best attempts I was unable to think of a similarly situated statue and building in New York City. I figured if I could identify either the building or the statue I might be able to narrow it down. The only building that I could think of which was somewhat similar in form was Riverside Church but I was sure that there were no statues in front of it. Next, I turned to the statue. I realized that the statue looked very similar to the statue of Nathan Hale I had seen at Yale, of which I knew there were copies, and close enough to the one in City Hall Park. As far as I knew, there was only one statue of Hale in New York City and that one was located in City Hall Park. When it was finally my turn to pay, I asked the cashier if she recognized the sites depicted in the photographs. She did not, though another employee suggested that the photograph has been taken somewhere in Brooklyn.</blockquote><br>
The statue in the photo is actually far away from both Brooklyn and Manhattan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523113910/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=chicago+tribune+statue+nathan+hale&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=2222l3749l0l3869l12l9l0l0l0l1l622l1631l0.2.1.1.0.1l5l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1244&amp;bih=692&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">residing</a> at the Chicago Tribune Building. It&apos;s almost like this massive chain store just doesn&apos;t even care anymore.<p></p>
