<p>Street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215126/http://gothamist.com/tags/shepardfairey">Shepard Fairey</a> gained fame after years of putting up his Obey stickers and wheatpastes on every surface of this and other cities&#x2014;but does he do it all himself now that he&apos;s got fame and, presumably, fortune? According to his wife: no way. But of course, that&apos;s not what he wants <em>you</em> to think. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215126/http://www.tmz.com/2011/06/14/street-artist-shepard-fairey-obey-obama-hope-wife-secrets-exposed-tmz-on-tv/">TMZ</a> recently bombarded the couple at the airport, where their awkward interaction went something like this: </p>

<p><strong>TMZ:</strong> You know, people go out and put the posters up...do you ever do that yourself?<br>
<strong>Shepard Fairey&apos;s wife:</strong> Long time ago...<br>
<strong>Shepard Fairey:</strong> What are you... don&apos;t answer stuff, please. Jesus. What is your problem? You&apos;re not stupid. <br>
<strong>Shepard Fairey&apos;s wife</strong> [to TMZ]: You know what, we have to stop this right now.</p>

<p><em>End scene</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215126/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tI0S1_qBA">Watch it all on YouTube here</a>, and then ask yourself: did you really think that he was putting all these things up himself these days... or just when there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215126/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/fin_shepard_fairey.php">a photo opp</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215126/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/27/shep_1.php">paycheck</a>?</p>
