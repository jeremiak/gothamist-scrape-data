Two of them students, two of them teachers...and their band name came from an argument about grammar. We love them already. </p>

<p>They play a unique brand of psych pop-rock, the perfect sonic outcome of a student-teacher collaboration. Thought-rock that you can dance to. So come check &apos;em out tonight, they go on at 8pm. </p>

<p>They&apos;ve got an album coming out in February, but for now you can listen to their Lounge Act on WOXY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208003928/http://content.lala.com/woxy/loungeact/thesubjects-20060808.mp3">here</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
<strong>JS</strong> - Subjects<br>
<strong>DS</strong> - We had an argument over grammar and did it out of spite because we were mad at each other.</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
<strong>JS</strong> - Light!<br>
<strong>DS</strong> - Taking the tour of Rockefeller Center and thinking, &quot;Wow.  There is so much awesome history right here.  Only in New York.&quot;<br>
<strong>MP</strong> - China Town. I saw a lot of dead chickens. I was in a blue car</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out?<br>
JS</strong> - Margaritas at Chipotle; Monday - because it&apos;s a great way to kick the week off, and you aren&apos;t hung over at work tomorrow.<br>
<strong>DS</strong> - Margaritas at Applebee&apos;s in Times Square (great food, too); Saturday - they play the best music and there&apos;s the best crowds.<br>
<strong>MP</strong> - Margaritas at Chipotle are pretty great but i&apos;m going to have to pick Margaritas at the Coco Cubana; Thursdays - The next day is friday so it is a nice way to bring in the weekend.</p>
