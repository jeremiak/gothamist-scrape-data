<p>The members of Community Board 1 may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417213933/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/concerts_now_banned_on_williamsburg.php">voted unanimously against concerts</a> on Williamsburg&apos;s waterfront, but they are still going to happen this summer thanks to a little contract that was already signed by the OSA and the State Parks Department. That isn&apos;t stopping that CB1 crew from yammering on about the nuisance the shows create, however. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417213933/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/16/wb_concertcrackdown_2011_4_22_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the locals want the concerts to produce less noise, and less trash.</p>

<p>CB1 member Del Teague claims, &#x201C;The entire area is just devastated. f you can&#x2019;t get out of the neighborhood, your weekend is ruined. There are so many people, you can&#x2019;t walk through the streets.&#x201D; While another nearby resident says the partying crowds make it &#x201C;impossible for senior citizens to sit in front of the back yard and enjoy the day.&#x201D;</p>

<p>They&apos;re now asking the state to watch over promoters, and &quot;minimize disruptions.&quot; Their suggestions for doing this include regulating the time concerts end and corralling attendees down Metropolitan Avenue instead of the smaller, more residential streets. Still, Open Space Alliance director Stephanie Thayer insists they have a good track record and have &quot;received almost no complaints.&quot;</p>
