<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173108/http://seinfeld.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Seinfeld_fictional_films">WikiSein</a>, and also our memory, there were plenty of fictional films that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173108/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> gang saw, talked about seeing, or illegally recorded for a bootleg business. Last month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173108/http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/seinfeld-movie-posters/">movie posters</a> were created for some of those films, and now even more have been knocked out to continue the series. Obviously the next step would be sweding these titles.</p>

<p>Do you remember which episode &quot;Agent Zero&quot; was in? The answer is in the video below:</p>
