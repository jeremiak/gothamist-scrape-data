<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="nmh0214.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135642im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/nmh0214.jpg" width="350" height="238" class="image-right"> </span>It wasn&apos;t that long ago that it seemed like we&apos;d never see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135642/http://gothamist.com/tags/jeffmangum">Jeff Mangum</a>&apos;s face again, but then he returned out of nowhere for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135642/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/09/jeff_mangum_returns_again_tickets_o.php">a few solo shows</a>, giving us all hope that a Neutral Milk Hotel reunion was not far behind. And not only did we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135642/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/neutral_milk_hotel.php">get that</a>, Mangum has apparently acquired some road legs, and the band&apos;s tour has just been extended.</p>

<p>While they&apos;ve already played several shows in the New York City area, they&apos;ll be back: it was just announced that the beloved troupe will hit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135642/http://bricartsmedia.org/events/benefit-concert-neutral-milk-hotel">Celebrate Brooklyn</a> stage this summer. Tickets go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135642/http://www.ticketmaster.com/Neutral-Milk-Hotel-tickets/artist/1866495?REFERRAL_ID=tmfeedbuyat141047&amp;wt.mc_id=aff_BUYAT_141047&amp;camefrom=CFC_BUYAT_141047">on sale THIS FRIDAY</a> (with a presale on Thursday morning), for the show on July 22nd in Prospect Park. They&apos;ll cost you just around 40 bucks.</p>

<p>They&apos;ve currently got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135642/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/02/neutral_milk_ho_10.html">7 more months</a> of touring ahead of them, which hopefully won&apos;t burn anyone out.</p>
