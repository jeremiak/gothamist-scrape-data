                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="SURICRUISE0713.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014929im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SURICRUISE0713.jpg" width="640" height="353" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It&apos;s bad enough when paparazzi target adults, but on Tuesday a particularly vile one decided to go after 7-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014929/http://gothamist.com/tags/suricruise">Suri Cruise</a>, <em>an innocent child</em> who has never known a life where there weren&apos;t a gaggle of photographers surrounding her wherever she goes. </p>

<p>The below video shows Katie Holmes, Suri, and a friend leaving the Trump International Hotel on Central Park West, where the incident happened. As the photographers flock to them, Suri says &quot;Stop,&quot; and as the trio try to navigate through the tabloid hounds, she tells them: &quot;We&apos;re trying to get in the car. Stop it! Get out of the way.&quot; Seems like some reasonable requests! But one paparazzi yells out, calling her a &quot;brat,&quot; adding, &quot;She&apos;s a bitch. A little brat kid.&quot; But not everyone is so evil, after the outburst another paparazzi scolds him and schools him.</p>
