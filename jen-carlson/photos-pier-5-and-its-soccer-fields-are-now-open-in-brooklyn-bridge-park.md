</div></div>					<p>Today Mayor Bloomberg, donning a New York Red Bulls scarf, sounded a whistle to officially open the new sports fields and picnic peninsula on Pier 5 in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000228/http://gothamist.com/tags/BrooklynBridgePark">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a>. The Mayor was joined by many who aided in the pier&apos;s progress, including BBP president Regina Myer, State Senator Daniel Squadron, Parks Commissioner Veronica White, and of course Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz... who called upon Bloomberg to build a new Barclays-style arena in Brooklyn to house New York&apos;s soccer team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000228/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">the Red Bulls</a>, who were also on hand along with general manager J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me de Bontin.</p>

<p>The three fields (to give you an idea of size: two can be combined to create a regulation soccer field) will accommodate everything from lacrosse to rugby to cricket to flag football and ultimate Frisbee. They&apos;re made of synthetic turf which is supported by shock pad and an organic infill made of sand and coconut fibers. You can click through for a closer look at the faux grass&#x2014;one local who attended the press conference was overheard asking, &quot;Remember when kids used to play in <em>real</em> grass?&quot; However, the synthetic turf will &quot;provide padding [and] help decrease surface temperature, creating a cooler experience for teams and spectators.&quot; The fields are open now for anyone to enjoy, and BBP will begin permitting them for league play in spring 2013.</p>

<p>Surrounding the fields are playgrounds for children, including a tether ball area; tables and benches; BBQ grills; sweeping views; and even an area for fishing equipped with bait preparation tables and sinks.<br>
 <br>
Since the park&apos;s electrical equipment sustained significant flood damage during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000228/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, the hours will be more limited for now&#x2014;&quot;there will be no evening play until the electrical equipment that provides power to the pier lights is replaced.&quot; Myer said this should be fixed sometime &quot;this winter.&quot;</p>

<p>Other sections of the 85-acre Brooklyn Bridge Park span are still being developed, and by year&apos;s end <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000228/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/05/this_pedestrian_bridge_will_connect.php#photo-1">the new pedestrian bridge</a> connecting Pier 1 to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade (via Squibb Park) will be open.</p>
