<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="snookbook1111.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103050221im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/snookbook1111.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="image-left"> </span>While some of America was helping the real talent get back on track, another portion was helping <em>no one</em> by buying a book written by <em>Jersey Shore</em>&apos;s Snooki. The reality starlet is now a published author&#x2014;though her book, &quot;A Shore Thing,&quot; was a collaborative work with writer Valerie Frankel. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103050221/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2011/01/05/2011-01-05_nicole_snooki_polizzi_jersey_shore_star_talks_first_novel_a_shore_thing.html">the Daily News</a>, Snooki prefers to go by her real name now, Nicole, and has excitedly declared, &quot;I never knew I would write a book!&quot; Only the big man in Hades could have predicted that one. </p>

<p><strike>Snooki</strike> Nicole thinks everyone out there will think her book is &quot;awesome,&quot; but if you simply don&apos;t have the time or brain capacity to commit towards what are sure to be complicated plotlines, here&apos;s a quick summary. The book, a work of fiction, follows a girl named Gia (who is eerily similar to Snooki herself) and her cousin Isabella (who is eerily similar to her real life best friend J-WOWW) on a summertime adventure in the Jersey Shore. She says she pulled a lot of her &quot;ideas&quot; from incidents that occurred during filming, and now that they&apos;ve wrapped on Season 3, she&apos;s got even more &quot;ideas&quot;! In fact, enough for a sequel. </p>

<p>Surely there are some great pull quotes, but no one sent us the book, so we&apos;ll never <em>really</em> know. But if you want to dip into the dark recesses of Snooki&apos;s mind, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103050221/http://jezebel.com/5725504/the-harrowing-date+rape-scene-from-snookis-book">Jezebel</a> posted a disturbing date rape passage earlier, which declares: <strong>&quot;This girl was putting up a fight. Most whores would just give in at this point and accept the situation they were in. If she ate the dinner, took the gifts, came home with you, she was obliged to put out. If she changed her mind and didn&apos;t want to? Too bad. Things might get a little rough. She deserved what happened.&quot;</strong> Ghostwriter Frankel has said that part was added to give the book &quot;some depth.&quot;</p>
