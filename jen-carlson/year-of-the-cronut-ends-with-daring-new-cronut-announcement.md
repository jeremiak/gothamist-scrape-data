<p>We leave 2013, the Year of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119071229/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">Cronut</a>&#x2122;, with an announcement that assures us that in 2014 there will still be Cronuts. Dominque Ansel, who turned the pastry world upside down this year with his croissant-doughnut hybrid, has just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119071229/http://instagram.com/p/iY7reKlOID/">posted a photo</a> of the upcoming January Cronut, which will feature a Peanut Butter Rum Caramel flavor palate. </p>

<p>Surely we aren&apos;t the only ones with a confusing relationship with peanut butter (&quot;we love it we hate it we love it we hate it we wouldn&apos;t wait on line for it!), and with peanut butter allergies and all, and with January being a month that people like to get back in shape, and <em>weather</em>... what we&apos;re saying is we may be looking at the shortest Cronut lines in history next month.</p>

<p>To help with sales, we recommend Ansel and his team recreate this vintage Reese&apos;s ad. &quot;Hey, you got peanut butter in my Cronut! You got Cronut in my peanut butter!&quot;</p>
