<p>At 7:30 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045951/http://gothamist.com/tags/statenislandchuck">Staten Island Chuck</a> <em>very</em> reluctantly came out of his winter home and did not see his shadow, therefore predicting that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045951/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/02/staten_islands_famous_groundho.html">Spring is just around the corner</a>. However, over in Pennsylvania, Puxsutawney Phil predicted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045951/http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/weather/02/02/groundhog.day/index.html">more winter</a>! Maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045951/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/26/petas_plea_for_robotic_groundhogs.php">a robot</a> <em>would</em> be more accurate. The two have differed before, but for the record, Chuck has had correct predictions 80% of the time since the 1980s.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mayor Bloomberg went hand-to-face once again with the animal, as officiator of the ceremony. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045951/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/02/mayor_bloomberg_vs_staten_island_ch.php">Last year</a> Chuck took a bite out of the Mayor&apos;s finger (he says he still has the scar), but this year he was more prepared and donned heavy duty gloves, as opposed to those fancy leather ones. After wrangling Chuck out of his home and returning him there without incident, he declared, &quot;I think it&apos;s clear who the real winner is.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045951/http://videos.silive.com/staten-island-advance/2010/02/groundhog_day_prediction_video.html">Staten Island Advance</a> now has video, for those who weren&apos;t awake to see it all go down <em>live</em>.</p>
