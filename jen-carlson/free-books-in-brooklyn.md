<p>The soon-to-be former home of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724025544/http://www.heightsbooks.com/">Heights Books</a> on Montague Street recently sold for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724025544/http://brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=5&amp;id=26303">$3.7 million</a>, so the shop is movin&apos; out and over to 120 Smith Street. But won&apos;t they need their books? A reader sent in these photos saying they&apos;ve &quot;set up a dumpster out front filled with books which presumably won&apos;t be following them to their new location. Dozens of people are sifting through the piles of dusty books, although the owner has been discouraging full-on dumpster diving.&quot; Though the store specializes in one-of-a-kinds, we&apos;re guessing they weren&apos;t sloppy enough to toss out any first editions.</p>
