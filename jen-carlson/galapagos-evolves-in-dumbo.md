title: Galapagos Evolves in DUMBO
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109222038/http://www.galapagosartspace.com/">Galapagos</a> has officially set up shop and opened their doors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109222038/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/30/galapagos.php">in DUMBO</a>, though a full schedule isn&apos;t planned to go into effect until September. The beautiful new space, located between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges on the corner Water and Main Streets, can hold <strong>175 seated and around 230 standing</strong>. Director Robert Elmes told us that the new arts space will continue to focus on the cultural ecosystem by hosting &quot;theater, dance, performance art, cinema, puppetry, classical and world music, lectures, literary events and fundraising events for non profits and local cultural groups.&quot; <strong>There will be no rock concerts</strong>, as there were previously at the Williamsburg space. Check out some of what <em>is</em> in store, after the jump.</p>

<p>As for the move, Elmes notes: &quot;We love DUMBO, we&#x2019;re very excited to be here and given that we were certain we were moving to Berlin, the chance to remain in New York was a godsend. And growing our Williamsburg pond into a 1600 square foot lake, and  opening what we hope will be <strong>the city&#x2019;s first LEED certified &#x2018;green&#x2019; cultural venue</strong> has made us very happy.&quot; </p>

<p>Speaking of green, one interesting thing of note about the exterior of the building: the old window area had previously been adorned with some art pieces, but the venue is painting over it. Why? They&apos;re planning <strong>a vertical grass wall with flowers</strong> there. Elmes tells us they also hope to have a green roof by this fall.</p>
