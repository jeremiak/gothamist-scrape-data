<p><strong>[UPDATES BELOW]</strong> On Sunday night reports of shots being fired inside of JFK Airport led to the evacuation of Terminals 1 and 8, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024721/http://pix11.com/2016/08/14/reported-shots-fired-inside-terminal-at-jfk-airport/">to PIX11</a>. Numerous people who were inside the airport at the time have been posting about the evacuation on social media. Some flights have been diverted and many passengers still on the ground have been evacuated as authorities investigate.</p>

<p>One man streamed the evacuation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024721/https://www.facebook.com/listonb/videos/10155166402618712/">on Facebook Live</a>, while another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024721/https://twitter.com/archcomix">tweeted</a> that the NYPD simply told them: &quot;it&apos;s not safe to stay here,&quot; without giving further information.</p>

<p>At this time, there is no confirmation that shots have been fired. We will update as we have more details.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 10:50 p.m.:</strong> The Port Authority has released this statement. &quot;Police received reports of shots fired at Terminal 8 at JFK at about 9:30. This apparently was near the departures area. There are no reported injuries or arrests at this time, we have no actual confirmation of shots fired. As a precaution, Port Authority police are evacuating the terminal at this time. Also, at about 10:15, Terminal 1 at JFK was closed after receipt of additional calls of shots fired.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024721/http://nypost.com/2016/08/14/shots-reportedly-fired-at-jfk-airport/">The NY Post</a> is reporting that a woman saw a man with a gun, and NYPD Emergency Services Units responded &quot;with automatic weapons [to scour] the area and passengers were taking cover outside cement traffic barriers.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 11 p.m.:</strong> The Port Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024721/https://twitter.com/NY_NJairports/status/765020260542058496">has tweeted</a> an update stating, &quot;Preliminary investigation does not indicate shots were fired at JFK. There are no injuries. At this time, no gun shells or other evidence of shots fired has been found. The terminal was evacuated out of an abundance of caution. Travelers should contact their carriers. There is substantial PAPD and NYPD presence at JFK and LGA. Investigation continues.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 11:55 p.m.:</strong> NYPD Special Ops says &quot;it appears no shots have been fired.&quot;</p>
