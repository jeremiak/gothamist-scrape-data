title: NYC As Seen On TV: Two Broke Girls Brings Back The Bad Old Days, Unintentionally
---

	
										<p>As we mentioned in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233133/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/14/a_fall_guide_to_your_nyc_television.php#photo-13">our Fall TV guide</a>, <em>Two Broke Girls</em> is based in NYC, but it&apos;s filmed in LA, making it perfect to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233133/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">pick apart</a>. The show premiered last night, and hopefully someone called the Vandal Squad, because the 1980s are back! Click through for some cringe-worthy Faux York moments... and let&apos;s all try to figure out <em>where</em> in Brooklyn they live and work.</p>
