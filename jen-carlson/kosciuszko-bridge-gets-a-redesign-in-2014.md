<p>The Kosciuszko Bridge, one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723114901/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/01/worst_bridges_ever.php">the worst bridges</a> in all of New York State&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723114901/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/30/while_our_citys_bridges_may.php"><em>the worst</em></a> in New York City, is getting redesigned. Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723114901/http://www.timesnewsweekly.com/news/2010-02-11/Local_News/THE_FUTURE.html">four possible designs</a> for the bridge, which goes over Newtown Creek and connects Brooklyn and Queens, were unveiled by the DoT for residents to review and critique. The renderings are even accompanied by this amazingly soundtracked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723114901/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/test-drive-the-new-kosciuzsko/">simulation video</a>!</p>

<p>Each design has an increased number of lanes, featuring five toward Brooklyn and four toward Queens. There will also be a pedestrian walkway <em>and</em> bike lane. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723114901/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/a-tired-old-bridge-gets-a-new-look-no-four-of-them/">The NY Times</a> reports that a price tag wasn&apos;t put on the project, though word is it could cost up to $1.7 billion. But as one DoT director declared, &#x201C;It will be the first new bridge in New York City since the Verrazano. This is a big deal.&#x201D; </p>

<p>That big deal will be happening in, oh, about 4 years from now, when they start construction. And when that happens, the two new bridges (one going in each direction), will be built next to the current structure to make the transition a bit less inconvenient.</p>
