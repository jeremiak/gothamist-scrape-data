<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082313/http://www.haikkocharian.com/">Haik Kocharian</a> has an ongoing exhibit that just opened at Gallery Mourlot. Living in New York since 1992, he&apos;s an offical local now (after 10 years right?). We, of course, especially love his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082313/http://www.haikkocharian.com/Architecture1.html">architecure photographs</a>, which mainly focus on urban structures (example above). Check out some of what he has to offer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082313/http://www.haikkocharian.com/gallery.html">here</a>, but for the full experience head over to the gallery.
