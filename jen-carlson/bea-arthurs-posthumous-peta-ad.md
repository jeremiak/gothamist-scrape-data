<p>Perhaps channeling the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326184433/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/08/tiger_woods_dead_dad_ad_sorta_shift.php">controversial commercial</a> featuring Tiger Woods&apos;s dead father, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326184433/http://gothamist.com/tags/peta">PETA</a> has brought <em>Golden Girl</em> Bea Arthur back to life in a new ad campaign. </p>

<p>The organization tells us: &quot;when she was alive, Bea Arthur was one of PETA&apos;s most stalwart supporters, and now&#x2014;through a provocative campaign that PETA is launching thanks to a bequest in her will&#x2014;Bea will remain an activist even in death.&quot; This week marks the first anniversary of her passing, so PETA will be spreading the posthumous ad campaign (targeting the Golden Arches of McDonald&apos;s) through some full page newspaper ads. (See the full ad below.)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326184433/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/a-new-peta-ad-will-feature-the-late-bea-arthur/">the NY Times</a>, her son &#x201C;especially liked that the copy was in Bea&#x2019;s irreverent voice.&#x201D; Plus, you don&apos;t want Betty White getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326184433/http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2010/04/21/betty-white-saturday-night-live/"><em>all</em> the attention</a>.</p>
