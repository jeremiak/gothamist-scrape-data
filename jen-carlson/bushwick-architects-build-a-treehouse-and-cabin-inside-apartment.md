</div></div>					<p>The architects at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160118231350/http://www.katzchiao.com/projects/a-cabin-in-a-loft-in-brooklyn/">Katz Chiao</a>&#x2014;Terri Chiao and Deborah Grossberg Katzhave&#x2014;bulit a treehouse <em>and</em> a cabin inside of an apartment in Bushwick! They told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160118231350/http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664586/for-2k-brooklyn-architects-build-an-indoor-treehouse-with-kitty">FastCoDesign</a> that it cost just $2,000, and, &#x201C;as a result, living in the space can feel like living outdoors, in a tiny community of two houses.&quot; The project transformed the one room loft into a 3 room compound... with room for a cat, no less.</p>

<p>On their website, they explain the idea further: &quot;Conceived of as houses within houses, the cabin and treehouse serve as private sleeping cabins, each with its own semi-private garden set off from the shared living space. The treehouse is lofted above the ground and houses a study and storage area below. The cabin has a storage space built into the raised floor. A garden and a place to hang clothes occupy the small semi-private area that is formed between the cabin entrance and the windows.&quot; </p>

<p>The structures were built in 2009, but it looks like it&apos;s still around since new photos have popped up on Flickr <a 21="" 2011="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160118231350/http://www.flickr.com/photos/cabininaloft/&apos;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;. And the idea is pretty great if you just manage not to think about the miniature $50,000 mansions &lt;a href=" http:="" www.nytimes.com="" 07="" garden="" playhouses-childs-play-grown-up-cash.html?_r="1&amp;ref=style&quot;">some <em>children</em> are living in</a>... without roommates.</p>
