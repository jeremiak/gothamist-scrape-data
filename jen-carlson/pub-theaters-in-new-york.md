Just picture Shakespeare&apos;s <em>Comedy of Errors</em> being performed in the 1500&apos;s, audience slugging down pints (and probably chewing on drumsticks and meat pies!) - seems accurate, right? Never has a want for alcohol overcome us mid-play, but it&apos;s probably not a bad idea in some cases. Apparently there are theaters in London that serve alcohol, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180738/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070123/stage_nm/britain_theatre_pubs_dc">a growing trend</a> of mixing pub culture with playhouse art across the pond.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The interest in blending a thirst for beer with the thespian arts has been a fixture of the London fringe theater scene since the 1970s and now scores of the capital&apos;s pubs do it.

<p>A pub in a former Birmingham stock exchange has become the latest creative outlet for budding playwrights, actors and established artists trying out new material.</p>

<p>Pub theatres stage anything from comedies, pantomimes and musicals dreamed up by promising new writers to established works like Shakespeare and Arthur Miller in often tiny rooms.</p>

<p>Enthusiasts say the intimate relationship between actors and the audience in confined spaces makes for an exciting experience. It also costs a lot less than a show at a theater in London&apos;s glitzy West End.</p>

<p>British film stars such as Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves used to tread the boards at the pioneering King&apos;s Head pub theater in London -- considered the granddaddy of the genre -- before going on to fame on the silver screen.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>So let&apos;s get on it, New York. Big pints of beer during Shakespeare in the Park, hot toddy&apos;s for something a little more posh on a cold night, whiskey at a Tennessee Williams&apos;s play...and there&apos;s no way we&apos;re not drinking some red wine (out of the bottle, thank you) during the first ever production of Jack Kerouac&apos;s &quot;Beat Generation&quot; (supposedly happening this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180738/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/11/13/new_venue_the_b.php">at The Box</a>). Then again, maybe we&apos;re not privy to some pub theaters that already exist here...?</p>
