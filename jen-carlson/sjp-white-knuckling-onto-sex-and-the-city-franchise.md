<p>Sarah Jessica Parker will not let <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145152/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/08/welcome_to_the_screen_a_young_carri.php">Blake Lively</a> steal her thunder, once the <em>Sex and the City</em> prequel starring the much younger vixen is out, the real Carrie wants back in. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145152/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/02/sex-and-the-city-3-satc-carrie-bradshaw-blake-lively-sarah-jessica-parker.html">LA Times</a> says she&apos;s not willing to give up on it, and in a recent interview the actress said, &quot;I would go back. I think there&apos;s one more story to tell. I know there is.&quot; (Like that one about beating a dead horse?) &quot;I&apos;d definitely tell that [third] story. But maybe not now. Maybe in five years, you know?&quot; Yes, after five years of moisturizing.</p>

<p>And back to this whole Blake Lively thing for a sec... SJP doesn&apos;t even know about it! She expressed her reaction, saying, &quot;I was like, &apos;Wha-a-a-a-t?&apos; I don&apos;t think we can pretend to go back. It&apos;s creating two histories. It&apos;s like, &apos;Oh I didn&apos;t know that about Carrie Bradshaw.&apos;&quot;</p>
