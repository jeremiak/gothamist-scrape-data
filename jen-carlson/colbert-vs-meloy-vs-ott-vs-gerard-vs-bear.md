Got some downtime? You&apos;ve got the rest of the day to work on an entry for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://www.mtvu.com/reanimatethedecemberists/">The Decemberists video contest</a>. They filmed themselves in front of a green screen and want the rest filled in, but we&apos;re sure you&apos;ve heard about this already. Here&apos;s a timeline (with slightly unrelated topics added for drama!):

</p><p>&#x2022; Chris Ott <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0646,ott,75004,22.html">starts verbal slapping match</a> with The Decemberists Colin Meloy. </p>

<p>&#x2022; Stephen Colbert calls Meloy a &quot;thief&quot;. (Video above)</p>

<p>&#x2022; Meloy challenges Colbert to a guitar-off. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/40102/Colbert_Accepts_Decemberists_Counterchallenge#40102">Colbert accepts</a>.</p>

<p>&#x2022; Ott, on Nick Sylvester&apos;s site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://riffmarket.blogspot.com/2006/12/year-in-riffs-chris-ott.html">claims to be</a> anonymous blogger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://gerardvsbear.blogspot.com/">Gerard vs Bear</a> and states in his rant that Meloy should &quot;Kiss your whip&#x2019;s ass for setting up this Colbert schtick, &#x2018;cos you were this close to a faceplant on the half-pipe of OOPS up until about five seconds ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x2022; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://gerardvsbear.blogspot.com/2006/12/fuuuuuck.html">Gerard vs Bear</a> states that &quot;CHRIS OTT BABY IS CRYING! GO CHANGE DIAPER, ASSCLOWN! GO TOUCH COLIN MELOY BALLS!&quot; </p>

<p>We think Ott should be invited to the guitar off, too. Sylvester can liveblog it. (Maybe both should have gotten honorable mention in Time Out NY&apos;s New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/12/11/new_york_critic.php">critics awards</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://www.stereogum.com/archives/004151.html">Stereogum has the details</a> on this whole mess. And we suggest you try to get some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082736/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/tickets/tickets.jhtml">Colbert Report tickets</a>.</p>
