<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180907/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> resumed its fifth and final season a few weeks ago, it was pretty clear there would be a fast-paced, no-sleep-til-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180907/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/09/breaking_bad_recap_dont_touch_my_mo.php">To&apos;hajiilee</a> (and not even then) rollercoaster ride causing frantic emotions and ultimately an empty, gutted feeling. There will be no closure. </p>

<p>So at this point the only way to find that calm you&apos;re craving so much is by going backwards, into a <em>slightly</em> less nightmarish era of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman&apos;s lives. And AMC is about to make that real easy...</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180907/http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/amcs-breaking-bad-finale-party-starts-wednesday.html">to Vulture</a> they have &quot;scheduled a marathon of every single episode of <em>Breaking Bad</em>: The 46 episodes from the first four seasons of the show will run consecutively from 8 p.m. Wednesday through Friday night. AMC will return to <em>Breaking Bad</em> at 11 p.m on September 28, running all of season five up through the finale at 9 p.m. on September 29.&quot; You&apos;ve still got a little bit of time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180907/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/08/woodworker_renting_out_trailers_for.php">rent an RV</a> and fill it with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180907/http://www.thedailymeal.com/breaking-bad-inspired-meth-candy-sparks-controversy">controversial meth candy</a> for the occasion&#x2014;but be warned that few people in this world can survive consuming all of this series in one sitting, even just the first four seasons.</p>

<p>And ICYMI, the final two episodes will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180907/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/breaking-bad-final-two-episodes-631824">75 minutes each</a> (with commercials). After you are done mourning, they&apos;ll hopefully have started working on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180907/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/breaking_bad_spinoff_better_call_sa.php"><em>Better Call Saul</em></a>, a spin-off we&apos;re actually pretty excited for.</p>
