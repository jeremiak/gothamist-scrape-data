<p>For a few days in June, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/how_much_would_it_cost_to_live_in_g.php">Ghostbusters HQ</a> will come back to life, but this time it&apos;s going to be in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Villain, located at 50 N 3rd Street, will be transformed (by the very capable team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/http://bbqfilms.com/ghostbusters">at BBQ Films</a>) into the firehouse headquarters you know from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/27/ghostbusters_book.php#photo-1">the original movie</a>. The company&apos;s Gabriel Rhoads tells us:</p>

<blockquote>While we&apos;re taking the Firehouse HQ as the main theme (we&apos;re installing it in an all-brick warehouse with a Firehouse feel), we didn&apos;t want to limit ourselves...  We&apos;re working to recreate and explore several sets in this experience.  We&apos;ve also teamed up with Sony Pictures, which means fans can expect to see film props integrated into the transportive cinematic environments BBQ Films has come to be known for.</blockquote> 

<p>This thing will feature &quot;a 360-degree interactive experience, with live Ghostbusters characters, themed rooms, screens showing the film, and, of course, ghosts.&quot; It&apos;s like the immersive experience you never got in 1984. </p>

<p>As part of the fun, you&apos;ll be tasked with helping to save NYC from a ghost takeover, and that collaboration with Sony Pictures (who are promoting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/ghostbusters_3_trailer.php">the <em>new</em> Ghostbusters</a>) will make the production extra legit. But what about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/http://gothamist.com/tags/billmurraywatch">Bill Murray</a>, <em>will he be there??</em> All we know is that BBQFilms will definitely have a surprise or two up their sleeves, and usually these include cameos from people involved in the film they&apos;re recreating... in this case it could be anyone? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKqjIv91Zx8">Dan Aykroyd</a> at the bar? Ray Parker, Jr. on the stage? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/27/ghostbusters_book.php#photo-1">The Blowjob Ghost</a>? Who knows  &#xAF;\_(&#x30C4;)_/&#xAF;</p>

The event will run from June 8th to 10th, and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162502/ttp://bbqfilms.com/ghostbusters">buy tickets here</a>&#x2014;they start at $42 and go up to $77 (that one includes a couple of free drinks and a gift).</p>
