<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141043/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcrib">The McRib</a> sandwich (drunk Diane Sawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141043/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/24/mcrib_returns_to_mcdonalds_still_co.php">loves &apos;em</a>!) is returning &quot;just in time for the holiday season,&quot; and McDonald&apos;s says it&apos;s their &quot;ultimate gift for New Yorkers&quot; (and the rest of America, as they&apos;ll be available nationwide).</p>

<p>The sandwich seems to have a cult following that has held up even after news came out that the 500-calorie sandwich doesn&apos;t actually contain any rib. Let us remind you of what is in this thing: &quot;restructured meat product,&quot; 980 mg of salt, pig innards (tripe, heart, and scalded stomach), and &quot;a flour-bleaching agent used to make the soles of shoes... and foamed plastics like gym mats,&quot; along with 70 other ingredients. At least one of our staffers found it &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141043/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/02/taste_testing_the_mcrib_returning_t.php">enjoyable nonetheless</a>&quot; during our taste test last year.</p>

<p>But <em>shhhhhh</em>, forget all that and focus on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141043/http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/promotions/mcrib.html">the McDonald&apos;s spin</a>: &quot;The McRib is famous for its unforgettable taste and signature tangy McRib barbeque sauce, boneless pork patty, fresh slivered onions, dill pickles and toasted home-style bun.&quot; Just read that a few times and forget <em>allllll</em> about that other stuff.</p>

<p>P.S. Less than two months until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141043/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/shamrock_shakes.php">Shamrock Shake Season</a>!</p>
