This year marks the 29th anniversary of Nancy Spungen&apos;s death, who was murdered in room 100 of the legendary hotel. Since then, questions and rumors have surrounded her death - which was pinned on Sid Vicious. </p>

<p>Now, a former friend of the late Sid (who we recently saw in those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005922/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/05/26/_as_we_heard_la.php">Doc Martens ads</a>) has accused the NYPD of wrongly accusing his punk rock pal. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005922/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/vicious%20was%20innocent_1032326">Contact Music</a>: </p>

<blockquote>The bassist was arrested over the fatal stabbing of Spungen in New York&apos;s Chelsea Hotel in 1978 - but the 21-year-old star died of heroin overdose the night he was released on bail. Steve Dior - who played with Vicious in a band called the Idols - says his former bandmate was the victim of a police &quot;set up&quot; and hopes to clear his name. He says, &quot;Sid didn&apos;t kill Nancy, I know that for a fact. I know who did it. He was a drug dealer from New Jersey who robbed the flat where Nancy was stabbed. Why would Sid rob himself? &quot;This guy&apos;s fingerprints were on the knife but New York Police didn&apos;t want to get into it. It was a case closed if they pinned it on Sid, they didn&apos;t care if Sid Vicious went to prison. I&apos;m trying to tell more people about it.&quot; </blockquote>

<p>Neon Leon, another musician in the hotel, was reportedly the last to see Sid before the murder. In an interview that took place that next afternoon, he recapped Sid&apos;s actions from the night before: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Sid came in here and said, &#x2018;Look what I&#x2019;ve got. Now people can&#x2019;t beat me up any more&#x2019;.&#x201D; He was brandishing a knife with a five and a half inch blade, said Leon. &#x201C;Nancy bought it for him so he could defend himself from the beatings he was getting.&#x201D;

<p>&#x201C;He said he was going to kill somebody&#x201D; said Neon, speaking rapidly and without hesitation. &#x201C;But he always says he&#x2019;s going to kill somebody. &#x2018;New York is making me violent. People are picking on me. All I want to do is to be in a band. I&#x2019;m gonna get me a weapon.&#x2019;&#x201D; Sid told him, he said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

As for the new theory, the Hotel Chelsea bloggers are wondering if this is to generate press for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005922/http://www.myspace.com/aparker01  ">Alan Parker</a>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005922/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sid-Vicious-No-One-Innocent/dp/0752875469">new bio of Sid</a>, which Steve Dior helped launch. </p>
