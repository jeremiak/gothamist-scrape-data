<p>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162806/http://www.yelp.com/topic/honolulu-going-to-new-york-city-what-you-do-there">a Yelper asked</a>, &quot;I am going to NYC for the first time and don&apos;t know what to do up there. There seems to be a lot. What is your favorite things in New York City?&quot; So far, the suggestions he&apos;s getting are a bit lacking, and coming mostly from other tourists. For example, the first commenter suggests mostly spots found in the movie <em>Serendipity</em>: &quot;Serendipity (the original! We sat next to the table Kate Beckinsale &amp; John Cusack sat in, in the movie!!), Waldorf hotel (where movie <em>Serendipity</em> was shot&#x2014;elevator scene!!),&quot; etc. </p>

<p>Other suggestions include Times Square for the great nightlife, the &quot;main train station&quot; (Grand Central <em>is</em> beautiful, but don&apos;t people know the name of it by now?), and finally Madison Square Park, which they note is &quot;several miles walking distance... may take a whole day if not two.&quot; Clearly, they mean <em>Central</em> Park. Others suggest Nintendo World, Tim Hortons (yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162806/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/13/tim_hortons_timbits_are_here.php">the Canadian coffee chain</a>), and one says to make sure to &quot;take da subway &apos;cuz da system is awesome.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly, these tourists need some inside intel, so where would <em>you</em> send them on their visit to the city for the first time? Leave your suggestions in the comments, and tourists, try to follow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162806/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/new_yorkers_give_tourists_etiquette.php">these simple etiquette guidelines</a> while you&apos;re here (or at least keep to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162806/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">the slow lane</a>).</p>
