<p>Anne Hathaway, the most recent incarnation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304221401/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/05/introducing_anne_hathaway_as_catwom.php">of Catwoman</a>, has moved to Brooklyn... from Brooklyn! That&apos;s right, Ms. Hathaway was living <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304221401/http://www.celebuzz.com/photos/anne-hathaway-takes-stroll-makeup-free-in-brooklyn/anne-hathaway-takes-stroll-makeup-free-in-brooklyn-6/">in Prospect Heights</a> last year, but recently moved to a sleepier section of the borough: DUMBO. She and fianc&#xE9; Adam Shulman have settled into 1 Main Street, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304221401/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2012/03/15/exile_on_1_main_street_anne_hathaway_moves_to_dumbo.php">Curbed</a> believes she&apos;s in unit 6K, &quot;which seems to fit the bill of what she and Shulman were searching for&#x2014;a 1BR with room for a home office going for $6,400 a month.&quot; </p>

<p>It was just recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304221401/http://streeteasy.com/nyc/rental/837325-condo-1-main-street-dumbo-brooklyn">rented out</a>. This is actually a pretty modest apartment for an A-lister, but as we know, Hathaway really relates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304221401/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/anne_hathaway_joins_large_crowd_at.php#photo-1">to the 99%</a>, probably from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304221401/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/04/check_fraud_cha.php">dating this guy</a>.</p>
