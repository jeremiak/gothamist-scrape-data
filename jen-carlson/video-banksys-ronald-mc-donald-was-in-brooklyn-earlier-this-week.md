<span class="photo_caption">Banksy... is that you?</span></p>

<p>Michael Tosner sent us this video he shot earlier this week, telling us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s Ronald McDonald shoe shine display was in Williamsburg two days ago, when he shot this video at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Manhattan+Avenue+and+Broadway&amp;ll=40.702554,-73.944812&amp;spn=0.009207,0.015299&amp;hnear=Broadway+%26+Manhattan+Ave,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11206&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">Manhattan Avenue and Broadway</a>. He wondered at the time if it was the work of the elusive street artist, and yesterday that was confirmed when Banksy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php">revealed the piece officially</a> in the South Bronx. A couple of notable things about this video:<br>
</p><ul><li>A man comes seemingly out of nowhere at the end to carry the statue off&#x2014;is this someone in Banksy&apos;s crew, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_one_of_these_men_is_banksy.php">or Banksy himself</a>? Dun dun dun.<br>
</li><li>The statue is put into a truck (not the van we saw yesterday) similar to the waterfall truck, but completely white with no tags. Banksy&apos;s fleet of vehicles vary, and it seems he has plenty of them that, as of yesterday, were being stored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_one_of_these_men_is_banksy.php">in Red Hook</a>.<br>
</li><li>The main takeaway here is that Banksy is debuting some pieces days before he officially reveals them. This also happened when the Sirens of the Lambs trucks was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/is_this_truck_filled_with_loud_stuf.php">first spotted in Brooklyn</a>, a day before its official debut. And when the 9/11 piece showed up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/theres_a_2nd_911_tribute_from_banks.php#photo-1">in Brooklyn Heights</a> days before the TriBeca one appeared.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>So if you see something, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023254/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">say something</a>&#x2014;<em>Banksy is all around us</em>.</p>
