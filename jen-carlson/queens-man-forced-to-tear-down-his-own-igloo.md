According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041257/http://reidontravel.blogspot.com/2011/02/random-photo-death-of-queens-igloo.html">Reid On Travel</a>, yesterday he &quot;took a pick-axe to his creation, knocking its roof in. With temperatures set to rise this week, so have concerns from neighbors over a potential hazard in the private garden area.&quot; Gindoff started the snow house project after he was laid off, and while his vision has now been destroyed, after all the press he got last week he&apos;s reportedly been contacted to help build a three ton snowman at Bear Mountain upstate.</p>

<p>At press time, there&apos;s no word on how Ice Castle Grayskull in Bed-Stuy is doing.</p>
