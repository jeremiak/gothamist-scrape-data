There&apos;s just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174738/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/wythe.php"><em>so much history</em></a> there! Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174738/http://archidose.blogspot.com/2012/08/g-train-safari-on-saturday.html">the G-Train Safari</a> aims to enlighten you on that, and other buildings. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174738/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/30/24_gtraintour_2012_07_27_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, architect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174738/https://twitter.com/archidose">John Hill</a> is giving the tour, which will include a visit to 20 different structures near the line, and during it he&apos;ll divulge &quot;fun facts, architectural insights and stories behind structures.&quot; The Barclays Center and the Pratt Institute buildings are also on his schedule.</p>

<p>You want in? Grab a Metrocard and head to the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station on August 11th at 11 a.m. And yes, it costs a shocking $35 (overpriced cocktails on the Wythe rooftop not included.)</p>
