										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mcds0612.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145559im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mcds0612.jpeg" width="640" height="437" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145559/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcdonalds">McDonald&apos;s</a> has updated their uniforms, giving their employees a 1960s flair, with plenty of inspiration coming from <em>Mad Men</em>. (Perhaps this will help the customer travel back in time to when we really didn&apos;t know how bad fast food was for us.) According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145559/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG9344287/Mad-Men-style-inspired-new-McDonalds-uniforms-says-Wayne-Hemingway.html">The Telegraph</a>, the new look will debut at the Olympics, and then get rolled out to all employees in the UK... but there&apos;s no word yet on whether they&apos;ll make it across the pond to McMerica.</p>

<p>According to reports, &quot;The main crew, who work behind the counters flipping burgers and frying chips, will wear polo shirts, in mustard yellow for the men and &apos;gherkin green&apos; for the women. Customer care assistants have check shirts with green dark green trousers or skits. Managers are in black and white, but with the female managers wearing a mustard yellow neck scarf.&quot; The collection will also include skinny ties and pencil skirts, and they say the design is based on &quot;a mixture of the 1960s mod movement and <em>Mad Men</em>&quot;&#x2014;though designers also aimed to &quot;hark back to a day of really classy air travel.&quot;</p>

<p>Hopefully the new threads are made of grease resistant polyblends.</p>
