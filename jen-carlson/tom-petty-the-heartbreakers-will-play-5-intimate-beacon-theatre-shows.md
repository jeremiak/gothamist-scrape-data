<p>If you know anything at all, then you know that Stevie Nicks and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154626/http://gothamist.com/tags/tompetty">Tom Petty</a> are two of the greatest American treasures. And lucky for us, the former is touring with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154626/http://gothamist.com/tags/fleetwoodmac">Fleetwood Mac</a> this year, <em>which would have been enough</em>... but now it&apos;s been announced that Petty is joining up with the Heartbreakers again for a summer tour HALLELUJAH! And the tour includes five intimate (at least, more intimate than MSG) shows at Beacon Theatre.</p>

<p>Tickets for the shows go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154626/http://www.ticketmaster.com/Beacon-Theatre-tickets-New-York/venue/237665">on sale March 25th</a>, and will take place May 20, 21, 23, 25, and 26. We&apos;re guessing he&apos;s going to add at least two more dates at the venue after initial tickets sell out.</p>

<p>Until then, if you haven&apos;t seen the four hour &quot;Runnin&apos; Down A Dream&quot; documentary yet... what are you waiting for? Not only will you hear from the aforementioned Nicks about wanting to join the Heartbreakers way back when, but you&apos;ll also get some epic hash stories:</p>

<p>Petty will also bring his tour to Los Angeles (for a West Coast intimate show run at the Fonda Theatre), Saratoga, Indiana, Pittsburgh, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and a few festivals: Bonnaroo in Tennessee, the Hangout Music Festival in Alabama, and Firefly Music Festival in Delaware.</p>
