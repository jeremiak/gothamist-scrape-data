<p>Recently a &quot;Big Pun Place&quot; sign was installed in the Bronx, but it wasn&apos;t the Department of Transportation dedicating the intersection to the late Bronx-born rapper. The sign, which is at 163rd and Rogers Place, was put there by Shane Rossi:</p>

<p>In 2012, Bronx Community Board 2 denied the dedication of the intersection because the rapper&apos;s music was &quot;too violent and referenced drugs.&quot; So Rossi took matters into his own hands, and simply purchased a sign for $35 on the NYC DOT site. <em>Did you know you could do that?</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150903001702/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/custom-signs.shtml">Through the DOT&apos;s site</a>, you can order a custom NYC street sign, or one in the old school style, or even a <em>hilarious</em> &quot;Yield To Mom&quot; sign for your busy brownstone in Park Slope. They start at around $32.
