<p>As mentioned last week, another New Jersey beach is considering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113347/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/22/jersey_beach.php">going topless</a>, but as the Asbury Park City Council vote lingers in the stifling summer air, locals discuss why they wanna have the right to take it off. Reggie Flimlin, the 48-year-old woman who presented the idea to the City Council, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113347/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/28/2010-06-28_asbury_park_eyes_fem_topless_beach.html">the Daily News</a> that &quot;baring your chest is really no big deal these days. Why are women&apos;s rights still at the bottom of the totem pole in regards to female toplessness? Men have better things to do than sit around and gawk at women all day long.&quot; Do they, <em>really?</em></p>

<p>As for Deputy Mayor John Loffredo, he&apos;s sticking up for the state&apos;s fairer sex, declaring: &quot;women in other parts of the world go to the beach topless. We think New Jersey women are just as beautiful as any women anywhere in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently (and since a 1992 ruling) New York is the only state where women can go topless legally. Which reminds us: National Topless Day (and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113347/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/25/you_missed_it_topless_day_in_centra.php">naked parade</a> in Central Park) is coming up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113347/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/things_we_missed_national_topless_d.php">on August</a> 22nd!
