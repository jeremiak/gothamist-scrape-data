<p>Jason Segel, who has a little movie called <em>The Muppets</em> coming out this week, just talked extensively about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171418/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/20/videos_muppets_take_saturday_night.php">his hosting duties on <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>, also offering up this cute anecdote to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171418/http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/11/21/jason-segel-snl-muppets-interview/">Moviefone</a>&#x2014;his list of goals that he made when he was a kid had three things on it: to be on Letterman, to work with the Muppets, and to host SNL. He told them, &quot;I did all three last week. In one week! That&apos;s not hyperbole, that&apos;s an actual list I had.&quot;</p>

<p>Segel also revisits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171418/http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Land_of_Gorch">SNL&apos;s &quot;Land of Gorch&quot; era</a>, which took place during the first season when Jim Henson created Muppets for an older crowd, Muppets that could stay up <em>all night</em>&#x2014;unfortunately, they weren&apos;t well received, and didn&apos;t quite fit on the show. Here&apos;s one of the &quot;Land of Gorch&quot; Muppets with Lily Tomlin: </p>

<p>Segel explains, &quot;it didn&apos;t quite work. But it did give birth to <em>The Muppet Show</em>. They said to Lorne, &apos;We&apos;d like to do our own variety show, do you mind if we copy your format in a half hour&apos;&#x2014;and that&apos;s how <em>The Muppet Show</em> was born.&quot;</p>
