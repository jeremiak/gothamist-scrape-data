<p>Who knew there was so much statue-moving in our city&apos;s history? While some have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150752/http://gothamist.com/tags/civicvirtue">been banished</a>, others have simply been given a better spotlight. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150752/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/prospectpark/highlights/9717">Abraham Lincoln statue</a> that&apos;s been at Prospect Park&apos;s concert grove will now be moved back to its old spot at Grand Army Plaza. The park&apos;s Eugene Patron told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150752/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/the_great_emancipator_will_return_6COj18gDHRqQ8U3tRrgabM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post,</a> &#x201C;We thought he should go back to a nice, prominent spot. It&#x2019;s more historically accurate.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It was first installed at the northern end of Grand Army Plaza in 1869 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150752/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40E10FA345C137B93C0AB178BD95F4D8684F9">the NY Times</a> was at the unveiling), but moved after 30 years there by city leaders who claimed he was being dwarfed by the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch (which Lincoln <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150752/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/479444341">also appears on</a>). Now he&apos;ll be returning to the area, on the north side, facing south, and he&apos;ll be surrounded by decorative pavement, benches and plants. Sounds lovely, but not everyone is happy with the move. Of course!</p>

<p>Enter local blogger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150752/http://brooklynmirador.com/">Richard Kessler</a>, who believes Honest Abe should face north, as a symbol of his Civil War affiliation. This was the direction he originally faced, but in order to face the home of the Astor family, which opposed Lincoln because of his anti-slavery positions. Either way, is the move worth the $340,000 it&apos;s going to cost?</p>
