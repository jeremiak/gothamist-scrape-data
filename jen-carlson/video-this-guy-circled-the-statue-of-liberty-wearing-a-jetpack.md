<p>Is this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325071623/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/06/spectre_review_james_bond.php"><em>Spectre</em> marketing</a>? No. Mayman, David Mayman, is in possession of &quot;the world&apos;s only real jetpack,&quot; and he just flew himself around the Statue of Liberty with it. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325071623/http://jetpackaviation.com/">his company&apos;s website</a>, a jetpack is defined as &quot;a jet turbine powered backpack that is capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), is extremely light and small and can easily be carried around by the pilot. It should be powerful enough to lift the pilot quickly to thousands of feet above the ground but small enough to fit into the trunk of a car.&quot; Fuck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325071623/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/16/east_river_skyway_gondola.php">the monorail</a>, let&apos;s all get these instead! </p>

<p>Really, can we? We reached out to Mayman to confirm this is real and will update when we hear back. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325071623/https://boingboing.net/2015/11/09/man-flies-new-jetpack-around-t.html">Boing Boing</a>]</p>
