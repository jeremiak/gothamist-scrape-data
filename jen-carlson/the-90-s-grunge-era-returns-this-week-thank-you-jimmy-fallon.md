<p>Starting tonight, and lasting through Friday, <em>Late Night With Jimmy Fallon</em> will be celebrating Pearl Jam and the release of the band&apos;s 10th album, <em>Lightning Bolt</em>. How? In the most perfect way possible. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053839/http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2013/10/jimmy-fallon-announces-pearl-jam-week/">Here&apos;s the rundown</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Tonight, 10/21:</strong> Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell performing &quot;Footsteps&quot; backed by members of the Avett Brothers.<br>
<strong>Tuesday, 10/22:</strong> Fleet Foxes frontman Robin Pecknold will break a long hiatus from performing when he covers &quot;Corduroy&quot; backed by special guests.<br>
<strong>Wednesday, 10/23:</strong> Country superstar Dierks Bentley will team up with Pearl Jam&apos;s Mike McCready and the Roots for a one-of-a-kind performance.<br>
<strong>Thursday and Friday:</strong> Pearl Jam will debut songs from &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; (but hopefully they&apos;ll also perform &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot; or something? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053839/https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon">Make it happen Captain</a>.)</p>

<p>The band just finished up a two-night run at Barclays Center over the weekend and we&apos;re happy to report that Eddie Vedder is still perfect.</p>
