It just <em>can&apos;t</em> be real...except it is. Advertised through a &quot;dedicated email&quot; from Daily Candy this morning means they have some cash to advertise -- but to prove their hipster-cred we may need to see some MySpace profiles. And surprise, surprise -- it looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003243/http://www.myspace.com/thrasherfunds">they have one</a> (John Mayer is in their &quot;Top 12&quot; friends! Ironic or do their parents also work there?). </p>

<p>Their site explains it &quot;was developed and is managed by young adult investors for young adult investors. A group of more than 60 million Gen X and Y&apos;ers largely untapped by the financial market place...until now.&quot; To think...we were all letting <em>old</em> people control our money, when there were Gen X and Gen Y&apos;ers who could have been doing it! What do you need to get started? Their minimum investment is $100 with $50/month minimum &quot;Automatic Investment Plan (AIP).&quot; If you invest $2,500 initially, however, there is no need for an AIP. Their investments are &quot;hand selected from the inspiration of invest-able themes guided by the contours of the Demographic Convergence Thesis.&quot; Confused? They have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003243/http://www.thrasherfunds.com/learn/glossary.htm">a glossary</a>. Not explained is their choice in name, Thrasher Funds. Thrasher is defined as &quot;to defeat utterly; vanquish&quot; or &quot;to move wildly or violently&quot; -- perhaps not quite the image you want when picturing the person handling your money. </p>

<p>Got some hipster bucks to thrash? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003243/http://www.thrasherfunds.com/learn/power_of_youth.htm">their graph</a> if you start investing at 25 with less than $100 month -- you can make $321,816 by age 65! That condo you&apos;ve been eyeing in East Williamsburg is <em>so</em> gonna be yours one day. </p>
