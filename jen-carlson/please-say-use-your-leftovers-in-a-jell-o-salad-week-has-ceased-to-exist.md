<p>There are a lot of food and drink &quot;holidays&quot; we can get behind, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204431/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/today_is_drink_wine_day.php">National Drink Wine Day</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204431/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/14/prepare_now_for_tomorrows_national.php">National Lobster Roll Day</a> to name two. Wine and lobster are worth celebrating, even if it&apos;s in the name of a marketing gimmick. But when called upon to celebrate people putting leftover peas in a gelatinous mold, we must protest! Sure, gelatin (the main ingredient in JELL-O) is made of animal products (boiled bones, connective tissues, and intestines of animals, to be exact), so why <em>not</em> pair it with some veggies? That&apos;s not a real question, so put down the JELL-O mold.</p>

<p>Hopefully National Use-Up-Your-Leftovers-In-A-Jell-O Salad Week is no longer celebrated by anyone, but back in the day it did exist. The ad read: &quot;Bet you have a dish of leftover peas or beans or carrots in the refrigerator right now. Why not use them beautifully tonight in a tempting JELL-O salad?&quot; (Just don&apos;t use fresh pineapple, papaya, kiwi, or ginger root because they contain enzymes that prevent the gelatin from setting&#x2014;nature is trying to tell us something!) Then they suggest you add vinegar, salt, onion, and other things that have no business being in JELL-O, to their lemon or lime flavor (this was probably before they invented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204431/http://www.flickr.com/photos/36878773@N07/3550859106/">the celery flavor</a>).</p>

<p>Can we just put an end to the national nightmare that <em>is</em> JELL-O?</p>
