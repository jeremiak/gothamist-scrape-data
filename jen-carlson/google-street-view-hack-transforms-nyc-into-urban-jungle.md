<p>Care to see New York City covered in overgrown flora, but don&apos;t want to watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153421/http://gothamist.com/tags/iamlegend"><em>I Am Legend</em></a> again? Einar &#xD6;berg has a hack for you! He&apos;s placed plants and vines all over your Google street view (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153421/https://twitter.com/inear/status/444469476629970944">he Tweeted</a> that he&apos;s &quot;breaking terms of use like it&apos;s no tomorrow&quot;), which makes urban areas look post-apocalyptic, or like Grey Gardens, or like some magical greenhouse...</p>

<p>With &#xD6;berg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153421/http://inear.se/urbanjungle/">Urban Jungle Street View</a> site you can &quot;visit any place available in Street View by entering a location, drag the map to browse around and drop the little guy on a road. It works best in environment with large buildings surrounding the streets. Some locations need a little more imagination than others.&quot; It may not be around for long, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153421/http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/17/5518732/google-street-view-hack-turns-your-city-into-a-jungle">The Verge</a> points out: &quot;Google has been quick to shut down similar map hacks, including one in 2011 that turned Street View into a first-person shooting game, but there&apos;s no word yet on the fate of this odd and imaginative website.&quot; </p>

<p>We reached out to Google (sorry!) for a comment, and will update when we hear back.</p>
