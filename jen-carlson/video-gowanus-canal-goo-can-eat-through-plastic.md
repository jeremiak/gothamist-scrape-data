title: Video: Gowanus Canal Goo Can Eat Through Plastic!
---

	
										<p>We&apos;ve all <em>heard</em> about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423183041/http://gothamist.com/tags/gowanuscanal">Gowanus Canal</a>&apos;s polluted waters, but now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423183041/http://gothamist.com/tags/superfund">Team Superfund</a> is on board, it&apos;s time to get an up close look at the goo that oozes within it. The folks who run <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423183041/http://www.charactersofgowanus.com/?p=37">Characters of Gowanus</a> were brave enough to get exclusive footage of the most talked about sediment in town, and it ain&apos;t pretty. EPA regional Superfund director Walter Mugdan explains the Superfund process in the below video and (spoiler alert!) talks about that time that the mud found in the waterway &quot;had eaten its way through this heavy duty plastic&quot; that it had been captured in. It&apos;s alive, people&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423183041/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">carrying gonorrhea</a>.</p>

<p>The EPA projects the actual dredging of the canal will start in 2014... so this stuff has 4 more years to grow even more powerful!</p>
