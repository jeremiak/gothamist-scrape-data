<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="jellybeangold0511.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525210011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jellybeangold0511.jpg" width="350" height="350" class="image-right"> </span>There was a big Sweets &amp; Snacks Expo and we weren&apos;t invited, but luckily the internet has delivered this morsel from the event. Jelly Belly inventor David Klein <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525210011/http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/5/prweb8463171.htm">has unveiled</a> the ultimate gourmet jelly bean (or as he calls it the &quot;next generation&quot; of jelly bean). The Beyond Gourmet bean will be laced in 24-karat gold-leaf, because that is really just the best way to make a regular ol&apos; food item gourmet (right <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525210011/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/09/affordable_gold.php">golden Twinkie</a>?).</p>

<p>Klein says his magic recipe will be blending exotic cuisine and luxury candy, which will also include flavors from exotic spices, herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, and nuts specific to world cultures. He&apos;s paired up with Leaf Brands to make it all happen, and CEO Ellia Kassoff says, <strong>&#x201C;To experience putting 3-4 beans in your mouth and to make an exquisite, complex fine dish bursting in your mouth is what we want it to do.&quot;</strong> (You can&apos;t hear but we are golf-clapping right now. C&apos;mon, give it up for that quote.)</p>

<p>Anyway, how pissed would you be if you splurged on these things and got a hefty amount of the dreaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110525210011/http://www.jellybelly.com/Shop/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=9000-BUTERD%20POP">Buttered Popcorn</a> flavor?<br>
