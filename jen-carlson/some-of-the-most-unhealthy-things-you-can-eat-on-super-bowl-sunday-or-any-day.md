<p>If you&apos;re gonna indulge this Super Bowl Sunday, at least do it right&#x2014;would it kill you to throw a little taleggio on the table, maybe next to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165859/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/03/7_amazing_super_bowl_meat_and_snack.php#photo-1">the cold cut stadium</a>? That way, when even your elastic waist pants feel tight, at least it&apos;s not because you ingested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165859/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/ammonia-treated_meat_still_good_eno.php">pink slime</a>. Recently the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine dropped some knowledge in our inbox, with some grotesque food facts that will have you reaching for the Blueprint Cleanse come Monday. We&apos;ll spare you all of the gluttonous details, but below are a few nuggets to chew on:<br>
</p><ul><li>Large Classic Italian Sub at Quiznos: 3,550 milligrams of sodium&#x2014;more than the amount in 13 single-serving bags of potato chips.<br>
</li><li>Crispy Bone-In Garlic Parmesan Wings with Blue Cheese Dipping Sauce from Pizza Hut: Just two wings with sauce have one and a half times the fat of a Big Mac.<br>
</li><li>The Meats Pizza at Papa John&#x2019;s: More calories than six Twinkies.<br>
</li><li>Volcano Nachos at Taco Bell: More fat than half a stick of butter.<br>
</li><li>New England Clam Chowder at Panera: One serving contains more saturated fat than an entire package of bacon.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>These &quot;experts&quot; also tell us that &quot;Super Bowl Sunday is America&#x2019;s second-biggest food consumption day of the year, after Thanksgiving, but many fans don&#x2019;t realize that some items sneak in more saturated fat and sodium than most people should eat in an entire day.&quot; Also, sports fans, studies show that &quot;you are already at an elevated risk of heart attack on big game days,&quot; and &quot;adding fatty products will raise blood pressure, stiffen major arteries, and cause the heart to beat much faster.&quot; But don&apos;t worry, you&apos;ll drink enough beer on Sunday that you&apos;ll have forgotten all about this.<br>
