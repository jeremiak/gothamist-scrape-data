										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="deathbear0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210100406im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/deathbear0110.jpg" width="300" height="248" class="image-left"> </span>Usually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210100406/http://gothamist.com/tags/natehill">Nate Hill</a>&apos;s antics just creep us out, but he&apos;s really on to something with his latest project: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210100406/http://clubanimalsnyc.blogspot.com/2009/11/death-bear.html">Death Bear</a>. Here&apos;s how it works... you can make an appointment with the Death Bear, who will show up at the appointed time and &quot;take things from you that trigger painful memories and stow them away in his cave where they will remain forever allowing you to move on with your life.&quot; In other words, Nate Hill is collecting your old ex&apos;s stuff, which he probably then sells on eBay. His next appointments available are, fittingly, Valentine&apos;s Day weekend.</p>

<p>The project recently backfired on Hill, however, when <em>his own ex</em> lured him over to her friend&apos;s apartment (an address he didn&apos;t recognize) to give him back a box of things acquired during their short fling. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210100406/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2010/01/creepy_plushie.html">The goodies included</a> (amongst other things): one of his own tied off used condoms, a bloodied (by Hill&apos;s testicles) bed sheet, a pubic hair heart, and a Trey Songz CD.</p>
