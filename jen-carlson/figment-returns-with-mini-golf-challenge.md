<p>The Figment festival is set to take over Governors Island for its 3rd consecutive year this coming June. Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192913/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/26/david_koren_figment_festival.php">David Koren</a>, the festival&apos;s organizer, had discussed with us the City of Dreams 9-hole minigolf course designed by a team of artists (photos of full course can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192913/http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilyrides/sets/72157607290219346/">found here</a>), and now the good word is that it will return! <em>And</em> the fest announced that this year they plan to double the fun by expanding the course to 18 holes. It will once again be free, and accessible to the public on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays while the island is open from the end of May to early October. First things first, though, it still needs to be designed, and you can be a part of that. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192913/http://figmentnyc.org/2009/get-involved/submit-a-project/city-of-dreams-mini-golf-submissions/">Head here</a> for full details on the challenge to build the course, and maybe watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192913/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093693/"><em>Overboard</em></a> for some inspiration. In fact, maybe they ought to just recreate Dean Proffitt&apos;s Wonders of the World miniature golf course!</p>
