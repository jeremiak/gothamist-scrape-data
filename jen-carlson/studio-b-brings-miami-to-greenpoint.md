We&apos;re a little confused by this new club, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215101/http://clubstudiob.com/">Studio B</a> (pictured), brought to us by the people who gave Miami <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215101/http://www.studioamiami.com/">Studio A</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215101/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/09/studio_b_in_bro.html">Brooklyn Vegan posted</a> this quote from New York Magazine: 

</p><blockquote>&quot;The rockers behind the Delancey and Studio A in Miami have commandeered a onetime Polish nightclub on the outskirts of Greenpoint and are using its over-the-top lights and smoke machines, industrial flavor, and gigantic dance floor for live performances (promoter Todd P. brought the Black Dice to a pre-opening party) and D.J. nights curated by Justine D. (of Motherfucker). In addition to a raised VIP lounge with leather couches overlooking the stage, an intimate, bordello-esque side room hosts its own spinners.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Has anyone been? Smoke machines, VIP lounge, &quot;over the top&quot; lights...what is this doing in Greenpoint? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215101/http://www.toddpnyc.com/">Todd P</a> is booking shows there, which sounds promising.</p>

<p><em>Studio B is located at 259 Banker Street, btwn Meserole &amp; Calyer Streets, Greenpoint, Brooklyn</em></p>
