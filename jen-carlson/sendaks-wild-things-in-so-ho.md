The show is comprised of 200 pieces and will run through November 8th and coincides with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522104955/http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=30">a Sendak retrospective</a> at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum. </p>

<p>Sendak may be best known for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522104955/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/25/video_where_the_wild_things_are_tra.php"><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></a> (just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522104955/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/where_the_wild_things_are_reminding.php">brought to life on film</a> with the help of Spike Jonze), but he&apos;s authored and illustrated more than 100 books; he&apos;s currently working on his latest, titled <em>Bumble-Ardy</em>.</p>

<p>The gallery (located on Broome &amp; Greene) will have etchings, limited editions and a commemorative poster for sale, with proceeds benefiting the Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library and the Jane Goodall Institute. The exhibition is free and open to the public seven days a week; Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. More details can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522104955/http://www.animazing.com/gallery/pages/show_SENDAK-IN-SOHO.html">found here</a>.</p>
