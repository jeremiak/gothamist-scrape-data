<p>Happy National Drink Wine Day! While some of us may celebrate this holiday every day, for those who don&apos;t like to indulge in a glass (or bottle) on the daily, now is your time to step up and pay tribute. This holiday is criminally under-publicized, and our email well is dry of any National Drink Wine Day events happening around the city. We&apos;ll update if we hear about any, but for now, just plan on uncorking a bottle at 5 p.m. (and another at 6 p.m., and so on).</p>

<p>Heads up: Tuesday is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143244/http://drinkgal.com/AnnouncementRetrieve.aspx?ID=34946">National Margarita Day</a>!</p>
