Some more details on what they&apos;re looking for:</p><blockquote>The project&apos;s scope must be &quot;just right&quot;&#x2014; not a whole house, but more than just a kitchen. The renovation must be completed in about 4 to 5 months, with construction beginning as early as August and finished by December. The ideal project should already be underway with design plans and have the ability to be &#x201C;fast-tracked.&#x201D;</blockquote>Renovations are funded by the homeowner (though the show likely gets some nice discounts), and there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825232614/http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/info/0,,20205059,00.html">more details here</a> if you are seriously considering it. It would be nice to see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825232614/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/27/bronx.php">Anthony Avenue mansion</a> in the Bronx get some love, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825232614/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/24/movin_on_up_1.php">the rooftop house in Williamsburg</a> (though the show would like for the entries to be &quot;historic&quot;). What other homes could use some touching up?<p></p>

<p>For renters with homeowner envy and network TV, episodes featuring the NYC renovation porn will air on PBS starting early 2009.</p>
