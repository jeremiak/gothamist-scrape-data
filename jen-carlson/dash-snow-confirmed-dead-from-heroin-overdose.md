Snow is the maternal grandson of Robert Thurman (and nephew of actress Uma Thurman), and his lifestyle was well-documented in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125004010/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/08/dashing_dash_sn.php">a sprawling <em>New York</em> magazine piece</a> two years ago. That lifestyle at one point included making what he called a Hamster&#x2019;s Nest with friends, where they would &quot;shred up 30 to 50 phone books, yank around all the blankets and drapes, turn on the taps, take off their clothes, and do drugs&#x2014;mushrooms, coke, ecstasy&#x2014;until they feel like hamsters.&quot;</p>

<p>Snow&apos;s work was exhibited at galleries like The Royal Academy in London, the Whitney, Deitch Projects and Saatchi Gallery (here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125004010/http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/dash_snow.htm">some selected works</a> from the latter).</p>

One of Dash&apos;s best friends, artist Earsnot/Kunle Irak, posted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125004010/http://twitter.com/KunleIRAK/status/2632481063">his Twitter</a> earlier: &quot;YOU HAD TO INJECT HEROIN RIGHT? YOU COULDN&apos;T JUST... :( DUDE! I FUCKING HATE YOU. YOU ARE THE WORST GUY EVER! FUCK YOU! FUCKING TURD! Dude.&quot; And another artist friend, CLAW, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125004010/http://twitter.com/CLAWmoney">has been posting</a> about the sad news as well. There has been no official comment released yet to confirm the rumor, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141125004010/http://search.twitter.com/search?q=dash+snow">it&apos;s certainly spreading</a> all over the place.</p>
