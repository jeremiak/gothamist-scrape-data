Good news: Wal-Mart won&apos;t be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521031854/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/20/wal-mart_to_union_square.php">moving to Union Square</a>. Bad news: They&apos;re still eyeing Manhattan. (If you&apos;re a big box supporter, adjust accordingly.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521031854/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03052009/news/regionalnews/attention__wal_mart_shoppers_158099.htm">The NY Post</a> that &quot;The company&apos;s real-estate scouts have also been roaming the area around 620 Sixth Ave&quot; (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521031854/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/03/05/walmart_watch.php">Curbed</a> points out is part of &quot;the Ladies&apos; Mile building with T.J. Maxx and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond&quot;). We asked Reverend Billy, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521031854/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/02/reverend_billy_for_mayor.php">recently announced</a> he&apos;s running for Mayor under the Green Party, what he would do to stop this madness:</p><blockquote>Wal-Mart tries to come here&#x2014;well it&apos;s a good thing for New Yorkers because we&apos;re waking up in a city that&apos;s been asleep and soon we&apos;ll all be awake and Bentonville will never know what hit it.  We need Wal-Mart to keep the knives of our conscience sharp.  Wal-Mart is a war-mongering company&#x2014;we call them WAR-Mart, since for election after election they showered Bush with money.  They were the biggest donor to Republicans through several election cycles.  Their union-busting is famous, of course&#x2014;the red phone in the middle of the store that workers are supposed to pick up and spy on any possible organizing.  <strong>Come on, Wal-Mart in New York City?  DEVIL GET THEE BEHIND ME!  As Mayor, I will take that company to the LAKE OF HELLFIRE!</strong></blockquote>Doesn&apos;t this epic battle between good and evil sort of make you want Wal-Mart to sign the lease though?<p></p>
