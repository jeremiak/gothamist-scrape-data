<p>While we often frown upon poor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410132339/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a>, we might give these guys a pass&#x2014;this is something only one Clark W. Griswold would be ballsy and idiotic enough to try, and the visual we are left with is truly a gift.</p>

<p>Tipster Bradley Nicholson sent in this photo, noting, &quot;I&apos;m not sure if I should have been annoyed or impressed, but these guys brought a 12-foot Christmas tree on the C from 81st to 14th Street. At least it made the train smell better.&quot; Any guess on how many straphangers were left with sappy jeans?</p>

<p>This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410132339/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/subway_douchery_brings_up_undergrou.php">isn&apos;t the first time</a> someone has taken a comically large piece of nature underground, but it is the most <em>impressive</em> example to date.</p>
