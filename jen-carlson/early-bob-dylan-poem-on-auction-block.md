										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="youngdylan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154048im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/youngdylan.jpg" width="130" height="156" class="image-right"> </span>Awww, before Bob Dylan wrote the songs he became known for, he wrote a poem called &quot;Little Buddy&quot; about the tragic death of a dog. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154048/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-05-19-dylan-poem_N.htm">USA Today</a> reports that when he was 16, Dylan (then Zimmerman) penned the poem for the newspaper at Herzl Camp in Webster, Wisconsin&#x2014;and now it&apos;s expected to take in around $15K <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154048/http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5215427&amp;sid=985ccb30-b3fd-40b2-807c-8d604c2fe8f9">at Christie&apos;s</a> on June 23rd. &quot;Written on both sides of a single page, the poem tells the poignant story of Little Buddy, who is killed at the hands of a drunkard, and the boy who mourns him.&quot; Christie&apos;s pop culture expert says, &quot;It&apos;s a very early example of his brilliance. It comes from the mind of a teenager (with) some very interesting thoughts kind of percolating in his brain.&quot; Dylan will turn 68 on Sunday, and he told his old camp they were free to do what they wished with the poem. Read it in full, in his own handwriting, after the jump.</p>
