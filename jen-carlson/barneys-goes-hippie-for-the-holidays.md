</div></div>					<p>Early this morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130231940/http://www.barneys.com/HOLIDAY/HIPPIEHOLIDAY,default,sc.html">Barneys New York</a> unveiled its 2008 Holiday Windows, which are being called: &quot;Peace &amp; Love: Have a Hippie Holiday&quot;. The theme was chosen in honor of the peace sign&apos;s 50th anniversary, and style guru/creative director Simon Doonan is the man behind the 60&apos;s holiday vibe (which incidentally leaves out any political references).</p>

<p>Doonan pointed out this morning that &quot;girls these days are so materialistic, but hippies back then didn&apos;t have handbags&quot; (that said, shop at Barneys!) and pondered a modern day Janis Joplin having to get a spray tan in order to be noticed by label bigwigs (one window is centered around Joplin and Carly Simon).</p>

<p>Volkswagen also joined in on the Barneys fun, and the two &quot;commissioned New York artist John-Paul Philippe to custom paint a one-of-a-kind New Beetle inspired by the decade and its indelible iconography.&quot; Doonan notes that &#x201C;While the counterculture of the late &#x2019;60s produced a host of cultural icons, none captured the vibe more poignantly than the Volkswagen Beetle.&quot; After its run in the window, tickets to win the vehicle will be available to holiday shoppers in-store and online, with a suggested price of $100.00 and proceeds will benefit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130231940/http://carbonfund.org/">Carbon Fund</a>. Stay tuned for more holiday window reveals!</p>
