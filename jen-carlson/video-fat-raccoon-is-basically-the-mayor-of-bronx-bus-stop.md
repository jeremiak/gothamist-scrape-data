<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194529/http://gothamist.com/tags/raccoon">Raccoons</a> have been slowly taking over the city for years now&#x2014;they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194529/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/13/raccoon_rummages_through_brooklyn_p_1.php">in our libraries</a>, they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194529/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/raccoon_invades_park_slope_brownsto.php">in our brownstones</a>, they&apos;re shopping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194529/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/11/raccoon_finds_its_way_into_john_var.php">at John Varvatos</a>, and perhaps the most unsettling and transparent in their mission to take over humankind: they&apos;ve invaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194529/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/18/raccoon_1.php">City Hall</a>.

<p>Mr. Boots tells us that there&apos;s a whole family at this bus stop, and they even venture underground&#x2014;&quot;I remember them from last year, they eat good [Ed.: <em>yeah, we&apos;re pretty sure this raccoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194529/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/14/squirrel_prefers_grimaldis_will_set.php">ate the fat squirrel that ate the slice of pizza</a></em>], early in the morning they are on the end of the downtown platform waiting on the train with us commuters, and I&apos;ve seen the motorman when the train pulls in open his window and throw them food.&quot;</p>
