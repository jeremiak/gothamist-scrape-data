A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028230843/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/02/01/2008-02-01_city_nanny_sues_pans_labyrinth_movie_pro.html">lawsuit was filed</a> in Manhattan federal court yesterday against Frida Torresblanco. Her nanny, Angelica Hernandez, claims she was treated like a virtual slave.</p>

<p>Hernandez (who was hired in February 2007) worked up to 150 hours a week for seven months in the producer&apos;s Tribeca apartment and brought home less than $12,000. Once the Oscars came rolling in, the nanny&apos;s duties were practically 24/7 and included maid-type services as well. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, two white European nannies also on hand were paid more for doing less, and were reportedly treated better. Which, if true, is a little odd since Torresblanco herself is hispanic, in fact, The Hollywood Reporter named her one of the 25 most powerful Hispanic women in entertainment after the success of <em>Pan&apos;s Labyrinth</em>. </p>

<p>Torresblanco allegedly physically abused Hernandez after she attended a workshop sponsored by Domestic Workers United, an advocacy group pushing for a state law that would guarantee domestic workers overtime, sick days and other labor protections. She was then fired in September during &quot;a violent outburst.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the lawyer of Torresblanco and her husband Marc Weiss, &quot;they feel as though they are being victimized by what appears to be a fabrication.&quot; </p>
