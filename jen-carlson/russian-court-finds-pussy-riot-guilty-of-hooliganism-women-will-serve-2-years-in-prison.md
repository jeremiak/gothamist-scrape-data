<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> This morning the Russian court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012726/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/17/russian-court-to-rule-in-pussy-riot-trial/">found Pussy Riot guilty</a> of &quot;hooliganism,&quot; after the band performed a short &quot;punk prayer&quot; inside Christ Savior Cathedral back in February. The prayer said: &quot;Mother Mary please drive Putin away,&quot; and they have stated that the performance was meant to highlight the close relationship between the church and state. This verdict will now highlight that even more. The three women now face up to seven years in prison for the act&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012726/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/08/a_timeline_of_the_russian_punk_band.php">here is a timeline of their trial up until now</a>.</p>

<p>The judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012726/http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9734">said that the women</a> &quot;imitated demonic attacks,&quot; and that they were &quot;motivated by hatred and religious enmity.&quot; She added, &quot;Tolokonnikova, Alyokhina and Samutsevich committed hooliganism&#x2014;in other words, a grave violation of public order. The court finds them quilty. The court reached this decision based on testimony of the defendants themselves and other evidence.&quot; There&apos;s not a full English translation at the moment, but some of it reads:</p><blockquote>&quot;<strong>The Pussy Riot singers colluded under unestablished circumstances, for the purpose of offensively violating public peace in a sign of flagrant disrespect for citizens. The women were motivated by religious enmity and hatred, and acted provocatively and in an insulting manner inside a religious building in the presence of a large number of believers.</strong> Intending to make the planned actions public and ensure that they drew public response, to draw the attention of the public to their illegal actions, and to communicate the expressed disrespect not only to the clergy and people in the church, but also to other citizens who were not present in the church at the time [of the punk prayer], but shared Orthodox traditions, Samutsevich, Tolokonnikova, Alyokhina, and their unidentified accomplice informed various media assistants and active bloggers on their action.&quot;</blockquote>Here&apos;s an English stream from inside of the courtroom, where the judge is still speaking as of 8:20 a.m. EST:<p></p>

Even Russian chess grandmaster, and former World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov has been arrested at a Pussy Riot protest outside of the courthouse today. One witness Tweeted a photo of the arrest, adding, &quot;This is the police wrestling with Garry Kasparov inside the paddy van. Are they beating him?&quot;</p>
