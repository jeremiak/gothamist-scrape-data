<p>The latest name in the late night game is... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162411/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>. Which is fitting, given the actor has a successful podcast on WNYC, has hosted <em>Saturday Night Live</em> a record number of times, has one of the more enjoyable voices in the industry, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162411/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/alec-baldwin-said-to-be-in-talks-to-join-nbcs-late-night-lineup/?smid=tw-share">the NY Times</a> points out: &quot;has been long regarded one of the best guests on late-night television shows.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162411/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/alec-baldwin-said-to-be-in-talks-to-join-nbcs-late-night-lineup/?smid=tw-share">Media Decoder</a> reports&#x2014;via a source involved in the network&apos;s planning&#x2014;that Baldwin &quot;is in the mix for a spot in NBC&#x2019;s late-night lineup,&quot; and &quot;the most likely landing place for a show hosted by Mr. Baldwin would be in the latest of NBC&#x2019;s entries, the show now called <em>Last Call</em>. That half-hour interview program currently stars Carson Daly,&quot; who is also currently a host on <em>The Voice</em>. <em>Last Call</em> airs at 1:35 a.m. EST.</p>

<p>Recent change-ups in NBC&apos;s late night lineup have included Jimmy Fallon taking over <em>Late Night</em> from Jay Leno, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162411/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/nbc_will_announce_jimmy_fallon_as_t.php">the network confirmed</a> would happen in February, when the show will start broadcasting from New York. There is still no word on who will replace Fallon, though recent rumors had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162411/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/seth_meyers_rumored_to_be_frontrunn.php">Seth Meyers</a> as the frontrunner.</p>

<p>Baldwin is not commenting at this time.</p>
