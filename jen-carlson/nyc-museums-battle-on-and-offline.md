<span class="photo_caption">The QMA gave the Brooklyn Museum a new flag on their panorama</span></p>

<p>It looks like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://twitter.com/queensmuseum">Queens Museum of Art</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://twitter.com/brooklynmuseum">Brooklyn Museum</a> are battling it out... on Twitter! It&apos;s impossible to say who is winning this <strike>publicity stunt</strike> war, but the Queens folk had a pretty good burn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://twitter.com/QueensMuseum/status/3231204540">posting</a> the above pic and saying they found the Brooklyn Museum on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/17/panorama.php">their panorama</a>. </p>

<p>Of course, the <em>real</em> battle will go down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/upcoming_events/events_search.php?id=173077">this Thursday</a>, when artist Duke Riley gives the city&apos;s art dignitaries &quot;baguette swords and watermelon cannon balls&quot; in order to fight it out in &quot;a flooded World&apos;s Fair-era-reflecting pool in Flushing Meadows Corona Park.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204908604574333991902090568.html">The artist has constructed</a> vessels and a fitting atmosphere in which to stage a gladiator-style battle between the museums (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://www.queensmuseum.org/">Queens Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://brooklynmuseum.org/">Brooklyn Museum</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://www.bronxmuseum.org/">Bronx Museum of the Arts, </a>and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144211/http://elmuseo.org/">El Museo del Barrrio</a> are all involved). Yep, even Manhattan is getting their hands dirty; Rebecca Goyette, of the Museum of Modern Art, has been assigned to play Caligula&#x2019;s wife, and told the WSJ that she won&apos;t mind getting splattered with fake blood. In fact, she told them: &#x201C;I want to fight.&#x201D; </p>
