										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpRfOekqAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225602im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpRfOekqAM.jpg" width="300" height="229" class="image-left"> </span>Life imitates <em>Seinfeld</em>, once again. In a Newman-esque operation, a Brooklyn postal worker was caught with 537 pieces of mail in the trunk of his car. The Dyker Heights Post Office employee, 26-year-old Peter Ramsdal, was pulled over while driving to the Catskills on April 21st. Police discovered he had a suspended registration, and, upon impounding his car they found the hoarded mail&#x2014;which then led to contacting federal postal inspectors.</p>

<p>One of the local officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225602/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/letter_stash_carrier_pulls_newman_Xq1QNdOl0kLd4WNxZEQHKJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, <strong>&quot;We found three large bags of mail, unopened and opened, time-sensitive mail, priority mail. He said he had taken it. We don&apos;t know where he was going.&quot;</strong> Ramsdal, who filled in for letter carriers when they were off, admitted that he purposely delayed the mail, though it&apos;s unknown why he did this. (Perhaps because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225602/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg_4z2adv6Q">when you control the mail, you control... information</a>?). Currently he&apos;s under investigation. </p>

<p>Some locals in Dyker Heights told the paper about their mail problems, one said, &quot;Last year, I swear, for a month I didn&apos;t get any mail. I called the post office to complain, and they said I have to talk to the carrier.&quot;</p>
