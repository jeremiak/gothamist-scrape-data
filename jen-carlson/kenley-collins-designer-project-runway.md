Hailing from Florida, she now lives and designs in New York, where she&apos;s been working on her own line in a small boutique, as well as freelancing and teaching. She recently told us about the show, her fellow designers and what trends appear to be back in New York.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did you get started in fashion?</strong> I started reconstructing vintage when I was a teenager and started making clothes from scratch about 3 years ago. I moved to New York almost 3 years ago with now job and a marketing degree from Florida State University. I got a job in sales for mass market women&apos;s wear and within a week was moved to a design position. Got all my experience that I needed for 2 years there then started my own label, freelanced for children&apos;s wear, and started teaching sewing.</p>

<p><strong>How has the Project Runway experience been thus far?</strong> This whole experience hasn&apos;t really hit yet but for the most part its been all kinds of things; fun, emotional, stressful, exhausting. </p>

<p><strong>Blayne&apos;s &quot;Girlicious&quot; schtick gets tiring after just one already-edited episode--how bad was it in the work room?</strong> It wasn&apos;t bad. Blayne has alot of catch phrases that didnt bother me because he was such a sweet guy.</p>

<p><strong>What are some trends you particularly like and don&apos;t like?</strong> I don&apos;t like when you see major trends on people over and over again to the point of just played out. For example, the thin head bands that cut across your forehead over your hair. At first, it was &quot;a look&quot; now its just a bad trend. I do like when someone has a look that is there own. No matter what it is.</p>
