</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221401/http://mas.org/category/coney-island/">Municipal Art Society</a> (MAS) had their intense redesign Coney Island workshop at the end of last week, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221401/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/28/imagine_coney_island.php">as promised</a> they&apos;ve released their ideas to the public today. The concept and design is portrayed in the renderings above (so many robots and clowns!), and MAS says &quot;The concept, which would include a variety of indoor and outdoor facilities, can be implemented immediately (Summer 2009) and would take advantage of the parcels of undeveloped land in Coney Island, much of which is now vacant or operating as street-level parking.&quot;</p>

<p>One entertainment developer involved, David Malmuth, notes that the live entertainment programming <em>and</em> a major new ride are integral to the future of Coney...he&apos;s also the former VP of Disney, and he&apos;s not the only mouseketeer on the team, former Disney exec Anne Hamburger (who oversaw programming in all of Disney&#x2019;s theme parks for more than eight years) is also on board. Are so many Disney minds a good thing in this case?</p>

<p>The next step for MAS (who are likely quite happy with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221401/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/17/will_thor_sell_astroland_to_the_cit.php">this morning&apos;s news</a>) is to provide a more detailed programming and funding proposal, which they promise by early 2009. After the jump you&apos;ll find more about their proposed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422221401/http://www.imagineconey.com/">Imagine Coney</a> concept.</p>
