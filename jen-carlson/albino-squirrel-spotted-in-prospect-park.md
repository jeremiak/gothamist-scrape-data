<p>It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075718/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/08/the_albino_squi.php">four years</a> since we last spotted the albino squirrel of Prospect Park. Apparently it, or its offspring, survived the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075718/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/prospect_park_2.php">animal massacres</a>, because One Ring Zero&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075718/http://twitter.com/#!/michaelhearst/status/28439033845">Michael Hearst</a> just spotted it! Now, anyone spot the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128075718/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/12/when_squirrels.php">black squirrels</a> lately?</p>
