<p>Twice recently we&apos;ve treated ourselves to a pricey $6 soy chai latte at Starbucks only to get on the subway, take a sip, and find we just paid $6 for a black coffee. We have vowed never to get burned by the franchise again, because that&apos;s a lot of money!  But it&apos;s not as much as one man&apos;s coffee at the joint (<em>though at least he was given the correct beverage</em>)&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114832/http://nacgeek.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/23-60-the-most-expensive-starbucks-drink-possible-in-the-world/">Logan A. Warren spent $23.60</a> on one specially-made concoction there recently. His Java Chip Frappuccino in a Trenta cup included: 16 shots of espresso, a shot of soy milk, caramel flavoring, banana puree, strawberry puree, vanilla beans, Matcha powder, protein powder, and a drizzle of caramel and mocha. (To <em>really</em> give this over-the-top status he should have ordered it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114832/http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/02/15/iced-coffee-worlds-first-ski-thru-starbucks-opens-in-california/">on the slopes in California</a>.)</p>

<p>That&apos;s 31 ounces of what sounds like a way too sweet coffee drink, packing around 1400mg of caffeine (that&apos;s 3 or 4 times a more normal dose of the stuff). It cost him $23.60 (he had a certificate), and he reported back saying: &quot;The flavor?  Tolerable, but not good.  Imagine a coffee-based health food smoothie that will put you in the hospital if you drink it all.  That&#x2019;s how it tastes&#x2026; like Jillian Michaels with a touch of Chuck Norris.&quot;</p>

<p>So in the end, it costs nearly 24 bucks to find out that banana puree and espresso probably don&apos;t taste all that good together.
