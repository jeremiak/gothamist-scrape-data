<p>Could have sworn this happened years ago, but turns out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140318/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> graduated from NYU film school <em>yesterday</em>, which probably isn&apos;t even a relief since he&apos;s going to about 850 other colleges and is even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140318/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/well_hello_professor_franco.php"><em>teaching</em> at some of them</a>. Unsurprisingly, some of his fellow students have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140318/http://twitpic.com/4ykip8">Tweeted pics</a> of the actor/artist/everyman in his shiny graduation robe, <em>and it&apos;s just adorable</em>. So what&apos;s next for this promising young man? He&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140318/http://www.okmagazine.com/2011/05/james-franco-uses-switchblade-to-carve-brad-renfro-into-his-arm/">cutting himself</a> in the name of art, because what else is he going to do? (Suggestion: release the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140318/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/james_franco_forever.php">NYU film</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140318/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/25/james_franco_2.php">the sex tape</a>... suggests our friend.)
