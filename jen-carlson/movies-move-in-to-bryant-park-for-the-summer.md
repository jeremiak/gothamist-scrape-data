<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504074200/http://www.bryantpark.org/calendar/film-festival.php">Bryant Park Summer Film Festival</a> kicks off its 16th year tonight with the 1962 (Sean Connery era) Bond classic <em>Dr. No</em>, though it&apos;s likely the opening evening will get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504074200/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/16/take_and_early_lunch_weather.php">rained (and stormed) out</a>. The Monday screenings will continue throughout the summer, however -- here&apos;s a look at the schedule:</p><blockquote>June 16th, Dr. No<br>
June 23rd, Bride of Frankenstein<br>
June 30th, Hud<p></p>

<p>July 7th, The Man Who Came to Dinner<br>
July 14th, Fail-Safe<br>
July 21st, Arsenic and Old Lace<br>
July 28th, The Apartment</p>

<p>August 4th, Lifeboat<br>
August 11th, The Candidate<br>
August 18th, Superman</p></blockquote>Rain dates are the following night, but beware the moist grass! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504074200/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/27/barefoot_in_the.php">Last month</a> it was reported that it harbors bacteria and can damage the skin, allowing &quot;infectious organisms to sink in or take up residency in your shoes.&quot; If you don&apos;t want to end up with warts, or worse, bromhidrosi infection (stinky feet) -- then maybe you want to avoid the grassy area. For the fearless, the lawn opens at 5 p.m.! <p></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The organizers tell us, &quot;We actually no longer have rain dates &#x2013; if a film is canceled, we do not show it on another night.  The most likely scenario is that the canceled movie might get put on the schedule for the following year.&quot; And as of 2:30 p.m. they say tonight&apos;s show is still on. </p>
