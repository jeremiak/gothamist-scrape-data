<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="php3ATie8PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142631im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php3ATie8PM.jpg" width="130" height="118" class="image-right"> </span>Yesterday the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142631/http://metmuseum.org/">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> sent out a statement announcing 74 layoffs at its stores (following 53 layoffs last year) with more to come from the museum&apos;s overall staff. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142631/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/arts/design/13metr.html?_r=1">The NY Times</a> reports that as many as 250 full and part time jobs may be lost before summer. While the cuts will hit <em>every</em> department, including curatorial, Met officials have declared the changes won&apos;t affect the museum&apos;s hours, exhibitions or standards. On top of endowment losses, &quot;the museum will receive $1.7 million less in operating help from the city this year and has been told to expect another cutback that could be as high as $2.4 million in the next fiscal year.&quot; With the recession hitting even the most prestigious of institutions these days, the paper notes that the layoffs are also in part due to problems that its merchandising arm have been facing. If you&apos;d like to help, they also shared that membership renewals have been on the decline (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142631/http://www.metmuseum.org/member/memb_only/me_only_login.asp">wink wink, nudge nudge</a>).</p>
