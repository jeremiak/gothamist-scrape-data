Mario Cantone, who played wedding planner and fag-for-Charlotte-to-hag Anthony Marantino, is the only one talking details so far:   </p><blockquote>&quot;Hopefully the Sex and the City movie is going to happen this fall,&quot; he said. &quot;If it does, I&apos;m in it which would be nice so it better get done. They&apos;ve called me about my availability, yeah, but nothing&apos;s negotiated with myself. I don&apos;t know if any of the girls are negotiated. All I know is it better get done because I want to do it.&quot;</blockquote>There were hopes for a film earlier, but rumor had it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131119025108/http://www.hollyscoop.com/sarah-jessica-parker/sex-coming-back-to-the-city_8062.aspx">Kim Cattrall didn&apos;t want any part of it</a>.  Despite nothing being nailed down, the film is tentatively scheduled to start filming this fall, so clear the sidewalks for some Manolos (or, whatever the shoe du jour is). The questions stands, however, is a movie necessary? <br>

<p>Sex and the City filming may have to compete with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131119025108/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/04/07/lipstick_jungle.php">Lipstick Jungle</a> and Cashmere Mafia, which are essentially SATC variations by SATC author Candace Bushnell (creator of Lipstick Jungle) and SATC producer Darren Starr (Cashmere Mafia) - on networks&apos; fall TV schedules. And here are our three year old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131119025108/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/02/23/sex_and_the_city_finale_thoughts.php">thoughts on the small screen series finale</a>.</p>
