Will this be the beginning of a trend where Park Slope parents get booted from their home turf bars? </p>

<p>Last week the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://www.brooklynian.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=40298">Brooklynian</a> message board was abuzz with residents who were surprisingly <em>not</em> split on the issue. One points out that some pubs in the UK have recently limited patrons with kids to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7171582.stm">two drinks</a> per visit, while many just echoed each other&apos;s &quot;babies and bars don&apos;t mix&quot; sentiment.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2008/01/mommies-toddlers-eighty-sixed-from.html">The Gowanus Lounge</a> pointed out the new policy at Union Hall via word of an employee that says the bar is only banning &quot;kids that are old enough to walk,&quot; and strollers because of fire codes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn.typepad.com/only_the_blog_knows_brook/2008/01/do-kids-need-to.html">OTBKB</a>, a Brooklyn mom, weighed in reminding thirsty parents that Union Hall is a &quot;grown up bar&quot; that many would like to see stay opened (something the new rule will help them do). At least one stroller-pusher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn.typepad.com/only_the_blog_knows_brook/2008/01/mom-of-toddler.html">is sounding off</a> though (some suggestions: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://www.chuckecheese.com/">Chuck E Cheese</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/09/montclair_new_j.php">Park Slope West</a>). </p>

<p>This is all starting to remind us of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171648/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/06/park_slope_stro.php">the Great Stroller Debate of &apos;07</a> that Barnes &amp; Nobles brought upon Brooklyn.</p>
