<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="siamesepumpkins.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229200528im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/siamesepumpkins.jpg" width="275" height="275"> <br> <i style=" width:275px; ;display:block"> Happy 20th, Siamese Dream</i></div> Twenty years ago tomorrow (July 27th, 1993) Smashing Pumpkins released their second album, <em>Siamese Dream</em>&#x2014;it was one that propelled them further into rock stardom, and one that very likely haunts Billy Corgan to this day. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229200528/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/billy_corgan_interview.php">we discussed that with him last year</a>, and he told us,  &quot;I listen to those albums&#x2014;they&apos;re working on the re-issues&#x2014;I just roll my eyes and think, &apos;Oh god. I really was listening to <em>this</em> record at that time.&apos; I can really hear it and it embarrasses me because I&apos;m obviously being trendy.&quot;<p></p>

<p>But the world loved it, and loves it, and continues to want <em>more more more</em> (&quot;Sentimentality is death&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229200528/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/billy_corgan_interview.php">Billy Corgan</a>). It got the band their first Grammy nominations, and placed them on a number of Best Albums Of All Time lists. And if you were born in the &apos;70s, you may or may not have lost your virginity to it. So many memories for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>At the time, the Chicago band was tossed into the Seattle grunge mix, and Corgan said during an interview on MTV&apos;s <em>120 Minutes</em>: &quot;We&apos;ve graduated now from [being called] &apos;the next Jane&apos;s Addiction&apos; to &apos;the next Nirvana,&apos; now we&apos;re &apos;the next Pearl Jam.&apos;&quot; At least <em>Rolling Stone</em> pegged them more as a progressive rock band, even if most of the world would just end up lumping all of these bands under the &quot;alternative&quot; label.</p>

<p>Below is producer Butch Vig discussing the record 20 years later (&quot;Billy wanted to make a record that people would put on and say, &apos;What the fuck was that?&apos; We wanted to have things going on in the left ear and right ear all the time.&quot;) And if you&apos;re wondering where the cover girls are, one was identified in 2007 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229200528/http://thefw.com/siamese-dream-album-then-and-now/">as Ali Laenger</a>.</p>
