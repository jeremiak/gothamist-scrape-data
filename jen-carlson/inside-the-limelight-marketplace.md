</div></div>					<p>While it may not be opening until the Spring of next year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143424/http://gothamist.com/tags/limelightmarketplace">the Limelight Marketplace</a> invited us over today to take a look at the space as it transforms yet again. Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143424/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> reports back that, &quot;although it&apos;s just a bunch of mini stores, they don&apos;t want to be known as a mini mall! It&apos;s a <em>market</em>.&quot; The folks there also told her that it would be very family friendly (but no club kids), and &quot;Saturdays it will feel like a carnival because they&apos;ll have clowns and mascots walking around.&quot; Terrifying!</p>
