According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/20/2011-01-20_hunt_for_scarce_ob_tampons_heats_up_on_web__prices_soar_on_ebay_for_discontinued.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+nydnrss/ny_local+%28NY+Local%29">the Daily News</a> there are bidding wars on eBay, turning o.b. brand loyalists against each other. As we noted yesterday, Johnson &amp; Johnson had a &quot;temporary supply interruption&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41158668/ns/business-retail/">whatever <em>that</em> means</a>) which has led to their product being out of stock in many places... though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/19/tampons.php">we found a few boxes</a> at Bridge Apothecary in DUMBO this week.<p></p>

<p>Currently there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/http://shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=o.b.+tampons&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_odkw=o.b.+tampon&amp;_osacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m270.l1313">278 auctions</a> on eBay, some with starting prices of $45 for one (40-count) box... albeit these are for the &quot;NEW&quot; and &quot;unopened&quot; boxes! However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/http://www.drugstore.com/search/search_results.asp?N=0&amp;Ntx=mode%2Bmatchallpartial&amp;Ntk=All&amp;srchtree=1&amp;Ntt=o.b.&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0">Drugstore.com</a> has 40-count boxes for just $6.99 each (also, presumably, new and unopened boxes). That hot tip comes from Penthouse editor Barbara Rice, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/http://twitter.com/#!/babsrice">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Still no OB tampons in stores, so I just ordered many boxes from drugstore.com. This might get me through till menopause!&quot;</p>

<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson still hasn&apos;t elaborated, and are saying to expect the product back on shelves &quot;soon&quot; (which they&apos;ve been saying for months now). Over at Bridge Apothecary, the tampons are &quot;on back order... the problem will be all corrected soon hopefully.&quot; But is there really a problem? We&apos;ve spotted them in several places in the city. Homework assignment: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> photos of your drugstores o.b. tampon section (be it empty or full). Yes, for real&#x2014;maybe this is all some marketing scheme to counter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324114848/http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/another-jj-recall-another-hit-jjs-image/2011-01-18">the bad press</a> Johnson &amp; Johnson has been having!</p>
