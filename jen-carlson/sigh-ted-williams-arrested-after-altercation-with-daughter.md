Last week he was panhandling on the side of a highway in Ohio, only to be pulled from the street by way of a viral video. Since then he&apos;s been whisked away by various press outlets and possible employers, and most recently he was in Los Angeles meeting Kobe Bryant and filming a Dr. Phil episode (with his ex-wife and estranged children). And then the levee broke! <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124414/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/01/11/2011-01-11_ted_williams_homeless_man_with_golden_voice_detained_by_lapd_after_alleged_fight.html">the Daily News</a>, Williams was briefly detained by the LAPD at his Hollywood hotel last night, where they were responding to a disturbance call. Williams was allegedly in an altercation with his daughter, and the two were brought to the station. Williams has been released, and no one has been charged with a crime, but the investigation is still ongoing. </p>

<p>We&apos;re gonna go ahead and blame <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124414/http://www.etonline.com/news/106329_VIDEO_Dr_Phil_to_Golden_Voice_Ted_Williams_Take_My_Sobriety_Challenge/">Dr. Phil</a> for this one. Some feelings were just meant to be repressed and buried!</p>
