										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="nyaquariumsealion.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151204003933im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/nyaquariumsealion.jpg" width="350" height="257" class="image-left"> </span>Forget about cash cows, the Wildlife Conservation Society has informed us that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151204003933/http://www.nyaquarium.com/">New York Aquarium</a> has just launched a program that will allow visitors to get up close and personal with their sea lions... for a price. </p>

<p>The Sea Lion Encounter Program allows visitors to go behind the scenes with keepers and learn animal training techniques, including helping out in the kitchen. At the end of the adventure, &quot;you will have a 20-minute meet-and-greet session with one of the New York Aquarium&#x2019;s California sea lions. You&#x2019;ll be able to pet the animal, and the session will be photographed. The sea lion will thank you with a kiss!&quot; Aw! </p>

<p>Better prepare to loosen those pursestrings though, the encounters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151204003933/https://tickets.wcs.org/mainstore.asp?vid=6">cost $200 per participant</a>, and aquarium admission, while not required, is not included in the price of the session! Consider it your good deed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151204003933/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/16/zoo_aquarium_layoffs.php">keeping the city&apos;s animals</a> employed? Or just go see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151204003933/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/09/sea_lion.php">baby sea lion</a> at the Bronx Zoo for a much cheaper price.</p>
