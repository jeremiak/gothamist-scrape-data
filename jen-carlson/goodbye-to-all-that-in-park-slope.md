										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="statlerwaldor1010.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182348im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/statlerwaldor1010.jpg" width="225" height="225" class="image-right"> </span>You know who hates Park Slope the most? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182348/http://daryllang.com/blog/3963"><em>This guy</em></a>. So he&apos;s left the &apos;hood and left its residents a very public reprimanding. He says amongst those residents that annoy him include &quot;guys my age who aren&#x2019;t put together, who slouch when they walk, who can&#x2019;t order a slice of pizza with confidence, who look fidgety and skittish. A lot of these guys are also fathers. It troubles me.&quot; Maybe he hasn&apos;t seen them at the bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182348/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/park_slope_parents_still_bringing_b.php">with their babies</a>, a few beers loosen them right up! Anyway, you can read the whole takedown on his blog, but here&apos;s a little taste:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I am leaving Park Slope because I am increasingly impatient with people too socially deficient to act like good neighbors. People who won&#x2019;t spare five seconds to help an old lady. People who can&#x2019;t figure out their way around without checking their iPhones. People who don&#x2019;t say hi to the neighbors with whom they share a stoop. These things are getting noticeably worse. Rather than stew here and become the local grouch, I&#x2019;m recognizing that I have passed my expiration date in this neighborhood. Time to exit gracefully.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Some of his hand-picked &quot;reader reactions&quot; are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182348/http://daryllang.com/blog/4961">here</a>, but as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182348/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/on-leaving-park-slope.html">FIPS</a> points out, he&apos;s gotten rid of comments, explaining, &quot;I feel writers ought to seize a maximum amount of control over the reader experience. Why should a writer let anonymous strangers add unedited footnotes to his or her work? I will control which words appear on the site.&quot; (<em>Someone</em> has control issues.)</p>

<p>So where is this magical land without iPhone-addicted, unselfish, neighborly folk? Manhattan&apos;s Financial District.</p>
