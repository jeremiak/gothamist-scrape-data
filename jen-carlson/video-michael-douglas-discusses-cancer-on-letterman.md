										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="douglasletterman.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231235812im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/douglasletterman.jpg" width="250" height="366"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Douglas arrives at Letterman</span></i></div> Last month word came out the Michael Douglas was battling throat cancer, at which time he said he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231235812/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/17/michael_douglas_fighting_throat_can.php">optimistic about a full recovery</a>. Now as he makes the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231235812/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/michael_douglas_optimistic_about_6yE1KtYIbQE3c0HHzRhotN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">press rounds</a> promoting his latest role in <em>Wall Street II</em>, he&apos;s talking about the battle some more. <p></p>

<p>Last night the actor was on Letterman, where he told the late night host he faces an &quot;eight-week struggle,&quot; but is still optimistic. He just finished his first week of radiation and chemotherapy, which shocked the host, who declared, &quot;You&apos;ve never looked better to me, and this proves that you&apos;re a tough guy, for God&apos;s sakes.&quot;</p>

<p>For real! Douglas wasn&apos;t just diagnosed with a little bit of cancer, this is late stage-four cancer, which he says is &quot;intense&quot; (he attributes it to drinking). He joked with Letterman about his spirits, saying, &quot;Let&apos;s just say... I&apos;m pretty lit up right now.&quot; Hopefully that kind of humor, and the fact that it hasn&apos;t spread below the neck, will keep the 65-year-old strong enough... so that maybe one day we can see a <em>Wonder Boys II</em>? Watch his appearance below (including the aw-worthy moment where Letterman asks him if he needs anything, and he says, &quot;Ahh, give me a hug.&quot;)</p>
