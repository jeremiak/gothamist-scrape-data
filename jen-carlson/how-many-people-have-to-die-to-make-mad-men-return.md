										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="madmendraper0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170421im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/madmendraper0311.jpg" width="365" height="304" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170421/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/mad_men_wont_return_this_year.php">we learned</a> that Don Draper &amp; Co. would not be returning to our television screens until 2012&#x2014;preferably <em>early</em> 2012 before the universe as we know it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170421/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">is annihilated</a>. It would just be nice to go out knowing if Don Draper will ever truly love, ya know. Either way, <em>Mad Men</em> will return... but rumored contract negotiations have creator Matt Weiner getting paid the big bucks to kill off his own characters. Allegedly!</p>

<p>One rumored reason for the hold-up is that Weiner seems to be renegotiating his contract, and early reports are that he&apos;s being offered $30 million to write the show for a three year deal. (He previously stated the show would only run through a 6th season, so this could also mean a 7th season.) Yesterday Weiner told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170421/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/arts/television/mad-men-delayed-as-matthew-weiner-and-amc-dispute-contract.html">the NY Times</a>, &quot;All I want to do is continue to make my show, and make it in the way I want to, with the people I want to make it with.&quot; (At press time it is unclear if he was stomping his feet in a tantrum-fit while stating this.) </p>

<p><em>LOST</em> writer Damon Lindelof <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170421/http://twitter.com/#!/DamonLindelof/status/52781731740270592">Tweeted his thoughts</a> about the rumored deal his peer was making, saying, <strong>&quot;Not that I&apos;m sour grapes, but TEN MILLION DOLLARS a year for 13 episodes of a single show seems pretty fair, no? #SOURGRAPES&quot;</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170421/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/03/29/damon-lindelof-on-mad-men-offer-seems-pretty-fair/">EW</a>, another rumor going around is that Weiner wasn&apos;t asked to cut just two series regulars, he was asked to <em>cut two a year for three years!</em> We&apos;re gonna need a bigger lawn mower...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Weiner has now addressed the rumors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170421/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/03/30/matthew-weiner-defends-mad-men-standoff/">saying</a>, &quot;There&#x2019;s been a lot of speculation and misinformation in the press about what is going on. I want the fans to know directly from me that I had nothing to do with this delay and it is not about money. I am fighting for the cast and for the show. And I appreciate the kindness and concern of the fans.&#x201D;</p>
