<p>If you&apos;ve got Southern roots and a taste for mayo-based &quot;sandwich spreads,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6877304">pimento cheese</a> is probably up top on your comfort foods list. But where can you find the best versions of the dish in New York City? While you probably won&apos;t ever track down an accurate portrayal of your mom&apos;s white bread version, there are plenty of pimento cheese offerings worth ordering. After a trip to Van Horn sandwich shop in Brooklyn recently, we went on a little quest for the best, and here&apos;s what we tracked down:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://www.yelp.com/biz/van-horn-sandwich-shop-brooklyn"><strong>Van Horn Sandwich Shop</strong></a> offers a Toasted Pimento Cheese Sandwich for $8. This is more like a grilled cheese with pimentos in it&#x2014;but while you lose some of the Southern authenticity, you&apos;ll probably also shave off some calories (no mayo!). They also offer a BLP (bacon, lettuce, pimento)&#x2014;both have received rave reviews <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://www.yelp.com/biz/van-horn-sandwich-shop-brooklyn">on Yelp</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/shake_the_winter_doldrums_with_bobw.php#photo-1"><strong>Bobwhite Lunch &amp; Supper Counter</strong></a> (a Gothamist fave) has a pimento cheese sandwich on the menu for $8, and it even comes available on white bread. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2012/03/a-sandwich-a-day-pimento-cheese-at-bobwhite-c.html">SeriousEats</a> called their version &quot;a creamy, fatty treat&quot; that&apos;s best for sharing, and we&apos;ve heard mumblings that it&apos;s better than some you can find down South.</p>

<p><strong>The Commodore</strong> offers a pimento cheese sandwich in disguise, under the name &quot;adult cheese,&quot; and served up for just $6. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-commodore-brooklyn">One fan</a> declared, &quot;the famous booze-infused pimento stuffed &apos;adult-cheese&apos; is my favorite cheese sandwich anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://www.pigandegg.com/menus/lunch/"><strong>Pig &amp; Egg</strong></a> has a Hot Ham and Pimento Cheese sandwich on the menu for $12. This is probably to be avoided by the purists, however&#x2014;it comes served on a fancy baguette, and features a grilled up country ham (though the pimento cheese <em>is</em> homemade).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://www.hillcountrychicken.com/assets/file/LunchDinnerMenu1_12_12n.pdf"><strong>Hill Country Chicken</strong></a> has a fried pimento cheese sandwich for the bargain basement price of $5. It&apos;s so fried, in fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2010/09/a-sandwich-a-day-fried-pimento-cheese-at-hill-country-chicken-broadway-flatiron-nyc.html">it doesn&apos;t even look like a sandwich</a> once it hits yours plate.</p>

<p>At press time, it&apos;s unclear if anyone in the five boroughs has dared attempt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210638/http://www.ourstate.com/pimento-cheese-cake/">this Pimento Cheese CAKE</a> yet, but you can always create one of your own. We hear Whole Foods and Trader Joe&apos;s have worthy pre-made pimento options, if you want to start there for your base... or you can make your own, Paula Deen-style:</p>
