<p>Hey Girl, Time Warner Cable wants to make right by you for all those times they were late, or unresponsive, or simply unavailable. For all those times they left you feeling helpless, and unconnected to the world. For every phone call where they just left you hanging. They want you to love them again, or at least not cancel your services, and they&apos;re smart enough to know that the best way to do that is with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121193216/http://gothamist.com/tags/ryangosling">Ryan Gosling</a>. They&apos;re so cunning!</p>

<p>So for the month of February (or, until the 27th) they&apos;ll be giving you &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121193216/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/02/ryan-gosling-on-demand-yes-ladies-its-true.html">Ryan Gosling On Demand</a>,&quot; a channel that allows you to cue up some RyGo 24/7, with his movies <em>Lars and the Real Girl</em>, <em>Drive</em>, <em>The Ides of March</em>, <em>Crazy Stupid Love</em>, and of course, <em>The Notebook</em>. But wait, there&apos;s more! They&apos;ll also give you those Gosling movies you never really cared about watching, like <em>Remember the Titans</em>, <em>Murder By Numbers</em>, and <em>Fracture</em>. Sadly, no <em>Blue Valentine</em> (you can get that over on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121193216/http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Valentine/dp/B004R170M4/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328279531&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon Instant Watch</a> if you feel like dropping 15 bucks).</p>

<p>And just like any terrible boyfriend that you don&apos;t know why you haven&apos;t broken up with yet, Time Warner is making <em>you</em> pay for it. The movies will cost from $1.99 to $4.99 each.</p>
