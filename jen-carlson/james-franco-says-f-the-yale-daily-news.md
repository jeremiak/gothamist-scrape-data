										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="YDNfranco0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922185209im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/YDNfranco0311.jpg" width="365" height="447" class="image-right"> </span>James Franco may have been hosting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922185209/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/27/the_83rd_annual_academy_awards_happ.php">the Academy Awards</a> on Sunday night, but by Monday morning at 9 a.m. he was back at Yale and ready for some schoolin&apos;, wearing a gray sweatshirt and his tuxedo pants. The actor and every man is pursuing a Ph.D. in English at the Connecticut Ivy League, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922185209/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/nyregion/04franco.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">the NY Times</a>, he took a red-eye after performing his Oscar duties. The professor for his morning seminar on medieval manuscripts told the paper, &#x201C;I was surprised and delighted that he made it to class. He&#x2019;s a dedicated student.&#x201D;</p>

<p>While he hasn&apos;t spoken out about his Oscar-hosting critiques (which have been harsh), he is now feuding with the Yale Daily News, where one writer dared criticize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922185209/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/please_welcome_james_franco_to_the.php">his Twitter-style</a>! A day before the Oscars, his fellow Yalie Cokey Cohen (<em>if that is your real name</em>) wrote: &quot;James Franco, your Twitter sort of sucks.&quot; Franco&apos;s response was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922185209/http://www.whosay.com/jamesfranco/photos/14429">this photo</a>, which he Twittered, declaring: &quot;Fuck the Yale Daily News.&quot; (Also, have Ivy League newspapers succumbed to cyber-speak? The article contains enough hashtags and <em>Oh My Gods</em> to make Sinclair Lewis roll over in his grave.) Cokey&apos;s classmates and commenters have turned the criticism on her, one writing: &quot;Really? Dedicating a whole post at YALE daily news to someone you &apos;don&apos;t really care about&apos;?&quot;</p>

<p>The kids at one of the many higher learning institutes that Franco has attended in New York (Columbia, NYU, Brooklyn College) would have never pulled this.</p>
