</div></div>					<p>Everyone recovering alright from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233709/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/11/celebrate_phil_collins_day_with_a_p.php">Phil Collins Day</a>? Yesterday&#x2014;<em>the big day</em>&#x2014;we spoke to one of the organizers, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233709/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/15/some_words_from_the_phil_collins_da.php">told us</a> all of the chatter about the holiday she created was making her &quot;a little nervous. I hope, that for all who come tonight, that they come to enjoy everything that Phil represents, and to have a great time.&quot; She started the annual celebration with friends five years ago, but this year upped the ante with a parade, a specialty pizza, masks, a Phil float... you get the idea. If you were unable to attend yourself, check out our photos above&#x2014;complete with seriously creepy Phil Collins masks, a marching band, a Phil impersonator, and plenty of celebratory dancing in the streets.</p>

<p>At press time, Phil Collins has not commented on his day, and we&apos;re awaiting the final word on how things went from organizers... who are probably still sleeping off all those Phil Collins cocktails.</p>
