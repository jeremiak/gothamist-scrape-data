<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028225740/http://www.wcbs880.com/ME:-Heath-Ledger-of-Accidental-Overdose/1607102">The official word</a> is that the actor died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. <em>A lot</em> of prescription drugs. <br>
   <br>
The ME&apos;s spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, made the following statement: &quot;Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine.&apos;&apos; These are generic names for OxyContin, Valium, Xanax, Restoril and Unisom. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028225740/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h_k1n_zmAFHkxYYOBmztTgWLpDIgD8UKT6D82">The AP</a> originally reported that Hydrocodone was another name for Ibuprofen, however that is inaccurate and the drug is most commonly marketed as Vicodin.)</p>

<p>Heath&#x2019;s father, Kim, has released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028225740/http://www.accesshollywood.com/article/8276/Heath-Ledger-Toxicology-Results-Revealed/">a statement</a> on behalf of the family in response to the Medical Examiner&#x2019;s findings. He stated, &quot;While no medications were taken in excess, we learned today the combination of doctor-prescribed drugs proved lethal for our boy. Heath&apos;s accidental death serves as a caution to the hidden dangers of combining prescription medication, even at low dosage.&quot; (Read the full statement after the jump.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as we approach the release date of his last film, <em>The Dark Knight</em>, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028225740/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2008/02/05/doctor-parnassus-lives/?loc=interstitialskip">being reported</a> that the film he was working on, <em>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</em>, will keep him in the picture. The decision was made to keep his performance and &quot;rework the film to accommodate it...out of respect for that performance and in memory of Heath.&quot;</p>
