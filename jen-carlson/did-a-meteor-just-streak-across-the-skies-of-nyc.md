										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="meteo0313.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131712im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/meteo0313.jpg" width="300" height="188"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> via Getty</i></div> Just around 8 p.m. tonight Twitter lit up with word that a meteor, or something resembling a meteor, flew over Manhattan. Whatever it was (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131712/http://www.ufoevidence.org/">ahem</a>), it was also reported to be seen by residents of D.C. and Boston. The Weather Channel (who haven&apos;t yet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131712/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/08/mayor_bloombergs_office_speaks_out.php">named the meteor</a>) Tweeted: &quot;Meteor observed over the skies of Manhattan within the past few minutes.&quot; We&apos;ll update as we receive more info on this, but one local tipster who saw it tells us, &quot;It was crazy huge! Seemed like way more than a star.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Incidentally, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131712/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57575194/nasas-advice-for-near-term-meteor-strike-pray/">earlier this week</a> at a House Committee hearing, &quot;NASA administrator Charles Bolden Jr. was asked what America would do if a meteor similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131712/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/video_meteor_hits_earth_hundreds_in.php">the one that hit in Russia on February 15th</a> was found to be on a path toward New York City, with impact three weeks away. His response? &apos;Pray.&apos;&quot; So uh, get out there and live life, everyone!</p>
