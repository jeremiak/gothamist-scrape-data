                            <p>Earlier today a new Banksy piece went up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/new_banksy_up_in_south_bronx.php#photo-1">in the South Bronx</a>, and this afternoon building owner David Damaghi told us he was looking into preserving the piece with plexiglass&#x2014;this came after the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/nypd_vs_banksy.php">asked him if he wanted to press charges</a> against the artist (he told them &quot;no&quot;). Until he gets some plexi up, he&apos;s hired two guards. Nic Garcia, who is on the scene right now (8:40 p.m.), tells us: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;They&apos;re both super friendly, they&apos;re &apos;independent contractors&apos; who were hired by the building owner. They&apos;re being really funny and easy going, they&apos;re letting people cross the caution tape to take pics. They heard a little about Banksy from the people here and the internet, but before that they didn&apos;t know him.&quot;</blockquote> 

<p>So this is like Red Hook (where there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/red_hook_banksy_has_a_night_watchma.php">a night watchman</a>), not like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/video_things_are_getting_interestin.php">in East New York</a> (where guys were charging people to see the piece)&#x2014;these guys are here to protect Banksy&apos;s latest, and we&apos;re told will only accept tips. If you go, bring them some warm coffee&#x2014;it&apos;s only 9 p.m. and they&apos;ve made multiple comments about taking a nap.</p>

<p>Throughout the month, Banksy&apos;s daily pieces have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/video_photos_banksys_woodside_piece.php">instant targets for taggers</a> (and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/banksys_911_tributes_gone_defaced.php">the city</a>), and as soon as they go up now, they&apos;re being protected by the masses until plexiglass or a gate can cover them.</p>
