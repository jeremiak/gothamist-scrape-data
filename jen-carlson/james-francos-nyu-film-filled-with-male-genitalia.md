										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="GOLDFRANCO.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/GOLDFRANCO.jpg" width="350" height="267"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">James Franco, eating gold. NBD.</span></i></div> James Franco&apos;s NYU film school thesis project has finally seen the light of day, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000603/http://www.observer.com/2010/daily-transom/james-francos-thesis-film-genitals-galore">and word is</a> it&apos;s heavy on the male genitalia. A source told Life &amp; Style, <strong>&quot;It pretty much had no plot and featured men in clown masks, men in dog masks, and shots of male genitalia urinating. I think everyone was shocked by how much male nudity there was.&quot;</strong> <p></p>

<p>This seems to all fit in line with that really weird James Franco story that popped up on the internet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000603/http://dogsareadorable.com/post/417851789">earlier this year</a>. In it, a Franco fan goes up to Woodstock to (unknowingly) be in a film the actor was working on; &quot;he gets there, and the lights are all off, and Franco is lying on a couch, all tangled in blankets wearing nothing but a speedo. Franco goes, &apos;the script&#x2019;s already on the table, man. You&#x2019;re playing Alan.&apos; Sure enough, there are some scenes typed up on the table, and there&#x2019;s a character named Alan&#x2026;without any lines. His only role is to get ass-raped in this one part.&quot;</p>

<p>While we await that video to show up on the YouTubes, after the jump you&apos;ll find another video which co-stars Franco. In it he wears one of his many hats, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000603/http://online.wsj.com/video/james-franco--interviews-artist-marina-abramovic/43CA82D1-5CF8-48CF-A12A-897C5C641E12.html">Wall Street Journal</a> contributor, and sits down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000603/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/11/james-franco-marina-abram_n_572351.html">to eat gold</a> (GOLD!) with none other than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000603/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/the_artist_is_present_for_vips.php">his BFF</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000603/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovi%C4%87">Marina Abramovi&#x107;</a>.</p>
