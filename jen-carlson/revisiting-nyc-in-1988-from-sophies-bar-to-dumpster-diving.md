</div></div>					<p>Recently some corners of the internet discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021450/http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelseanedwards/">Michael Sean Edwards</a>&apos;s photos of New York City in the 1970s and &apos;80s, which we published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021450/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/22/flashback_new_york_1978-1985.php">a couple of years ago</a>. But they&apos;re always worth revisiting, and now you can click through for a look at some of his black and white images from 1988, which we didn&apos;t include at the time. If you end up feeling nostalgic, you&apos;ll be happy to know you can still visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021450/http://www.yelp.com/biz/sophies-new-york">Sophie&apos;s Bar</a> in the East Village&#x2014;they might even be using the same pool table you see in these images.</p>
