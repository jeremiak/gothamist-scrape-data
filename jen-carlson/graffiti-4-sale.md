Animal reports that the &quot;Smart Crew have come up with a great way to parlay their love of graffiti, piss off public paint hating politician Peter Vallone, and make some money in the process: vending machines that sell fat caps for spray paint.&quot; </p>

<p>The collective&apos;s art project is functional and they&apos;re currently looking for spots to place them. The vending machines currently sell .25 NY Fats and Rusto Fats (that price tag includes a fortune!) and there are future plans for machines that vend .50 Pink Dots, Gray Dots and German Outline caps. </p>

<p>Looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602074647/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/16/funometer.php">Jake Bronstein&apos;s idea vending machine</a> has some competition! But will any businesses actually take them up on the offer?</p>
