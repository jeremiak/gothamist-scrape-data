										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpOtBtirPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124554im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpOtBtirPM.jpg" width="640" height="334" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Earlier this month the New York Public Library launched their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124554/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/04/nypl_maps_launches.php">interactive map site</a>, which allows users to bring the old city landscape together with the current one. Now the folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124554/http://www.sepiatown.com/">SepiaTown</a> are zooming in a little bit closer. The site, which just launched, &quot;lets people experience the past through a large and growing collection of user-submitted, mapped historical images.&quot; </p>

<p>Currently there are around 400 images on the site, and a cumbersome looking map with thumbnails of those images. If all goes as planned, the site will be adding new features and growing in the next few months&#x2014;when they promise &quot;a mobile version, filtering by date and media type, film and audio upload, plus individualized pages for registered users.&quot; </p>

<p>Hopefully they&apos;ll also include more information with each image uploaded. For example, the picture above is just captioned: &quot;222 Columbia Heights. 1936.&quot; Through the Google machine, one can find a little bit more information at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124554/http://www.mcny.org/museum-collections/berenice-abbott/a127.htm">Museum of the City of New York</a>, where they note that the home pictured was built in 1865 for the Cornell Family, and &quot;although Brooklyn Heights was designated a historic district in 1965, the Cornell mansion was torn down and replaced in 1982 with a small apartment house. To meet landmark regulations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124554/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=222+columbia+heights+brooklyn&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=222+Columbia+Heights,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11201&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=nAaCS7zGN8zT8QaH0ZScBQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=40.696502,-73.997211&amp;spn=0.008183,0.017681&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.696414,-73.997274&amp;panoid=UzgK0rZ4hpPx0eiD7-y8SA&amp;cbp=12,326.14,,0,-19.62">the apartment house</a> conformed to the shape of the original mansion.&quot;</p>
