<p>If you read aloud from, say, a thesaurus or a Mad Libs filled in by a 10-year-old, you would probably spew out something like the lines delivered in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063848/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/19/true_detective_season_two_review.php"><em>True Detective 2</em></a>. The show&apos;s script, at points, sounds like it was written by someone who read a bunch of Smart Books and then tried to sound like them without much understanding of their words or meaning. Below is a sampling of real lines from <em>True Detective 2</em>, which are best read in the voice of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063848/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0007241/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Brick Tamland</a>.</p>

<ul><li>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want to look hungry. Never do anything out of hunger. Not even eating.&#x201D;
</li><li>&#x201C;I used to want to be an astronaut, but astronauts don&#x2019;t land on the moon anymore.&#x201D;
</li><li>&quot;You like to bully kids, ASS-pen?&quot;
</li><li>&#x201C;A good woman mitigates our baser tendencies.&#x201D;
</li><li>&#x201C;Maybe it&#x2019;s just a little too close to sucking a robot&#x2019;s dick.&#x201D; (This one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063848/https://twitter.com/christrobbins/status/408347366492626945">sounds familiar</a>!)
</li><li>&quot;You&#x2019;re asking me if he&#x2019;s that kind of guy. He looks half anaconda, half great white.&#x201D;
</li><li>&#x201C;God forgive me for misreading what subtle clues you embed for me in your limp dick, which is as wishy-washy as your fucking mood.&#x201D;</li></ul>

<p>Recently, Chris Rose of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151110063848/http://latenightbasement.tumblr.com/">Late Night Basement</a> took these lines out into the wild, blurting them out to strangers in McCarren Park. Rose told us this morning, &quot;No one recognized anything. But when a couple people got freaked out I did tell them what was going on and then they were like, &apos;Oh yeah I thought that sounded familiar.&apos; Most people were just doing that thing you do in New York when you think a crazy person is talking to you by being polite but a little stand offish. It&apos;s over all good to know that if you sound like Vince Vaughn from True Detective people will just assume you&apos;re the average crazy New Yorker.&quot;</p>
