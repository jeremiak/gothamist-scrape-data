<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171313/http://www.henson.com/jane.html">the Jim Henson Co.</a> released a statement saying that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171313/http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jane_Henson">Jane Henson</a>, co-creator of the Muppets, had died at the age of 78. The former wife of the late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171313/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimhenson">Jim Henson</a> was at her home in Greenwich, CT at the time of her death, which came after a &quot;long battle with cancer.&quot;</p>

<p>Jane, who was born in Queens, met Jim in a puppetry class in 1954 at the University of Maryland (they married five years later). While at the university, Jim had been offered a job on NBC affiliate WRC-TV in Washington, DC and he asked Jane along as his co-performer and creator, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171313/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/muppets-jane-henson-dies-432527">the Hollywood Reporter</a>. It was there that the two ran a five-minute show called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171313/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_and_Friends"><em>Sam and Friends</em></a>, which aired before the Huntley-Brinkley Report and again after The Tonight Show&#x2014;the show featured a little green guy who would become Kermit the Frog (he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171313/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/kermit_the_lizard.php">more of a lizard back then</a>).</p>

<p>Even though the couple separated in 1986, Jane still worked with the Jim Henson Co. She also founded the Jim Henson Legacy two years after Jim&apos;s death, as well as the National Puppetry Conference and the Jane Henson Foundation for philanthropic work. A memorial mass is planned for next week.</p>
