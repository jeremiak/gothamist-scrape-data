<p>Following the announcement that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112015/http://gothamist.com/tags/JamesGandolfini">James Gandolfini</a> had died yesterday, hundreds of fans of the actor flocked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112015/http://www.holstens.com/holstens.htm">Holsten&apos;s ice cream parlor</a> in Bloomfield, New Jersey last night, where his famous final scene in <em>The Sopranos</em> was filmed. We called Holsten&apos;s this afternoon, and were told there&apos;s been a steady stream of fans coming in today, &quot;definitely broke a hundred&quot; in numbers, so far.</p>

<p>The booth where the final scene was shot has a &quot;reserved&quot; sign on it&#x2014;&quot;I closed the booth out of respect for him. It&apos;s to let the people know who come in and look at that booth, they will see the sign that it&apos;s reserved for the Soprano family,&quot; owner Chris Carley told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112015/http://www.nydailynews.com/james-gandolfini-dead-51-holsten-ice-cream-parlor-reserves-booth-memoriam-article-1.1377813">Daily News</a>. Many last night were ordering onion rings, the final order placed by the Soprano family on the show, and posing at his table:</p>

<p>We were told this afternoon that the reserved sign is still up, and flowers are on the table. Here&apos;s the final scene, which gave Gandolfini <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112015/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/james_gandolfini_went_wtf_after_see.php">a WTF moment</a> when he first saw it: &quot;When I first saw the ending, I said, &#x2018;What the fuck?&#x2019; I mean, after all I went through, all this death, and then it&#x2019;s over like that?&quot;</p>
