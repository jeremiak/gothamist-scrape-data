</div></div>					<p>Over the weekend the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192837/http://figmentnyc.org/2009/">Figment Festival</a> brought color, art, and even mini golf to Governors Island. This is the 3rd year folks have been invited to use their imagination, either as artists or spectators, and the three day event boasted around 400 interactive-art pieces. Last year founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192837/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/26/david_koren_figment_festival.php">David Koren</a> explained where the name of the festival came from, saying Andy Warhol once commented that he wanted just the word &#x201C;Figment&#x201D; on his tombstone (sadly he ended up with a traditional grave marker).</p>

<p>By the way, that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192837/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/24/figment_is_back.php">mini golf course</a> you see will remain open through early October, accessible to the public on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
