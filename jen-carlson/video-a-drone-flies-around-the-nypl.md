<p>Drones can capture a lot, but they can <em>really</em> capture the pure, lonely state of human beings. So this footage shot from one flying around the New York Public Library is just perfect. Hovering above library patrons and workers, it captures solitude, loneliness, and the humdrum of every day routines. But it also captures whatever it is that makes you want to sit down at a large, wooden table and crack open the spine on your favorite hardcover. Enjoy: </p>
