title: There's Always A SirenSinging You To Shipwreck
---

<p>Gothamist is aware that you&apos;re probably already finding yourself pulled towards the sweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.villagevoice.com/siren/" target="_Blank">Sirens</a> sounds promised to be coming from Coney Island tomorrow, but we wanted to give you a reminder of the event in the form a preview. We are really excited about it ourselves and are having a problem figuring out which acts to catch, so here&apos;s our rundown for your sake and our own...</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/images/2004_07_artsmap1.php" onclick="window.open(&apos;https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/images/2004_07_artsmap1.php&apos;,&apos;popup&apos;,&apos;width=490,height=488,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&apos;); return false"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318im_/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/images/2004_07_artsmap-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="199" border="0" p="" align="right" hspace="5"></a><b>First stop:</b> <strike>The Main Stage @ 1pm</strike> Beer Tent @ 12:50pm</p>

<p><b>Second stop:</b> The Main Stage @ 1pm for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.theponys.com/" target="_Blank"><b>the Ponys</b></a><br>
We&apos;re curious about this band, we&apos;ve heard around town they&apos;re worth checking out and if nothing else we&apos;ll be in prime spots for the segue into our...</p>

<p><b>Third stop:</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.thefieryfurnaces.com/" target="_Blank"><b>the Fiery Furnaces</b></a> (also @ the Main Stage, 2pm)</p>

<p><b>Fourth stop:</b> back to the Beer Tent for approximately one hour while trying to decide what to do about the next bands. You see, they have put <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.tvontheradio.com/" target="_Blank"><b>TV on the Radio</b></a> up against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.thefeveronline.com/" target="_Blank"><b>the Fever</b></a>. This causes Gothamist much confusion. Personally we think we&apos;ll be sticking with a favorite of ours, the Fever, but if you want to check out both you probably could as TV on the Radio goes on at 4 (Main Stage), and the Fever goes on at 4:30 (Stillwell Stage)</p>

<p><b>Fifth stop:</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.electricsix.com/" target="_Blank"><b>Electric Six</b></a> @ 530pm (Stillwell Stage). Gothamist knows nothing about this band except the fact that very recently Steve-O from MTV&apos;s <i>Jackass</i> has declared war on them. Actually his band, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.steveovideo.com/fanclub/jerks.asp" target="_Blank">Wild Boyz, has asked that anyone in attendance at their shows throw eggs at the stage</a>. </p>

<p><b>Sixth stop:</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.blonde-redhead.com/" target="_Blank"><b>Blonde Redhead</b></a> @ 6pm, the Main Stage. </p>

<p><b>Seventh stop:</b> It&apos;s a good thing our absolute favorite man in the entire world is up next, as we would surely pass out from exhaustion (read: beer drinking, sun soaking, egg tossing...) at this point if this wasn&apos;t the case. 8pm, Main Stage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/" target="_Blank"><b>Death Cab for Cutie</b></a>.</p>

<p>Post Seventh-stop Gothamist will be attempting to get an interview with Ben Gibbard for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203014318/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/archives/2004/07/13/madison_strays_in.php" target="_Blank"><i>Sets and the City</i></a>. Wish us luck. </p>
