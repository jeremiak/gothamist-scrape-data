<p>Drones are terrifying tech creatures that are watching us from above. Sometimes, along with your deepest of secrets, they capture the world&apos;s beauty. Below, check out the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905043031/http://gothamist.com/tags/drone">drone</a> video, which explores the edges of Manhattan. </p>

<p>Note: one Reddit commenter says it&apos;s not a drone video at all, that it was filmed via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905043031/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/386gfi/edges_of_manhattan_by_drone_in_4k_resolution/crsz9ti">a quadcopter</a>. But who cares? It&apos;s still pretty, even if it&apos;s soundtracked by Avicii.</p>
