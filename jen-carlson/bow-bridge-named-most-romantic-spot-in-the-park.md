<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426145446/http://centralparknyc.org/love">Central Park Conservancy</a> asked New Yorkers to pick the most romantic spot in all the park, and today they unveiled the winning location: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426145446/http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/bridges-of-central-park/bow-bridge.html">Bow Bridge</a>. <em>Can&apos;t you just hear Johannes Brahms playing right now?</em> </p>

<p>The bridge was given its name because of its resemblance to a violinist&apos;s bow... or maybe Cupid&apos;s bow? The CPC also notes that it was built in 1862 and designed by Central Park co-designer Calvert Vaux and his assistant Jacob Wrey Mould; it&apos;s the second-oldest cast-iron bridge in the United States; it spans sixty feet across the Lake&quot; ... and it&apos;s most likely in a lot of engagement photos. In fact, while beautiful, it&apos;s sort of clich&#xE9;, no? The people who find this spot <em>the most</em> romantic are probably the same people who had Monet&apos;s &quot;Water Lilies&quot; hanging in their college dorm room. So, leaving the confines of Central Park, where do<em> you</em> think the most romantic spot in Manhattan is?</p>
