<p>DUMBO is just so picturesque, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s <em>so</em> photogenic, in fact, that Hollywood keeps coming back, much to the chagrin of residents. Because who wants to look out of their million dollar luxury converted warehouse condo window to see celebrities! Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412155907/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/15/dtg_dumbofilming_2011_4_15_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that the locals are getting restless, and want their streets back, saying &quot;Hollywood couldn&#x2019;t have picked a worse time to spotlight their hot area, what with chunks of Water Street blocked off to accommodate construction, street reconstruction and water main work.&quot;</p>

<p>There <em>has</em> been a lot of filming in the neighborhood lately; Gothamist HQ is located in the area, and it seems like there are new crews around every week (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412155907/http://dumbonyc.com/category/dumbo-in-media/">all the signs</a>), but they never seem very invasive. At least not <em>complaint-box-worthy</em>. However, those who use 4-wheels to get around have a different opinion&#x2014;area man Frank Connolly told the paper, &#x201C;Give me a break. Enough is enough; tell &#x2019;em to go back to TriBeCa.&#x201D; </p>

<p>If they must stay in DUMBO, he says the filmmakers should be paying for people&apos;s parking spaces during filming. And he wants the city to consider the area as &quot;movie-burdened&quot; and tell Hollywood to back off for a while (as they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412155907/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/02/filming_fades_to_black_in_south_wil.php">did in Williamsburg</a> in 2009), noting that with the warm weather on its way, &quot;we are about to get hammered.&#x201D;</p>
