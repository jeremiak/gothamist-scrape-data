<p>On this week&apos;s <em>America&apos;s Got Talent</em>, brother and sister duo Aaralyn and Izzy shocked judges and viewers when they ripped into their original song, &quot;Zombie Skin,&quot; sung exactly in the style we&apos;d imagine Carol Anne from <em>Poltergeist</em> would have sung it if that movie were a musical.</p>

<p>While older brother Izzy was wearing a skull t-shirt, 6-year-old Aaralyn dressed in a decoy outfit of pink and polka dots, surprising everyone when she belted out the first note.</p>

<p>They got about one minute into the song when Howard Stern stopped them, explaining, &quot;I was afraid your voice was gonna blow out.&quot; But they made it through the to the next round, and will be headed to Vegas with the show for an encore performance, where hopefully they&apos;ll play their other single, &quot;Lullaby Crash.&quot;</p>
