<p>This summer Brooklyn artist Leon Reid IV <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150716/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/fyi_you_cant_dress_up_nyc_statues_t.php">launched a Kickstarter</a> to support his project: dressing up the George Washington statue in Union Square as a tourist. At the time, the Parks Department said they didn&apos;t allow dressing up public statues... yet today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150716/http://blog.vandalog.com/2011/09/tourist-in-chief-to-go-ahead-this-saturday/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Vandalog+%28Vandalog%29">word comes in</a> that it&apos;s all happening this weekend. That&apos;s right, this Saturday George will be donning an &quot;I &#x2665; NY&quot; hat, a subway map, and local shopping bags... but like all tourists he&apos;s only here temporarily, leaving around 8 p.m. that night.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150716/http://www.leonthe4th.com/upcomingprojects/tourist.html">Reid says</a> his project, called Tourist In Chief, aims to: </p>

<p>1) Reflect the cultural atmosphere of Union Square.<br>
2) Make George Washington more relatable to the public.<br>
3) Educate the public about Washington&apos;s role in NYC history.</p>
