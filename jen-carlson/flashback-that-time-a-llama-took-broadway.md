</div></div>					<p>Happy Friday... here are some photos of a llama cruising around West 44th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110725/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/koclv/llama_goes_to_broadway/">Redditors noticed this vintage photo</a> of the llama, taken by Inge Morath in 1957, when Judy Holliday was starring in &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110725/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Xf6fusFmg">Bells Are Ringing</a>&quot; at the Shubert Theater... <em>but where was s/he going?</em> </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to a commenter, we now know this photo was from a LIFE magazine shoot, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110725/http://www.ingemorath.org/index.php/2010/05/a-llama-in-times-square-1957-2/">read more about here</a>. The llamas name was Linda, and she was on her way to make a television appearance at ABC!</p>
