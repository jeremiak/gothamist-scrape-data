<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/let_your_rogue_one_anticipation_run.php">latest installment</a> in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe officially hits theaters on Friday, December 16th. But <em>really</em> it hits theaters the night before. That&apos;s how movies work sometimes! Who knows why they do this. (Hype.) But the first night of a <em>Star Wars</em> movie hitting theaters is something to behold&#x2014;remember when it happened last year? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/do_they_know_things_lets_find_out.php">Good times</a>. Remember when it happened in the &apos;70s? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://laist.com/2015/12/17/star_wars_line_1977.php">Even better times</a>. Remember those first lines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/1980s_star_wars_nyc_line.php">from the 1980s</a>? Wow. Surely the huge fanbase in any given city is larger than seats availalbe, right? Apparently not anymore. </p>

<p>&quot;Wait, there are still opening night <em>Rogue One</em> tickets available?&quot; My colleague Nell Casey was surprised this morning to find out that yes, there are. She bought tickets for SATURDAY, like a sucker. (Now is a good time to remind you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/may_the_force_shut_you_up.php">STFU during these screenings</a>.)</p>

<p>As of right now, here&apos;s where you can still see <em>Rogue One</em> FIRST: <br>
</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/ipic_movies_review_seaport.php#photo-1">iPic</a> has seats left for their 10:45 and 11:15 screenings (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/https://www.ipictheaters.com/#/movieinfo/location/15/movieid/HO00001394/moviedate/20161215/seo/More%20Movie%20Times">tickets here</a>)<br>

</li><li>Cobble Hill Cinemas has tickets for 7, 7:30, 8, 10:15, 10:40, and 11:10 p.m. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://www.starwars.com/films/rogue-one">get tickets here</a>)<br>
</li><li>This list could go on forever, so please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://www.fandango.com/site-index/theaters/ny.html">check your local theater here</a> and, as of right now, you&apos;ll probably find a ticket for opening night</li></ul><p></p>

<p>And on that Friday, remember to send us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040535/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/19/a_guide_to_the_best_worst_star_wars.php">your hot takes</a>.</p>
