Tonight you can catch them on this coast, where they&apos;ll be doing a show at Joe&apos;s Pub in support of their latest release <em>Mentor Tormentor</em>. Do you want to go? Email us at <strong>GothamistContest(a)gmail dot com</strong> and let us know -- the winner (who we&apos;ll choose by noon) will get two tickets. For now, get to know the leader of the band, Aaron Espinoza.</em> </p>

<p><strong>What can fans expect from the new album?</strong><br>
On this new record, you&apos;ll hear what happens to Earlimart when they are given a lot of time to make a record after having listened to the Carpenters and Depeche Mode for a spell.  Also they can expect to hear what happens when &quot;the girl&quot; pipes up. </p>

<p><strong>Earlier this year you played at the Getty with an orchestra, how was that? Can we expect more shows like this in the future?</strong><br>
It was 4 string players. I think you will see more of us with the string Dream Team.  We love them, and now we&apos;re getting spoiled, being able to play our stuff live the way we always had hoped it could sound.  </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything special in store for the Joe&apos;s Pub show?</strong><br>
Well, the String Dream Team will be there with us, in reference to the last question. </p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the biggest difference you&apos;ve noticed between the New York music scene and LA music scene?</strong><br>
I don&apos;t know much about the scenes, especially in New York. I know they exist, and I&apos;ve heard that we&apos;re a part of the LA one, but when you&apos;re living day to day in a place making music, it&apos;s not like some obvious thing that you&apos;re aware of. I think when you get right down it, scenes usually start with a group of incestuous musicians and clubs and journalists who all know each other and go to see and play shows together. Is that what it&apos;s like in New York? Cause that&apos;s kinda what it&apos;s like in LA.</p>
