<p>The club has been around since WWII, and was at one point a staple stop in New York&apos;s nightlife circuit. Having already had to move three times, finding a new home isn&apos;t something new for owner (since 1976) John Juliano, who says, &quot;Like anything else in life, you&apos;re born and you die. We&apos;ll try to find another spot by the fall.&quot;</p>

<p>This most recent Copacabana was a three-floor space on the West Side of Manhattan, a replica of the original. &quot;The hottest spot north of Havana&quot; lived up to it&apos;s reputation back then, with Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin being the kings of the Copa. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195034/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana_(nightclub)">Wikipedia</a>, the historic walls of the first also saw &quot;Harry Belafonte get banned in 1944, for being African American. He was in the U.S. Navy at the time, and was denied entry with a date (he returned in the 1950s as a headliner at the club).&quot; The AP recalls that:</p>

<blockquote>The original was the scene of a memorable 1957 brawl involving New York Yankees stars Mickey Mantle and Billy Martin, and eventually became a disco in the mid-1970s.

<p>&quot;In the &apos;40s and &apos;50s, every star possible appeared at the Copa,&quot; Juliano said. &quot;You had to play the Copa if you wanted to get anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Copa II was opened in 1992. The current Copacabana, which caters to the hip-hop and salsa crowds, opened on West 34th Street in 2001.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>You&apos;ve probably seen it in movies, too, the first Copa (which was on E 60th St) was in <em>Goodfellas</em>, <em>Raging Bull</em> and <em>Tootsie</em>. Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195034/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueX7XsmKjsY">this classic scene</a> from the former, makes us wonder if it&apos;s moved so far away from what the original was, if it&apos;s worth reopening again. Imagine what Studio 54 would be like if it tried to keep the original feel alive for all ths time. </p>

<p>It will reopen, though (most likely by October), and it&apos;s not closing down because of a rent hike or condos...this time it&apos;s to make way for a subway. It was condemned when the city decided to extend the 7 train. As of now, a possible move to the Bronx has been mentioned, of which the owner said, &quot;It would kill me, but what are you going to do?&quot;</p>
