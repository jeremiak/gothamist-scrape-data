<p>Remember when you could buy a donut in Williamsburg for a buck? Then they started calling them <em>doughnuts</em> and adding hibiscus or some shit and the price went up to 3 bucks. Well now Chef Bj&#xF6;rn DelaCruz of Manila Social Club has risen the douche bar all the way up to $150. <em>For a donut that you will consume in under 2 minutes.</em> </p>

<p>His latest creation has Patr&#xF3;n in it and looks like a piece of jagged scrap metal. </p>

<p>On his inspiration behind selling a $150 donut, we are told: &quot;Bj&#xF6;rn was looking to up the ante after the success of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093145/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/05/gold_donut_williamsburg.php">their viral Golden Cristal Ube Donut</a>&#x2014;and what&#x2019;s more precious than gold, Platinum. He created a limited edition, uber-luxury donut...&quot; Okay we&apos;ve heard enough.<br>
 <br>
DelaCruz&apos;s latest attempt at food virality is described as a &quot;rose petal donut filled with cream and a spicy ginger-jalapeno margarita jelly, covered in a sweet tequila frosting, and then finally topped off with sheets of edible silver and platinum.&quot; Each donut is about 6-inches, which comes to about $30 an inch (an amount of money that could get you six donuts at Doughnut Plant).</p>

<p>If you would like a donut that tastes like a Spring Break hangover, you&apos;ll have to put in a special request during the week of Cinco de Mayo (which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014093145/http://www.manilasocialclub.com/donuts">do here</a>). </p>

<p>If you got this far, we regret to inform you it gets worse: he&apos;s calling it The Patronut... and the people of New Williamsburg are actually going to buy it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> We are now told that the proceeds from the donut&#x2014;which will only be offered for one week&#x2014;will go to the American Cancer Society.</em></p>
