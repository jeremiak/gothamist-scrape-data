                            <p>Galapagos officially changed hands <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306183123/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/galapagos_moves.php">earlier this year</a>, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306183123/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/01/matthew_roff_so.php">Matt Roff</a> &amp; Co. now at the helm. With the Galapagos name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306183123/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/30/galapagos.php">moving to DUMBO</a> and the artspace under new ownership, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306183123/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/15/name_that_space.php">a contest</a> to name the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306183123/http://www.70north6th.com/">70 N 6th Street</a> space (after briefly working under the name Natural Selection). Well, they&apos;ve finally come to a decision (drum roll please): Public Assembly. Roff tells us that they&apos;ll also be holding the official after parties for the McCarren Pool Parties there, which start this Sunday (check out the full lineup for the McCarren Pool free shows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306183123/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/28/mccarren_park_p_1.php">here</a>).<br>
