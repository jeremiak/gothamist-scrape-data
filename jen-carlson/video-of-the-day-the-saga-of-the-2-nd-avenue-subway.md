title: Video of the Day: The Saga of the 2nd Avenue Subway

										<p>Believe it or not, there was once a time when the subway was celebrated! Channel 13 just launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140914094100/http://video.thirteen.org/">a video site</a> hosting their visual vault of old shows. The below is from a program that originally aired in 1975, and in part shows the 1870 attempt at an underground transit system. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140914094100/http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/beach.html">The Beach Pneumatic Transit</a> was a demonstration line secretly built by <em>Scientific American</em> editor Alfred Ely Beach. He constructed the 312-foot tunnel in 58 nights, unbeknownst to those above ground, and once complete it was unveiled to the masses. What they found underground wasn&apos;t just a subway, but a ballroom of sorts -- complete with grand piano. Fancy! The glory days didn&apos;t last long though, and the program&apos;s main focus is on the much less celebrated 2nd Avenue subway, a story that couldn&apos;t differ more from the small success of Beach&apos;s line.</p>

<p>The &apos;70s saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140914094100/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/09/video_groundbre.php">three 2nd Avenue groundbreaking ceremonies</a>. Just last year we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140914094100/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/12/second_avenue_s_5.php">the latest groundbreaking</a> in the still ongoing saga, and we wonder how many more we&apos;ll have this decade. History, after all, does tend to repeat itself. </p>
