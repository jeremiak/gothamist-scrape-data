Adam&apos;s penis, however, is worn golden, due to all the... handling. <p></p>

<p>Passerby have been spotted stopping, touching, rubbing and taking photos with the bronzed genitalia&#x2014;allegedly for luck, for laughs, and of course for new Facebook profile photos. The center&apos;s general manager, David Froelke, says, &#x201C;We have an art dealer that comes in and redoes the patina from time to time, but it doesn&#x2019;t last very long.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Froelke added, &#x201C;In looking at my shoppers coming into the Time Warner Center, there&#x2019;s so much hustle and bustle that if I can do something to slow the experience down and make it more pleasurable, I&#x2019;m doing something to make their day a little bit better.&#x201D; Whatever helps, New York.</p>
