<span class="photo_caption">504-506 Broome St. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530063418/http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/changing-new-york#/?tab=about">Berenice Abbott</a>/NYPL)</span></p>

<p>Now that we live in the future, it&apos;s so much easier to travel back to the past. The New York Public Library has done a fantastic job with their digital collections database, and it just grew by 180,000. At least, that&apos;s how many images are now part of their easy to navigate hi-res collection&#x2014;all with no known U.S. copyright restrictions, and all available to you to spend hours and hours clicking through. </p>

<p>The collection, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530063418/http://nypl.org/publicdomain">view here</a>, includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530063418/http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/changing-new-york#/?tab=about">Berenice Abbott&apos;s iconic documentation</a> of 1930s New York for the Federal Art Project&#x2014;you&apos;ve likely seen many of her photos before, spanning all over the city during that decade. Like Abbott&apos;s photos, many of these images were available previously, though could only be downloaded at lower resolutions, if at all.</p>

<p>The treasure trove of material is clearly filled with the rare and unique, and the library is encouraging &quot;novel uses of its digital resources.&quot; So if you want to go beyond, note that they are now &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530063418/http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/fellowships-institutes/remix">accepting applications</a> for a new Remix Residency program. Administered by the Library&apos;s digitization and innovation team, NYPL Labs, the residency is intended for artists, information designers, software developers, data scientists, journalists, digital researchers, and others to make transformative and creative uses of digital collections and data,and the public domain assets in particular. Two projects will be selected, receiving financial and consultative support from Library curators and technologists.&quot;</p>

<p>They&apos;ve introduced new projects themselves, as well, including a then-and-now comparison of Fifth Avenue, &quot;juxtaposing 1911 wide angle photographs with Google Street View.&quot; You can check that one out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530063418/http://publicdomain.nypl.org/fifth-avenue/">here</a>, but don&apos;t click through until you have a couple of hours to spare.</p>
