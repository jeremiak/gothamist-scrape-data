										<p>Tomorrow morning the Straphangers Campaign and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz will meet again, this time to hold a &#x201C;mock funeral&#x201D; for the M and R trains. They say, &quot;Without new state aid, the MTA is proposing to eliminate parts of these subway lines, while also raising transit fares.&quot; They&apos;ll be grieving at the Court Street subway station in downtown Brooklyn mid-morning. When asked what was going on with the R, we were told: &quot;NYC Transit is going to shutter 5 stations on the line between 11 pm and 6 am.&quot; Tomorrow&apos;s ceremony follows the farewell to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407002302/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/z_train.php">the Z train</a>&#x2014;yet still, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407002302/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/mta_may_eliminate_w_train_among_oth.php">the W</a> is getting nothing but disrespect!</p>
