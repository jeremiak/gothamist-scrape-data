The story goes like this: Greenberg procured a vintage owl pendant for then editor-in-chief Bensimon to wear for photo shoots, and together they promptly made a deal to manufacture a replica of the design. Trouble is, those verbal agreements are always so tricky. Greenberg is now filing a lawsuit that claims Bensimon &quot;cut Greenberg out and went ahead and manufactured the pendant on her own,&quot; which she currently sells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142301/http://kellykillorenbensimon.com/jewelry.html">for $325</a> and has been happily hawking the piece during her <em>Real Housewives</em> screen time.</p>
