										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="0210walgreens.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101024904im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0210walgreens.jpg" width="240" height="160"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a hef="http://www.flickr.com/photos/digiart2001/3196277904/">digiart2001</a></span></i></div> Would you rather have a Walgreens or a Duane Reade on every block? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101024904/http://www.wcbs880.com/MANHATTAN--Walgreens-is-Buying-Duane-Reade/6380399">Word is</a> that the former is buying the latter for around $1.075 billion. While there aren&apos;t too many details yet (a press conference is being held today), the Duane Reade name <em>will</em> remain in place&#x2014;so when the switch officially happens around August, you won&apos;t feel a thing.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101024904/ttp://www.marketwatch.com/story/walgreens-to-acquire-new-york-based-drugstore-chain-duane-reade-2010-02-17?reflink=MW_news_stmp">According to Marketwatch</a>, the acquisition gives Walgreens a leadership position, but Duane Reade will continue its brand identity &quot;while accelerating Walgreens Customer Centric Retailing initiative in urban markets.&quot; There are 257 Duane Reades in NYC, and there are 70 Walgreens; a decision will be made on how to &quot;harmonize&quot; the brands over time.  </p>

<p>The new corporate overlord, Walgreens President and CEO Greg Wasson, says, &quot;Duane Reade is a compelling strategic acquisition that will immediately provide Walgreens with a leading position in the largest drugstore market in the U.S.&quot; It just all sounds so, <em>evil</em>.</p>
