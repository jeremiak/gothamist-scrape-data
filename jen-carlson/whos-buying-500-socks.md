One New York PR girl told the paper, &quot;They last forever, and they look amazing and feel comfortable. If you think about all the times you buy cheap socks and six months later they have holes in it, these don&apos;t.&quot; But... these crocheted socks <em>come with holes</em>, and besides, the editor of <em>Elle</em> warns, &quot;The open-toe [shoe with] sock trend is very season-specific, and by the end of the fall, the trend is most likely to look dated or pass&#xE9;.&quot;</p>
