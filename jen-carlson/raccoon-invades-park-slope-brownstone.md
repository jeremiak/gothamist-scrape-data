Either way, this story might put the fear in some Brownstone-dwellers. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194514/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/">FIPS</a> reader sent in this photo with an equally crazy story; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621194514/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/attack-of-the-raccoons.html">head over here</a> for the full tale, but to summarize: the raccoon is calling from inside the building! </p>

<p>This kitchen is on the 3rd floor of a brownstone, in which the same tenants live on the 3rd and 4th floors. When one of them awoke, they came upon this scene&#x2014;as well as a huge mess in the kitchen. They believe the raccoon got in by making a hole in the screen of a nearby window. The horrible thing is, this raccoon in the photo isn&apos;t trying to get out of the silverware drawer, it actually <em>died trying to</em>. The tenants said, &quot;it must have gotten its head out and then suffocated as it couldn&apos;t get its body out. So, the raccoon was dead by the time we &#x2028;got up in the morning and its body was still in the cabinet.&quot; Oh, but it gets ever more sad! &quot;In the morning, its baby was outside on the fire escape sleeping! My landlady got a pest control company to remove the raccoon while we were at work and we haven&apos;t seen the baby again.&quot;</p>

<p>That orphaned raccoon will now spend the rest of its life seeking revenge, either that or it also died and its ghost will spend eternity haunting brownstones.</p>
