										<p>The NY Times is reporting that both hipsters <em>and</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2007/01/29/blipster_really.php">blipsters</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/arts/music/07just.html?_r=2&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin"> like Justin TImberlake</a>. Of course, there&apos;s been a long history of indie holding hands with MTV pop stars. We recall numerous covers of Britney Spears &quot;Toxic&quot;, Kelly Clarkson&apos;s &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://dailyrefill.blogs.com/daily/files/since_u_been_gone.mp3">mp3</a>) and more recently Gnarls Barkley&apos;s &quot;Crazy&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://dailyrefill.blogs.com/daily/files/Crazy.mp3">mp3</a>). It&apos;s about time we all embraced JT! </p>

<p>The Klaxons recently covered Justin Timberlake&apos;s &quot;My Love&quot;, you can find that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://i-was-there.blogspot.com/2007/01/myths-of-near-overdose.html">mp3 here</a>, and Rock Plaza Central covered &quot;Sexy Back&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhO9qkB0YXQ">video here</a>).  </p>

<p>Of course, nothing beats the original, hear the boy belt out his tunes on BBC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/presents/justintimberlake/">right here</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://myoldkyhome.blogspot.com/2006/10/justin-timberlake-bbc-radio-1-maida.html"><em>via MOKTB</em></a>). And last night he brought Andy Samberg out to MSG for a live rendition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180658/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dmVU08zVpA">SNL&apos;s &quot;Dick in a Box&quot; digital short</a>!
