---


                            
                            
                            
                            <p>Thank you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141411/https://twitter.com/#!/julieklausner/status/142263001033097216">Julie Klausner, Ted Leo, and WFMU</a> for unlocking the door to this amazing dog disco that existed somewhere on television in 1979&#x2014;a year that was so clearly superior to all others. There is so much joy in this 31 seconds of vintage video (the dog couple doing a spotlight dance, <em>the close-up zoom on wagging tails</em>!). The only description given says: &quot;Hot moves at Kibble&apos;s Korner in NYC, circa 1979,&quot; and The Google Machine isn&apos;t really giving us much in terms of finding out more&#x2014;but who really cares where it came from, the important thing is that our eyes can see it, over and over and over again, and without the use of LSD:</p>

<p>Do you think this is what goes on at that late night canine dance club that opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140110141411/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/03/new_late_night_dance_club_caters_to.php">earlier this year</a>? If so, cancel all of our plans for the weekend... and we&apos;re going to need to borrow someone&apos;s dog.</p>
