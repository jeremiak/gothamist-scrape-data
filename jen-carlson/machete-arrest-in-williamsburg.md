										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpWUR4D7PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140802001801im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpWUR4D7PM.jpg" width="350" height="196" class="image-left"> </span>This morning we received an email regarding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140802001801/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/18/machetes_and_kn.php">another machete incident</a> in South Williamsburg. The tipster wrote: &quot;I witnessed a young man in handcuffs being pulled out the bodega near the corner of South 4th and Bedford at about 9:45 last night, the bodega next to Papa Lima sandwich shop.  After he was placed into a police van, a police officer walked out of the bodega holding a machete.  </p>

<p>&quot;I heard from some people in the neighborhood that some machete-wielding kids ran into the bodega and raised hell. Ambulances arrived on the scene and EMT&apos;s were directed towards the corner of South 3rd and Bedford, where a small crowd was gathered.&quot; </p>

<p>This corner seems to be particularly troublesome; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140802001801/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/18/the_gangs_of_williamsburg_return.php">just last month</a> there was a pipe fight <em>and</em> an incident where a kid was caned at the pizza joint across the street. </p>

<p>We talked to an employee at the bodega this afternoon, who confirmed that there was indeed a machete arrest there last night, but since he wasn&apos;t there at the time, all he could tell us was that he heard it was &quot;crazy&quot; and that &quot;everyone&apos;s been talking about it today.&quot; The 90th Precinct also confirmed that one person was arrested during the incident last night, and was still being held today. Though the officer we spoke to couldn&apos;t confirm it, he did say it was possible it was gang related, and that the police presence on that corner would likely be increased. Sigh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140802001801/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/12/stabbings.php">machete season</a> is upon us yet again.</p>
