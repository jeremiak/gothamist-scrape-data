<p>The third and final chapter in Christopher Nolan&apos;s retelling of the Batman story,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035733/http://gothamist.com/tags/darkknightrises"> <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a>, will hit theaters (including IMAX screens) on July 20th. Warner Bros. just released the latest trailer, which is <em>by far</em> the best glimpse we&apos;ve gotten at the new film.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035733/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_1697466.php/New-full-trailer-for-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-blows-up-online">Monsters and Critics</a>, the story will take place eight years after where we left off, introducing new characters like Selina Kyle/Catwoman (played by Anne Hathaway&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035733/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/05/introducing_anne_hathaway_as_catwom.php"><em>meow</em></a>, etc) and the less sexy but totally creepy Bane (portrayed by Tom Hardy).</p>

<p>Check out the new trailer below, where you&apos;ll also see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035733/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/06/photos_secret_batwing_location_is_a.php#photo-1">the Batwing</a> in action, some of the scenes filmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035733/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/dark_knight.php">near Zuccotti Park</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035733/http://gothamist.com/tags/josephgordonlevitt">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a> as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035733/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0247446/bio">a &quot;hard-nosed Gotham beat cop</a>,&quot; and yes, the Williamsburg Bridge getting blown up (if you look closely, you&apos;ll also see the Manhattan Bridge blowing up behind it).</p>
