<span class="photo_caption">Not a theater person? Clarke gets naked about 14 times during the first episode of Game Of Thrones</span></p>

<p>Not since the infamous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101007/http://classicalmusic.about.com/od/20thcenturymusic/qt/rite-of-spring.htm">Rite of Spring riot</a> of 1913 has the audience itself become the stage upon which one witnesses the total mental and physical breakdown of humanity! Last night at the Cort Theatre, during a preview performance of <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101007/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/here_is_your_new_holly_golightly.php">starring Emilia Clarke</a>, humans once again fell apart beside each other&#x2014;this time it was as they witnessed the <em>Game of Thrones</em> actress disrobe and step into a bubble bath.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101007/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/doff_broadway_8R1KFFft9y0I89zyi5pgUL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">the NY Post</a>, the sight &quot;whipped theater fans into a photo frenzy... Hoping to capture the image of the ravishing actress in her birthday suit, folks ignored Broadway&#x2019;s stringent &apos;no photos&apos; rule and frantically snapped shots on their cellphones. Things got so out of control that management has now beefed up security.&quot;</p>

<p>On the off chance the NY Post was exaggerating the story a teensy bit, we reached out to the production&apos;s publicity team, who confirmed that &quot;it happened,&quot; and they were &quot;not surprised.&quot; Publicist Rick Miramontez gave us this statement, &quot;The bathtub scene in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s</em> is gorgeously done.  Theater goers are reminded that photography of any kind during the performance is strictly prohibited and offenders will be asked to leave the theater.&quot;</p>

<p>The show opens March 20th. And one tip from a theater-goer who has already seen it&#x2014;&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re sitting in the balcony you can see a lot more.&quot;</p>
