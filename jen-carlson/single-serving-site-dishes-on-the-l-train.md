title: Single Serving Site Dishes On The L Train

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ltrainsite0211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221615im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ltrainsite0211.jpg" width="640" height="448" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>This site only has one purpose, to let you know: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221615/http://istheltrainfucked.com/">Is the L Train Fucked?</a>&quot; Currently, and shockingly, the answer is no... but keep refreshing before swiping that MetroCard because this could change <em>at any time</em>. Also, maybe the MTA should invest in these single-serving sites for each of their train lines&#x2014;so easy to update, maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221615/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/02/why_the_l_train_sucks_so_much.php">the robots</a> could even run it.</p>
