title: New Museum Hard On "Big Dick," Kicks Out Artist
---

	
										<p>Below is a clip of artist David Livingston bringing his 6-foot-long absurdist work of art into the New Museum, where he remains for about 30 seconds before being kicked out&#x2014;even though this might be a great addition to the Koons-curated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111122805/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/03/skin_fruit.php">Skin Fruit</a> exhibit currently taking place there. Maybe he should try squeezing through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111122805/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/marina.php">the naked people</a> with it at MoMA?</p>

<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111122805/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2010/03/the-big-dick-visits-the-new-museum-video.html">Bowery Boogie</a> asked him about the project, he said, &quot;I find its childish humor appealing, and I am fascinated by my sudden transformation from anonymous pedestrian to attention-grabbing street performer.&quot; The &quot;Big Dick&quot; (as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111122805/http://davidlivingstonart.com/work/gallery/1036">he calls it</a>) has also visited the Stock Exchange <em>and</em> dared enter stroller territory in Park Slope. Yikes.</p>

<p>Livingston told us this morning that the New Museum was the first time he&apos;d been kicked out of a place, however, adding: &quot;I was disappointed that I didn&apos;t get to look at any art with the dick on.  I feel no animosity towards the guard who asked me to leave.  He was doing his job. I&apos;m annoyed that I actually purchased a ticket... they charged me $8. That seems a bit steep for a student.&quot; When we asked the New Museum what they had against a little pink felt and sofa upholstery, they simply told us: &quot;We support freedom of expression!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A rep for the museum has now added, &quot;it is my understanding that the guest would have needed to coat check the item.&quot;</p>
