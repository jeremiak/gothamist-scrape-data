Tonight that deejay is Ad Rock of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051625/http://gothamist.com/tags/beastieboys">the Beastie Boys</a>, who will be spinning from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051625/http://moma.org/visit/calendar/events/11104">more details here</a>). Bonus: Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre will also be on hand&#x2014;it was just announced that she&apos;ll be collaborating with Horovitz on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051625/http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/05/kathleen-hanna-peaches-team-up-with-ad-rock-on-runaways-tribute/">a Runaways tribute</a>. </p>

<p>Before traveling to midtown, however, travel back to the summer of 1986, when the Beastie Boys were opening up for Run-DMC on their Raising Hell Tour. At the time, <em>Licence To Ill</em> wasn&apos;t even released yet! In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051625/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663023/beastie-boys-hot-sauce-committee-2.jhtml">vintage footage</a> below, they say it&apos;s filled with &quot;14 anthems for youth today,&quot; and it&apos;s &quot;real fun ... kinda like new wave, Euro disco type of stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>The group just released their 8th album, <em>The Hot Sauce Committee Part Two</em>, combined with a star-studded video and short film (watch below) in which they revisit <em>License To Ill</em>&apos;s &quot;Fight For Your Right (To Party).&quot;</p>
