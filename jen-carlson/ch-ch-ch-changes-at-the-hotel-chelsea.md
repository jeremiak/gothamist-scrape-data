<p>Is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190023/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">Hotel Chelsea</a> one step closer to becoming a shell of its former self? A trendy, celeb hot spot, a generic boutique hotel... <em>that</em> kinda thing? You betcha. Hoteliers Andre Balazs and Ian Schrager have both been interested in the property, and may now be entering a bidding war; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190023/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/eviction_fear_grips_chelsea_4WvB0oNSmzFCUeSbF9i6mI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Page Six</a> reports that &quot;several bids are in but no deal has been struck.&quot; A source told the paper that &quot;management has already been whittling down the tenants. They would go in there and get building permits to renovate the rooms and then make them hotel rooms. They aren&apos;t giving out long-term leases.&quot; The source noted that the place will &quot;cost a fortune to overhaul,&quot; and the only way to avoid lawsuits is to buy tenants out in cash. Whoever takes this place over, they better not touch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190023/http://www.bluejake.com/2007/08/sam-on-top-of-the-chelsea-hotel.html">that amazing roof</a>.</p>

<p>Sort of related: if you have managed to stick it out this long and still live at the hotel, <em>and</em> have a piano, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190023/mailto:jencarlson@gothamist.com">contact us</a> asap! Thank you.</p>
