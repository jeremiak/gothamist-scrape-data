</div></div>					<p>Why were there so many abandoned cars and refrigerators in Breezy Point in 1973? <em>We may never know</em>, but here&apos;s an interesting look back at the private little spot&#x2014;located near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004530/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/your_guide_to_rockaway_beach_this_s.php#photo-1">the Rockaways</a>&#x2014;from that era.</p>

<p>A little background: In 1960 Breezy Point was sold to the Atlantic Improvement State Corporation for $17 million, half of that land was then sold to residents who formed the Breezy Point Cooperative. And now, unless you own one of the 3500 homes there, you won&apos;t be able to access the area&#x2014;Breezy is patrolled by a private security force, and most of it is surrounded by security gates. Back in 2008, the NY Times infiltrated the area and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004530/http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/07/24/realestate/20080727_LIVINGIN_SLIDESHOW_index.html">posted this slideshow</a>&#x2014;they&apos;ve come a long way from having auto chassis&apos;s submerged in their water.</p>
