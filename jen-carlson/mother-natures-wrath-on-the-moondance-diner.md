At that time new photos of it in La Barge, Wyoming (the diner&apos;s new home) surfaced, and it wasn&apos;t lookin&apos; too pretty. Well it just got worse for the wear. </p>

<p>With the original sign safe in storage, the new owners still hope to open in May of this year, with the Moondance back to its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235721/http://www.historicmoondancediner.com/news/?p=36">Alan Bushbaum-remodeled glory</a>. Good luck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235721/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/11/moondance_diner.php">Pierces</a>!</p>
