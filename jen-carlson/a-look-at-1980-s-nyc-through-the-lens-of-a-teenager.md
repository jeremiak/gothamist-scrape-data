					<p>Through the magical and bittersweet filter of nostalgia, it&apos;s possible to look back at photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135439/http://gothamist.com/tags/1980s">1980s New York City</a>&#x2014;a decade that followed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135439/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/20_minutes_in_1970s_nyc.php">one of the toughest in the city&apos;s history</a>&#x2014;and think: ah, the good ol&apos; days. Recent transplants will say it, speaking some pseudo-knowledge and pointing to the dearth of combination Chase Bank-Duane Reades on the streets back then. But those who lived it know exactly what they miss.</p>

<p>Native Ken Stein has just shared some of his old photos from the decade with us, taken from 1980 through 1989. Stein was a teenager when he took most of these, and tells us, &quot;The city was different back then. I think it was quieter, the street lights were darker, there was more room to walk and more places to wander&#x2014;often everything seemed new and the different areas of the city were just that; different.&quot;</p>

<p>Stein continued:</p>

<blockquote>Most of those images were shot in 1982 and 83. I was 17 and 18 year old and was the staff photographer for a weekly community newspaper in The Bronx.

<p>These images are part of a larger collection that were shot on slide film&#x2014;a rare luxury for me because it was far more expensive than the black &amp; white I could get and develop for free. Hugh Bell, the famous jazz era and commercial photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135439/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=161264503">who died</a> after Sandy knocked out the electricity in lower Manhattan, was a huge influence on me. </p>

<p>Taking pictures was always thrilling and I loved the way it made me feel. It felt at times I was the only one taking pictures&#x2014;I think that&apos;s why people let me take their photos. It was a rare occurrence and I was bold as fuck back then.</p></blockquote> Click through for a look, and you can check out a few more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135439/https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenstein/sets/1409579/">on his Flickr page</a>.<p></p>
