The paper reports that dog owners who use the run are fighting for a separate area for the small pups to enjoy, away from the bigger dogs that are allegedly attacking them; one owner likens the scenario for the petite pooches as &quot;going up against Muhammad Ali.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Smaller dogs are getting injured <em>and killed</em> in the run and &quot;<strong>once a small dog is in a big dog&apos;s mouth, chances are you won&apos;t be able to save it. That dog will never fetch again</strong>.&quot; One member of the Dog Owners Action Committee says Dobermans and Rottweilers are using beagles and Yorkies as chew toys, and yet Community Board 2 and the Hudson River Park Trust refuse to separate them by providing a second run. The battle has been going on since at least 2007, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150015/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_203/leroyruncrowdedand.html">the Villager</a> reported on the crowded, unsafe conditions there for smaller dogs.</p>

<p>Why? The fat cats are to blame, says one committee member: &quot;The people who make the decisions about this park don&apos;t have to use a dog run because they have a town house with a back yard and a house in the country.&quot;</p>
