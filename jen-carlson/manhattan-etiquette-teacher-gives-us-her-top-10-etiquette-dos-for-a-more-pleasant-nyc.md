<p><strong>1.</strong> Do keep to the right when walking on the sidewalk, except when passing; and always leave room for other pedestrians to pass if you are walking with a group of friends.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Do let others exit elevators, buildings and public transportation before you attempt to enter them.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Do hold doors open for individuals following closely behind you or for someone who may need a little help entering a building or public transportation.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Do give up your seat to someone who may need it more than you&#x2014;the elderly, a caregiver with small children, a woman who is pregnant&#x2014;when you are taking public transportation.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Do be mindful of others when you are talking or texting on your cell phone when you are in public places: Save your private conversations for private locations.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Do be sensitive to others&#x2019; enjoyment at restaurants, movies, or any other performances or cultural events by not talking on your cell phone, keeping your voice low when you are having a conversation, and conducting yourself with a sense of decorum.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Do smile and take time to give tourists directions. (We want tourists to think New Yorkers are polite, friendly, and helpful.)</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> Do eat in restaurants or other appropriate places, such as the park&#x2014;not on buses, the subway, or walking down the street.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> Do show respect for our city streets and public places: Throw your trash in trash cans instead of littering.</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong> Do be polite and use the magic words: Say &#x201C;Please&#x201D; and &#x201C;Thank You&#x201D; to the waitstaff in restaurants, salespeople in stores, and whenever or wherever the situation calls for a &#x201C;Please&#x201D; or &#x201C;Thank You.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And of course, there&apos;s plenty more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092331/http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette">etiquette tips</a> you overachievers can follow.</p>
