<p>A librarian at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104722/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypl">New York Public Library</a>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104722/http://www.nypl.org/locations/webster">Webster Library</a> branch on the Upper East Side is taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104722/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/photos_tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_in.php">the Tilda approach</a> to raise awareness about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104722/http://www.nypl.org/speakout">NYPL budget cuts</a>. She has placed herself on display behind glass, but instead of doing this for Art, Kristy Raffensberger is in the display case &quot;to create awareness of the recently proposed $47 million budget cut. &quot; Once inside, we&apos;re told she &quot;demonstrates the Library&apos;s resources by reading a book, and also waves to patrons and encourages them to sign a letter to their City Councilmember to oppose the significant budget cut.&quot;</p>

<p>Kristy will be behind the glass tonight, and tomorrow afternoon, and plans to return whenever she is able to.</p>
