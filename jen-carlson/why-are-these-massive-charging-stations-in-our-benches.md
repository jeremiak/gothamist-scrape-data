<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090808/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/25/nyc_bench_history_shocker.php">so many classic benches around New York City</a>: you&apos;ve got the World&apos;s Fair Bench (designed by Robert Moses), the Central Park Settee, and the tried and true wood-and-concrete, all little green monuments to the art of sitting. These benches are one of the city&apos;s most simple, historic, and already functional joys&#x2014;can&apos;t we just leave these perfect things alone?</p>

<p>Like those silver eyesores that started popping up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090808/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/01/new_bench.php#photo-1">around 2010</a>, a new bench has arrived to threaten the classics, and this time it&apos;s heralding slick features. The solar-powered smart benches were unveiled today and will come decked out with charging stations. This is what they look like:</p>

<p>The new pilot program will bring five of these smart benches&#x2014;created by Soofa, an MIT Media Lab spin-off&#x2014;to Manhattan and the Bronx&#x2019; Highbridge Parks. They&apos;ll be able to charge your mobile devices and &quot;aid NYC Parks in understanding how many people visit the parks, by counting Wi-Fi enabled devices as they pass.&quot; This data will supposedly help with maintenance schedules.</p>

<p>At a press conference today Rohit T. Aggarwala, Chief Policy Officer of Sidewalk Labs, declared: &quot;The bench is amazing.&quot; We respectfully disagree.</p>

<p>Having charging devices around the city is a wonderful thing, but why attach them to our lovely benches? Here are some alternate suggestions: charging lamppost, charging pigeon, charging hot dog cart, <em>just a totally separate charging tower that stands alone near a regular bench</em>, charging garbage can...</p>

<p>As for whether or not they&apos;ll wipe out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090808/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/25/nyc_bench_history_shocker.php">our classic greens</a>: <em>probably</em> not, but a rep for the Parks Department told us this afternoon, &quot;The pilot program is slated for two years. If successful we will expand the program.&quot;</p>
