<p>A new cafe is opening in Prospect Park, thanks to the Prospect Park Alliance and Baked &amp; Brewed, but... it&apos;s called... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150046/https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/park-map/places-to-eat/tip-of-the-tongue/">Tip of the Tongue Caf&#xE9;</a>. </p>

<p>Will they be serving up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150046/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/09/tongues_inwood_park.php">all of those animal tongues we&apos;ve seen</a> nailed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150046/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/30/has_animal_sacrifice_arrived_in_pro.php">to nearby trees</a>? Probably not? But now that&apos;s all you will think about when you bite into one of their danishes, or whatever. </p>

<p>Prospect Park Alliance, <em>it is never too late to rebrand</em>. Just take a minute and think of a new name. Any name. Any other name will be better than this. No one is going to say the words: &quot;Let&apos;s meet for a quick bite at the Tip of the Tongue!&quot; Seriously, say it out loud to yourselves right now&#x2014;do you truly see this happening? </p>

<p>Turns out that Baked &amp; Brewed actually has a storefront elsewhere in Brooklyn called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150046/http://www.tipofthetongue.net/locations/">Tip of the Tongue</a>, which we never heard of because: see above.</p>

<p>Anyway, the ToTT is now open, and will remain open through Halloween, which seems fitting. But until then, the cafe promises to provide espresso, coffee, house-made pastries, cakes, cookies, sandwiches, salads, and quiches.  Their press released also announced their &quot;signature Tip of the Tongue offerings, like prosciutto sandwiches on Cuban baguettes and bacon-gruyere scones.&quot;</p>

<p>The caf&#xE9;, located at the Park&#x2019;s Long Meadow by the Picnic House, will be open from 8 a.m.- 4 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays, as well as 8 a.m.- 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
