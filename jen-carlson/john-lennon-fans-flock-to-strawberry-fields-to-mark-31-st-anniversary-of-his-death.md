</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s been 31 years since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151636/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">John Lennon</a> was shot outside of his home at the Dakota&#x2014;where his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151636/http://www.life.com/gallery/66931/famous-last-words#index/33">last words</a> were, &quot;I&apos;m shot, I&apos;m shot.&quot; Will you be going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151636/http://gothamist.com/tags/strawberryfields">Strawberry Fields</a> today? Below is a broadcast from ABC News that aired December 9th, where Paul McCartney is heard telling a reporter, &quot;It&apos;s a drag, isn&apos;t it?&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151636/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/06/lennon_1.php">Here are some images</a> of New Yorkers following his death, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151636/http://www.nydailynewspix.com/sales/largeview.php?name=7aa2sk5s.jpg&amp;id=97398&amp;lbx=-1&amp;return_page=searchResults.php&amp;searchDisplay=A&amp;searchAction=advSearch&amp;numFields=1&amp;Button=1&amp;start=345186000&amp;end=345531599&amp;dayFrom=9&amp;monthFrom=12&amp;yearFrom=1980&amp;dayTo=12&amp;monthTo=12&amp;yearTo=1980&amp;location_0=allmeta&amp;value_0=Lennon&amp;bool_0=AND&amp;Button=1&amp;page=0">the Daily News&apos;s coverage</a> from that time. Meanwhile, London&apos;s News Standard called &quot;Lennon&apos;s meaningless murder increasingly typical of New York... where the freedom to carry guns has brought forth monsters.&quot;</p>

I said, &apos;He&apos;s probably asleep by now&apos;. And the car stopped, we got out and it was... really terrible.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this afternoon, Yoko Ono asked that people put their Lennon tributes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151636/http://imaginepeace.com/imagine-all-the-people/john-lennon-tribute?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">right here</a>&#x2014;there are already over 700 posts.
