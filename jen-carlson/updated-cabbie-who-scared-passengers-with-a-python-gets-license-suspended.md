<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> Recently, Jimmy Failla&#x2014;a former, but still licensed cabbie&#x2014;has been promoting his book through a series of videos. In an effort to be Extra Viral, he brought a 14-foot Burmese python into a cab for one of them, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409085831/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/10/worst_cabbie_ever_surprises_passeng.php">surprised screaming passengers</a> as he sat laughing in the driver&apos;s seat. While his publicist assured us the whole thing was real, it turned out that was a lie and there was a snake handler in the car the entire time, a fact that came out after Failla was called out by both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409085831/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/11/snake_cab_peta.php">PETA and the TLC</a> for the prank.</p>

<p>When we had reached out to the TLC at the time of the video&apos;s release, Allan Fromberg told us, &#x201C;This was monumentally poor judgment on the driver&#x2019;s part, and we are clearly going to actively question this person&#x2019;s suitability to continue holding a TLC license.&#x201D; While Failla isn&apos;t a full-time cabbie anymore, he does &quot;occasionally get behind the wheel every now and then for fun,&quot; his publicist told us. But FUN&apos;S OVER funny guy, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409085831/http://www.tmz.com/2014/03/19/snakes-in-a-cab-license-suspended/#ixzz2wQoKfQOj">TMZ reports</a> his cabbie license has been revoked. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&apos;m headlining Taxi and Limousine Commission&apos;s Court Room at 10am and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409085831/https://twitter.com/LevityLive">@LevityLive</a> at 8pm. Free admission to either with promo code &quot;snakes&quot;</p>&#x2014; Jimmy Failla (@jimmyfailla) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409085831/https://twitter.com/jimmyfailla/statuses/446258800538824704">March 19, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Jimmy tells TMZ the Taxi and Limousine Commission yanked his license for two years, but Jimmy is more than ok with it. He says he&apos;s gotten two TV development offers, his stand-up career is taking off and he&apos;s even auditioned for a slot on The Tonight Show. Failla says he&apos;s even been approached by producers to pull the prank in Los Angeles, though he says he&apos;d need a fake taxi.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>And yet only 180,000 views at press time...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Fromberg tells us Failla&apos;s license was NOT suspended (though we see how spinning that way is better for more press!), he says, &quot;We made him aware that we were going to seek revocation, and he surrendered it voluntarily.&quot;</p>
