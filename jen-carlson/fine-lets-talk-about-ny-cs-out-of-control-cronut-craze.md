<p>Last week I sent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/http://www.thehungrymouse.com/2013/05/20/the-cronut-all-hype-or-worth-the-wait/">this link</a> to everyone at Gothamist HQ asking, &quot;Hey, why haven&apos;t we tried cronuts yet?&quot; I didn&apos;t really push for anyone to get them, because do we really NEED sugary, cream-filled, fried croissant-doughnut hybrids on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/is_your_office_filled_with_unhealth.php">our Silver Table Of Sin</a>? Plus, I was pretty satisfied <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/http://gothamist.com/tags/dels">with my Del&apos;s</a>. But ever since then about three cronut stories have been published across the internet per day, <em>at minimum</em>. So, I give up... in case you aren&apos;t already in the grips of the city&apos;s Cronut Craze, here is what you need to know, as well as some other thoughts about cronuts.</p>

<ul><li>&quot;Real&quot; cronuts are sold at ONE PLACE ONLY (until the copycats catch on): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/http://dominiqueansel.com/">Dominique Ansel Bakery</a> on Spring Street.
</li><li>One cronut costs $5.
</li><li>There is a limit: only 6 cronuts per person. Don&apos;t be greedy.
</li><li>By 7:30 a.m., the bakery line is already out the door like this is some kind of goddamn Justin Bieber appearance.
</li><li>If you are an influential food blogger, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/https://twitter.com/kludt/status/339420169665396738">you can get them delivered</a>.
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel">Check Twitter</a> for updates on cronut availability before attempting to pick some up. And also check Twitter for updates on human adults acting irrationally when denied a cronut:</li></ul>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>It is not okay to flip off our baristas because we are out of cronuts. Wtf!</p>&#x2014; Dominique Ansel (@DominiqueAnsel) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/334689996504170497">May 15, 2013</a></blockquote>

<ul><li>When I was little, my family would get glazed croissants every Sunday at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081146/http://anconasmarket.com/">Ancona&apos;s</a>. They were good, addictive, and while not doughnut shaped, basically the same idea&#x2014;the cronut isn&apos;t really new or original you guys, so calm down.
</li><li>And finally, doesn&apos;t this narrator seem too factual and serious to be talking about cronuts?</li></ul>
