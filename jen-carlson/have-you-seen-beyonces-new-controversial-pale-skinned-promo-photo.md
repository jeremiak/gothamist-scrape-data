<p>The latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155731/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonc&#xE9;</a> news isn&apos;t about Baby Blue or the Carter family&apos;s VIP stay at Lenox Hill Hospital. Today the performer is making headlines for a photo she&apos;s using to promote her latest album, which like her previous (and controversial) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155731/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2087388/Beyonc-white-skin-row-Controversial-photo-shows-singer-looking-shades-lighter-usual-tone.html">L&apos;Oreal ad</a>, makes her look very... white. Whiter than this photo of her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155731/http://poponandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Beyonce-Chris-Martin.gif">with the lead singer of Coldplay</a> makes her look, even.</p>

<p>The photo is currently running on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155731/http://www.beyonceonline.com/">her website</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155731/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/beyonce-heat-pale-skinned-photo-promoting-latest-album-article-1.1007367">the Daily News</a> notes that she&apos;s getting slammed for the pale-skinned, blonde-haired promo shot. Some say it&apos;s just the bright lighting and not Photoshp at all (she <em>has</em> been accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155731/http://www.wendymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/beyonce-white-skin.jpg">lightening her skin</a>). Either way, critics are calling her out, saying &quot;whitewashing&quot; is a damaging message to send. One declared, &quot;I think in a lot of ways she&apos;s culpable because there&#x2019;s history there. She&apos;s not saying explicitly you have to lighten your skin, but it does carry that inherent message.&quot;</p>

<p>One documentarian, who put out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155731/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1966396/"><em>Dark Girls</em></a> last year, told the paper, &quot;Beyonc&#xE9; is doing what she needs to do to be accepted worldwide and keep those sponsors happy. What does something like this do for a young girl who&#x2019;s so impressionable... that&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201D;</p>
