										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="norahjonesbk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911035350im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/norahjonesbk.jpg" width="250" height="200" class="image-left"> </span><em>Finally</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911035350/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/mark_of_klyn_big_bad_brother_K9TOsBhIiiSw59rpq7lGaP">the Post&apos;s</a> Andrea Peyser weighs in on Windowgate, the ongoing controversy starring Norah Jones&#x2014;who had the <em>audacity</em> to install windows in her new Cobble Hill home. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911035350/http://gothamist.com/tags/norahjones">Catch up here</a>.) She got 7 of her 10 windows after fighting the Landmarks Preservation Commission regarding their <em>archaic</em> ways, and now the Grammy winner has her natural light. But Peyser says her win &quot;is a warning to the aging Italian-American population that remains in gentrifying Carroll Gardens.&quot; </p>

<p>Word is there&apos;s now a move to expand the entire neighborhood into a historic district, which would give landmark status to all houses... and the old timers are not happy about this kind of gentrification preservation! Pizza-parlor owner John Esposito points out, &quot;Not everyone here is a doctor or lawyer or singer with an endless amount of money.&quot;</p>

<p>That kind of landmarking sweep could prevent anyone from making cost-friendly repairs; and Michael Di Meglio, a member of Citizens Against Landmarking, simply says: &quot;We don&apos;t need Big Brother to protect us.&quot;</p>
