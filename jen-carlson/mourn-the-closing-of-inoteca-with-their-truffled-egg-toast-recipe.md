<p>You guys, the Lower East Side restaurant &apos;inoteca is closing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525222819/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/02/inoteca_to_shutter_after_service_this_saturday.php">this Saturday</a>. Some people are very sad about this, claiming their version of the LES is dead. But that is silly, this place was actually a gentrifier of the neighborhood, and of all the things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525222819/http://gothamist.com/tags/riples">that have been shuttered</a> there and all the changes we&apos;ve seen in its landscape and residents, this charming little eatery did not actually define the LES, ever, for anyone. &apos;Inoteca is closing, and we can let it go. But wait... they were the ones that served that amazing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525222819/http://www.yelp.com/menu/inoteca-new-york-4/item/truffled-egg-toast">truffled egg toast</a>, weren&apos;t they? Shit. </p>

<p>Luckily, you can make their mouthwatering signature dish at home... if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525222819/http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/food/articles/2010/06/02/recipe_for_truffled_egg_toast/">the people of Boston</a> are to be believed, here&apos;s the recipe (which we have adjusted a bit for authenticity): </p>

<ul><li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil
</li><li>12 spears asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
</li><li>1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
</li><li>Salt and pepper, to taste
</li><li>4 slices (each 1-inch or more thick) Pullman white bread
</li><li>8 eggs
</li><li>4 ounces Italian fontina cheese, thinly sliced
</li><li>2 tablespoons white truffle infused oil (also called truffled olive oil), or more to taste</li></ul>

<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Chop up the asparagus into 1/2 inch sections, and in a skillet over high heat cook them with some olive oil (stirring often, for 2 to 3 minutes). Remove and sprinkle with lemon juice and salt. Toss those on a plate (or rather, 4 plates).</p>

<p>Next toast the bread before placing it on the baking sheet, then use a small spoon to make an indentation about 2 1/2 inches long and 1 inch wide in the center of each slice of bread. Make the well about 3/4-inch deep, making sure not to cut through the bottom. Drop an egg yolk into the wells you just made, then lay the cheese on the bread (but not directly over the yolks). Bake for around 5 minutes, place these beautiful things on top of the asparagus, drizzle truffle oil over them, and voila!</p>
