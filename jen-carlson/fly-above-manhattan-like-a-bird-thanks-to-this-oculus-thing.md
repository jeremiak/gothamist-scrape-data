<p>Let&apos;s face it, most of us, maybe even all of us, will never ever fly above Manhattan like a bird. However, there is something that will allow us, one and all, to fake it.</p>

<p>Through June 7th, the Museum of the Moving Image will rig you up to a contraption, with visuals powered by an Oculous headset, so you can kind of feel what it would be like. Their virtual reality exhibit, called Birdly, will bring you over the skyscrapers and tenements of Manhattan, in 3-D. It will look like this, but a million times cooler once you&apos;re all strapped in: </p>

<p>The folks at Audubon, naturally, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606121916/http://www.audubon.org/news/be-next-birdman">have tried it out</a> and written up a very convincing reason to head over there:</p>

<blockquote>This is reality&#x2014;or simulated reality, at least. I&#x2019;m connected to Birdly, a new flight simulator that enables its pilots to imitate an elegant bird of prey, the Red Kite. Along with the simulator&#x2019;s aerial views and audio to recreate the sound of wind, touch technology reacts to the precise pressure and tilt of a user&#x2019;s hands and arms&#x2014;&#x201C;allowing you to fully embody a bird,&#x201D; says Michel Zai, a media artist and Birdly&#x2019;s CEO. Touting all of its sensory bells and whistles, Birdly comes close to making this universal fantasy come true. </blockquote>        

<p>You&apos;ll even get to experience something the Red Kite won&apos;t ever experience, since it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606121916/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kite">not native to these parts</a>!</p>

<p>Birdly is on view as part of the exhibition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606121916/http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2015/04/18/detail/sensory-stories-an-exhibition-of-new-narrative-experiences/">Sensory Stories</a> (curated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606121916/http://futureofstorytelling.org/">the Future of Storytelling</a>), which features seventeen projects that offer new ways of telling stories using new immersive technologies or other creative experiments that engage sight, hearing, touch, and smell. Five of these are virtual reality. You can test out Birdly on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays during public hours.</p>
