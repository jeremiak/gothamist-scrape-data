<p>Earlier this year a Brooklyn cafe called The End, sister shop to Montauk Juice Factory, introduced a frothy blue drink called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/this_is_the_end_my_friend.php">the Unicorn Latte</a>. It was the next logical step into the unfortunate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/https://news.northeastern.edu/2017/05/the-business-of-unicorn-food/">Unicorn Food trend</a>, which takes perfectly fine food and makes it less edible but <em>more</em> Instagrammable. At the time, they told us: </p>

<blockquote>It is named the Unicorn Latte as the drink is meant for you to fly high and tap into your inner mystical, powerful self. The latte is made with E3 live, a potent blue green algae which decalcifies the pineal gland.This is a gland many ancient cultures believed was the seat of your intuition. The pineal gland is calcified by stress and modern toxins, including our water, and when it&#x2019;s calcified, it makes it harder to access. Decalcifying the gland can lead to extreme mental clarity, and helps one restore health and vibrancy to the physical body.</blockquote>

<p>It did not taste good. It tasted like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/this_is_the_end_my_friend.php">warm juice</a>.</p>

<p>Later this year, Starbucks introduced a Unicorn Frappuccino. They explained:</p>

<blockquote>The elusive unicorn from medieval legend has been making a comeback. Once only found in enchanted forests, unicorns have been popping up in social media with shimmering unicorn-themed food and drinks. Now Starbucks is taking the trend to a new level with its first Unicorn Frappuccino&#xAE; blended beverage... made with a sweet dusting of pink powder, blended into a cr&#xE8;me Frappuccino with mango syrup and layered with a pleasantly sour blue drizzle. It is finished with vanilla whipped cream and a sprinkle of sweet pink and sour blue powder topping.</blockquote>

<p>Some say it tasted like &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/19/internet_pans_unicorn_frappucc.php">molten clown</a>,&quot; others <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/19/unicorn_frappuccino_review.php">got sick</a> to their stomach, and Stephen Colbert called it &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/21/colbert_unicorn_frapp.php">a sugary affront to God</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>And now, in a battle with a zero winner outcome, The End is suing Starbucks, claiming &quot;the idea of a brightly colored, multi-flavored drink was theirs,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/http://www.tmz.com/2017/05/04/starbucks-sued-unicorn-frappuccino-unicorn-latte-brooklyn/">according to TMZ</a>. The lawsuit states that The End &quot;filed paperwork to own the name in January,&quot; and they want Starbucks to pay up, and also &quot;stop using Unicorn on its drinks.&quot; Same.</p>

<p>The suit also states: &#x201C;The size of and scope of Starbucks&#x2019; product launch was designed so that the Unicorn Frappuccino would eclipse the Unicorn Latte in the market, thereby harming [The End] and confusing their customers.&quot; </p>

<p>Even worse, the The End <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616085553/http://nypost.com/2017/05/04/brooklyn-cafe-claims-starbucks-stole-their-unicorn-drink/">claims</a> Starbucks&apos; product resulted in brutal hashtag appropriation: &quot;Starbucks&#x2019; products began appearing on social media labeled with the hashtag #unicornlatte, online publications began referring to Starbucks&#x2019; products as Unicorn Lattes, and [The End&#x2019;s] Unicorn Latte&#x2014;while still occasionally mentioned&#x2014;was reduced to an &apos;also ran&apos; anecdote to Starbucks&#x2019; Unicorn Frappuccino.&quot; </p>

<p>Starbucks says the lawsuit has no merit. We&apos;ve reached out to The End for comment and will update if we hear back. And the unicorn would still like a goddamn Scotch, please. </p>
