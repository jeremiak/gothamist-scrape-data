                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0209momagate.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0209momagate.jpg" width="640" height="214" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/24/poster_boy_hits_momas_subway_ads.php">of Tuesday</a>, Doug Jaeger of HappyCorp was cleverly wording his comments about his and Poster Boy&apos;s involvement in the alteration of MoMA&apos;s subway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/03/moma_targets_locals.php">ad campaign</a> in Brooklyn, which he developed. According to Jaeger, he met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/posterboy_street_artist.php">Poster Boy</a>, who he says is more than one person, and that he and some others were in the subway system the night the ads were deconstructed.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://www.nypost.com/seven/02262009/news/regionalnews/moma_art_wreck_o_157009.htm">The NY Post</a>, not a fan of Poster Boy&apos;s work in the past, chimes in today saying that Jaeger has &quot;admitted his responsibility in the bizarre publicity stunt,&quot; refused to pin any of it on Poster Boy (who is already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/10/poster_boys_day_in_court.php">facing charges</a>), and allegedly didn&apos;t have MoMA&apos;s permission to carry out the vandalism. In a statement released yesterday MoMA said, &quot;The museum deplores any kind of vandalism and we are distressed that this happened, did not condone or authorize it and hope it doesn&apos;t happen again.&quot; (In other words, they love it, it&apos;s drawn even more attention to their campaign, but they can&apos;t <em>say</em> that because it&apos;s totally illegal.)</p>

<p>The museum is keeping mum about their current relationship with HappyCorp, and the fact that they haven&apos;t severed ties with them has the MTA &quot;furious,&quot; according to the Post. While we haven&apos;t heard back from Jaeger about the latest developments, we talked to Jeremy Soffin at the MTA, who told us that even if MoMA and HappyCorp altered <em>their own ads</em> it is still illegal, and that &quot;designing an ad doesn&apos;t give him any more right to vandalize than anyone else.&quot; The MTA&apos;s contractor CBS Outdoor is currently in contact with both parties on the organization&apos;s behalf.</p>

<p>While it seems pretty evident that this was the plan all along, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/02/agency_says_van.php">the Village Voice</a> is still questioning why the HappyCorp folks went from being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://thehappycorp.com/words/index.php/2009/02/16/underground-art-enjoyed-by-all/">so proud</a> of the installation to vandalizing it. Maybe they were just tired of seeing Starry Night? The subway station isn&apos;t a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153353/http://www.dorm-room.com/starry-night-poster.html">dorm room</a>, after all.</p>
