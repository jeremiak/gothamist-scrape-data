<p>Gary David Goldberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055219/http://laist.com/2013/06/24/gary_david_goldberg_creator_of_fami.php">died in California at 68 years old yesterday</a>&#x2014;he had been suffering from brain cancer. While he may be best known for the beloved <em>Family Ties</em>, the writer and producer also had <em>Spin City</em>, a short-lived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055219/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101055/reviews">but celebrated</a> semi-autobiographical show called <em>Brooklyn Bridge</em>, and a hour long drama called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055219/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092326/"><em>The Bronx Zoo</em></a>. Let&apos;s look at his NYC-centric shows... Goldberg was, after all, a native New Yorker. In the below video he bullet points his life story: he was born at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, became a waiter at the Village Gate, and met his wife, a Pan Am stewardess, before moving to Berkeley and eventually getting in to showbiz.</p>

<p><strong>THE BRONX ZOO</strong><br>
Goldberg created this hour long drama, which ran for two seasons, airing on NBC from 1987 to 1988. The show focused on a Bronx high school, with Principal Joe Danzig (Ed Asner) at the helm. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055219/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLksfPrvuIU">Here&apos;s an episode</a> featuring a young Cuba Gooding Jr. </p>

<p><strong>BROOKLYN BRIDGE</strong><br>
This show aired on CBS between 1991 and 1993, and centered on a Jewish American family living in mid-1950s Brooklyn, partially based on Goldberg&apos;s childhood. The show won a Golden Globe for Best TV Comedy, and got 12 Emmy nominations... but it still got cancelled after just two seasons. As Goldberg said himself: &quot;Welcome to television.&quot;</p>

<p>While the series was due to come out on DVD in 2010, the release was later delayed indefinitely, and it&apos;s hard to find it anywhere online. </p>

<p><strong>SPIN CITY</strong><br>
<em>Spin City </em> focused on a fictional local government running New York City, and originally starred Michael J. Fox as Mike Flaherty, the Deputy Mayor of New York (to Barry Bostwick&apos;s Mayor). Fox was replaced by Charlie Sheen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055219/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/arts/charlie-sheen-delivers-a-new-spin-to-spin-city.html">in 2000</a> when he left due to his worsening Parkinson&apos;s disease. The show lasted a couple more season, and was eventually cancelled in 2002.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the pilot, which first aired on ABC on September 17th, 1996. In it, Fox tells the team, &quot;It&apos;s gonna be a long day people, we got garbage in the streets, we got a weather report calling for temperatures in the mid-90s with no breeze. By 11 o&apos;clock the city&apos;s going to smell like a giant foot. People are going to be hurling themselves into the East River.&quot;</p>
