They&apos;ve also dished on the eccentric board president, O. Aldon James. While outsiders see high-brow events and black tie parties, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519230451/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110125/murray-hill-gramercy/national-arts-club-board-gets-housing-for-steal-tax-filings-show">DNAInfo</a> reports the organization may be deteriorating under the allegedly increasingly erratic James.</p>

<p>At the center of the intrigue is the club&apos;s landmarked Tilden Mansion, at 15 Gramercy Park South. Apparently some of the apartments in the mansion have been rented out by James, including an 800-square-foot, 2-bedroom to his twin brother, John... for just $356 a month! Other apartments have seemingly become secret hoarding spaces for the brothers, as a series of photographs show. One previous renter, author Lucy Grealy, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519230451/http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/neighborhoods/features/2984/">NYMag</a> in 2000 that <strong>the NAC is &quot;like if David Lynch made a movie of a Henry James novel.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Board members and employees also discussed James&apos; recent behavior, noting that he&apos;s recently been firing people &quot;out of the blue,&quot; and one member of the board&#x2014;who has tried and failed to get James to hand over financial records regarding the 40 apartments&#x2014;claimed, <strong>&quot;Our president has gone from eccentric to totally crazy.&quot;</strong> There are some who stand by him, however, and commend him for maintaining the &quot;soul&quot; of the place. One such man told the website, &quot;In some ways, people think we&apos;re the greatest place since chopped liver. Others think, &apos;What a loony bin.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Loony bin or not, it <em>does</em> look like we may have a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519230451/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/26/flashback_the_collyer_brothers_nys.php">Collyer Brothers</a> on our hands. A former employee says, <strong>&quot;It&apos;s a fire hazard and health hazard to the club. If these guys keep doing this for 10 more years, that building will be destroyed.&quot;</strong> (And won&apos;t someone think about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519230451/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/01/19/2010-01-19_lifes_a_big_tweet_for_bird_lover_prez_of_posh_gramercy_club_tends_to_his_flock.html">the birds</a>!)</p>

<p>While it&apos;s unclear when all the photos were taken, there are a few that are definitely from the past couple of years. An FDNY inspection last year yielded violations for obstructed hallways and exits, however the building was not deemed unsafe.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the club&apos;s PR firm, and will update with any new information we receive.</p>
