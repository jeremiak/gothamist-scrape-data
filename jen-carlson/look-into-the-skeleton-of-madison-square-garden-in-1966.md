Everything is new, and it&apos;s clean. The people are filled with hope. New York City is in decay. But Madison Square Garden&#x2014;it&apos;s the beginning of a new city on a hill.&quot; Don Draper said that in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003901/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, and it remains one of the nicest things anyone has ever said about Madison Square Garden. And Don Draper was fictional.</p>

<p>That photo is of the 4th (and current) incarnation of Madison Square Garden, as photographed from atop the New Yorker Hotel in August 1966. It&apos;s the beautiful shell of the concrete beast we know now. </p>

<p>The Garden opened on February 14th, 1968, but not after some resistance. As you may remember from <em>Mad Men</em>, or real life, there wasn&apos;t much public approval of the design, which called for tearing down the street level portion of Pennsylvania Station; a beautiful Beaux-Arts structure that called for dramatic entrances and long farewells. The opposition&apos;s outcry was so loud that it led to the creation of our city&apos;s Landmarks Preservation Commission. Of course, at that point they couldn&apos;t save the station, which had already been torn down... FOR THIS garbage: </p>
