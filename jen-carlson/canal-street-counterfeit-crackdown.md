										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:270px; "> <img alt="2009_12_canalst.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618132758im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_12_canalst.jpg" width="270" height="211"> <br> <i>From a reader via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618132758/http://gothamist.com/contribute">Contribute</a></i></div> Yesterday morning the crackdown on counterfeit rings on Canal Street continued, just as vendors are surely hitting a busy time of year with fake designer handbags being purchased as holiday gifts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618132758/http://www.1010wins.com/Cops-Take-Down-Alleged-Counterfeit-Ring-in-Chinato/5847437">1010Wins</a> reports that &quot;police raided a block of Canal Street off Broadway including 10 buildings and 30 stalls. During the raid, police said they also found secret rooms inside the buildings where dealers allegedly conducted business.&quot; Everything from knock-off Chanel bags to Tiffany-esque jewelry was confiscated. <p></p>

<p>The area has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618132758/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/26/canal_street_under_skywatch.php">under skywatch</a> for some time. Bloomberg says, &quot;We&apos;re just not going to have any tolerance for people selling knock-offs. It&apos;s not fair to those companies that invest in their brand.&quot; But what about the broke brand-whores? One woman declared, &quot;I can&apos;t afford an $1800 Louis Vuitton bag. When I get it for $60 it&apos;s good.&quot;</p>
