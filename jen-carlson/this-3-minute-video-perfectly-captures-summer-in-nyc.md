<p>Every summer, filmmaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223104014/http://gothamist.com/tags/colbymoore">Colby Moore</a> releases a new video capturing the season. His 2015 homage to summer in the city has just been released, and he tells us it was mostly filmed in Coney Island, Brighton Beach, and Midtown (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223104014/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/14/boundaries_debated.php">wherever that is</a>). </p>

<p>Moore (apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223104014/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/21/east_coastwest_coast_video_tortures.php">a fan of 90-degree days</a> with high humidity levels) says, &quot;Summer here always feels like it&apos;s over before it even really begins, so I wanted to do a quick vignette to capture the sights and sounds before they&apos;re gone for another 8 months.&quot; It is missing a few key sounds, however, like the sound of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223104014/http://gothamist.com/tags/thongguy">Thong Guy</a> snapping on his new yellow gear&#x2014;the official gunshot blast signaling summer&apos;s arrival in NYC.</p>
