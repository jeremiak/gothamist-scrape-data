<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="BLOODQUOTE.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028102321im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/BLOODQUOTE.jpg" width="300" height="245" class="image-right"> </span>Yesterday at least one mother was spotted shielding her babes eyes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028102321/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/photos_boerum_hill_residents_want_t.php">from the bloody scene</a> a creative Boerum Hill homeowner arranged for the Witching Season. But where some winced at the doll massacre, others reveled&#x2014;most people love the gruesome scene, which at most is like, B-movie quality. </p>

<p>We dropped by yesterday, where the owner was shouting &quot;Boo!&quot; from inside at passerby. She later told us, &quot;I don&apos;t want to get into a controversy. If people are bothered and we need to change it, we will. We&#x2019;re artists, every year we do it. This is our fifth year. The kids every year go &#x2018;more blood, scarier!&#x2019; We&#x2019;ve done things that have been more happy/funny, but the kids always come by and they go &#x2018;more blood, more scary&#x2019; and since we put it up two days ago, we&#x2019;ve had nothing but positive comments.&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
The homeowner&#x2014;who declined to give her name&#x2014;also told us that this is nothing new: &#x201C;Last year we did a pumpkin, and he was barbecuing things like this, nobody said anything so we didn&#x2019;t have an issue. We just do it every year.&quot; One year they even set up a Bates Motel: </p>

<p>She added, &quot;We want to be good to our neighbors. if there&#x2019;s any kind of controversy about it, it&#x2019;ll be changed. We don&#x2019;t want to hurt anybody, for goodness sake.&#x201D; Lady, whatever your name is, leave it up! As young poet Miley Cyrus once said, &quot;Forget the haters cause somebody loves ya.&quot; Besides, the only truly horrifying thing about this display is that squirrel&#x2014;WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT SQUIRREL? WHAT DO YOU KNOW?</p>
