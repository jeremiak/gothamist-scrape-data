<p>The City Parks Foundation has officially announced the 2012 season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123118/http://gothamist.com/tags/summerstage">SummerStage</a>, but one thing really stood out amongst the <em>54-page</em> PDF press release we received: over in the Bronx they&apos;ll be doing a re-imagined version of <em>Hamlet</em> set to the music of Pearl Jam. <em>Say what?</em> According to the release, the theatrical concert event, called <em>A King of Infinite Space</em>, will take place on July 13th and 14th in Crotona Park.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Noted playwright Mando Alvarado&#x2019;s modern spin on William Shakespeare&#x2019;s <em>Hamlet</em> places the plot in the Lower East Side for a more relatable take on the quintessential tale of struggling family dynamics, power, and revenge. Fusing the music and themes from American rock icon Pearl Jam&#x2019;s ground-breaking album, <em>Ten</em>, with a gritty Lower East Side dynamic, this concert event relates Shakespeare&#x2019;s 17th century literature to 21st century New York City.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>We are shocked that they didn&apos;t replace &quot;gritty&quot; with &quot;grungy,&quot; given neither is accurate. But moving along, the massive aforementioned PDF file declares the musical big draws at this time to be Big Daddy Kane, Dawes, Bobby Womack, a Blue Note Jazz night with DJ ?uestlove, and Inner Circle. There&apos;s also mention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123118/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/cbgb_music_festival_coming.php">of the CBGB Festival</a>, which looks like it&apos;s been folded into the SummerStage lineup, and will only take place one day, July 7th, starting at 3p.m. (no acts have been announced yet). More additions to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123118/http://www.summerstage.org/">the summer series</a> will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
