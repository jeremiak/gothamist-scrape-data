Marisa Tomei is 50 years old. But a 50 years old that any of us would be lucky enough to look like at 40 years old. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051258/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Tomei#/media/File:Marisa_Tomei_TIFF_2012.jpg">Maybe even 30 years old</a>.<p></p>

<p>Aunt May is about a billion years old. Here is a brief history of Aunt May, from her first print appearance to her appearances on the big screen:</p><ul><li>Aunt May&apos;s first appearance was in print, in Marvel Comics <em>Amazing Fantasy #15</em> (August 1962). Her bio includes &quot;a period of convalescence at a nursing home.&quot;<br>
</li><li>In Sam Raimi&apos;s <em>Spider-Man</em> (2002 - 2007), Aunt May was played by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051258/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365281/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Rosemary Harris</a>. Harris was born in 1927, making her 75 to 80 years old when she played Aunt May. <br>
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051258/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948470/"><em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em></a> (2012 - 2014). Aunt May is played by Sally Field. Field was born in 1946, making her 66 to 68 years old when she played Aunt May.<br>
</li><li>In the upcoming Spider-Man (2017), Aunt May will be played by Marisa Tomei. Tomei was born in 1964, which will make her 53 once the movie hits the big screen.</li></ul>Here is what that looks like visually: <p></p>
