</div></div>					<p>Way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425161216/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/25/worst_subway_station_ever.php">back in 2009</a> the MTA released a list of the worst subway stations after assessing conditions across the city; coming in at #1 was the Seneca Avenue (M line) station in Ridgewood, Queens. At the time, the agency promised that 25 of the stations would get major overhauls sometime over the next 5 years. Well, now that number is up to 29, and <em>allegedly</em> work will start at some stops this year.</p>

<p>Since last November we&apos;ve been contacting the MTA for a progress report on the repairs, sending them photos from the increasingly crumbling Seneca stop; in December we were told by the agency&apos;s press liaison Deirdre Parker: &quot;We are working on platform edges for stations along the line.  I&apos;m checking with our design people to see if there are any plans specifically for Seneca Avenue.&quot; Despite further contact on our end, all we&apos;ve heard since is radio silence.</p>

<p>Well, now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425161216/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/24/2011-01-24_29_stations_in_qns_bklyn_bx_to_get_makeover.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+nydnrss/ny_local+%28NY+Local%29">the Daily News</a> reports that the MTA&apos;s &quot;Passenger Station Renewal Program&quot; is almost sort of underway! The paper reports, &quot;In addition to Hunters Point and Seneca, the other stations targeted in the next four years or so are: Fresh Pond Road and Forest, Knickerbocker and Central Aves. on the M line; 80th, 88th, 104th and 111th Sts. and Rockaway and Lefferts Blvds. on the A line; Ditmas and 18th Aves., Bay Parkway and Avenues I, P, U and X on the F line; Sutter, Saratoga, Rockaway, Pennsylvania and Van Siclen Aves and Junius St. on the No. 3 line; Middletown Road and Buhre, Zerega and Castle Hill Aves. on the No. 6 line.&quot; </p>

<p>Hurrah! Well, not so fast, they also note: &quot;The work will inconvenience riders for extended periods of time.&quot; We&apos;ve contacted the MTA for all the gritty details. In the meantime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425161216/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> photos of your own crumbling station and we&apos;ll put together an uplifting photo gallery.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Parker tells us, &quot;Since the project will probably not begin until later this year, it is too early to determine what the service changes will be at this time.&quot; She is tracking down a possible start date, and we&apos;ll update when/if we hear back.</p>
