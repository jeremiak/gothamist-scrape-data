<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810063611/http://gothamist.com/tags/madisonsquaregarden">Madison Square Garden</a> continues to undergo renovations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810063611/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a> has been dominating the spotlight in Brooklyn. But recently one Brooklyn resident, the Beastie Boys&#x2019; Mike D, stopped by The Garden to check out the transformation and visit with the workers.</p>

<p>His visit aired on the MSG Network&apos;s &#x201C;The Garden Transformed: Year 2,&#x201D; a five-part series that is documenting the top-to-bottom transformation. During his time back inside the arena, he reflected on the band&apos;s first show there, saying, &#x201C;First time we played here it was opening for Madonna. We never dreamed that we&#x2019;d get to walk in the employee entrance and The Garden. Then, of course, once we got on stage, we got booed a lot.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course, the Beastie Boys later became well acquainted with the venue, and Mike D says they always had &quot;sweaty palms about the prospect of playing in this building. Every time we came here we&#x2019;d get chills because this is where we grew up, this is where I saw my first sporting event. Even if you didn&#x2019;t grow up in New York, you grew up with awareness of so many incredible events that happened here.&#x201D; And even though now he&apos;s got a hyped-up arena closer to home, don&apos;t expect him to turn his back on his original home team&#x2014;he says &quot;throughout a big part of our lives, it&#x2019;s always been the Knicks.&quot;</p>

<p>During his visit he also talked about the late, great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810063611/http://gothamist.com/tags/adamyauch">Adam Yauch</a>, who directed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810063611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome;_I_Fuckin%27_Shot_That!">groundbreaking Beastie Boys concert documentary</a> at the arena: &#x201C;For MCA it was a huge deal to play here and to be in this building, and every time we&#x2019;d tour, one of his only questions was &#x2018;do we get to play The Garden?.&#x2019; That was obviously something very hard to go through, losing a great person and a close friend, but the love that New York showed as a whole, people on all kinds of levels opening up and doing incredible tributes. That would have meant a lot to him.&#x201D;</p>

We&apos;re told that Mike D will be back at the Garden tonight, rooting for his Knicks. And during their game against the Brooklyn Nets he&apos;ll get interviewed&#x2014;so if you&apos;re in the house, you may hear some friendly trash-talking.</p>

<p><em>The episode of &quot;The Garden Transformed&quot; with Mike D will air after post-game coverage tonight, around 10:30 p.m. on the MSG Network.</em></p>
