										<p>Recently there have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212843/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/video_how_not_to_react_to_a_rat_in.php">more videos</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212843/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/video_rat_in_subway_car_crawls_over.php">than we&apos;re comfortable with</a> showing rats riding the subway (one didn&apos;t survive the close encounter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212843/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/30/video_man_steps.php">with straphanger</a>). And now, the latest, comes with a twist. This time the rat was brought on to the train <em>on purpose</em>, and sits on the lap of its owner, feasting on a shared plate of pasta... as fellow passengers react with both shrieks and laughter.</p>

<p>The rat guy (it&apos;s unclear if it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212843/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/10/sad_rat_man.php">this man</a>) compares himself to Naked Cowboy, and explains that people shouldn&apos;t freak out when they see a rat on the train, because,&quot;when they&apos;re in the house and they got rats in their house they don&apos;t run. They be like I see motherf*ckers in my cereal again you need to put more traps down.&quot; MTA, put more traps down please.</p>
