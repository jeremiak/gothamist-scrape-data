<p>Everyone is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326002325/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2007/12/brooklyn-bridge-park-work-to-start-with.html">buzzing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326002325/http://curbed.com/archives/2007/12/20/brooklyn_bridge_park_work_will_start_with_demolition.php">about</a> the Brooklyn Bridge Park development today. The latest is that the project (which has been stalled time and time again) could begin next month as a wrecking ball tears down a piece of the area&apos;s history. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326002325/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2007/12/20/2007-12-20_new_waterfront_park_coming_soon.html">The Daily News</a> reports:</p><blockquote>If approved today, the $18 million construction phase would include the demolition of the historic Purchase Building [pictured] and the removal of portions of five piers, officials said.<p></p>

<p>&quot;This is the first major step in constructing this park, and we&apos;re very proud to be moving forward,&quot; said Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corp. President Regina Myer.</p>

<p>The Purchase Building, built with federal Work Projects Administration funds in 1936, had been used as a temporary headquarters for the Office of Emergency Management following 9/11, when its Manhattan office was destroyed.</p>

<p>Supporters of the $150 million park plan believe the landmarked building would bisect the park, interrupting its continuity and blocking views of the river.</p></blockquote>We&apos;ll be damned if we let some historic building block our view of the pristine East River! Of course, the Landmarks Preservation Commission voted to demolish the building in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326002325/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/nyregion/19land.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">February of 2006</a>, so it shouldn&apos;t come as a shock, despite the fact that protesters and preservationists have tirelessly fought against that decision.<blockquote>&quot;It&apos;s further evidence that the [Empire State Development Corp.] cares so little about what the community thinks,&quot; said Judi Francis, president of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Defense Fund. &quot;All parties, for and against the project, have wanted to preserve it because it&apos;s a landmark.&quot;</blockquote>What will replace the historic landmark? An ice skating rink. And &quot;the piers will eventually be home to basketball and handball courts, a rolling landscape called Prospect Hill, soccer fields, playgrounds and a promenade.&quot; Word should be in soon if the demolition/construction will be taking place next month, and the Park may even be ready this decade.<p></p>
