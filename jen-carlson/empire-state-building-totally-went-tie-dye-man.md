(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150026/https://www.nyhistory.org/web/default.php?section=support_nyhs&amp;page=grateful_dead_ticket_form">A benefit</a> with Dead members Phil Lesh and Bob Weir will be held in the city tomorrow.) Some readers certainly came through with some fantastic photos of the lights last night &#x2014; some including trippy photo tricks, and psychedelic Photoshopping. Enjoy!</p>
