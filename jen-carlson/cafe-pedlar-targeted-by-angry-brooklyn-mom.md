title: Cafe Pedlar Targeted By Angry Brooklyn Mom

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="pedlar0410.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231225620im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/pedlar0410.jpg" width="250" height="250"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Inside Cafe Pedlar</span></i></div> Earlier today someone forwarded us along the latest complaint from the Brooklyn parenting camp, this one aimed at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231225620/http://cafepedlar.com/">Cafe Pedlar</a> in Cobble Hill. <p></p>

<p>The inexplicably traumatized woman wrote, &quot;I wanted to warn others so that they don&apos;t have to experience that I did this morning. Our family have been regulars of the Cafe Pedlar since they opened... This morning I went in like normal... I was drinking my coffee and feeding my daughter some fruit and yogurt that I had brought with me, when one of the employees came over to tell me that the owners are now enforcing a policy that prohibits outside food&#x2014;baby food included, and I either needed to stop feeding my daughter or leave. I was so embarrassed, sad and to be honest, a little angry. To enforce this type of policy at a coffee shop that is so often frequented by parents and families just seems over the top.&quot;</p>

<p>Really, <em>the nerve</em> of an establishment wanting to stay in business! We called Pedlar and spoke to an extremely friendly employee, who told us they have always had a no-outside-food policy (again, maybe because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231225620/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/25/the_mysteries_of_coffee_peddlar.php"><em>they sell food</em></a>, including fruit, which is what this woman was feeding her child)&#x2014;but as far as babies and children were concerned, breastfeeding is allowed and if parents can be discreet with snacks for their children, they can give it a shot. This sounds more than reasonable to us, which has us wondering if Brooklyn breeders are just running out of things to stand on their soapboxes about.</p>
