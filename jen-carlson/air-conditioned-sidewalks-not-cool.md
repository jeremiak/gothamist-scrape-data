<p>Last year City Councilwoman Gale Brewer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232739/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/17/still_legal_for_frosty_stores_to_ha.php">proposed a bill</a> that would fine establishments $200 per open door/window in air conditioned spaces (as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232739/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/26/west_village_re_2.php">heated spaces</a> in the winter), the bill wasn&apos;t fully backed by the Bloomberg administration and never saw the light of day...until now! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232739/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08132008/news/regionalnews/pols_put_heat_on_city_biz_124256.htm">The NY Post</a> reports that the environmentally friendly bill is now supported by Bloomberg and &quot;is expected to win council approval tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>The bill has a couple of exemptions, for restaurants with outdoor seating and small stores (under 4,000-sq-ft). Those who aren&apos;t exempt and who <em>are</em> found luring customers in with cool air will first be issued a written warning, it isn&apos;t until they are found committing the act again within 18 months that the fines come down (after the second notice it gets raised to $400). Brewer notes some of the positive outcomes, saying: &quot;Hopefully, it will prevent the brownouts and the blackouts. If we are serious about our planet, this is just one small way that you can contribute.&quot;</p>

<p>Those against the bill aren&apos;t <em>necessarily</em> anti-green, but they are against the &quot;nanny-state mentality&quot; and placing restrictions on businesses. And as one employee as Sunglass Hut in Times Square said, &quot;Having the doors open increases business. It does wonders for us. I feel like they should find a between solution to the energy crisis.&quot; However, Eric A. Goldstein (a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council) told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232739/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/nyregion/13ac.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;The only group that should be opposing this sensible legislation is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232739/http://www.opec.org/">OPEC</a>.&quot;</p>
