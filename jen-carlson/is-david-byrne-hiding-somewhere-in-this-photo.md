<p>David Byrne was present when this above photograph was taken, but can you see him in it? Photographer Chris Buck, whose show <em>Presence</em> runs through Sunday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111752/http://foleygallery.com/exhibitions/focus/chris_buck_presence">at the Foley Gallery,</a> has hidden the former Talking Heads frontman from the viewer.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;In <em>Presence</em>, Buck plays with our celebrity-obsessed culture and delivers portraits of some big names:  Robert De Niro, David Lynch, Cindy Sherman, Judd Apatow... only, they aren&#x2019;t in the picture.  Or are they?  Taken over a five year period, each photograph is titled by the sitter, but none of them appear in the frame.  Actually, they do... we just can&#x2019;t see them.  They are hiding, somewhere in the composition.  You have our doubts?  So did I.  Along with each photograph is a signed witness statement, testifying that indeed the sitter is present and in the photograph.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>While on other assignments to shoot these celebrities, Buck would ask them to be a part of this project that turned into his latest exhibit, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111752/http://www.amazon.com/Presence-Invisible-Portrait-Chris-Buck/dp/3868283072">his first book</a>. Here he is talking about the idea, alongside some clips from the shoots:</p>
