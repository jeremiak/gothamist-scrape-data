Watch in horror and hilarity as, one by one, the characters in the Bard&#x2019;s best comedy fall prey to flesh eating, blood gurgling zombies. It&#x2019;s the sort of thing that could end up funnier in theory than practice, but J. Jordan assures us in his amusing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103758/http://www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/12th5728.htm">review</a> that &#x2018;the result is hilarious&#x2026; and really, really, really gross. Really. Gross.&#x201D; Though he cautions that some familiarity with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103758/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night">plot</a> of <em>Twelfth Night</em> is crucial, and urges you to heed the ushers&#x2019; the warning about not sitting in the first rows unless you want to be splattered in stage blood. Also, &#x201C;sit very, very still in your seat or they&apos;ll get you.&#x201D; &#x2013; <em>John Del Signore </em></p><em>
