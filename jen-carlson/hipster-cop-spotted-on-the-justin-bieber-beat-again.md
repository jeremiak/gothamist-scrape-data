</div></div>					<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701134409/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">Justin Bieber</a> continued his promotional tour of New York City with a trip to both Power 105.1 and Z100 to promote his new album. And where Bieber goes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701134409/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/19/evidence_hipster_cop_hearts_justin.php">Hipster Cop follows</a>! (He was into Bieber back when he was busking in Canada, <em>man</em>.)</p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s Tien Mao was on the scene outside of Z100 (located inside of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701134409/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_Avenue_of_the_Americas">32 6th Avenue</a>) after <strike>camping out all night to get Bieber&apos;s autograph</strike> &quot;turning down the wrong block on the way to the subway&quot; and stumbling upon the barricaded Bieber fans. Along with them was a Seersucker suited-up Hipster Cop standing like a cool Buddha in the midst of the tween scream chamber. Mao reports back:</p><blockquote>&quot;I was walking by the entrance to the building, someone ran out and mouthed &apos;he&apos;s coming out,&apos; so I stuck around... He came out of the entrance, people started shrieking... he took photos with his fans and then went towards his car. Some fans seemed to get into a cab with the intent of following him, like in the movies. His car was caught in a light, so fans ran up to it... Hipster Cop saw this and started towards the light, but it turned green before he needed to do anything.&quot;</blockquote>Hipster Cop, unable to do anything more for Bieber, turned to the remaining fans and patted one girl on the head, assuring her: &quot;next time.&quot;<p></p>
