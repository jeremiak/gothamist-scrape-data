To my surprise, I just found out that the owners of the building have decided not to allow Dreamland Roller Rink to continue&quot; in their space on West 21st Street.</p>

<p>According to Staar, Taconic Investment Partners (owner of the building) wanted her out, and their spokesman Pete Krokondelas told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308192324/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/05/06/2010-05-06_coney_island_lola_staars_dreamland_roller_rink_loses_bid_to_renew_lease_at_child.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;We were happy to be part of Dreamland Roller Rink for the past two years, and unfortunately because of the liability we can&apos;t do that this year.&quot; Last year a customer sued the rink after falling.</p>

<p>Currently Staar says she&apos;s searching all over Brooklyn for a new space, preferably with a wooden skating floor. Her rink typically opens Memorial Day weekend... so the clock is ticking.</p>
