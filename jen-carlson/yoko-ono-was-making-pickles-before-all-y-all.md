Certainly doesn&apos;t sound like she was ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170211/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/18/post-beatles_bread_baking_with_john.php">baking bread with her husband</a>, but she does want to remind all of you local young things that while you&apos;re making your pickles, and your fine mustards and whatnot, you weren&apos;t the first to do it! She declares: &quot;Women of the &#x2019;60s made pickles, too, you know. Health food started then.
