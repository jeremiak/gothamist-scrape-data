</div></div>					<p>Artist Leon Reid IV, a Bed-Stuy resident who most recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121626/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/29/george_washington.php">transformed George Washington</a> into a tourist, is aiming to adorn the Brooklyn Bridge next <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121626/http://www.leonthe4th.com/aslb/aslb_frontpage.html">with a massive spider</a>. Reid&apos;s arachnid would cost about $800,000 to pull off, but after seeing his renderings we&apos;d <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121626/http://www.artspire.org/DirectoryDetail/tabid/95/id/1075/Default.aspx">donate</a> to the cause (which kind of reminds us of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121626/http://www.limecontracting.com/EmpireStateBuilding.html">that time in 1983</a> an 80-foot King Kong resided on the Empire State Building). Below he tells us a little more about the project.</p>

<p><strong>What steps have you made to move this project forward, will there be a Kickstarter?</strong> The first step in moving &quot;A Spider Lurks In Brooklyn&quot; forward was to establish a funding platform. To meet that need I&apos;ve partnered with ARTSPIRE, a program of NYFA which acts as my non-profit 501(c)3 conduit. [There will be no Kickstarter] All funds will be raised directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121626/http://www.artspire.org/DirectoryDetail/tabid/95/id/1075/Default.aspx">through ARTSPIRE</a>. It should be noted that all funding sources will be private; we will not seek public sources of funding for this project. All donations to &quot;A Spider Lurks In Brooklyn&quot; are tax-deductible.</p>

<p><strong>What would the spider be constructed of, and how big would it be?</strong> At this stage, the spider is designed to be a vinyl float filled with Helium approximately 60ft long, 30ft wide, 13ft high. Materials and size of the spider may be adapted to satisfy engineering concerns.<br>
 <br>
<strong>How long would you want it to be on the bridge?</strong> I would like the spider to remain on the bridge for two weeks during Halloween season (approximately October 15th through November 1st, 2014). Myself and others believe that &quot;A Spider Lurks In Brooklyn&quot; will be a draw for tourists and consequently bring in business for local restaurants, shops and vendors during its display.<br>
 <br>
<strong>How did you come up with this idea, and would you be open to bringing the spider to a different bridge in New York? Is the Brooklyn Bridge your first choice?</strong> One day in 2008, I was walking on the bridge from Brooklyn into Manhattan with my wife Caroline. Somewhere on the stretch leading up to the Brooklyn-side arches, it hit me; what if a spider crawled through the cables? Could a spider have designed the cable structure? Is this what it feels like to be trapped in a spider web? The idea was compelling enough for me to pursue. The spider could not work&#x2014;visually&#x2014;on any bridge other than the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
