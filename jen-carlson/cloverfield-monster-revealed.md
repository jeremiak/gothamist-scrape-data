Abrams movie, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117203157/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/01/abrams.php">tore up the LES</a> last year, will soon be in the past as it finally hits the big screen this week. <em>Cloverfield</em> (long thought to be just a code name for the movie) will be unleashed this Friday, and is getting some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117203157/http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/archives/2008/01/first_cloerfiel.php">great reviews</a>. But what everyone wants to know is: what does the monster that&apos;s responsible for decapitating Lady Liberty look like? One description from that review: &quot;He&apos;s a fiend that a heroin addict might see in his sleep during his first night in rehab.&quot;</p>

<p>We saw one rendering <a 11="" 20="" 2007="" href"http:="" gothamist.com="" new_cloverfield.php"="">in the past</a>, and now some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117203157/http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/cloverfield-update-fans-draw-the-cloverfield-monster.php">new images</a> have come out. These are by people who have seen the movie already, so are likely to be pretty accurate. We&apos;re hoping this monster isn&apos;t lurking in the depths of the East River waiting to plunge! </p>

<p>Check out some of the images, which are after the jump just in case you want to be surprised when you see it on celluloid.   </p>
