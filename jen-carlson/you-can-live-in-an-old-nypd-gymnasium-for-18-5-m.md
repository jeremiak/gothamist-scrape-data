					<p>Beginning in the early 1900s, the building located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716125924/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240_Centre_Street">240 Centre Street</a> served as the NYPD headquarters. Located between Broome and Grand Streets, the now-iconic building&#x2014;designed by the firm of Hoppin &amp; Koen&#x2014;was completed in 1909, and housed the headquarters from that year through 1973. And now, like so many things, it&apos;s a luxury residential building. This latest incarnation, called the Police Building Apartments, actually came about in the 1980s, and currently one of the most coveted apartments in the landmarked building is on the market for $18.5 million. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716125924/https://www.elliman.com/new-york-city/the-police-building-240-centre-street-5h-manhattan-yzeciqp">the listing</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Architecturally magnificent and visually stunning, the former gymnasium of the classic Beaux-Arts style building was transformed into a stunning contemporary one-of-a-kind 6,600 square foot, four bedroom residence by the famed late architect Charles Gwathmey. It was the only apartment he ever designed from the ground up, and required over four years to complete. The home, comprised of the fifth and sixth floors, seamlessly integrates contemporary aesthetics with modern conveniences all while preserving the integrity of this historical treasure. 

<p>On the main level of this expansive home, a grand entrance foyer with onyx powder room leads to an impressive and massive great room that hosts multiple sitting and dining areas. Limestone floors and subtle Venetian plaster walls are complimented by the soaring 25 foot barrel-vaulted ceilings that are punctuated by three skylights, terra cotta tiling and exposed steel tresses. Through double doors, the kitchen is truly chef&apos;s grade with double Viking wall ovens, Viking Stove, two Traulsen refrigerators, double Miele dishwashers, multiple sinks, a custom Winekeeper and 80+ bottle wine cellar within the adjacent laundry and has a separate staff entrance. Off the kitchen, a private terrace offers...</p></blockquote><p></p>
