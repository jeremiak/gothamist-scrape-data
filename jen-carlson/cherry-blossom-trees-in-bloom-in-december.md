<p>Usually we don&apos;t see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140308/http://gothamist.com/tags/cherryblossoms">cherry blossoms</a> until April or May in these parts... but today the Brooklyn Botanic Garden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140308/http://www.bbg.org/news/autumn_blooming_cherries">is reporting</a> that some of their cherry trees are in bloom right now. Yes, in December! </p>

<p>BBG&apos;s Japanese Hill-and-Pond curator Brian Funke explained that &quot;while it&apos;s common for the everblooming cherry and the autumn-flowering cherry to be blooming in December, it is a bit irregular for Prunus to have so many blossoms.&quot; Usually these trees will bloom in December <em>only if</em> a cold spell is followed by warm weather. He notes that weather permitting, &quot;the blossoming should continue throughout the weekend and into next week.&quot; So get ahead of the spring time rush!</p>
