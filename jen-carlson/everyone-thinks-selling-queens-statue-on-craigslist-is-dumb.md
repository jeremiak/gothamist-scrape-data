<p>Rep. Anthony Weiner&apos;s idea to sell a city owned statue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150759/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/25/this_queens_statue_for_your_lcd_tix_1.php">on Craigslist</a> was a stupid idea, and now the art experts agree! The Triumph of Civic Virtue statue was originally in Manhattan outside of City Hall, but it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150759/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/31/is_this_statue_an_eyesore.php">was banished</a> to Queens in 1941, nearly 20 years after its debut. The statue has gone neglected and is now need of a makeover, but some locals want it banished <em>again</em>, claiming it celebrates domestic violence. (The statue shows a man, civic virtue, conquering the sirens of vice and corruption... by stepping on them.)</p>

<p>An art professor from Stony Brook told the Daily News she&apos;s &quot;more offended by [Weiner&apos;s] little campaign than I am by any of the imagery at all.&quot; And an art history professor from Indiana told them, &quot;It would be unethical and egregiously misguided to dispose of it that way. It makes the people involved look pretty stupid.&quot; Another jab at the Queens folk was taken by a Frederick MacMonnies expert (he created the sculpture in question), who said the whole thing reflects poorly on the borough, which apparently has &quot;no regard at all for American history, American tradition.&quot; (Maybe that&apos;s why nothing is landmarked there!)</p>

<p>Currently the statue has an open invite to come live at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150759/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/green-wood_cemetery_wants_to_offer.php">the Green-Wood Cemetery</a>, where some of MacMonnies family is interred. The statue could cost as much as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150759/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/03/08/2011-03-08_civic_virtues_got_high_price.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+nydnrss/ny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">$2 million</a> to restore.</p>
