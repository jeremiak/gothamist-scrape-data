<p>This weekend, going through some old family photos, I found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045024/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/272733296973205504">this folded up piece of newspaper</a>: a page from The New York Times, October 5th, 1969. My dad, a huge Beatles fan, most likely saved it, though maybe it was my mom who originally tore it out of the paper to show him... she didn&apos;t really like The Beatles, and there was often a battle over the 8-track player in our old family van. It seems the author of the review also had plenty of criticisms about the band.</p>

<p>Nik Cohn makes the 15-minute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045024/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road#Medley">medley</a> on the second side the centerpiece of his review, as it was the only 15 minutes of the album he enjoyed&#x2014;his headline reads, &quot;The Beatles: For 15 Minutes, Tremendous.&quot; And even within those 15 minutes there are problems, according to Cohn, who declares: &quot;Individually, the numbers are nothing special... and some of the lyrics are quite painful.&quot; Here are some other thoughts from Cohn, on one of the greatest albums in history:</p><ul><li>&quot;There was a time when the Beatles&apos;s lyrics were one of their greatest attractions. Not any more. On <em>Abbey Road</em>, you get only marshmallow.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;On <em>Abbey Road</em> the words are limp-wristed, pompous and fake.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;This album is unmitigated disaster.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;The badness ranges from mere gentle tedium to cringing embarrassment.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;On &apos;Oh! Darling,&apos; Lennon flounders in an orgy of gulps, howls and retches, flung together at random.&quot; [Note: Lennon didn&apos;t sing that song, McCartney did.]</li></ul>And that&apos;s not all, he goes on to call the two songs by George Harrison: &quot;mediocrity incarnate.&quot; Those two songs, by the way, are  &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Something.&quot; He says Lennon has sunk to new lows by ripping off not only earlier Beatles tracks, but other musicians as well. He says The Beatles have started to rely on &quot;overkill&quot;&#x2014;something that &quot;ruined their last double-album,&quot; as well. You know, the legendary album commonly known as <em>The White Album</em>? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045024/http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/arts/nikcohn1968.pdf">his review of that one</a>, it was &quot;boring beyond belief&quot; and filled with &quot;profound mediocrities.&quot;<p></p>

<p>You can read all of Cohn&apos;s <em>Abbey Road</em> review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045024/http://www.nytimes.com/library/music/100569lennon-beat.html">right here</a>&#x2014;he finishes off his takedown by declaring: &quot;As it stands, <em>Abbey Road</em> isn&apos;t tremendous. Still, it has 15 fine minutes and, by rock standards, that&apos;s a lot.&quot;</p>
