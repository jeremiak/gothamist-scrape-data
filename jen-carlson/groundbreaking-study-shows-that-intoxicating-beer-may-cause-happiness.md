<p>Researchers in Indiana published their findings yesterday in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, and their big find was that just a tiny sip of beer can cause a pleasurable sensation, before intoxication and before a drop of beer even hits your gut...<br>
just a taste caused a surge in levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. And while the ties between intoxication and the release of dopamine have been known for some time, this study&apos;s results show that intoxication may not even be necessary, just a sip can cause the release. In fact, the study (which took 49 men, from heavy drinkers to those who rarely indulge) involved spraying just half an ounce of beer on the subjects tongues for 15 minutes, never allowing any of them to get wasted.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020754/http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/04/merely-a-taste-of-beer-can-trigger-a-rush-of-chemical-pleasure-in-the-brain/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+smithsonianmag/science-nature+(Science+%26+Nature+%7C+Smithsonian.com)">The Smithsonian notes</a> that &quot;the amount of dopamine release per person wasn&#x2019;t random. People who had a family history of alcoholism showed notably higher dopamine levels after tasting beer as compared to others. But participants who were heavy drinkers but didn&#x2019;t have the family history had merely average dopamine levels.&quot; And almost across the board, everyone involved craved beer more than water after having a taste.</p>

<p>Following a lengthy, one-person study we conducted in our free time over the past decade or two, we&apos;ve concluded that other alcoholic drinks that can make you happy include: wine, whiskey (and whisky), vodka, gin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020754/http://thehairpin.com/tag/qream/">Qream</a>, tequila, rum, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020754/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/maximize_your_lime-a-rita_experienc.php">Lime-A-Ritas</a>, absinthe, moonshine, ether (in a pinch), brandy, ouzo, Zima, wine coolers. But note: feelings of happiness with all of the above may be empty, fleeting.</p>
