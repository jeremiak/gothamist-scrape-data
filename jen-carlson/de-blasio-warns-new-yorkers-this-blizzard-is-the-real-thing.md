<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215359/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayordeblasio">Mayor de Blasio</a> and his team updated the city on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215359/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/watch_this_blizzard_closely.php">this weekend&apos;s snow storm</a> from the beautiful Spring Street Salt Shed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215359/http://www.dattner.com/portfolio/spring-street-salt-shed/">just <em>look</em> at that salt shed</a>!). De Blasio says the forecast is still just a forecast, but all signs indicate a storm a-brewin&apos; which will start Saturday morning and continue through Sunday morning. However, forecasts can change, so be sure to constantly refresh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215359/http://bfy.tw/3qOk">Gothamist.com</a> for updates!<br>
 <br>
The bottom line, de Blasio noted, is that &quot;New Yorkers should be ready for a big storm. Make precautions now. Plan on staying home, taking it easy, stay off the roads.&quot; He warned that people need to &quot;take this very seriously, recognize that this is the real thing&quot;&#x2014;this is particularly important for drivers, and de Blasio issued a hazardous travel advisory for Saturday.</p>

<p>The current National Weather Service forecast predicts 8&quot;-12&quot; of snow, with strong winds and possible coastal flooding. The NWS has already issued a blizzard watch that takes effect at 6 a.m. Saturday. Sanitation Commissioner Catherine Garcia says to expect gale force winds and white-out conditions when driving. And now, some answers to your snow questions:</p>

<p><strong>Will there be...</strong><br>
</p><ul><li><strong>Garbage pick-up:</strong> Most likely there will not be garbage or recycling pick-up on Saturday.<br>
</li><li><strong>School on Monday:</strong> Probably!<br>
</li><li><strong>Subway service:</strong> Hell yes (unless this storms hits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215359/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuI5ZtE3lOI"><em>Day After Tomorrow</em> levels</a>, which is not expected)<br>
</li><li><strong>Alternate side parking:</strong> It will probably be canceled on Monday<br>
</li><li><strong>Sanitation trucks fitted with plows:</strong> ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THEM (this number is higher than last year)<br>
</li><li><strong>Salt</strong>: 303,000 tons of it, thanks to a new $77.5 million dollar snow budget</li></ul><p></p>

<p>And if you&apos;d like to make some extra cash, you can sign up to be a snow laborer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215359/http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/3480/snow-removal-employment">here</a>. You should also help shovel outside of your own building, though de Blasio says he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215359/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/mayor_de_blasio_shovels_his_sidewal.php">taking a break from that</a> this year.</p>
