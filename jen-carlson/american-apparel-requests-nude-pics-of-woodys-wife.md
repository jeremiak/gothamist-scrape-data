After the company used the director&apos;s image (without permission) on one of their billboard campaigns, he filed a $10 million lawsuit saying it damaged his reputation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081634/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/08/woody_allen_calls_american_apparel.php">He called the company &quot;sleazy&quot;</a> amongst other things, and the company retaliated noting that he already tarnished his image when he married his young stepdaughter, Soon-Yi Previn. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081634/http://www.wcbs880.com/Woody-Allen-in-Legal-Battle-with-American-Apparel/4207205">WCBS</a> now reports that &quot;Lawyers for American Apparel have complained that Allen has refused to turn over much of the information they have demanded to prepare for trial. Among their demands were documents concerning any endorsement requests that were withdrawn after the sex scandal with Farrow and Previn became public.&quot; The request included nude photos Allen allegedly took of Soon-Yi Previn&#x2014;but don&apos;t get your hopes up Charney, his lawyers say that request is not relevant to the case.</p>
