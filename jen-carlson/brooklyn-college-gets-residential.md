The school has a little over 15,000 grads and undergrads, with about 99% hailing from New York and 77% from Brooklyn. The school hopes that by adding a dorm, some out-of-staters will flock to Midwood. </p>

Developed by New Brooklyn Development, who have worked on New York University and Pratt&apos;s dorms, the &quot;prospective residents of the dorm would qualify for affordable rent in each of the single-bedroom, two-bedroom and studio apartments.&quot; </p>

<p>The lucky 214 will enjoy an internet cafe, concierge services, a gymnasium, laundry facilities and plasma-screen TVs in each room. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175950/http://brooklynjunction.blogspot.com/2008/03/brooklyn-college-dorm-second-rendering.html">The school&apos;s statement</a> included one piece of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175950/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/04/deciphering_dev.php">developer-speak</a> we actually believe, &quot;We anticipate this development to be highly beneficial to the community in general, bringing new residents and revenue to the area, beautifying the area with greenscaping and plants and, most importantly, the vitality that responsible, hard-working students bring.&quot;</p>
