<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mcbarflier.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202855im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mcbarflier.jpg" width="326" height="350" class="image-right"> </span>In February, everyone shed a tear as Motor City Bar announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202855/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/motor_city_bar_closing_this_spring.php">it would be shutting down</a> for good after nearly two decades. The Ludlow Street bar has gently led many alcohol-fueled patrons into late nights and Lower East Side sunrises, and now they&apos;ve announced their official time of death: June 30th, one week after their big blowout:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;On Sunday, June 23rd, come and celebrate 17 years of sex, drugs and rock n roll with some of the best people you&apos;d ever care to meet. Come and give a long kiss goodbye to the amazing owners, bartenders, dancers, DJs, Detroit memorabilia, and those infamous bathrooms! A big thank you to all those who have lived, loved, laughed, cried, danced, yelled, fallen down, met future partners, found jobs, been inspired, or just generally had a great time in this wonderful establishment these past two decades. To say it will be sorely missed would be an understatement. RIP.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>While the big goodbye takes place on the 23rd, they aren&apos;t handing over the keys until June 30th, and the bar will remain open until midnight of that date&#x2014;go and pay your respects to MCB, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202855/http://gothamist.com/tags/riples">and the rest of the LES</a>.</p>
