										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_amaplet.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922225023im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_amaplet.jpg" width="640" height="168" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Yesterday more court papers were filed for the upcoming American Apparel/Woody Allen showdown, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922225023/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04212009/gossip/cindy/woody_vs__apparel_case_is_heating_up_165405.htm">the NY Post</a>&apos;s Cindy Adams thinks it&apos;s going to get uglier than a Nylon Spandex Micro-Mesh Bodysuit.</p>

<p>To recap: after the retailer used an unauthorized image of Allen on billboards (he won&apos;t even lend his image <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922225023/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/04/21/2009-04-21_where_has_your_love_for_ny_gone_woody_allen.html">to the I Love NY campaign</a>), the director filed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922225023/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/01/woody_allen.php">$10 million lawsuit</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922225023/http://gothamist.com/200a/04/08/woody_allen_calls_american_apparel.php">called them &quot;sleezy&quot;</a> amongst other things. American Apparel&apos;s lawyer Stuart Slotnick, the only one to speak out from the company thus far, has said Allen isn&apos;t worth that kind of money since he &quot;<strong>devalued his reputation by becoming involved with his lover Mia Farrow&apos;s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom he later married</strong>.&quot; Slotnick also may or may not have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922225023/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/15/woody_allen_1.php">requested nude photos</a> Allen allegedly took of Previn, though this was probably just for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922225023/http://www.dovcharney.com/">Dov Charney</a>&apos;s personal collection (unsubstantiated!). </p>

<p>The case goes to court on May 18th, and apparently the defense is prepared to use Mia Farrow&apos;s memoir as proof that Allen has a &quot;clear inability to discuss the value of any endorsement or much else outside the realm of the purely creative,&quot; since Farrow noted he had an &quot;evident lack of familiarity with the most basic details of day-to-day existence.&quot; However, we just got this internal memo that American Apparel sent out to employees this morning, and you guys, everything is going to be okay, &quot;Dov (and everyone else at the company) LOVES Woody Allen.&quot; That, and much more, is explained in the full memo (after the jump).</p>
