There was a bomb squad on the scene and a staging area set up for EMS at South 5th Street.</p>

<p>A tipster wrote in around the same time, saying, &quot;The block of South 3rd between Roebling and Havemeyer is completely closed off &#x2014; there was a manhole cover explosion at about 12:30 a.m., police are saying, and now the area is swarming with police, fire dept., and apparently bomb-sniffing dogs. No one is being allowed to enter their buildings. No one seems to know if anyone was hurt or what&apos;s going on, but there are a lot of emergency trucks and people here.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ll update as soon as we find out about the current situation.</p>
