<p>There is this new website called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011513/http://mydadwasinaband.com/">My Dad Was In A Band</a>, and it&apos;s pretty great you guys. You get a short story about the band, a clip of their music, and what is almost always an amazing photograph to tie it all together. The latest band featured comes from Staten Island, and they&apos;re called Hot Ice. Give a listen:</p>

<p>The son of guitarist Tommy Marcinek told the site: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I can recall the first time I heard my dad&#x2019;s songs. I had never heard anything like it. And at 30 years old I have still not heard anything else quite like it. Its uniqueness is powerful because it encourages the listener to experience music in a different and deeper way.  While not mainstream, they still played Clubs in NYC and Staten Island and had loyal fans.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Other NYC bands include 1980s metal band (also from Staten Island) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011513/http://mydadwasinaband.com/savage-thrust/">Savage Thrust</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011513/http://mydadwasinaband.com/earle-warren-sextet/">Earle Warren Sextet</a> swing band, and 1970s Post Punk/No Wave band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011513/http://mydadwasinaband.com/jack-ruby/">Jack Ruby</a>. Hopefully there will be many, many more to come, because this is amazing... even if it all seems to be a promo site for a new film called <em>A Band Called Death</em>.</p>
