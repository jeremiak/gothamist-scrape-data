It was hardly outside of what one would expect her to do on even a normal day, never mind on a day she&apos;s performing at a huge MTV awards show airing just prior to her big album release. And her controversial moves probably twerked, shifting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153654/http://gawker.com/heres-a-supercut-of-people-saying-twerk-on-the-news-1209405932?utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_twitter&amp;utm_source=gawker_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">all of Bored America&apos;s eyes</a> her way, while driving the final nail into the coffin of Hannah Montana. </p>

<p>But as truly unshocking as it was, people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153654/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco">Can&apos;t Stop</a> talking about it. And their criticism has moved at least four young, misguided youths to get offline, go outside in the fresh air, and talk about what we&apos;re all talking about online still. Our tipster tells us these kids were spotted holding their signs (which read: &quot;We must worship Miley Cyrus! Twerking is good!&quot;) in Union Square this afternoon.</p>

<p>Yeah we&apos;re doomed.</p>
