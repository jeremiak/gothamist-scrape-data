<p>We&apos;ve seen New York in the 1980s, and things were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010108/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php#photo-1">looking pretty <em>Mad Max</em></a>, so it&apos;s unsurprising that in the dark corners of the city was a booming porn industry. Now, Barbara Nitke is aiming to bring it back, sort of. She tells us, &quot;I have a campaign currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010108/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1990714042/american-ecstasy-photo-book">running on Kickstarter</a> to publish a photo book behind-the-scenes of making porn movies in New York in the 1980&apos;s.  A lot of people don&#x2019;t know there was a porn industry here in NY back then.&quot; She sent along many photos that she took at the time, documenting around 300 porn movies with still photography. We can&apos;t publish them here, but you can see them all in this video (NSFW x infinity!):</p>

<p>She writes, &quot;we shot real 35mm film on big movie cameras.  Home video cassette players had barely been invented.  There were no DVD&#x2019;s, no home computers, no Internet.  People went out to downtown movie theaters and watched sex movies on the silver screen.  Our shoots lasted anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks, with a crew of at least twenty people.  We all put a lot of care into the script, the acting, the lighting, sound, editing&#x2014;all the aspects of real movie-making.  <strong>It was the Golden Age of Porn</strong>, and I was thrilled to be a part of it.&quot; As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010108/https://twitter.com/#!/jenist/status/160771449001476096"><em>this</em> author</a> can tell you, having worked (as a writer) for the same industry, a lot of care is still put into some of these movies! But yes, even with the better quality films out there, it&apos;s nowhere close to &apos;80s porn.</p>

<p>As for where this was all going down, Nitke tells us, &quot;There was a studio in Corona Queens, aptly called Adventure Studios, where a lot of the movies where made.  It was there from the 1970s and director Jerry Damiano shot there a lot, followed by another big name director of the period, Henri Pachard.  We also shot a lot in a loft in the East 20s, and a midtown townhouse (reputedly owned by somebody who was in jail).&quot;</p>
