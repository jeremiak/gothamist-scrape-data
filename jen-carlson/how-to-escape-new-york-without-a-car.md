<p>Hey everyone: Happy Earth Day! We know how you celebrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164752/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/how_are_you_celebrating_420.php">the <em>other</em> green day</a> this week, but how will you go about giving back to Mother Nature (who seems pretty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164752/http://gothamist.com/tags/volcanicash">pissed off</a> right about now)? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164752/http://www.jauntsetter.com/current_issue/trip_picks">Jauntsetter</a> has some tips on how to green your travels, with a list of carless escapes from NYC. They note, &quot;Not only are all our destinations green friendly, but they&apos;re easy to get to (either by train or bus), to get around (public transport or cabs abound), and on the wallet (eliminating automobiles means mitigating emissions and dollars spent on gasoline).&quot; On their top five: Montreal, Fire Island (no cars allowed!), Philly, Montauk, and Hudson (we suggest trying to catch one of Pete Seeger&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164752/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpSXLXi6WU">sidewalk shows</a> in Beacon&#x2014;which used to happen every 2nd Saturday around 5 p.m.). Where else?</p>
