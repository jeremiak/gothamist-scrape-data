<p>Are you wondering what happened to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203044134/http://gothamist.com/tags/endlesssummer">Endless Summer</a> food truck, which was a bit of an institution on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg for five years? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203044134/http://www.yelp.com/biz/endless-summer-brooklyn">Loyal fans</a> have been curious about the truck&apos;s whereabouts, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203044134/http://www.ebay.com/itm/MOBILE-FOOD-TRUCK-TACO-TRUCK-WITH-PERMIT-ENDLESS-SUMMER-BROOKLYN-NEW-YORK-/330911950831?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4d0be3a7ef#viTabs_0">this new listing</a> gives the answer: the truck has met its end... UNLESS you revive it. The business is being auctioned off on eBay for $60,000&#x2014;let&apos;s look at this &quot;ONCE IN A LIFETIME BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY&quot; the owners are serving up.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;<strong>The globally renown Endless Summer Taco Truck is now for sale. The enterprise that started the vending trend in Williamsburg, Brooklyn (and arguably ignited the worldwide food truck craze)</strong> has nourished literally hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and established itself as a landmark in the NYC food-culture landscape.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The owners are relocating from New York City and have decided to sell&#x2014;they promise that along with the truck, you&apos;ll also get their expert tips on the trade.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The bureaucracy, legal hurdles and headaches of the food truck business have thwarted many a prospective entrepreneur. We know all the tricks of the trade.  We wrote the book on the Williamsburg food truck game. You are not only buying a fully-functioning vending truck with an established customer base currently operating in an unbeatable location but you are also saving yourself countless hours of legal wrangling with the Department of Health and other nightmarish city institutions.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>At lease they&apos;re being transparent about what the buyer would be entering in to after the one year left on their city-wide mobile vending permit expires (though they note there is an option for ongoing 2 year renewals). Going once, going twice...</p>
