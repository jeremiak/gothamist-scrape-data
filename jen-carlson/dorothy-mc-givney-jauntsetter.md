After spending the better part of a year visiting destinations like Argentina, Japan, India, Nepal, Thailand and Cambodia, she decided to turn her online experience and passion for travel into jauntsetter, a travel site for New York women. It&apos;s been a fun and valuable resource since, and you may want to consider following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110131215/https://twitter.com/jauntsetter/">McGivney&apos;s Twitter</a> as well, because sometimes she&apos;ll drop a last minute deal in there for the spontaneous amongst us. If you&apos;re interested in a short journey this evening, jauntsetter is hosting a party in the exotic Williamsburg neighborhood&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110131215/http://www.jauntsetter.com/blog/guide-book-swap-jauntsetter-social-invite">more details here</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>How and when did you come up with the idea for jauntsetter?</strong> A couple of years ago, it dawned on me that out of all the many travel sites out there, there really wasn&apos;t one that was targeting me as a traveler, and that I was wasting a tremendous amount of time wading through non-relevent travel information.</p>

<p>When I looked closely at the sites I usually read when contemplating a trip, I realized the vast majority of them were too segmented around extreme price points. They were either promoting the aspirational - featuring hotels or experiences that were exceedingly overpriced - or they were extremely budget oriented, to a fault. As in, the majority of their specials were super cheap, but also super cheesy: Shipmates-style cruises and frightening all-inclusive resorts and Disneyworld package deals. The budget-friendly travel deal sites were also way too broad in their geographic scope. I really didn&apos;t care about last minute flight specials from Chicago to Tampa; as a New Yorker, I only wanted to know about flights that were leaving from JFK, LGA or Newark.</p>

<p>So at the end of last year I launched jauntsetter, where I handpick the best travel deals for New Yorkers and recommend a weekly getaway that&apos;s value-oriented, but also provides opportunities for &quot;splurging.&quot; In addition, there&apos;s a blog and a weekly interview with a New York traveler about her travel likes and dislikes. By the way, I originally created the site specifically for New York women, but really, the content is somewhat gender-agnostic. So &quot;gentsetters&quot; should definitely check out the site.</p>
