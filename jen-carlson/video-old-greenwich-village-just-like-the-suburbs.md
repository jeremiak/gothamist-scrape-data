title: Video: Old Greenwich Village, Just Like The Suburbs!
---

	
										<p>Want to take a journey back in time to when Greenwich Village was just like Greenwich, Connecticut meets a modern bohemian Casbah? Then watch this vintage video, where the narrator explains that the neighborhood &quot;is the postmark for many countrified cosmopolitans, people who prefer small town casualness to rigid metropolitan dress... Village life is cosmopolitan, yet relaxed, care-free. Pleasure is found in <em>just being alive</em>. Suburban living, on an urban landscape.&quot; Also: sidewalk cafes, free from conservatives! We don&apos;t want to give any spoilers, but be sure to stick around for (drum roll, please) the paradoxes and contradictions that nightfall brings.</p>
