<p>New York City has the most expensive, well, <em>everything</em>... but that includes the most expensive haircuts, for women at least. A map created by the people at Square shows how much money residents of different cities are getting charged for haircuts, with the average women&apos;s cut in NYC costing $73. But you know what, you ladies look GREAT. Totally worth it. Have you <em>seen</em> one of those $41 Minnesota hatchet jobs? No thank you. <br>
 <br>
Men, however, are getting charged around $37, which is pretty low compared to the West Coast prices&#x2014;Los Angeles and San Francisco men are paying around $45 and $49, respectively. Which probably means narcissism has a tight grip around the well-groomed superegos of Southern California men, who are doomed to kneel by the water&apos;s edge until eventually wasting away. Which means NYC has better men. Which means NYC wins yet another round of its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161841/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/nyc_vs_la_which_better.php">ongoing battle</a> with LA.
