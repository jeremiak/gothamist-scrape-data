                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="awbabypastahead.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306065414im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/awbabypastahead.jpg" width="200" height="311" class="image-right"> </span>There&apos;s a breeder rage outbreak <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306065414/http://www.yelp.com/biz/fornino-park-slope-brooklyn">on Yelp</a> over the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306065414/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/06/new_restaurants_12.php?gallery0Pic=4">Fornino in Park Slope</a>. The pizza joint, which also has a restaurant in Williamsburg, just opened and the parents in the neighborhood are outraged that there&apos;s no children&apos;s menu. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306065414/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/fornino-doesnt-have-a-kids-menu-oh-yes-they-do.html">FIPS</a> points to some of the reviews, which make mention of $16 ravioli dishes&#x2014;too high a price for some people to spend on their <em>flesh and blood miracle of life</em>, apparently.</p>

<p>Anyway, one parent declares, &quot;I&apos;m sure this place does awesome in hipster W&apos;burg, but in breeder Park Slope, this menu has issues.  There are no &apos;simple&apos; menu items I could order since of course last night was the night my son decided to be picky.  I wasn&apos;t looking for chicken fingers and french fries, but maybe a basic pasta I could order as an app would have worked.&quot; Say, like, a simple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306065414/http://www.forninopizza.com/Menu.html">$8 pizza</a>? But then again, you could buy a whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140306065414/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/park_slope_parents_still_bringing_b.php">beer</a> for that.</p>

<p>We called the restaurant earlier and an employee told us that they were working on a children&apos;s menu, which just moments ago was sent to us by their publicist (you can see it after the jump). Bitching on the internet: works every time.</p>
