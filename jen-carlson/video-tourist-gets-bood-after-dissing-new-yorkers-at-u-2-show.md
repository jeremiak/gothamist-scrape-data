<p>At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118113904/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/5693adfeed28413a8192854a09bfabfb/paul-simon-joins-u2-onstage-nycs-madison-square-garden">a recent U2 show</a> at Madison Square Garden, Bono took the time to thank the firefighters from Engine 44 who helped him when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118113904/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/17/bono_u2_central_park.php">fell off his bike</a> in Central Park last year. He also thanked Alyssa from D.C., who got them there that day by calling 911. Bono introduced them to the audience, saying: &#x201C;I am here today because some people, when I crashed my bike here in the city, a beautiful girl made a phone call to 911. She&#x2019;s from Denver, but she&#x2019;s here tonight. And so is Engine 44, the firefighters that picked me up off the ground.&quot; The accident left Bono with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118113904/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/19/bonos_high_energy_bike_accident_cau.php">severe injuries</a>.</p>

<p>While the firefighters offered Bono a glass of Jameson and some kind words and enthusiasm, Alyssa from D.C. took her time with the mic to diss New Yorkers and take all the credit for saving Bono&apos;s life. Take it away, Alyssa:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;So I have to clarify, it&#x2019;s Alyssa and I&#x2019;m from D.C., not Denver. Here&#x2019;s what happened: I was running in Central Park, there was an accident, obviously I had to stop and help because I&#x2019;m not from New York, I&#x2019;m from Virginia, where people are nice.&quot; [THE BOOING BEGINS] &quot;Anyhow, I called 911 because no one else was doing it...&quot; [LOUD BOOING] &quot;He would not be here tonight if it weren&apos;t for me!&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The video cuts off, but let&apos;s pretend that Saint Alyssa was escorted out of the venue and sent back to Port Authority to catch a bus back to D.C.</p>
