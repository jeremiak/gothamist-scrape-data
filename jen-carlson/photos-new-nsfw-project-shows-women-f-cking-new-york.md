</div></div>					<p>Sure, we&apos;ve seen photographers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150829002751/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/nsfw_photos_get_ready_for_more_topl.php#photo-1">use topless women</a> in New York City as their <strike>way to get attention</strike> &quot;muse&quot; before, but Nikola Tamindzic is straight up having people <em>fuck</em> this city&#x2014;which is a lot more hard core. His ever-growing series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150829002751/http://www.fuckingnewyork.com/">Fucking New York</a> will be not only an exhibit, but a book... and you can be a part of it. Tamindzic tells us, &quot;I&apos;d love to invite Gothamist readers with a strong exhibitionistic streak to join in on the fun &#x2014; they can reach me directly at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150829002751/http://homeofthevain.com/">my website</a>.&quot; But first, <em>as if anyone is still reading at this point and not just clicking through to look at the naked ladies</em>, find out what it&apos;s really all about&#x2014;this weekend the photographer told us a bit more:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Ok, so FUCKING NEW YORK: that cliche about New York being the most important relationship for as long as you live here? So true! But what if we took that further? What would actually fucking New York be like? What would getting fucked by New York look like? (Oh, don&apos;t we know already!)

<p>Would it be literal? Like molesting buildings, cars, fire hydrants? Or more abstract? Would it look like possession? Like an ecstatic experience? Would it be joyous? Nasty? Funny? Angry? Ridiculous? All of the above? What would you do?</p>

<p>And what if voyeurism &#x2014; so unavoidable when living in New York &#x2014; got turned on its head, and if instead of inside, all interesting, strange, beautiful things were happening outside, on the street, seen from the window of your office?</p>

<p>New York is a mythical city &#x2014; it creates, grows and feeds on myths. This series is my take on New York mythmaking as much as my nightlife work was 7-8 years ago.</p>

<p>This is just the first phase of the project: it started off as an extension of fashion work I was doing, hence mostly young women as protagonists in the work that&apos;s been completed so far.</p>

<p>But now the whole project is growing into something much broader &#x2014; with the book and exhibit being lined up as we speak &#x2014; and more subjects being involved, with no age, sex, race or size limits &#x2014; anyone who wants to fuck New York can fuck New York &#x2014; that&apos;s why we&apos;re all here, taking it as much as dishing it out.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p></p>

<p>Shockingly, he hasn&apos;t run into any issues while shooting (so far)&#x2014;he says, &quot;New Yorkers generally don&apos;t give a flying fuck. The only people I had any issues with were clearly tourists, and that was limited to leering grins, wagging tongues, and sweaty attempts to get their shitty little cellphone to work. OH MY GOD I&apos;VE NEVER SEEN A NAKED PERSON IN MY LIFE. I&apos;m just grateful about how cool everyone else has been so far.&quot;</p>
