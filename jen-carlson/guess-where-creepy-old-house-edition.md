<p>Was this Norman Bates&apos;s New York City vacation home? Sort of looks like it! Guess where this photo was taken, and we&apos;ll update later with the answer.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This house was located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173617/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=2505+Palisade+Avenue+NY&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2505+Palisade+Ave,+Bronx,+New+York+10463&amp;gl=us&amp;sqi=2&amp;ll=40.879402,-73.920865&amp;spn=0.010075,0.021737&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.880531,-73.922362&amp;panoid=OApFgDebrrbZSavViNV6tA&amp;cbp=12,321.02,,0,8.75">2505 Palisade Avenue</a> in the Bronx (Spuyten Duyvil to be exact). The photo was taken on October 11th, 1935, and the caption reads: &quot;Three story wood frame house with partly visible basement, steps leading up to wooden porch on front, decorative brackets along roof.&quot; No word of a Norman Bates tenant, though.</p>
