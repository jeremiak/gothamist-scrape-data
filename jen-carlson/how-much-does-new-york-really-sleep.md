<span class="photo_caption">LIFE magazine photo caption: &quot;Millionaire Bernard F. Gimbel, needing only four or five hours sleep, reading his competitor&apos;s advertising.&quot; New York City, October 1949.</span></p>

<p>When we interviewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050450/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/06/pat_kiernan_ny1_anchor.php">Pat Kiernan</a> last year, he told us that years ago he settled on a 3:17 a.m. wake-up time, but as he added <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050450/http://www.patspapers.com/blog/item/ny_post_on_pats_sleep_schedule/">Pat&apos;s Papers</a> on to his schedule, he was rising closer to 2:30 a.m. This mind-boggling fact that came up as the NY1 anchor was enjoying beer with us and our readers recently following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050450/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/poutine.php">a poutine dinner</a>. While Kiernan may have an odd schedule, that doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s the only New Yorker not getting a full 8 hours of sleep. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050450/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/you_snooze_you_lose_gFLignlA4d2d5gfmiiVNpK">the NY Post</a>, New Yorkers don&apos;t need no stinkin&apos; sleep&#x2014;at least those who are striving to succeed. Take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050450/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a>, for example&#x2014;that sleepy-eyed look isn&apos;t just one of his <em>many</em> genetic gifts, he&apos;s actually only getting a few hours of shut eye a night! <em>New York</em> magazine recently called him &quot;a hero to nonsleeping power players.&quot;</p>

<p>One expert told the paper, &#x201C;In sleep medicine, [people like Franco] are called &#x2018;short sleepers,&#x2019;&#x201D; getting around 4 hours of sleep, which fuels them up enough to keep going the other 20 hours of the day. The National Institute of Health says that &quot;sleep need hasn&#x2019;t changed, but what we believe is that people are doing other things besides sleeping, and they&#x2019;re tending to do these other things more and more.&#x201D; But was there ever any doubt that this city doesn&apos;t sleep? Maybe #1 on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050450/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/08/what_wakes_you_up_new_york.php">that list of things</a> that keeps New Yorkers awake can really be found in the mirror.</p>
