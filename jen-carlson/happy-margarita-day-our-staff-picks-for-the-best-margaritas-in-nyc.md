<p>It&apos;s National Margarita Day! And since we love any excuse to drink on a weekday, we&apos;re here to help you celebrate. Over the years our staff has tasted the best and worst this city has to offer of the tequila-based drink, and here our some of our favorites. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:252px; "> <img alt="jdsmarg0212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jdsmarg0212.jpeg" width="252" height="334"> <br> JDS has also been known to enjoy the margs at Surf Bar. (Photo by Jen Carlson)</div> But before we get started, can we all agree that you have to go with the salt-rimmed glass? Editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/https://twitter.com/#!/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a> explains, &quot;Salt is necessary to balance out the inherent sweetness of the margarita, in addition to making the rim of your glass look jagged and broken, therefore increasing the badass quotient.&quot; Seconds later, he added, &quot;Fuck yeah!&quot;<p></p>

<ul><li>The frozen pomegranate margarita at Rosa Mexicano is Editor-in-Chief <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://twitter.com/jenchung">Jen Chung</a>&apos;s top pick, and it pairs very well with the restaurant&apos;s tableside guacamole. You can try these out at one of their three locations: 61 Columbus Avenue, 9 East 18th Street, or 1063 1st Avenue.
</li><li>Managing editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://twitter.com/johndelsignore">John Del Signore</a> prefers the frozen ones at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/trailer-park-lounge-and-grill/">Trailer Trash</a>, which he says are &quot;potent, and BIG.&quot; His memory is fuzzy but he believes they may have a good happy hour, as well. They&apos;re located at 271 West 23rd Street.
</li><li>Editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://twitter.com/garthj">Garth Johnston</a> prefers Mesa Coyoacan&apos;s concoctions at their Graham Avenue spot in Williamsburg, saying, &quot;I feel like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/25/woody_would_you_marry_me.php">such a fag</a> when I order it, but the (very pink) watermelon margarita is delicious.&quot;
</li><li>Senior Editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen Carlson</a> prefers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/11/how_to_do_sxsw_in_nyc.php#photo-2">the avocado margarita at Curra&apos;s in Austin</a>, but since that&apos;s so very far away, she&apos;ll pick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-nuevo-amanecer-restaurant-new-york">El Nuevo Amanecer</a>&apos;s on the LES... pretty sure it&apos;s made mostly of grain alcohol.
</li><li>Intern Kate Schaefer says &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://empellon.com/taqueria/#menu.html?id=982071">Empellon</a> has a lot of good margaritas and a ton of tequila choices. And for cheap, frozen, will get you drunk margaritas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://www.burritobarbrooklyn.com/">Burrito Bar</a> in Brooklyn makes good margaritas, and sell them by the pitcher, so it&apos;s good for groups.&quot;
</li><li>Contributor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://twitter.com/jbthilman">James Thilman</a> says &quot;I hit up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://www.hechoendumbo.com/cocktail-menu/">Hecho</a> on Bowery when I&apos;m in the mood for a spicy &apos;rita.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>One last tip from Robbins, if he didn&apos;t already sell you on the salt: &quot;Salt is also necessary for when you&apos;re on a bad date and cannot control your wince or frown. At each mention of a <em>Modern Family</em> plot line, take an inordinately large lick of salt and nod.&quot;</p>

<p>P.S. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429105935/http://sfist.com/2012/02/22/celebrate_national_margarita_day.php">Over at SFist</a>, they&apos;re also celebrating, and have a little bit on the history of the drink.</p>
