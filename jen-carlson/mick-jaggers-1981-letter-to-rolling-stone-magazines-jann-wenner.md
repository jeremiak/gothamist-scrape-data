<p>In 1981, Rolling Stone Mick Jagger had a letter typed out (right? he didn&apos;t type it himself) to <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine&apos;s Jann Wenner, which read: &quot;In return for my consent to allow you to register the name &apos;Rolling Stone&apos; what do you offer as far as cover stories, special small ad rates and summer clothes coverage?&quot;</p>

<p>According to legend, the band and the magazine both took their names from the Muddy Waters song &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; which the magazine has also claimed in the past. But while there&apos;s no dispute about the origin of the band&apos;s name, some believe the magazine took their name as a nod to the group. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144445/http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-68002.html">One person</a> even claims Jagger was on the masthead in the early days. Since early rock n&apos; roll facts are hard to track down and confirm (see: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144445/http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/mudshark.asp">sharks</a>), we&apos;ll just let the legends circulate while we stare at this beautifully typed, humorous letter.</p>
