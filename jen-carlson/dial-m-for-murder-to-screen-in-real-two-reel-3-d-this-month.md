<span class="photo_caption">Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123048/http://realvision.ae/blog/2010/03/is-3d-a-tool-or-new-storytelling-medium-for-cinematographers/">what to pay attention to</a>, 3-D-wise, in this scene.</span></p>

<p>Last year when the Film Forum screened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123048/http://www.filmforum.org/films/dialm.html"><em>Dial M For Murder</em></a> in real, original two-reel 3-D, all four screenings sold out fast. So here&apos;s your heads up that they&apos;re bringing it back this month, from June 17th to 23rd, and tickets are still available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123048/http://boxoffice.printtixusa.com/filmforum/advance?v=2454&amp;i=1523">here</a>. The 1953 Alfred Hitchcock classic, starring Grace Kelly and Ray Milland, was shot with M.L. Gunzberg&apos;s Natural Vision 3-D camera rig, which is said to have begun the 3-D craze (which is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123048/http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/will-harry-potter-and-transformers-stop-wall-streets-anti-3d-stampede">suffering backlash</a>?).</p>

<p>The Film Forum is &quot;equipped with a silver screen, 3-D filters, and two synchronized 35mm film (not digital like today&#x2019;s 3-D movies) projectors... [it&apos;s] the only NYC cinema able to screen vintage double-system 3-D films made during the first big 3-D cycle of the early 50s.&quot;</p>

<p>If you have some 3-D glasses around, you can check out some of it on YouTube (below). Though it won&apos;t be like seeing the film on the big screen, where it&apos;s said that &quot;3-D is most effectively used in the murder sequence, which takes on new and greater significance as the viewer is placed in the midst of the struggle: a voyeuristic accomplice to murder as only Hitchcock could have planned.&quot;</p>
