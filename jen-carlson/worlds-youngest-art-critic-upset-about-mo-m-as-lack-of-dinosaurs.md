<p>We&apos;ve got the next Rosalind Krauss on our hands! Tiny art critic Annabelle stopped by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322035202/http://gothamist.com/tags/moma">MoMA</a> earlier this year and says that while she did get chance to see a thought-provoking collection that included &quot;a coat closet, trash, and two water fountains,&quot; she was ultimately &quot;very disappointed&quot; at the lack of paleontological art. Or as she simply put it: &quot;I did not see a dinosaur.&quot; </p>

<p>For the kicker, she added this to the personal criticism she left behind when she departed the establishment: &quot;You call yourself a museum!&quot; Harsh words, Annabelle. But may we suggest the American Museum of Natural History&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322035202/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/photos_worlds_largest_dinosaurs_now.php">new dinosaur exhibit</a>? Just try to overlook those drop ceilings.
