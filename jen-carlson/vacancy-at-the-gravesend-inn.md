</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s haunted house season, and Theatreworks&apos; high-tech haunted hotel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030021255/http://gravesendinn.com/">the Gravesend Inn</a> (located at 186 Jay Street in Brooklyn), has returned. The creepy, creative project is produced by City Tech&apos;s resident theatrical troupe (part of the CUNY school&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030021255/http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/academics/deptsites/enttech/index.html">Department of Entertainment and Technology</a>) and they claim to be a &quot;theme-park-quality Halloween attraction.&quot; We went over to check it out for ourselves, and here are some sneak peeks.</p>

<p>Before you check in though, you should (suspend disbelief and) know that the old seaside hotel was built on a cemetery inhabited by Brooklyn&apos;s first settlers and shipwrecks have occurred numerous times right off the shore. You know what this means: pirate ghosts!</p>

<p>Dare you enter the hotel, you&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030021255/http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/gravesendinn/schedule.html">have to do so</a> on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturday only, through October 31st. Even ghosts need some time off!</p>
