While the bodega \"egg n\' cheese on a roll\" will rarely fail you, there are some establishments that go above and beyond the slapped together standard. Enter: \<a href=\"http://www.scratchbread.com/\"\>SCRATCHbread\<\/a\>, the part restaurant/part culinary workshop in Bed-Stuy, which has a walk-up window taking orders every day of the week.\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nWhile the shop excels at many things (take a look at \<a href=\"http://www.scratchbread.com/menu/\"\>their menu\<\/a\>), the window is a magical portal into the land of The Perfect Egg Sandwich. When asked about creating the ultimate egg sandwich, owner Matthew Tilden told us this afternoon, \"I\'m much more into excellence and delicioustown, than perfection. I want to give you not bland, not stale, not flavorless, not overcooked, not dull, and not conventional, but a faint reminder and comfort. Those deli guys murder those things. But I think just providing a little comfort, the standard egg n\' cheese in NY is amazing to me.  I mean, it\'s a cult. We may ride a line of this cult, but we ain\'t apart of it.  Obviously we\'re lucky we make our own breads to build from... we design sandwiches from the bread.\"\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nCurrently there are a number of egg options on the menu, which is ever-changing, and Tilden says, \"Our menu reflects an ability to maintain the integrety of the egg potion, whether it be those who don\'t like the runny (egg salad) to those that do.\" Click through for a look, as well as des\criptions of the sandwiches, provided by Tilden.\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\n\<em\>SCRATCHbread is located at 1069 Bedford Avenue in Bed-Stuy, and is open Monday through Friday 6:30 a.m. through 6:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.\<\/em\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_1'] = photo;</script>

The cool thing about this is that it\'s a much lighter feeling sandwich in your belly because the cheese is parmigiano reggiano and it\'s only in the pesto, and crusted into the bottom of the bread, giving it an amazing texture and depth in flavor. (And you can always add or subtract the bacon action obviously.)\" â Matthew Tilden", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>

We make these beautiful pitas in the wood oven with our SIMPLEwheat bread dough (left over juice pulp, brown rice, sprouted grains whole wheat). (Though the textures are so fun in this bread, instead of calling it a pita, we call it HOLLOWbread.) For this, we\'re using our wood roasted cheese curd, talleggio, fontina, kale/dandelion pesto and a spicy pickle. Those in the know add an egg n\' bacon to this.  It\'s ridiculous, and a treatâmore like love making in the morning as opposed to the daily routine.\" â Matthew Tilden", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_4'] = photo;</script>

It\'s got talleggio for funk sex appeal, chopped almost-hard organic eggs, and is mixed with pickle juice aioli, a little dabble of the charred heirloom chili mustard, and our Sicilian salsa verde and smoked chili. This is stuffed in the PARMAhoagie again, and just a pickle for crunch and balance is all we put in it.  It\'s topped with pecorino bread crumbs toasted with fresh herbs, garlic and a little salted caper. Boom.\" â Matthew Tilden", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_5'] = photo;</script>
