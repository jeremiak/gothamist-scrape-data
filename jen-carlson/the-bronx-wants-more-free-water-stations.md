title: The Bronx Wants More Free Water Stations

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:211px; "> <img alt="phpX8wHTCPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605080742im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpX8wHTCPM.jpg" width="211" height="300"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605080742/http://www.flickr.com/photos/osr/4799188562/">hudson&apos;s flickr</a></span></i></div> Those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605080742/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/05/water_2.php">free water stations</a> are rotating throughout the boroughs&#x2014;but is the Bronx being left to dehydrate? With ten stations on the move, the borough is only getting one, and only for four days this month. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605080742/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2010/07/27/2010-07-27_parched_in_the_bronx.html">The Daily News</a> reports that in comparison Manhattan will have several stations set up for 24 days this month. <p></p>

<p>City Councilman Oliver Koppell told the paper, &quot;Unfortunately our city government focuses more on Manhattan than on the outer boroughs.&quot; </p>

<p>The Water on the Go project was created to encourage people to drink water over sugar-loaded beverages, and as one Columbia professor noted, &quot;The possibility of being overweight in New York City is 86% higher in the Bronx than in Manhattan&quot; (sugary beverages can also lead to dehydration).</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Protection says locations were selected for the amount of foot traffic they get, and from the looks of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605080742/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/news/temp.shtml">the schedule</a>, the Bronx isn&apos;t the only borough being left thirsty.</p>
