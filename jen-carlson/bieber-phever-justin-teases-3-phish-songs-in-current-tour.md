<p>The universe has been slowly peeling off the Band-Aid and painfully revealing that Justin Bieber is basically now the sixth member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103832/http://gothamist.com/tags/phish">Phish</a> (the fifth is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103832/http://phish.net/people/chris-kuroda">lighting designer Chris Kuroda</a>, who is now doing lights for Bieber). Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103832/http://laist.com/2012/08/16/justin_bieber_attends_phish_show_an.php">in August</a> Biebs attended a Phish show with his guitarist and musical director Dan Kanter, who had been urging the pop star to &quot;check out the band&apos;s lyric-light brand of psychedelia and rockabilly for almost as long as the two had known each other.&quot; Well, this slow clap is for you Kanter, you did it. At a recent show Bieber and Kanter teased not one, not two, but <em>three</em> Phish songs into the set: &quot;Sand,&quot; &quot;First Tube,&quot; and &quot;Divided Sky.&quot;</p>

<p>The first two are at 4:32 and 5:35 in this video:<br>

<p>The latter is at 13:40 in this video: <br>

<p>So, how long before Bieber brings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103832/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QMt3ExlWijs/TnI9MufI8wI/AAAAAAAAHnc/AnM1ug-chq0/s1600/Phish_HurricaneMUMU.jpg">Fishman&apos;s dresswear</a> to the forefront of fashion hotness? And will Phish show up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103832/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/justin_bieber_coming_to_barclays.php">Bieber&apos;s Barclays show</a>, or will Bieber show up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103832/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/phish_returns_to_madison_square_gar_1.php">Phish&apos;s MSG show</a>? Because we might as well embrace it&#x2014;one of those things is happening. And if you think it won&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103832/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jay-z-jams-with-phish-20040621">just ask Jay-Z</a>.
