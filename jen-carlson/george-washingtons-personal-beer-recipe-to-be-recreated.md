President Obama wasn&apos;t the first one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321021314/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/30/four_guys_having_a_beer.php">to crack open a cold one</a> while in office&#x2014;the New York Public Library just sent us George Washington&apos;s handwritten beer recipe! (The guy really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321021314/http://www.beerhistory.com/library/holdings/washingtonbeerlover.shtml">loved his beer</a>.) They tell us that Coney Island Brewing Company has partnered up with them to recreate the concoction, which they hold the handwritten recipe to. They&apos;re calling it: Fortitude&#x2019;s Founding Father Brew (try saying that three times fast after a few), and you can get the full recipe as Washington intended it below (the 2011 version will be slightly modified).</p>

<p>The beer is <em>not</em> being sold commercially, but it will be served to guests at the Library&#x2019;s Centennial gala on May 23rd. The general public will have a chance to taste it as well: we&apos;re told Shmaltz Brewing Company will host a tasting at Rattle N Hum (located at 14 East 33rd Street) at 7 p.m. on May 18th.</p>

<p>The NYPL&apos;s  Ann Thornton says, &quot;This partnership is a fun and unique way to bring our awe-inspiring collections to life. Not only will it give people a rare opportunity to experience history first-hand, but it will shine a spotlight on the incredible depth and breadth of our collections. We have a treasure trove of materials that can be accessed by the public and used to advance the worlds of scholarship, literature, invention, creation... or even beer-making.&quot;</p>

<p>Which makes us wonder... what else can potentially get us drunk in the library? How about something with an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321021314/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/old_book_smell.php">old book smell</a> top note?<br>
