<p>Here is the first trailer of the first Jeff Buckley film, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220206/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/16/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about.php">of three</a> that are in the works. This one features <em>Gossip Girl</em> heartthrob and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220206/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/penn_badgley_sticks_it_to_bloomberg.php">99-percenter</a> Penn Badgley as the legendary late musician, and as we&apos;ve seen through video from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220206/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/hear_penn_badgley_covering_jeff_buc.php">live shows around town</a>, Badgley actually got cast for a reason: he doesn&apos;t <em>not</em> sound like Buckley. He even spoke about his singing in the film  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220206/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/video_penn_badgley_talks_about_bein.php">at a recent Q&amp;A;</a>, saying, &quot;Trust me, it was a super-ballsy thing to think I could do it, but I could... I can&apos;t do everything he could do, but this specific slice of him, I can do that.&quot; Check out the first look, and sound, below:</p>
