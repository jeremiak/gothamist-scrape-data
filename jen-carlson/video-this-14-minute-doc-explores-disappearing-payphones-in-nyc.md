<p>There&apos;s somewhere between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063125/http://www.scoutingny.com/the-last-phone-booth-in-new-york-city/">0 and 4 real phone booths</a> left in New York City&#x2014;you know, the kind that Superman would use, the kind with a door. There are more than a handful of those other ones left, but they&apos;re disappearing too. If you Google &quot;phone booth NYC&quot; you will get more results regarding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063125/http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d806296-r149193875-Please_Don_t_Tell-New_York_City_New_York.html">the &quot;speakeasy&quot; type bar</a>, PDT, than an actual working phone booth on the sidewalk. Most of those would be in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063125/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/17/photos_did_you_know_that_theres_a_p.php">payphone graveyard</a> by now, but even the payphone graveyard is no longer. Filmmaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063125/https://twitter.com/ugo_mas">Hugo Massa</a> decided to document the remaining phones before they all vanish, too.</p>

<p>The 14-minute long doc, called <em>Hang Up</em>, was shot in 2014, and you can now view it online (below). The protagonists you&apos;ll meet are John <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063125/http://www.payphone-project.com/">and Mark</a>&#x2014;&quot;each of them cares for these vanishing urban objects in an unexpected manner: John is the owner of one of the last remaining independent payphone companies, Mark a disinterested archivist who documents the last days of the payphone era. Their concerns and struggles remind us of a lost age of street communication and invite us to meditate on the effects of ever-changing technologies on our lives.&quot;</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>
