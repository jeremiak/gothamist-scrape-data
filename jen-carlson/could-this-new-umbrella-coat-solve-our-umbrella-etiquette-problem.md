<p>You know how when it rains and everyone takes out their umbrellas and the sidewalks become even more unbearable and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021324/http://twitter.com/johndelsignore"><em>some people</em></a> even deign to carry those huge golf umbrellas? Well this new jacket could solve all of our rainy day problems. It will keep you dry, <em>and</em> as a bonus, will make you look sort of like Darth Vadar. Or the grim reaper. Or an extra in <em>Harry Potter</em>. Or maybe just someone who works in a meth lab.</p>

<p>Who cares what it makes you look like, though&#x2014;this thing could solve the age old problem New Yorkers have with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021324/http://gothamist.com/tags/umbrellaetiquette">umbrella etiquette</a>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021324/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/gadget-guide-umbrella-coat-raincoat-combines-umbrella-raincoat/story?id=14947731">ABC News</a>, designer Athanasia Leivaditou was inspired to create her Umbrella Coat Raincoat after moving to NYC, saying, &quot;Rainy days put a strain on my movements. I had to hold the umbrella and do other things at the same time. Instead of getting frustrated with the physical constraints that my body imposed in such situations, I thought that I should come up with a solution.&quot; It&apos;s made of waterproof synthetic leather, and provides head-to-toe coverage... but what about shielding your face? &quot;A clear plastic membrane extends from the umbrella hood... while strings keep the hood secure so that it doesn&apos;t collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021324/http://www.studionl.com/#/product-design/">also came up with</a> a solution to getting sleepy at work, creating the Life/Desk Convertible to Bed, which is basically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021324/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W__qCFWi1KA">the George Costanza dream</a>.</p>
