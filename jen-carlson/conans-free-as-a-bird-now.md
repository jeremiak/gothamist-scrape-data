										<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521211010/http://gothamist.com/tags/conanobrien">Conan O&apos;Brien</a> bid his final farewell to <em>The Tonight Show</em>, with some help from guests Tom Hanks, Steve Carell and Neil Young. We laughed, we cried, then we were treated to an All-Star performance of &quot;Free Bird&quot; as performed by Will Ferrell, his wife Viveca Paulin, Billy Gibbons, Beck, Max Weinberg &amp; the Tonight Show Band, Ben Harper, and Conan himself!</p>

<p>Before picking up his axe, Conan took a moment to take the high road during the final episode, saying: &quot;Tonight I am allowed to say anything I want. And what I want to say is this: Between my time at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, <em>The Late Night Show</em> and my brief run here on <em>The Tonight Show</em>, I have worked with NBC for over 20 years. Yes, we have our differences right now and, yes, we&apos;re going to go our separate ways. But this company has been my home for most of my adult life. I am enormously proud of the work we have done together, and I want to thank NBC for making it all possible.&quot; And here&apos;s where the host became a little emotional, saying, &quot;Every comedian dreams of hosting <em>The Tonight Show</em> and, for seven months, I got to. I did it my way, with people I love, and I do not regret a second.&quot;</p>

<p>Now we won&apos;t see Conan for seven months, as part of his departure deal states that he isn&apos;t allowed back on the air until September 1st &#x2014; and in the interim, is allegedly not even allowed to appear for interviews. This gives him some time to work out his next move, however &#x2014; think it&apos;ll be back to New York?</p>
