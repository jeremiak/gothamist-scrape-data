<p>Lest you forget where you are (New York City) and <em>who</em> you are (a very important New Yorker) here is a little sign to help you keep in check&#x2014;located at 14th Street, it states: Please Do Not Smile At Strangers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001220/http://subwayartblog.com/2011/02/21/tourist-information/">Subway Art Blog</a> thinks it may be to help out tourists, who come from places where it is perfectly acceptable to smile at strangers. Maybe the sunshine got to our head over the weekend, but we say go ahead and smile at strangers (how else would Missed Connections get filled up)! Just don&apos;t smile at the wrong stranger, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001220/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/man-ties-string-around-penis-and.html">that guy who ties a string around his penis and rubs one out on the subway</a>. </p>

<p>We&apos;d have to agree with the artist&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001220/http://subwayartblog.com/2011/01/31/please-do-not-feed-the-rats/">other sign</a>, however, which states: Don&apos;t Feed The Rats After Midnight. We don&apos;t want a Gremlin situation on our hands.</p>
