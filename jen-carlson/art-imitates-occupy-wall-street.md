<span class="photo_caption">Kirby and his tribute to the protesters.</span></p>

<p>An artist has created a sculpture depicting an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170202120948/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protester laying on the concrete, with his feet sticking out from under a blanket. The piece is in Zuccotti Park, as a tribute to those sleeping there for well over a month now. Norman Kirby says in the below video that he was inspired to make it after sleeping in the park for one night, which he said was &quot;one of the roughest things I&apos;ve ever experienced... it wasn&apos;t even the cold, but it was just being uncomfortable on the ground. I did it for one night, and it&apos;s very difficult. So I applaud these people here for doing this.&quot; And he hopes his tribute doesn&apos;t scare anyone:</p>
