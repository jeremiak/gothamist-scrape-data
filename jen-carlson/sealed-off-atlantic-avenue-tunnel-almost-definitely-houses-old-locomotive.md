<p>Last January <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071729/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/17/19th_century_steam_locomotive_disco.php">we heard</a> from a reliable source that a late night excursion to the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel area led to the discovery of a 19th Century LIRR steam locomotive underground, and now more information from that investigation has <em>surfaced</em>. </p>

<p>The circa-1844 tunnel was rediscovered by Bob Diamond in the 1980s, and until a few years ago he was giving tours down below, with hopes of breaking through to another sealed off area of the tunnel, but the FDNY and Department of Transportation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071729/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/17/bob_diamonds_atlantic_avenue_tunnel.php#photo-1">shut his operation down in 2010</a>. That sealed off area has not been opened since around 1861, and is believed to hold a few historical treasures, the most grandiose being this locomotive. And now there is almost definitive proof that it exists!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="tunnelex11212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071729im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/tunnelex11212.jpeg" width="640" height="351" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>This week Diamond told us that he now has &quot;high tech scientific proof that there is in fact an early 19th century steam locomotive buried inside the historic Atlantic Avenue tunnel.&quot; The finding came after engineering consultants at Brinkerhoff Environmental Group were brought to the site, where they identified a 20-foot long metallic structure under the surface of Atlantic Avenue at Hicks Street. </p>

<p>Director of Geophysical Services, Matthew Powers, wrote: &quot;It is conceivable that the suspect locomotive is located between the middle and south sides of Atlantic Avenue and a separate smaller anomaly is located on the northern side. Based on Brinkerhoff&apos;s interpretation of the geophysical data, there is no question that something(s) metallic is buried under Atlantic Avenue, its just a matter of what. Brinkerhoff does not believe that the response is due to any surficial utilities.&quot; He added that there may be &quot;additional artifacts&quot; (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071729/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/23/under_atlantic_ave_john_wilkes_boot.php">the diary of John Wilkes Booth</a>?).</p>

<p>So now the question is: will the Department of Transportation allow an underground investigation? Currently they aren&apos;t commenting on the matter, but Diamond says it is his &quot;New Year&apos;s hope that everyone can pull together to give Atlantic Avenue the most unique historical tourist attraction in the City Of New York.&quot;</p>
