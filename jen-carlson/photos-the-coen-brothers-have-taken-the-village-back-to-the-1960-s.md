</div></div>					<p>The East Village has been transformed into Greenwich Village of the 1960s, thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151012180615/http://gothamist.com/tags/coenbrothers">Coen Brothers</a>, who have been filming their period piece <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> in the area. Today is said to be the biggest transformation, with more storefronts and old cars taking over 1st and 2nd streets (between 2nd Avenue and Avenue A). Here are some photos of how things were shaping up yesterday.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151012180615/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/04/justin_timberlake_shooting_cohen_br.php">spot</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151012180615/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/can_the_coen_brothers_transform_jus.php">Justin Timberlake</a> donning beatnik garb, send us your photos. He&apos;ll be portraying a folk singer named Jim, who is married to a gal named Jean (the flick is loosely based on &apos;60s Village mainstay and Dylan pal Dave Van Ronk).</p>

<p>And for a real look back at what Greenwich Village was like in the &apos;60s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151012180615/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/video_spend_a_sunday_in_greenwich_v.php">take a look at this video</a>.</p>
