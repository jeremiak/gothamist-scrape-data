<p>There are a lot of websites dedicated to snitching on fellow straphangers popping up lately. First there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170523/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/subway_douchery_brings_up_undergrou.php">Subway Douchery</a>, then the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170523/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/08/ntraingossip.php">N Train Gossip</a> Twitter account that totally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170523/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/10/hell_hath_no_fury_like_an_n_train_s.php">backfired</a> on the author... and now we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170523/http://www.trainpigs.com/">Train Pigs</a>. </p>

<p>This one is dedicated to calling out those eating in the subway system (and even on buses). They declare one should not nosh in such a confined space because it smells, it&apos;s messy <em>and</em> the site says it&apos;s a misdemeanor. Yet, there&apos;s still this phenomena of eating in the most non-appetizing atmosphere of underground New York, amongst sneezing passengers and rats running down tracks. Are you <em>part of the problem?</em></p>
