Have they been making you feel like you&apos;ve had one too many? Seems the inaccurate wording has some straphangers puzzled, specifically the part that reads: &quot;there are 9 wrong ways to swipe your subway card.&quot; Let&apos;s ignore the fact that no one calls a MetroCard a <em>subway card</em>, and take a look at what one reader had to say:</p><blockquote>It&apos;s been bothering me for weeks; the Jameson ads that claim that there are nine wrong ways to swipe a Metrocard. False...there will never be exactly 9 ways to swipe a MetroCard.</blockquote>The reader also sent along a diagram, which found 15 ways to wrongly swipe a MetroCard (see the &quot;math&quot; after the jump), and asked if we could &quot;publicly humiliate whoever is responsible for such foolishness.&quot; Seems some have been trying to do just that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208004122/http://www.yesbutnobutyes.com/archives/2008/03/is_there_a_wron.html">since March</a>, but the wrongly worded ads are still running. <em>What gives</em> Jameson? Next you&apos;ll tell commuters they&apos;ve only got 25 ways to leave their lovers?<p></p>
