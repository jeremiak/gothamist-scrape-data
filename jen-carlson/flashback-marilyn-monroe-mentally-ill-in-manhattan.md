</div></div>					<p>For the non-hardcore Marilyn Monroe fans, maybe you didn&apos;t know that the actress spent some time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622161321/http://www.doublex.com/section/life/marilyn-monroe-was-more-mentally-ill-we-knew">at NYC&apos;s Payne Whitney Hospital</a> in 1961, just a year before her fatal overdose. That year her psychoanalyst, Marianne Kris, committed Monroe; &quot;Knowing the star would never go to a psychiatric hospital on her own&#x2014; Monroe was terrified of sanitariums because her mother lived in one for most of her life and her grandmother had died in one&#x2014; Kris told her that she was going to a private hospital for some rest and relaxation.&quot; The ol&apos; R&amp;R; bait and switch!</p>

<p>By February 5th, the starlet was in a padded room with barred windows; she told friends, <strong>&quot;I&apos;m locked up with these poor nutty people. I&apos;m sure to end up a nut too if I stay in this nightmare. Please help me.&quot;</strong> One author has taken to task the retelling of this time in a new book called <em>The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe</em>, even talking to a Payne Whitney intern &quot;who visited Monroe after she tried to break down the bathroom door in her room.&quot; She told her: &quot;You are a very, very sick girl. And you&apos;ve been sick for a long time.&#x201D; Indeed, Monroe&apos;s mother was a paranoid schizophrenic, and now there is &quot;evidence that suggests that, beginning in her late teens, Monroe heard voices and believed she was being followed.&quot; Sigh. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622161321/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE8Aj55D4Ko">Here&apos;s some video</a>, along with the photographs, of Monroe in New York City during happier times.</p>
