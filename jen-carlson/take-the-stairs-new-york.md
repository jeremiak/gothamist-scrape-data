<p>The efforts will benefit both the environment, by reducing energy consumption, and your health, by burning calories -- but will a simple sign work? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120608051946/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Health/2008/05/21/2_minutes_of_stair-climbing_cuts_1_lbyr/7461/">Officials stated</a> that studies show &quot;visual prompts can boost stair use by more than 50 percent.&quot; More statistically enticing is that a mere two minutes of stair climbing a day will &quot;burn enough calories to eliminate the one pound an average adult gains each year.&quot;</p>
