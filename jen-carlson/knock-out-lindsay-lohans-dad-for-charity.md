Ideally Ms. Ronson would get up there herself, but since that isn&apos;t happening (yet!), the charity suggests you submit an offer (starting at $5,000) to boxing(a)lifightforcharity(dot)com. Lohan himself wanted to get K-fed in the ring with him, but &quot;there was no funding source.&quot; Who will benefit from the beatdown? Organizations like Family Residence and Essential Enterprises who help more than 3,000 individuals with developmental disabilities and/or mental illness.</p>
