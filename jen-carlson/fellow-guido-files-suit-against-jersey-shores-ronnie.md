<span class="photo_caption">Pictured: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro (left) and Stephen Izzo, Jr. (right)</span></p>

<p>Stephen Izzo Jr. isn&apos;t the only person who got injured during the filming of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151004185530/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> this past summer, but he might be the only one taking legal action. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151004185530/http://www.app.com/article/20100221/NEWS/2210339/1070/NEWS02/Man-asks-judge-to-block-release-of-MTV-s-Jersey-Shore-DVD-set">Word is</a> that he&apos;s trying to stop MTV from releasing a <em>Jersey Shore</em> DVD set, which would include the incident where cast member Ronnie Ortiz-Magro punched him. Could it be because Izzo, prior to getting knocked out, was being an antagonizing douchebag on that episode? It&apos;s so hard to pick a side because there are clearly <em>no winners in this situation</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Izzo&apos;s attorney also believes that Ronnie&#x2014;who has been charged with aggravated assault&#x2014;doesn&apos;t deserve payment for his role on the show, and is trying to put a halt to his paychecks as well. At the very least, maybe Ronnie should take that photo of his handiwork (pictured) off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151004185530/http://www.facebook.com/search/?q=Ronnie+Ortiz-Magro&amp;init=quick#!/album.php?aid=149831&amp;id=251452721645">his Facebook page</a>?</p>
