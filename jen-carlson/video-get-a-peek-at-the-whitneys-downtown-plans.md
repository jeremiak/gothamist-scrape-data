<p>Earlier this year the board of directors at the Whitney Museum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150231/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/26/whitney_announces_plans_to_open_dow.php">approved plans</a> to begin construction on a new building near the High Line, to be completed by 2015, saying that &quot;Downtown is a new city, a new nation. Why shouldn&#x2019;t the Whitney be the museum of record there?&#x201D; Well, it&apos;s on its way, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150231/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/12/21/whitney_museum_unveils_new_designs_divorces_the_high_line.php#whitney-downtown-at-cb-3">Curbed</a> has grabbed some shots from an unveiling of the plans... and there&apos;s a video fly-through of the whole thing! Think of it as the closest renderings will ever get to IMAX or 3-D.</p>

<p>The museum folk will be breaking ground on May 24th, 2011, at which time architect Renzo Piano&apos;s 14,000-square-foot plans will come to life along Gansevoort Street. Bonus: the new digs will have terraces, outdoor exhibits, pretty sweet views, and &quot;a theater with convertible seating is tucked into the second floor, where performers will be backed by vistas towards the river.&quot;</p>
