<p>We happened upon this photo in the LIFE magazine archives. The caption reads: &quot;Construction in NYC: land being cleared for 20 story building in East 60s &#x2014; still occupied brownstone is soon to go.&quot; It was still occupied! The photo was taken in 1959... any guesses as to what block it was on?</p>
