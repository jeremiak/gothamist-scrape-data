I think it&apos;ll be good, because I could fix it up the way I want it... although this is nice over here. But the landlord is jerking me around.&quot; Opening 38 years ago and keeping loyal employees and customers since then, it&apos;s nice to see this story have a happy ending. One customer said, &quot;They don&apos;t have these types of businesses anymore. All of them went out 30, 40 years ago. At least Tony maintains some of the splendor of the old days.&quot; Indeed.<p></p>
