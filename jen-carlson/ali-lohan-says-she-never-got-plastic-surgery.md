<p>You know when Ali Lohan, sister of Lindsay, showed her face in September and it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151443/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/09/photo_ali_lohan_has_never_had_plast.php">a totally different face</a> from the one she had previously? Well, following denials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151443/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/13/lohan_clan_not_worried_about_the_in.php">from her family members</a> that she had plastic surgery and an eating disorder, she has finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151443/http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/64731365.html">spoken out for herself</a>, telling Page Six Magazine:</p><blockquote>&quot;I was cracking up. Because, like, when would I do that? I&apos;m 17 years old. That&apos;s not legal! I would need my mother&apos;s signature, and do you think my mom would ever sign off on that?&quot;</blockquote><em>Yes?</em> Anyway, the 17-year-old, who is now modeling, says plastic surgery is &quot;not the right thing to do,&quot; and calls the rumors &quot;stupid.&quot; Also, she doesn&apos;t do drugs when they&apos;re offered to her, saying, &quot;I just say no. I&apos;m lucky enough that I had my sister to learn from. I&#x2019;ve seen people do it to her, so I&apos;ve learned to be like, &apos;That&#x2019;s stupid, no.&apos; That&#x2019;s why me and Lindsay are also so close, because we&#x2019;re able to talk about those things together.&quot; It&apos;s important to note that this interview with Page Six Magazine took place on Opposite Day.<p></p>
