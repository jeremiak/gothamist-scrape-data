<p>This fake advisory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141025195900/http://soupsoup.tumblr.com/post/96491965/heathalouise-fake-service-advisory-at">was spotted at the Metropolitan G stop</a> recently, and even though it&apos;s not real... it&apos;s all too realistic. Though perhaps there are more quirky subway incidents that could be added... what other MTA troubles are missing from this passive-aggressive masterpiece?</p>
