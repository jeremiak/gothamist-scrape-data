<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW DREAMS COME TRUE!]</strong> <em>Shhh</em>, it&apos;s story time. In the latter half of the 1990s, bands like Third Eye Blind, Fatboy Slim, and Destiny&apos;s Child were replacing grunge on the airwaves, <em>Friends</em> was on the television, your cell phone was bigger or non-existent, Y2K panic was lurking in the air, and I... I was living on the beautiful sandy shores of Rhode Island, where I attended college.</p>

<p>During my time in Rhode Island, I fell in love with many things, because that is the nature of youth: there was Narragansett (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/you_can_has_cans_of_six_point_brook.php#photo-1">its beer</a>), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/01/best_hangover_foods_in_nyc.php">Louis&apos; egg sandwich</a>, the cheap rent for off-season beach houses, Bess Eaton coffee (RIP), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://www.dels.com/">Del&apos;s Frozen Lemonade</a>, to name a few. My boyfriend at the time worked on a Del&apos;s truck to earn some extra cash, so I was swimming in the stuff. Sometimes I would request vodka in mine (and off-menu option), but even a virgin Del&apos;s Frozen Lemonade is something to cherish, and in Rhode Island Del&apos;s is <em>tradition</em> (my Rhode Island-born and bred friends even had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenc/945282729/">a truck at their wedding</a>).</p>

<p>Each cup has the exact right amount of real lemon zest, perfectly slushed ice (not too soft, not too hard), and a not-too-sweet lemony taste (there are other flavors, but <em>always get lemon</em>). So last night when I was walking in DUMBO, I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw this Del&apos;s Frozen Lemonade truck. </p>

<p>Is this real? Am I dreaming? Has my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">nostalgia &quot;problem&quot;</a> finally transferred me over in to some new world where I&apos;m now just going to think I see shit from my past? That would be awesome. But this thing was real, I touched it. </p>

<p>But was it <em>really real</em>? I reached out to Del&apos;s, who have not responded yet&#x2014;their website says there are no franchises <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://www.dels.com/Locations.aspx?state=NY&amp;city=Brooklyn&amp;miles=5&amp;l=true&amp;f=true&amp;t=true">in New York</a>, but there is a store in Bay Ridge that may sell the stuff. I also reached out to the people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://135plymouth.org/">at the address</a> painted on the side of the truck... but considering they are part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150221/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/greathomesanddestinations/the-art-of-digging-in.html?pagewanted=all">this loft commune</a> the NY Times recently wrote about, things don&apos;t seem promising. For now, we&apos;re going with: cruel art project. But if Del&apos;s NYC turns out to be a real thing, I will update you. Every day. Forever.</p>
