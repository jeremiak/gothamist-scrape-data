<p>While we knew Vincent Kartheiser (a.k.a. Pete Campbell, a.k.a. Sneaky Pete on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145243/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>) played a baby-faced rebellious teen in <em>Angel</em>, we never would have pegged Jay Ferguson (aka Stan Rizzo, a.k.a. the rising star of the season) as a teen heartthrob, and yet the world always finds new ways to amaze us.</p>

<p>While at present time he dons a beard and a stoned squint, Ferguson sported a cleaner cut in the 1980s and &apos;90s, when he wasn&apos;t afraid to bare some midriff. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145243/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/02/jay-r-ferguson-teen-idol-vincent-kartheiser-photos_n_3197041.html?utm_hp_ref=tw">HuffPo</a> has a bunch of photos, but we feel like the above &quot;now &amp; then&quot; comparison is just too stunning to sully with any more imagery. That shot on the right (for sale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145243/http://www.ebay.ca/itm/JAY-R-FERGUSON-SHIRTLESS-4-by-6-PHOTO-TEEN-BOY-ACTOR-01-/360647869878?pt=Art_Photo_Images&amp;hash=item53f849c5b6&amp;_uhb=1#ht_944wt_1191&amp;clk_rvr_id=475021157730">on eBay</a>!) was taken around the time that Ferguson was a regular in <em>Tiger Beat</em>-esque glossies, shot sometime after he was cast as Ponyboy Curtis in the TV adaptation of <em>The Outsiders</em> in 1989.</p>
