This Thursday, her hour-long special&#x2014;which she took to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival last year&#x2014;will hit the streaming network <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022094350/https://www.seeso.com/">Seeso</a>, offering &quot;a probing examination into the U.S. body politic and a couple of dick jokes.&quot; Friedman (who you may have seen expertly interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022094350/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/making_a_murderer_ken_kratz.php"><em>Making A Murderer</em>&apos;s Ken Kratz</a>) has a talent for generating laughter and terror all in one comedic swoop&#x2014;she&apos;s one of the most unique and important voices in comedy right now, so listen up.</p>

<p><strong>You&apos;ve been touring your &quot;American Cunt&quot; show for a little while, how did the special, and the title, come about?</strong> I originally wrote the show for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the title was partly a play on how often the word cunt is used in the UK, it&apos;s a lot more colloquial there. I thought of the worst thing I could call the show... and then I ran it by a friend and she said, &quot;you have to call it that, it&apos;s so you.&quot; Also, a name like &quot;American Cunt&quot; gave me permission to say what I wanted to say without worrying about offending anyone.</p>

<p><strong>In the political landscape, the past year has been surreal, and the past few months have been especially unbelievable&#x2014;every day there&apos;s a new thing that is just awful, partially because it doesn&apos;t even surprise us anymore. Have you had to tweak your show much since you first started?</strong> Absolutely, the whole second half of the show is about the election and it kept changing up until about a week before I taped it (which was August 22nd). The Trump stuff changed the most, at first I didn&apos;t even talk about him in the show, because it felt too cheap and easy and I really didn&apos;t think he was going to have much traction against Jeb (remember him!) and Kasich. But then as the primaries went on and Trump began rising in the polls, I began talking about him more. By June, I had about 15 minutes on Trump that was really working and then all of the sudden I had to throw it all away because he just stopped being funny, it all just became scary. I think the fear has reached its tipping point but there&apos;s always Wikileaks, so we&apos;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>Last year you said that your comedy hasn&apos;t done well in mainstream America, do you think that&apos;s changed at all?</strong>  The special is on Seeso, so it&apos;s not exactly mainstream, but it will also be available on Amazon so we&apos;ll see!</p>

<p><strong>You share your thoughts on Twitter a lot &#x2014; from the Amanda Knox documentary to Donald Trump to ebola &#x2014; would you say the majority of the feedback you get is negative or positive?</strong> Trump and Ebola in the same sentence feels so right. To answer your question, I have no idea, I treat Twitter like a joke book that talks back to me, if it starts getting mean or harass-y, I tend to delete whatever it is I was tweeting about. </p>

<p><strong>What amount of negativity seems to be based in sexism?</strong> I personally haven&apos;t (yet) been subjected to too much sexual harassment online, it could be because I&apos;m still under the radar or maybe because I&apos;m over 30.</p>

From Netflix&apos;s &quot;Undecided: The Movie&quot;</i></div> <strong>Do you think you&apos;ve reached anyone, gotten through to anyone, in regards to this election?</strong> There was a guy I talked to on an hour long flight, he had supported Bernie in the primaries and wasn&apos;t planning on voting in the election. He later emailed me to say that after our conversation he was going to vote for Hillary, so that was encouraging. I felt bad for ambushing a captive audience but he didn&apos;t seem to mind.<p></p>

<p>As for on Twitter, I have no idea. That&apos;s the question, right, how do we reach people? Especially now, when I want to be &quot;understanding&quot; of the other side but really feel that anyone not voting for Hillary at this point is just an idiot, misogynist and/or racist. Off the record. Just kidding, you can print that. </p>

<p><strong>Is humor helpful in dealing with Trump and all of the hateful people who have shown their faces supporting him?</strong> I think so, in the same way that it&apos;s helpful to joke about terminal cancer if you have it. </p>

<p><strong>When I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022094350/http://laist.com/2016/10/12/judd_apatow_trumpocalypse_interview.php">spoke with Judd Apatow</a>, he told me that he had &quot;thought that George Bush wouldn&apos;t get re-elected as a result of the amazing work of <em>The Daily Show</em>, and then he was re-elected.&quot; Do you think shows like this can get through to the other side?</strong> I don&apos;t know, I have seen evidence from field pieces I&apos;ve produced on <em>The Daily Show</em> of comedy being able to move the needle in a more progressive direction but this election is its own animal, it&apos;s so unprecedented in so many ways and it really isn&apos;t about logic. We&apos;re in a culture war. People seem to be voting based on their emotions, how do we break through that? If you know, please tell me. </p>

<p><strong>As a former <em>Daily Show</em> producer, what would your ultimate segment be to produce right now revolving around this election?</strong> I have always found Trump&apos;s female supporters fascinating, the deep Stockholm Syndrome or self-hate they must possess. I can&apos;t believe more hasn&apos;t been done on them. </p>

<p><strong>If you had a few minutes with Trump, what would you say to him?</strong> Who hurt you?</p>
