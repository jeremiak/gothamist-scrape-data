Located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303065045/http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=104372634431222606322.00045216a6e9d7c6e2df3&amp;ll=40.680963,-73.987062&amp;spn=0.00851,0.016801&amp;z=16">622 Degraw Street</a>, this one is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303065045/http://littlefieldnyc.com/">Littlefield</a> and will be housed in an old, 6200-square-foot warehouse renovated with an eco-friendly touch. They tell us <strong>&quot;Green elements include a landscaped interior courtyard, sound walls formed from recycled rubber tires, and a bar constructed of salvaged bowling alley lanes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Expect live music, film screenings, and art installations from the owners, Julie Kim and Scott Koshnoodi, as well as talent buyers (who include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303065045/http://www.frictionnyc.com/">FrictionNYC</a>&apos;s Justin Carl and Nghia Nguyen). A moveable partition is designed to separate the main performance space from the bar/courtyard, to give each area an intimate feel. &quot;When the partition is fully closed, the performance space can accommodate up to 200 people while the bar/courtyard can hold up to 100. For larger performances, the partition can be moved to one side and the warehouse can accommodate up to 300 people.&quot;</p>
