<p>Seems everyone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122050/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--giantorchid0919sep19,0,4085361.story">is talking</a> about the Grammatophyllum speciosum (aka: the tiger orchid) growing and blooming at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122050/http://www.bbg.org/">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a>. Originally purchased 10 years ago at auction by the garden&apos;s orchid curator, David Horak, the plant rarely blooms in captivity. On top of the recent blooms (which should be around for another week or two), it&apos;s now up to 12 feet in diameter and weighs in at around 200 pounds. </p>

Horak mostly refers to it as &quot;the beast,&quot; however he told the paper, &#x201C;On any given day, if it&#x2019;s creating trouble, it gets names nobody wants to hear.&quot;</p>
