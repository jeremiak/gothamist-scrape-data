Later this year his third book will hit the shelves, but first he&apos;s on tour supporting his latest album, Who Was Changed And Who Was Dead (recorded with the Minus Five). Tomorrow night he&apos;ll be at (le) Poisson Rouge, joined by the likes of Eugene Mirman and Rosanne Cash, and he&apos;ll return to that stage in April for another show with his Cabinet of Wonders (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517033648/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TXfkHaM7XY&amp;">video</a>). Recently he told us a little bit about his endeavours, a super deluxe package available of his latest cd, and bringing his favorite football team, Arsenal, over from England.</em> <p></p>

<p><strong>What inspired the new album?</strong> Well, the practical answer is easy: Jim Brunberg of Mississippi Studios in Portland, OR, who said: have a free week of studio time and make your record. And so I got my friends together and we recorded there. As for other inspirations, the kinds behind the songs or the theme of the record, I couldn&apos;t name a specific event or person - except the usual ones: old myths; bogus confessional songs. I allowed myself a little more latitude with the musical inspirations this time because the previous album, Adam&apos;s Apple, was quite focussed. So you might hear a little of The Lovin&apos; Spoonful, Cat Stevens, Duncan Browne, Colin Blunstone, Soft Machine, Hatfield and The North, Rodriguez - things that have made me very happy recently. My wife, Abbey&apos;s, painting that is on the cover was also very inspirational: it made a perfect fit with the songs, and then the title - which is the name of a Barbara Comyns&apos; novel that blew me away at just the right time.</p>

<p><strong>Has anyone opted for the $5,000 deluxe package of your cd, which comes with a personal show?</strong> Yes. And you can all come. Although I&apos;m delighted that it did, I have no great idea why this made the news. People have been doing this stuff for ages, and it didn&apos;t seem terribly revolutionary or even newsworthy, just a good way to raise a little capital so I could self-release my new album and not be at a financial disadvantage. But ever since Boing Boing posted it on their blog, I&apos;ve read the most incredible amount of (and weirdest reactions to) this simple thing: ranging from sweet, grateful, concerned, humorless to indignant. It was actually quite an education in how the web works. But in answer to your question: in the past people booked musicians for private parties (weddings etc); that never really made the news. In more recent times, these house concerts have developed (I&apos;ve done a few, not many, and mostly for my friend Drew out in New Jersey); and so I thought it would be a good idea to advertise that I would do one in case it piqued someone&apos;s interest, who might not otherwise have thought of it. And it has. But, I mean, big whoop, news-wise.</p>
