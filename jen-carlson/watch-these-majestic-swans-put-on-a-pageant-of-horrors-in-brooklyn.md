<p>Beauty is often a cloak that&apos;s covering up pure evil, something we know from the existence of glitter. It&apos;s also something many of us first learned upon encountering a swan in the wild&#x2014;these majestic creatures are reminiscent of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822142812/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dho00D88Eo">a cloying Nicholas Sparks movie scene</a>, and they are amongst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822142812/http://www.catersnews.com/stories/animals/swan-steals-a-baby-gosling/">the most evil things</a> on this planet. On Saturday, these two Brooklyn swans proved it again by putting on a Pageant of Horrors for onlookers. Presumably for &quot;fun.&quot; Nina Ippolito was there to witness it, and tells us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I decided to take advantage of the lovely weather and go for a calming and meditative stroll in Prospect Park. I came upon the lake, where a small group of birds had gathered along the shoreline. The pink of the twilight sky was reflecting off of the still waters, and I began to film two frolicking swans. And then...&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This?</p>

<p>No, but close. What you&apos;ll see in the below footage are the two swans dipping their heads playfully in the water, forming that classic heart shape with their necks... but what lies beneath is death. Slowly, the lifeless body of a raccoon reveals itself as the swan&apos;s plaything. </p>

<p>But as raccoons are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822142812/http://a-z-animals.com/animals/swan/">a predator of swans</a>, maybe it was just self defense... or maybe these swans are responsible for years and years of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822142812/http://gothamist.com/tags/santeria">disturbing reports of animals parts</a> being discovered around the park.</p>
