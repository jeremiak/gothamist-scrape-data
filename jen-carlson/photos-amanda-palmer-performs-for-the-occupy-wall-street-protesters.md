</div></div><p>When we found out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011814/http://gothamist.com/tags/amandapalmer">Amanda Palmer</a> (of Dresden Dolls and Evelyn Evelyn fame) was going to do one of her &quot;ninja gigs&quot; at Occupy Wall Street yesterday, we grabbed the camera crew and headed to Zuccotti Park. We&apos;ll have video of the full performance shortly (some audience footage below), but in the meantime, check out some photos, and here&apos;s what Amanda told us about the experience: <br>
</p><blockquote>If I&apos;m going to bring a bunch of people together, this is the perfect place to do it, just to spread awareness of what&apos;s happening here. Because I bet you a lot of the people here are New Yorkers who knew this was happening, but hadn&apos;t taken the time out of their lives to come here yet and check out what is actually going on. So hopefully this isn&apos;t a kind of one time event&#x2014;where people wander in and see me, then wander out&#x2014;but people actually stay and it spreads the awareness of what people are doing here. That was the goal in Boston, too.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Palmer, who&apos;s from Boston, had previously done the same thing at the Occupy movement going on there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011814/http://surekharatnatunga.com/">Suri Ratnatunga</a> was on the scene for Gothamist yesterday, and reports back:</p>

<blockquote>Palmer made ample use of the &quot;people&apos;s mic&quot; to introduce her songs. In addition to some very entertaining material of her own -- a rewrite of Rebecca Black&apos;s viral hit &quot;Friday&quot; from the point of view of a truck stop hooker and an ode to the ukelele with lyrics that were crowd-sourced from twitter -- she did a cover of Neutral Milk Hotel&apos;s &quot;Two Headed Boy&quot; in honor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011814/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/video_jeff_mangum_plays_occupy_wall.php">Jeff Magnum&apos;s performance last week</a> and an apt rendition of John Lennon&apos;s &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; with New York native Sxip Shirey on guitar.</blockquote>

<p>Later today, Rage Against The Machine&apos;s Tom Morello will be performing for the protesters, and previously we headed down there with former Shudder to Think frontman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011814/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/video_jeff_mangum_plays_occupy_wall.php">Craig Wedren</a>, who spent his time there talking to those occupying the park.</p>
