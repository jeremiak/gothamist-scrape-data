<p>Though the autopsy isn&apos;t in on this little guy, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330150719/http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=40.671085,-73.96569&amp;spn=0.009797,0.022981&amp;z=16&amp;msid=101719041197281383900.0004570452e67cf3075d6">this map</a> he met his end in Prospect Park (where his kind has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330150719/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/06/raccoon.php">struck before</a>), and according to the orange paint it may have been at the hands of a cable company (probably Time Warner). Whether the company has blood or just orange paint on its hands is undetermined, but shame on them--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330150719/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/28/verizon_cable_tv_getting_turned_on.php">Fios</a> would never pull this.</p>
