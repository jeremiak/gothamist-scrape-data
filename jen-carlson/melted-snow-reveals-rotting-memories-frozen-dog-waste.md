<p>This week, as the snow melted, the big reveal was caught on film. So if you&apos;ve been wondering just what happens when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151142/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/31/they_are_taking_the_garbage_away_ag.php">garbage</a> is frozen in time, here&apos;s your answer. These relics from 2010&#x2014;when things we&apos;re simpler until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151142/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzadgeddon">Blizzadgeddon</a> broke our spirits&#x2014;likely haven&apos;t seen the light of day since late December or early January... and they&apos;ve made some new friends while in hiding. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151142/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/photo-what-lies-beneath/7171/">PBS.org</a> recalls, &quot;approximately 11,000 tons of trash per day were being piled onto city sidewalks and not being collected,&quot; which was then topped with &quot;more snow, discarded furniture, rotting food, even more snow and doggie waste from irresponsible owners.&quot;</p>

<p>The caption to the photo also refers to &quot;black mounds of filthy, oozing refuse&quot;&#x2014;which looks a little something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151142/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/07/black_snow.php">like this</a>. We officially welcome you to Garbagegeddon &apos;11!</p>
