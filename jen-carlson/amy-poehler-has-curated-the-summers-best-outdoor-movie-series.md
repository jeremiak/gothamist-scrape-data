<p>Amy Poehler has curated a new movie series, which will take place atop the McKittrick Hotel, of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119111355/http://gothamist.com/tags/sleepnomore">Sleep No More</a> fame. The announcement today noted that &quot;Poehler has chosen some of her favorite films from a variety of genres and decades, and they will be presented in a private garden space called The Farm, an extension of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119111355/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/23/best_roof_bars_nyc.php">rooftop garden bar and restaurant Gallow Green</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>How big is The Farm? Not very, so if you have enough friends interested, you could buy out a whole screening and break all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119111355/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/05/movie_theater_etiquette_posters_fro.php">movie etiquette rules</a> you want. There will only be seating for thirty audience members per screening, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119111355/http://events.mckittrickhotel.com/summerfilm/">each $20 ticket</a> &quot;comes complete with popcorn, a specialty cocktail and a breathtaking view of Manhattan.&quot; <br>
