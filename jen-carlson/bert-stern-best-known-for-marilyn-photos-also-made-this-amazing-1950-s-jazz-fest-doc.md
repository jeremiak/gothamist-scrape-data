His friend, and &quot;secret wife,&quot; Shannah Laumeister confirmed the death but gave no cause. <p></p>

<p>Stern was much more than his images of Marilyn (which were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309070850/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/18/lindsay_lohan_r.php">recreated by Lindsay Lohan</a> years ago), as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309070850/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/arts/bert-stern-elite-photographer-known-for-images-of-marilyn-monroe-dies-at-83.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">the NY Times</a> points out he &quot;helped redefine advertising and fashion art in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s.&quot; This was all captured in the documentary about his life, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309070850/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzHvtQadZnw&amp;oq=bert%20stern%20o&amp;gs_l=youtube..0.5j0.54.1280.0.2202.12.12.0.0.0.0.150.1149.6j6.12.0.eytns%2Cpt%3D-30%2Cn%3D2%2Cui%3Dlr.1.0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.BXVYMRYUu1c"><em>Bert Stern: Original Madman</em></a>.</p>

<p>Stern also put out his own, much celebrated documentary in 1959 called <em>Jazz on a Summer&#x2019;s Day</em>, which captured in colorful film the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. Forty years later, in 1999, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; Let&apos;s revisit it now:</p>
