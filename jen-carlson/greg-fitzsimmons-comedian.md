You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025436/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0300402AB92A5F5A?artistid=1188933&amp;majorcatid=10002&amp;minorcatid=51">buy tickets here</a>.</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>When not making one of his many appearances on late night TV, or taking the stage for stand-up, Fitzsimmons is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025436/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0280624">writer</a>. He&apos;s won four Emmys for his television writing; most recently he penned the HBO series &quot;Lucky Louie&quot;. We asked him a few questions this week in anticipation of his event.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did you become involved in the Gerry Red Wilson benefit?</strong><br>
I created the Foundation with Gerry&#x2019;s fianc&#xE9;e and cousins after he died.  We work together every year trying to build it while also keeping the integrity of the comedy night.  The purpose of the Foundation is to raise money to fight the disease, raise awareness about the disease and honor Gerry by doing the best comedy show we can in front of his hundreds of friends and family.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about him?</strong><br>
Gerry was one of my best friends.  He taught school in Queens and finally got huge success as a comedian in his 30&#x2019;s.  But he finished out the school year even though he was developing his own TV show because he wanted his students to do well on their college achievement tests.</p>

<p>Some of my best memories are times I spent with my wife and Gerry and Kathleen.  He was bigger than life and made everyone feel special.  A true New Yorker who put family and friends and having a good time ahead of everything.  He had so much energy that you just wanted to be around him.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us how meningitis has affected you personally?</strong><br>
Gerry&#x2019;s death was so sudden and mysterious that we all wanted to know more about it and do something about it.  This made us feel at the time like there was something we could do. </p>

<p>Three years after Gerry&#x2019;s death my 9 month old son got Meningitis and I spent 3 days in the emergency room holding his limp body and wondering with my wife if he was going to live.  He came out fine, but 3 years after that my wife got Meningitis and was also treated immediately and is fine.  Needless to say, I am spending way too much time around these Meningitis people.</p>
