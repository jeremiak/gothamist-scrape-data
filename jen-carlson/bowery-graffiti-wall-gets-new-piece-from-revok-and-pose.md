<p>On Monday, the Bowery Wall got buffed again to make way for a new piece. It&apos;s been about three months since the last piece, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153936/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/popeye_mural_goes_up_on_houston_str.php">by CRASH</a>, went up. This time REVOK and POSE have taken over the wall, which is nearing completion&#x2014;Luna Park, who took the above photo, tells us it&apos;s &quot;supposed to be done sometime later today.&quot; </p>

<p>REVOK has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153936/http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2011/04/27/graffiti-artist-revok-arrested-and-setenced-to-six-months-in-jail">a number of arrests</a> under his belt, but he&apos;s in the clear for this legal piece... the mural will even coincide with their upcoming show at Jonathan Levine Gallery, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153936/http://jonathanlevinegallery.com/?method=Exhibit.Upcoming">which opens on the 29th</a>.</p>
