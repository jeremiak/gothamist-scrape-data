<p>Earlier this week we had the chance to take a tour <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130518235350/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/photos_inside_the_explorers_clubs_u.php">of the amazing and decadent Upper East Side mansion</a> that the Explorers Club calls home. The club is hosting their annual dinner tomorrow night (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130518235350/http://www.explorers.org/index.php/events/detail/explorers_club_annual_dinner_2013">you&apos;re invited</a>), and one member is bringing along his one-man yellow submarine, a project he first thought of when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130518235350/http://www.liboatingworld.com/archive/2008/10/LIBW/LIBW_16.pdf">he was 12-years-old in Brooklyn</a>. Alan Winick has been a club member since 1998, and this morning he told us about the sub during a phone call:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The submarine is actually a homemade submarine, though not a backyard creation. It&apos;s a genuine one-person submarine with a depth capability of 350-feet. It&apos;s a project that I wanted to do ever since I was 12-years-old living in Brooklyn. I stayed with the project for basically my whole life, and finally as an adult I got a chance to build it.

<p>Almost all of the dives have been in the metropolitan area, mostly in the Long Island Sound. It&apos;s used largely for education projects and is one of the smallest of its kind in the world, only 8-feet long, weighs 2,300-pounds. It&apos;s what you call a one-atmosphere submarine, which means when you dive in it, no matter how deep you go the pressure inside the sub doesn&apos;t increase, so there&apos;s no diving suit or anything required to just get in, you just get in in your street clothes as it were.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The sub will arrive at the Waldorf tonight, from Connecticut, and will be on exhibit at the dinner tomorrow. After that, it gets back to work:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It&apos;s spent a lot of time on the road, for various presentations and shows and things like that because it&apos;s very easily transportable. As I said it&apos;s used mostly for education, it&apos;s in the process of being reconfigured a little bit for diving next summer, and there&apos;s going to be some research projects added soon. We&apos;re considering doing some dives in Rhode Island, and then possibly the following year we may go down to some tropical waters. It&apos;s never been in tropical water. It&apos;s designed to dive in low-visibility situations like we have here in the northeast.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>While in the tropics, there&apos;s a good chance it will run into a jaguar shark:</p>
