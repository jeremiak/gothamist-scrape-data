Cam Crockford of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040311/http://gothamist.com/tags/dels">Del&apos;s NYC</a> captioned the image, which has been getting passed around amongst Del&apos;s fans, &quot;Yes, this is real life.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040311/http://cranston.patch.com/groups/weekend-planner/p/shandy-gansett-a-hit-on-twitter">But is it</a>? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040311/http://instagram.com/p/k4rltijqnW/">original photo</a> was captioned: &quot;not an actual can,&quot; so as our hearts dropped we contacted Narragansett for some clarity.<p></p>

<p>A rep for the company, who tells us the photo &quot;launched a thousand questions, and got hearts a racing across New England&quot;&#x2014;says there are still some details up in the air about the beverage, however, it IS real. Here&apos;s what we know, straight from &apos;Gansett HQ: </p>

<ul><li>The second installment of Narragansett Beer&#x2019;s limited-edition &#x201C;Hi Neighbor Mash-Up&#x201D; series will be Del&#x2019;s Shandy. It&#x2019;s another unique collaboration between two iconic Rhode Island companies, Narragansett Beer and Del&#x2019;s Frozen Lemonade; combined to create the most refreshing summertime adult beverage. 
</li><li>The Shandy is a thirst-quenching combination of &#x2018;Gansett&#x2019;s award-winning Lager with Del&#x2019;s lemon concentrate; the perfect balance of malty sweetness and citrus tartness.
</li><li>The beer is tentatively scheduled to hit shelves in April.
</li><li>The Del&#x2019;s Shandy is 5.0 percent Alcohol By Volume and will be available in six-packs of 16-oz tallboy cans.</li></ul>

<p>Will it make it to NYC? The rep told us &quot;details on availability are still pending,&quot; however, Crockford&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040311/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/20/the_nyc_dels_truck_is_on_the_road.php">who brought Del&apos;s here last year</a>&#x2014;is hopeful that &quot;the &apos;Gansett x Del&apos;s Shandy will definitely find it&apos;s way to NYC.&quot;</p>
