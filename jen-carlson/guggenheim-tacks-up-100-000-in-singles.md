</div></div>					<p>Want to see $100,000 in singles up close? German conceptual artist Hans-Peter Feldmann&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152640/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/hugo-boss-prize-2010">Guggenheim installation</a> is where you want to go. The artist was named the winner of the 8th Biennal Hugo Boss Prize, where the prize comes with an honorarium of $100,000&#x2014;he took that money, in singles, and has now tacked it to the museum&apos;s walls.</p>

<p>In an interview, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152640/http://thisiscolossal.com/2011/05/first-look-hans-peter-feldmann-suspends-100000-dollar-bills-on-the-walls-of-the-guggenheim-museum/">Feldmann said</a>, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m 70 years old, and I began making art in the &#x2019;50s. At that time there was no money in the art world. Money and art didn&#x2019;t exist. So for me $100,000 is very special. It&#x2019;s incredible really. And I would like to show the quantity of it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It took the museum&apos;s art handlers 13 days to pin the singles (which are all out-of-circulation) to the wall, where it will stay until November 2nd.</p>
