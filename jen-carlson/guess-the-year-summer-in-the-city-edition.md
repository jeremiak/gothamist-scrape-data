<p>It&apos;s been a while, but we&apos;re back with another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719043806/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">Guess The Year</a> challenge. Can you guess the year, and (this is easy) what neighborhood this photo was taken in? You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719043806/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gtylarge0613.jpg">see a larger version of the image here</a>&#x2014;there are a few hints in the finer details. </p>

<p>We&apos;ll update later with the answer and more info on this particular shot. Cheaters and anyone who makes an Instagram joke will be banished from Gothamist and the entire Internet.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 5:50 p.m.:</strong> This photo is captioned: &quot;A man lies across a ledge on the south side of Washington Square Park, with New York University and the Twin Towers behind. August 10th, 1979.&quot;</p>
