Below is a sample of some of the earliest color motion picture film you will see, and more information about it is posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406005320/http://1000words.kodak.com/post/?ID=2982503">at Kodak&apos;s blog</a>. </p>

<p>They note that it&apos;s actresses Hope Hampton, Mary Eaton and Mae Murray you&apos;ll see &quot;in these newly preserved tests, made in 1922 at the Paragon Studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The Two-Color Kodachrome Process was an attempt to bring natural lifelike colors to the screen through the photochemical method in a subtractive color system. First tests on the Two-Color Kodachrome Process were begun in late 1914.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a full 13 years before the first full-length feature was filmed in color.</p>
