The Brooklyn crew bombed with throw ups and block letters; they were highly regarded and had a strong presence in the city. These days Top has taken his art indoors -- teaching a graffiti class in the Bronx and, this weekend, opening his first New York exhibit. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308115551/http://essexstreetgallery.com/">Afrology</a> opens this Friday and includes the debut of seventeen variations of &quot;the 1970&#x2019;s Afro hairstyle that illustrate humorous and serious messages about being an African American within the United States and in New York City.&quot; We recently asked him about the early days of graffiti writing as well as his latest endeavours.</em> </p>

<p><strong>How, and when, did you get into writing graffiti?</strong> Everyone around the neighborhood was doing it. I was about 12 years old...  </p>

<p><strong>Do you recall your first experience using a train as your canvas? Please tell us about it, and the early years of graffiti in the city.</strong> My first experience was in the train yards--- really for the first year and a half I began writing my names on the building walls of my projects. I graduated up to trains and became the King. Mickey729, Hurst and In1 and myself formed the legendary crew: The Odd Partners. We worked central Brooklyn and became legendary.</p>

<p>Early graffiti in the city was really fun. All the kids were doing graffiti at the time, every block had a writer. We wrote our names more than anybody. Our energy was different and it was a lot stronger than other local writers. With every train line we took over, we eventually became the kings of that train line&#x2014; IRT, BMT, IND it didn&#x2019;t matter. We went where other people didn&#x2019;t go. Even though each line had it&#x2019;s respective King, we would writer over their tag and dominate that line. Even those Kings had to bow down to us and there wasn&#x2019;t really any major beef behind that&#x2014; we were well received. There wasn&#x2019;t really competition. It was really &#x201C;us&#x201D; vs. the MTA who often tried to clean up our tags. Everyone tried to find a new style but ours became the best style to mimic: the &#x201C;throw up&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s close to a tag but takes more skills to execute with one fill-in color and one outline. We used a lot of silver and black. Mostly &#x201C;high heat silver&#x201D; from automotive stores&#x2014; very luminous stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Did you have any favorite spots back then?</strong> I grew up in the projects right next to the Euclid Avenue// A train local train yards. It was very comfortable for me to go out into that massive yard and write. It was the A, AA, E, F and sometimes the G. From that one spot, I hit up 5 trains and became an &#x201C;all city kid.&#x201D;  We also liked the &#x201C;lay-up&#x201D; at the Atlantic Avenue yard where coincidentally, we were up nearly 10 stories high and watched the city go black&#x2014;hence, the blackout of 1977. Down the block from me was another yard called the New Lots Yard where the 2 &amp; 3 trains were parked.</p>

<p><strong>If you could hit any New York train/building/wall today, which would it be?</strong> It would be the A line, that&#x2019;s my home line and it would run through areas where my friends currently reside.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a most memorable run-in with the law?</strong> (laughs) No comment.  (laughs again)</p>
