<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> Years ago Woody Allen commented on his cinematic abandonment of New York City, the backdrop for so many of his classic films. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174848/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/18/woody_allen_talks_new_york.php">He said</a>, &quot;I could do another 50 pictures about New York, but I can&apos;t afford to do it. New York itself is very inspiring. If I take a walk in the morning on Madison Avenue and I look at people going to work and kids going to school, I&apos;m full of ideas about wanting to do stories about the city.&quot; Good news: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174848/http://www.vulture.com/2012/04/actually-woody-allens-next-movie-will-be-set-in-the-us.html">Vulture</a> reported today that, despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174848/http://www.vulture.com/2012/03/woody-allen-circles-denmark-for-next-film.html">rumors</a> his next venture would bring him overseas again, Allen told a crowd last night at a screening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174848/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/video_breaking_down_the_trailer_for.php"><em>To Rome With Love</em></a> that he&apos;s coming back to the States for his next flick, which he&apos;ll film in both New York and San Francisco.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned interview from 2009, Allen had also mentioned that coming up with new locations in NYC at this point is sometimes difficult... so where do you suggest Allen bring his cast and crew for his next New York story?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174848/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/new-woody-allen-film-set-in-rome-draws-some-grumbling-there/">ArtsBeat</a> reports that Allen&apos;s next film will be set &quot;mostly in San Francisco&#x201D; with only a &#x201C;tiny part&#x201D; in New York. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174848/http://www.sadtrombone.com/">Sad<strike>trombone</strike>clarinet</a>!
