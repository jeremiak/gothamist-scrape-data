<p>Beginning at noon this Saturday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131810/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/14/the_new_museum.php">the New Museum will open its new doors</a>, but this morning we snuck a peak inside. The gray aluminum mesh exterior of the building is a whimsical stack of rectilinear boxes shifted off-axis, not unlike a pile of blocks arranged haphazardly by a toddler. It&apos;s a bold, dynamic presence on the Bowery and, along with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131810/http://www.theboweryhotel.com/">Bowery Hotel</a>, signifies yet another firm step away from the area&apos;s gritty past. </p>

<p>After the jump, tons of pictures from inside every nook and cranny of the museum. </p>
