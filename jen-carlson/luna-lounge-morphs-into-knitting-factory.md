										<p><img alt="0806knitluna.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0806knitluna.jpg" width="350" height="281" class="left">With the Knitting Factory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/29/knit.php">looking for a new home</a>, and Luna Lounge being closed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/luna_lounge.php">since April</a>, all signs are pointing to the former moving into the latter. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2008/06/luna_lounge_not.html">a sign on the front door</a> of the now defunct Luna Lounge says as much. </p>

<p>The closing of the doors came with a sad little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=149854958&amp;blogID=406680526">announcement on April 26th</a> via their MySpace page, stating &quot;Thanks for all the good times, everybody.&quot; The venue had only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/16/luna_lounge_ope.php">moved</a> in January 19th the year prior. </p>

<p>Though the problem seemed to stem from the Dept. of Health shutting them down, the venue was likely also struggling to compete with Music Hall of Williamsburg and the yet-to-be-named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/galapagos_moves.php">former Galapagos</a> space. Will the Knitting Factory be able to rejuvenate the East of Bedford music scene? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://www.nypress.com/blogx/display_blog.cfm?bid=49107379">The NY Press</a> asked today if 361 Metropolitan Avenue is where music venues go to die.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Luna Lounge owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222046/http://gothamist.com/2004/08/10/rob_sacher_coowner_luna_lounge.php">Rob Sacher</a> to find out if he&apos;ll reopen elsewhere, but have yet to hear back. As for Knit, they&apos;re currently seeking out their liquor license, as the photo suggests. </p>
