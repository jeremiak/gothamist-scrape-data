<p>Have you heard of the movie <em>Dorothy and the Witches of Oz</em>? The low-budget flick is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120218031739/http://www.movieline.com/2012/02/16/who-knew-something-called-dorothy-and-the-witches-of-oz-is-apparently-opening-friday/">coming out on Friday</a> and looks <em>wicked</em> bad. The movie (of which there may also be an alternate television mini-series version) puts Dorothy in Manhattan, sipping on cosmos. &quot;<em>The Witches of Oz</em> follows the exploits of the grown Dorothy Gale, now a successful children&apos;s book author, as she moves from Kansas to present day New York City. Dorothy quickly learns that her popular books are based on repressed childhood memories, and that the wonders of Oz are very, very real. When the Wicked Witch of the West shows up in Times Square, Dorothy must find the inner courage to stop her.&quot; </p>

<p>In the trailer, you&apos;ll hear of the Central Park tree <em>eating people</em>, and you&apos;ll see a dragon chewing on the Chrysler Building... but don&apos;t worry, the munchkins eventually show up to save NYC from total destruction.</p>
