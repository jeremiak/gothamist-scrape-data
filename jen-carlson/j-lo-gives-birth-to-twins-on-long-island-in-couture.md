She had visited a Long Island hospital with husband Marc Anthony and her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172451/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22940662">couture hospital gowns</a>, but it must have been a false alarm, because soon after she was attending Fashion Week events. Initially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172451/http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_272618782.shtml">it was reported</a> she would have a Cesarean birth that was scheduled for Valentine&apos;s Day; no word yet on whether she ended up going the natural way, as yesterday the twins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172451/http://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSN2153398220080223">finally arrived</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172451/http://www.nypost.com/seven/02232008/news/regionalnews/twin_kle_little_stars_98884.htm">The Post</a> reports J.Lo &amp; Co. &quot;celebrated with family at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset in a luxury suite on the ninth floor, which was under tighter lockdown than that surrounding some presidential candidates.&quot; Turning a sterile hospital into a 5-star hotel, the couple brought in their own attendants and private chefs. </p>

<p>Pictures of the twins, a girl and a boy, are placed at high value; reportedly People magazine is offering $6 million for the first exclusive shot (Brangelina only got $4.1 million for Shiloh!). The Post notes that figure is on par with the box office gross of Lopez&apos;s 2003 flop, <em>Gigli</em>. With all of the ridiculousness surrounding the twins on their first full day in the world, it&apos;s nice to know (if reports are true) that Jenny from the Block kept it <em>a little bit</em> real, naming the babies Anna Maria and Marc Ruiz.</p>

<p>A note to mothers-to-be: get your own couture hospital gowns (with coordinating robes!) from J.Lo&apos;s supplier, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172451/http://dearjohnnies.com/">Dear Johnnies</a>.</p>
