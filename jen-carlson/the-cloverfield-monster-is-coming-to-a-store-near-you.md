But with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519233823/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/31/is_new_york_rea.php">a sequel</a> on the way, this monster just isn&apos;t going away anytime soon. To be sure of that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519233823/http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/ProductsByBrand.htm?BR=863&amp;ID=21030">Hasbro</a> has now created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519233823/http://io9.com/357033/cloverfield-toy-revealed-++-start-canceling-your-preorders?loc=interstitialskip">a <em>Cloverfield</em> monster toy</a> (photos are after the jump for those who haven&apos;t checked this guy out on the big screen yet). </p>

<p>This is some bad news for Barbie! The 14&quot; tall monster features authentic sound, 10 parasites and, yes, a Statue of Liberty head accessory. Thing is, it costs $99 and doesn&apos;t even look like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519233823/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/14/cloverfield_mon.php">the real monster</a>.</p>

<p>Check out photos of the toy after the jump, and while you&apos;re at it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519233823/http://toyhaven.blogspot.com/2008/02/i-am-legend-2007.html">here&apos;s an <em>I Am Legend</em> action figure</a> (accessory: Sam the dog!). </p>
