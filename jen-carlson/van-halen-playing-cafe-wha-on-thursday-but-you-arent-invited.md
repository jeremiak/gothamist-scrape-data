<p>Oh look at this, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020651/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/van-halen-stalwart-arena-rock-band-to-play-intimate-set-at-small-club/">the NY Times</a>, Van Halen has invited music writers and critics to a short, intimate concert at the 250-capacity Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village this Thursday. Meaning they&apos;ll get an up-close and personal look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020651/http://www.allstarpics.net/0005107/012624312/eddie-van-halen-pic.html">at this</a>! But sadly, it looks like our invitation was lost in the mail. It&apos;s cool though, we were Hagar fans anyway&#x2014;mostly because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020651/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/24/cabo_wabo.php">he feeds us tequila</a>. This concert, however, is a prelude to a tour which will bring David Lee Roth back to the forefront.</p>

<p>And in case you missed the giant billboard they took out in Times Square (which includes the date February 7th), the Grey Lady points to the below YouTube that the band put up last month, featuring some dance moves from the now 57-year old Roth, and announcing tickets for their tour will start to go on sale on January 10th.</p>

<p>Oh fine, we actually do like David Lee Roth. But where do you guys stand?</p>
