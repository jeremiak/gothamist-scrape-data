<p>This giant, inflatable, 54-foot-tall rubber duckie has been traveling around the world for years, and yet we still haven&apos;t seen it in the East River, or the Hudson River, or any body of water in New York. <em>WHAT GIVES RUBBER DUCK YOU TOO GOOD FOR US?</em> The floating sculpture is by Dutch artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111250/http://www.apple.florentijnhofman.nl/dev/project.php?id=190">Florentijn Hofman</a>, and just arrived in Hong Kong&#x2019;s Victoria Harbour, where it will remain through June 9th. And then, if it&apos;s not <em>too busy to visit the greatest city on earth</em>, maybe it can consider coming here? Please?</p>
