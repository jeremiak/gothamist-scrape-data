<p>Who will fill Regis Philbin&apos;s chair when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425145209/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/18/regis_philbin_is_retiring_from_live.php">leaves</a> <em>Live! With Regis and Kelly</em>? Plenty are tossing their name in the ring, and NY1&apos;s Pat Kiernan is one of them. Upon Regis&apos;s announcement that he would be leaving the show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425145209/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/18/regis-philbin-replacement_n_810409.html#s225703&amp;title=Pat_Kiernan">HuffPo</a> called Kiernan a &quot;dark horse contender&quot; to take his spot, and now the NY1 anchor tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425145209/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/pat-kiernan-2011-4/">NY Mag</a> about his advantage over the competition, saying if the powers that be &quot;turn off their cable box and turn it back on, it comes to NY1... if they do that in the morning, there I am. I need to sneak into the Time &#xAD;Warner Cable offices and find out if Kelly Ripa has [NY1]. If so, I hope she&apos;s a fan.&quot;</p>

<p>This morning Kiernan stressed to us that he loved his NY1 job (he explained to NY Mag, &quot;I ran into some guy in a Borders recently who said, &apos;Pat Kiernan! I grew up watching you!&apos; I thought: Oh my God! There&apos;s a generation that has grown up watching me? It might be time to explore new &#xAD;opportunities.&quot;) We also asked Kiernan a couple of questions of our own, like what Canadian<em>isms</em> would he introduce the <em>Live!</em> audience to. He told us, <strong>&quot;I have always wanted to expand the use of the word &apos;keen&apos; in the U.S. As in &apos;I&apos;m sure keen on Justin Bieber.&apos; I learned years after I moved here that Americans don&apos;t use &apos;keen&apos; very often.&quot;</strong> (Do you not see why everyone loves this man?) For the record, he would also replace &quot;knit cap&quot; with &quot;touque.&quot; And as for matching Regis&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425145209/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/29/regis-and-kelly-halloween_n_776244.html">Halloween costumes</a>, the anchor sent along the below photo from Halloween 2010 at NY1:</p>

<p>Now, we&apos;ve gotta work on at least getting <em>Live!</em> to let Kiernan showcase his skills as a guest host on the show (he can teach America how to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425145209/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/14/video_pat_kiernan.php">uncork wine with a shoe</a>!)... and hope that when he lands the job he will still have time for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425145209/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/poutine.php">our annual poutine dinners</a>.</p>
