Seemingly influenced from everything he&apos;s absorbed in his 27 years, his demeanor emanates both innocence and experience--making even the traditional folk songs he delivers seem to be off-the-cuff during a live performance. Catch him tonight at the Lutheran Church of the Messiah in Greenpoint, and next Wednesday at Glasslands in Williamsburg.</em></p>

<p><strong>How was the tour with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120000/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/19/nico_muhly_musician.php">Nico Muhly</a> and Doveman?</strong> Oh man, it was fantastic.  We had a grand old time blending our sets together so that instead of three separate sets, we&apos;d segue (a word I only recently discovered is pronounced &quot;segway,&quot; I always thought it was pronounced &quot;seeg&quot;) from a Nico piece to a Doveman song to a folksong and around again.  Our soundman Dan Bora was on the road with us and he taught us Chinese in the van. We are all fluent now.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Was there one specific show that stood out, or any particular experience on the road that&apos;s worth sharing?</strong> Well, we had a great show up in Toronto with our friend Owen/Final Fantasy. Stupidly enough, we had no official show in Vermont, which is stupid because we are all from Vermont and the tour was called &quot;the 802 tour&quot; because that is Vermont&apos;s lone area code.  But we did do a little secret show there at Nico&apos;s parents&apos; house for some people in the hood, that was wonderful because it was so beautiful up in the mountains and we had all eaten delicious food at the local diner that morning.  Nico has recounted many of the more exotic tales of our tour on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117120000/http://nicomuhly.com/">his blog</a>, including encounters with an enormous breast, and near death by brush fire.</p>

<p><strong>You seem to have an interesting recording/music-making process, can you talk about that a bit?</strong> It&apos;s come about haphazardly so far, I&apos;d like to make some records that consist of people actually sitting around in a room making music together at some point.  But for whatever reason the last two (&quot;But This Chicken Proved Falsehearted,&quot; produced by Thomas Bartlett/Doveman, and &quot;All is Well,&quot; produced by Valgeir Sigurdsson and arranged by Nico Muhly) were both made by me first putting down solo tracks of voice &amp; guitar or banjo, and then those guys just adding things afterwards without me having any idea what they were going to do, or even hearing it until long afterwards.  I like the field recording quality of that- where I just put the shit down in a simple oldtime way, and then what happened afterwards was highly accidental and confused, similar to the process a folksong goes through- somebody sings it, and then it&apos;s out of their hands and half of it gets forgotten, or embellished, or whatever.</p>
