title: Watch Old NYC Come To Life Through Animated Vintage Photos
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913010715/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">Looking back</a> at how the world used to be is sort of a special thing&#x2014;there&apos;s so little visual documentation from a time when a city&apos;s residents weren&apos;t carrying around tiny cameras in their pockets. At best we get some grainy footage and black &amp; white images, but this &quot;Old New World&quot; photo-based animation project brings crystal clear photographs from the Old Days to life, placing you on familiar streets in an unfamiliar time. </p>

<p>In their video you&apos;ll see NYC, including Central Park, St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral, and the H. Zang Milk Depot in Chinatown, as well as areas of Detroit, Boston, Washington D.C. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913010715/https://vimeo.com/160024074">The creators</a> explain this was done through &quot;camera projection based on photos,&quot; and not magic.</p>
