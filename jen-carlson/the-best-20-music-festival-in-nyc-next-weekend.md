<p>With festivals being so expensive these days <em>and being so hosted on Randall&apos;s Island</em>... the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006165115/http://spymusicfestival.com/">3rd annual Spy Fest</a> got our lazy and broke attention. It&apos;s happening next weekend and will be held at two venues, one on the Lower East Side (on September 7th) and one in Williamsburg (on September 8th). And it only costs $20&#x2014;for that money you&apos;ll get entry to both days, plus a pre-party on Friday the 6th (which includes drink specials and performances).</p>

<p>Fest organizers just announced their headliners: Sean Lennon and Greg Saunier (Deerhoof), who will perform the last night with their Mystical Weapons project. Sadly, Thurston Moore and John Moloney (Caught On Tape) had to postpone their fest appearance, but here&apos;s how the rest of the weekend will play out: </p>

<p><strong>Friday, September 6th</strong> at The Grand Victory (245 Grand Street, Brooklyn): Pre-party with drink specials provided by Sixpoint Brewery and performances by Swindlella (members of the Cloud Nothings) and Colin L. Orchestra (USA is a Monster). </p>
