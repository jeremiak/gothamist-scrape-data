<p>The news is spreading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002843/http://search.twitter.com/search?q=williamsburg+bridge&amp;result_type=recent">via Twitter</a> right now, but there are few details as the incident just occurred. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002843/http://twitter.com/#!/smartcrew/status/58552437140762624">Smart Crew</a>, the jumper is a cab driver who abandoned his taxi and jumped off the Brooklyn side of the bridge (though this has not been confirmed).</p>

<p>We&apos;re told that calls came in around 11:30 a.m. when people noticed something floating in the river near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002843/http://www.giandoonthewater.com/">Giando on the Water</a>. There are also reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002843/http://twitter.com/#!/marcweiner1/statuses/58558522161512448">traffic on the bridge is halted</a> in at least one direction.</p>

<p>We&apos;ll update when we receive more information. </p>
