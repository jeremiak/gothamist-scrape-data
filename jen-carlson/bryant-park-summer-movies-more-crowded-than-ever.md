<p>Last night Bryant Park kicked off its summer movie series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140525012315/http://twitter.com/#!/BryantParkNYC/status/82969030478151680">transmitting</a> this aerial shot of a <em>massive</em> crowd (you can&apos;t even see any blades of grass&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140525012315/http://ow.ly/i/df4W/original">check the close-up</a>). These events usually get crowded, but this is like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140525012315/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/black_eyed_peas_concert_canceled_fa.php">Black Eyed Peas canceled Central Park concert crowded</a>! Which is sort of nice, actually... that just as many people want to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140525012315/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/your_guide_to_this_summers_outdoor.php#photo-2"><em>One Flew Over The Cuckoo&apos;s Nest</em></a>. There is hope yet! </p>

<p>Director Milos Forman was also on hand to introduce the movie last night, which may have added to the draw. Yesterday Bryant Park noted that, &quot;It doesn&apos;t always fill up quite this fast,&quot; adding the earlier you can show up for the screenings, the better.</p>

<p>With this kind of crowd, it probably doesn&apos;t even matter if drinking is legal&#x2014;but we&apos;re checking on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140525012315/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/27/drinking_at_bryant_park_movies_this.php">the park&apos;s status</a> with the State Liquor Authority, and will update when we hear back. In the meantime, prepare to fill up your Sigg bottle with some Ros&#xE9; for next week&apos;s screening of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s <em>The 39 Steps</em>.</p>
