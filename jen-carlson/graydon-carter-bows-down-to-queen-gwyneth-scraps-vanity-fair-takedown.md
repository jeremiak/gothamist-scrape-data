										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="gwynpaltvf.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gwynpaltvf.jpeg" width="254" height="350"> <br> <i style=" width:254px; ;display:block"> On the cover in 2011</i></div> Earlier this year a few of us were discussing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803/http://gothamist.com/tags/gwynethpaltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803/http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/news/gwyneth-paltrow-interview-0513?click=pp#slide-1">admission</a> to smoking one cigarette every Saturday night. &quot;What else does Gwyneth only occasionally indulge in?,&quot; we wondered. Our minds reeled with ideas: &quot;I murder one prostitute, but only once a week... every Sunday, just before dawn.&quot; Or, &quot;While mostly plant-based, I do allow my diet to include rare, exotic animal meats, but only every Monday at family dinner.&quot; When <em>Vanity Fair</em> announced they would be publishing an &quot;epic takedown&quot; of the actress and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803/http://goop.com/">Luxury Lifestyle Goddess</a>, we knew we would finally be able to know things we never truly cared about on how Gwyneth <em>really</em> lives. <p></p>

<p>But alas, she has wielded her considerable clout, and after a battle with Graydon Carter&apos;s magazine, the story&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803/http://www.classicalite.com/articles/3997/20131121/cheater-gwyneth-paltrow-vanity-fair-expos%C3%A9-issue-release-date-chris-martin-divorce-rumors.htm">included a rumor</a> that she cheated on husband Chris Martin&#x2014;has reportedly disappeared.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2519398/Gwyneth-Paltrow-wins-battle-Vanity-Fair-magazine-reportedly-ditches-epic-down.html#ixzz2mj8jPHcY">to reports</a>, Paltrow enlisted her A-list friends to boycott the magazine, penning a letter that read, &quot;<em>Vanity Fair</em> is threatening to put me on the cover of their magazine. If you are asked for quotes or comments, please decline. Also, I recommend you all never do this magazine again.&quot; Carter, a bit of a celebrity whore himself, will reportedly now run a fluff piece on Paltrow, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803/http://www.eonline.com/news/470690/gwyneth-paltrow-article-is-happening-vanity-fair-editor-graydon-carter-says-actress-forced-my-hand">but previously told</a> The Times of London:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We started a story on her. We have a very good writer and it&#x2019;ll run. Well, she sort of forced my hand... Some famous people believe that they live in a cone of celebrity that protects them. But it doesn&#x2019;t really exist anymore in LA unless they stay in. I mean, you can be a well-known movie star and go decades without getting an embarrassing picture in a magazine just by leading a quiet, normal life... We wouldn&#x2019;t be doing our job is there wasn&#x2019;t a little bit of tension between <em>Vanity Fair</em> and its subjects, In any given week, I can expect to hear from a disgruntled subject in Hollywood, Washington or on Wall Street. That&#x2019;s the nature of the beast.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>A source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031803/http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2013/12/gwyneth-paltrow-vanity-fair-takedown-piece-soft/">RadarOnline</a>, &quot;Whatever they wind up publishing, it&#x2019;s going to be soft. Gwyneth&#x2019;s campaign against the <em>Vanity Fair</em> article has apparently worked and she&#x2019;s not as worried as she was three weeks ago.&quot;</p>
