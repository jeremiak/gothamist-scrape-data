<p>I have never really delved into the world of Pinterest, which seems to me to be a place where people collect images of things they want but will never have, and call it &quot;inspiration.&quot; Sad! But while searching for a photo of a fire escape recently, I came upon a fire escape Pinterest board, and hoo boy... <em>do you even know what people do with their fire escapes?</em> They turn them into lush verandas, resting spots, miniature porches, little oases of their own. </p>

<p>This goes beyond the romance of simply dangling one&apos;s feet off a fire escape on a hot summer day in the city&#x2014;it&apos;s a full transformation, an extension of one&apos;s apartment, and it can be a real gamechanger here in the land of 400-sq-ft living spaces. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082220/https://www.pinterest.com/explore/fire-escape/">F*ckin&apos; Pinterest</a>, man.</p>

<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082220/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/19/fire_escape_gardens.php">not at all legal</a> to do these wonderful things to your fire escape, as they are meant to be kept clear in the event of, you know, a fire. FDNY spokesman Frank Dwyer told us, &quot;In short, no, plants and other items are not to permitted on fire escapes.&quot; </p>

<p><em>However</em>, fire escapes are basically only decoration now anyway&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082220/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/12/fire_escapes_may_be_going_the_way_o.php">last year</a>, one FDNY rep declared: &quot;Those fire escapes are going the way of the dinosaur,&quot; noting that fireproof interior stairwells are now the preferred addition for newer buildings. </p>

<p>These little metal ledges are something only New Yorkers could romanticize so much, and they have a long history here in the city (some people even used them as open-air bedrooms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082220/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/nyc_fire_escape_summer_flashback.php">back in the day</a>). So we want to celebrate them&#x2014;have you done something magical with your fire escape? We&apos;d like to see it. You can submit a photo to us at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082220/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tips@gothamist.com</a> (just let us know if you would like to remain anonymous).</p>

<p>N.B. Never go on Pinterest:</p>
