<p>Author (and concierge of ten years) Amber C. Jones is bringing the scratch n&apos; sniff concept to a book about New York City, and more specifically: a book about New York City <em>smells</em>. It&apos;s called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420100916/http://www.scentsationalbooks.com/#!get-a-whiff-of-this"><em>New York, Phew York</em></a>, and according to the website: &quot;<strong>All of the books smells are synonymous with the city&#x2014;both good and bad.  From fresh bagels and pizza, to garbage and sewer steam</strong>, this book ventures into 19 neighborhoods and uncovers many hours of scratch-and-sniff scents!&quot; </p>

<p>The first time author explains, &#x201C;There are books out there that give you a great feel of the city and there are books out there where you can see what New York looks like, but there are no books out there where you can smell what New York smells like.&quot; And maybe for good reason!</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420100916/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scentsationalbooks/new-york-phew-york-a-scratch-n-sniff-adventure">her Kickstarter campaign</a>, the smells include: Red Apple, Strawberry, Garbage, Pizza, Hot dogs, Sewer steam, Fish, Churros, Peanuts, Horse Manure, Shish-kabobs, Smoke, Bagels, Grass, Piragua Ice Cone, Pickles, and Pastrami. What&apos;s missing?</p>
