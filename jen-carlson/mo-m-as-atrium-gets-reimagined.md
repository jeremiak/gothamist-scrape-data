</div></div>					<p>The expansive six story atrium at the Museum of Modern Art, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152507/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/arts/design/21rist.html?_r=1&amp;8ur&amp;emc=ur">the NY Times</a> notes has been a &quot;space more suited to corporate functions than to art,&quot; has had its second floor taken over by a new Pipilotti Rist installation titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152507/http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/exhibitions.php?id=9760">Pour Your Body Out</a>.</p>

<p>The press release points out that the museum commissioned the artist to reinvent the space and reenvision its architecture. At 7,354 cubic meters, the result &quot;is a lush, immersive landscape shaped by images, sound, and sculptural elements.&quot; It went on view this week, and will be in place through February 2nd, 2009...and the artist encourages visitors to experience the installation &quot;by taking off their shoes, lying on the round sofa or on the carpeted floor, or singing or dancing around freely.&quot;</p>
