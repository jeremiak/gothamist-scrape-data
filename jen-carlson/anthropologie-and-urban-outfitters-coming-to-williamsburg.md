<p>Throughout time, the men of Williamsburg have had to travel all the way to the isle of Manhattan to sit on the couches inside of Anthropologie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419052013/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/166200843450847233">as their girlfriends shopped</a>. But a new day is upon us. Soon the men of Williamsburg will be able sit on the couches without having to take mass transit: there&apos;s an Anthropologie opening at 242 Bedford Avenue (between North 3rd and North 4th streets)! Crains New York calls it a &quot;match made in hipster heaven,&quot; which doesn&apos;t really make any sense since the store caters more to the area&apos;s newer condo set. But whatever, Williamsburg! Hipsters! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419052013/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130305/REAL_ESTATE/130309950">Pageviews</a>!</p>

<p>The store is negotiating a lease for a 10,000-square-foot space in the retail complex that will also be the future home of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419052013/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/the_inevitable_whole_foods_williams.php">Whole Foods</a>. And word is that Urban Outfitters is also aiding in the neighborhood&apos;s streetscape transformation: they&apos;ve signed a lease for a space at 102 North 6th Street (between Berry and Wythe streets)&#x2014;for those familiar with the area, that will make them neighbors with American Apparel.</p>

<p>Crain&apos;s also notes that &quot;Canadian retailer Joe Fresh, New York Sports Club, and Citibank are also potential tenants for the site,&quot; which opens next year.</p>
