title: Rom-Com Inspired Valentine's Day Date Ideas
---

	
										<p>It&apos;s almost Valentine&apos;s Day, and we got you an early present. This is like a box of chocolates, except instead of chocolates it&apos;s a list that will direct you towards the most cliche things you can possibly do on Valentine&apos;s Day in New York City, inspired by the almighty Rom-Com. You can do any one of these things sincerely or ironically.</p>

<p><strong>EMPIRE STATE BUILDING</strong><br>

<p>We have reached out to the Empire State Building&apos;s publicity team to find out how many more visitors they get on Valentine&apos;s Day in comparison to a Non-Hallmark Day, and will update here when we find out. But needless to say, this is a popular spot for starry-eyed lovers. So romantic, with its sweeping views and old school art deco charm. Plus it&apos;s so goddamn cold outside that it will give you the perfect reason to press all up against each other.</p>

<p><strong>DINNER AT CAFE LALO</strong><br>

<p>Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320/http://cafelalo.com/cafe/">Cafe Lalo</a> and bring a copy of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> with a rose stuck in the pages. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNRbnz58O24">Try not to fight</a>.</p>

<p><strong>HOT CHOCOLATE AT SERENDIPITY</strong><br>

<p>Recreate your very own meet cute, and then share a mug of hot chocolate at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320/http://www.serendipity3.com/">Serendipity 3</a> and discuss John Cusack&apos;s best roles as a romantic lead.</p>

<p><strong>BROOKLYN BRIDGE LOVE LOCKS</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lovelocks14.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lovelocks14.jpg" width="640" height="374" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Love locks are everywhere, and while we can&apos;t think of any NYC-based on-screen scenes that feature them, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/27/will_love_locks_take_over_the_brook.php">we do <em>have</em> them here</a>. We even have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/14/break_the_locks_of_love_on_the_broo.php#photo-1">a team that breaks them apart</a>... but let&apos;s not think about that. Your love and your love lock is forever. Take your person over to The Brooklyn Bridge and make it so.</p>

<p><strong>HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE RIDE</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="SATCCP.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SATCCP.jpg" width="640" height="448" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We can&apos;t wholeheartedly <em>recommend</em> this, since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034320/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">the carriage horse industry</a> is evil, but they are there in Central Park, and it&apos;s the perfect Manhattan romantic cliche, but... maybe just go and feed the horses carrots?</p>

<p><strong>A ROM-DRAM ALTERNATIVE</strong><br>

<p>You are young, adorable Brooklynites in love. Grab a ukulele and sing and dance through the night, spin around under the stars, feel the passion overcome you, try to hold on to it, never let it go, store it in your gut and feed off of it for the rest of your lives. If you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll look across the table one day and see nothing more than a dead-eyed stranger, a memory.</p>
