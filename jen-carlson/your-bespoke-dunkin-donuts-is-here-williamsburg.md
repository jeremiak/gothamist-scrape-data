<span class="photo_caption">Look they made it look like stuff you like (photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235037/https://twitter.com/LeedsRadio/status/387590250052059138">LeedsRadio</a>)</span></p>

<p>As was foretold by the giant construction wall adorned with Dunkin&apos; Donuts&apos; colorful logo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235037/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/19/williamsburg_dunkin_donuts.php">just last month</a>: the ubiquitous chain and Bedford Avenue would be cohabitating soon. And that soon is now. And, inevitably, a certain cross-section of residents are simply aghast! What is this chain store doing in a neighborhood we spent so long branding as hip and artisanal and Cool? Fill up your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235037/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/duane_reade_wins_over_williamsburg.php">growler of beer</a> at the Duane Reade down the street and chill out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235037/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/23/ask_a_native_new_yorker_how_guilty.php">tourists</a>.</p>

<p>Dunkin&apos; Donuts is FINE. Maybe it&apos;s not cold-brewed in mason jars but their coffee actually tastes good, and costs about $3 less than wherever you&apos;re currently getting your caffeine fix at. Is it that place you read about in the NY Times Sunday Style section, where the bespectacled and suspendered boy you like works? Well one day soon you two will have way too many adult beverages after his shift is done, make a lot of mistakes, wake up blinded by a hangover, and eat a shameful breakfast together at this very Dunkin&apos; Donuts before the brunch crowd wakes up. And you will thank that deity statue you bought at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235037/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/anthropologie_and_urban_outfitters.php">the new Urban Outfitters</a> down the street that it exists, because you could not have gotten through the day without that microwaved egg n&apos; cheese. When that day comes, wear sweatpants&#x2014;it&apos;s okay, Dunkies don&apos;t judge.</p>

<p>Or whatever, just keep logging your complaints on Twitter.</p>
