title: How To Live In A 90-Square-Foot Apartment
---

	
										<p>In 2011 a woman named Felice Cohen let the world see her tiny Manhattan digs through a video tour that quickly went viral. Sure, it was no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111251/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/06/video_is_this_78-square-foot_apartm.php">78-square-foot apartment</a>, but it helped adjust our measurements of micro-living, and gave insight into just how much people will give up to live in New York City.</p>

<p>Now, Cohen&#x2014;who later purchased <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111251/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/28/video_woman_who_lived_in_90-square-.php">a 490-square-foot apartment</a> in the same neighborhood for under $300,000&#x2014;is releasing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111251/http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Living-Large-Square-Feet-ebook/dp/B01CM3XU0E">an e-book on living small</a>, coming out next week and titled <em>90 Lessons for Living Large in 90 Square Feet (...or More)</em>. </p>

<p>She told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111251/http://nypost.com/2016/03/14/i-lived-in-a-closet-sized-apartment-and-you-can-too/">the NY Post</a>, &quot;Living in that tiny space made my life so much bigger. My book is about living the life you want in whatever size you choose... I learned to love living with less.&quot; In her case, it certainly helped that her closet-sized pad was only $700 a month and located on West 70th Street at Columbus Avenue.</p>

<p>&quot;The studio changed my life,&quot; she added, &quot;It made me realize that I didn&#x2019;t want to waste money on stuff, and that I didn&#x2019;t want to spend my life putting stuff away, cleaning and working to pay off stuff.&#x201D; According to the book&apos;s summary, &quot;the message&quot; is to &quot;eliminate clutter and focus on the things that matter.&quot; Which kind of sounds like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111251/http://www.amazon.com/Spark-Joy-Illustrated-Organizing-Tidying/dp/1607749726">the hugely popular Spark Joy movement</a>.</p>
