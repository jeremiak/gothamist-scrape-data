<p>The Museum of Moving Image has decided to extend its amazing Jim Henson&apos;s Fantastic World exhibit (as Kermit would say, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171410/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_w4oSCJIQk">Yaaaaaay!</a>&quot;). We checked it out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171410/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/13/in_which_we_enter_jim_hensons_fanta.php">earlier this year</a> and highly recommend visiting before it closes on March 4th (originally it was meant to shut down on January 16th).
