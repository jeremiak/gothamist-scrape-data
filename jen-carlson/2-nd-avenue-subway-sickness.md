<p>The MTA says the sites are all safe, and free from harmful materials or chemicals that cause illness &#x2014; adding that sites are hosed down to reduce dust. However, a spokesman says they have &quot;received a few complaints about asthma cases since the project began.&quot; The amount of calls hasn&apos;t been significant enough to warrant an investigation, apparently.</p>

<p>The project site manager says the virgin ground they&apos;re digging into is pure &quot;mother earth,&quot; and while the DEP&apos;s soil tests have shown more than 200 materials that could be harmful &#x2014; there have only been trace amounts detected.</p>

<p>Amongst the illnesses locals and health providers have been seeing are headaches, asthma, allergies and severe coughs. The UES&apos;s Dr. Joseph Raeanelli said he sees up to 4 new patients a week complaining of air quality issues, and that &quot;residents may be affected by construction dust, or pollutants in the air from traffic jams, dirt being moved or compounds in sewer gases.&quot; In other words: welcome to New York.</p>
