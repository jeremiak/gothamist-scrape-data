<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="savekates0312.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322063504im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/savekates0312.jpeg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>A longtime fave of vegetarians and the people that dine with them, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322063504/http://www.yelp.com/biz/kates-joint-new-york">Kate&apos;s Joint</a>, is in danger of being evicted. The East Village spot, which is located on Avenue B and East 4th Street, opened in 1996, but now owner Kat Halpern needs your help. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322063504/http://www.indiegogo.com/savekatesjoint?c=home">Save Kate&apos;s campaign</a> has been launched, where fundraisers are hoping to get $30,000 for Halpern&#x2014;and if you donate more than 20 bucks, you&apos;ll get something in return (something <em>other</em> than the gratifying feeling of saving an East Village mainstay).</p>

<blockquote>Unfortunately, with the changing neighborhood and economic recession Kate&#x2019;s Joint has seen a fall in business and rise in costs. Kate is currently in arrears with the landlord. Eviction notices have been sent, court appearances have been made, and if a substantial amount of money is not raised by April 11th, the next court date, the doors will shut permanently at Kate&#x2019;s Joint. The East Village will lose another neighborhood landmark.

<p>Anyone who has ever met Kate knows how hard she has worked over the past 15 years, and how dedicated she is to this business. She has many plans to increase business, including transforming a section of the restaurant in to a bakery featuring vegan and gluten free baked goods, reaching a new market of morning commuters who would be able to grab a cup of coffee and a vegan muffin on their way to work. That being said, first thing is first, fighting off this eviction!</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>So far they&apos;ve raised just over $1,000, and there&apos;s only 9 days left&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322063504/http://www.indiegogo.com/savekatesjoint?c=home">help</a>, or you may never eat another vegan disco fry in your life.</p>
