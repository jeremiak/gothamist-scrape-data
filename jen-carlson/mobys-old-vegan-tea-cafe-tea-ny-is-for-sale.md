<p>TeaNY, once called &quot;the best tea cafe on earth&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101124358/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qriV35wdBto&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL47994889DBB21232">by this guy</a>, is for sale. The tea and vegan cafe was opened 10 years ago (!) at 90 Rivington Street, and was the creation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101124358/http://gothamist.com/tags/moby">Moby</a> and his then-girlfriend Kelly Tisdale.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101124358/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2012/07/teany-cafe-on-rivington-street-for-sale/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BoweryBoogieALowerEastSideChronicle+%28Bowery+Boogie%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher">Bowery Boogie</a> points out, &quot;The second half of their decade residency on the block has been quite tough for TeaNY. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101124358/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/03/breaking_teany.php">Moby eventually divested</a> from the institution he helped create; a fire at 90 Rivington Street in June 2009 crippled operations for a year; the Department of Health mandated a forced-closure back in January, but the tea spot reopened a short week later with new management and a lime-green makeover.&quot; This is a turn-key operation, and while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101124358/http://www.nycrs.com/listings-cols2/view-property/turn-key-cafe-for-sale.html?returndefault=0">this listing</a> says it&apos;s $130,000/month, in the below flyer they&apos;re asking $130,000 + rent $5,800/month rent:</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear what will happen with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101124358/http://www.teanybeverages.com/">TeaNY beverage company</a>, which produces bottled TeaNY tea sold in stores.</p>
