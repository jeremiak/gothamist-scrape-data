<p>Is the world&#x2019;s first steampunk bar (according to owner Andy Heidel) at risk of shutting down before it even gets started? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430080126/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/1/33_01_sk_way_station.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that Prospect Heights&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430080126/http://waystationbk.blogspot.com/">Way Station</a> has high hopes of becoming a live-music venue... but can&apos;t seem to get a liquor license. </p>

<p>Heidel describes the process as &quot;Kafka meets Catch 22. Fortunately, I haven&#x2019;t woken up as a giant cockroach... yet.&#x201D; Currently he&apos;s hosting one-off events in the space with one-night liquor licenses, but has failed to book any bands on a regular schedule because they fear there will be no audience without alcohol (people: make a crazy Steampunk flask!).</p>

<p>Currently there&apos;s at least another three months to go in which Heidel needs to stay afloat without being able to serve alcohol, and this Thursday night he&apos;ll be hosting a New Year&#x2019;s Eve bash and fundraiser. The paper suggest attending, since &quot;the Way Station&#x2019;s survival is crucial to the neighborhood... [as] the first live venue on this rejuvenated section of Washington Avenue.&quot;</p>
