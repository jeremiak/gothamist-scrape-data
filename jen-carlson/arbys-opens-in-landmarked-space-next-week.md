<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:225px; "> <img alt="arbys0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111130071133im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/arbys0110.jpg" width="225" height="278"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111130071133/http://lostnewyorkcity.blogspot.com/">Lost City</a></span></i></div> If your mouth is watering for a big, juicy roast beef sandwich, you only have one more week until you can sink your teeth into some processed meat... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111130071133/http://gothamist.com/tags/arbys">Arby&apos;s</a> opens inside of the gorgeous Gage &amp; Tollner space next Thursday! For almost a year now there&apos;s been chatter about the fast food joint taking over the landmarked space &#x2014; many opposed to the franchise moving in to such fancy digs for its first outpost in the borough.<p></p>

<p>The Landmarks Preservation Commission eventually gave the franchise owner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111130071133/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/11/arbys_is_a-okay_with_lpc.php">their approval</a>, however &#x2014; mostly insisting that the gas lamps and wall-length mirrors stay put.</p>

<p>So fight it no longer, people: it&apos;s happening. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111130071133/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=5&amp;id=32905">The Brooklyn Eagle</a> reports that there will be a soft opening at the 372-374 Fulton Street space on January 21st. This will be followed by a more formal opening weeks later. Can a place that offers &quot;Horsey Sauce&quot; really host a soft <em>or</em> formal opening?</p>
