<p>Meanwhile, the proposed Trans Gas power plant on the North Brooklyn waterfront, which has been met with local <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326052530/http://www2.nysun.com/article/73978">opposition</a>, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326052530/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/17/31_17_power_plant_gets_renewed.html">started an appeal</a>; the Bloomberg administration&#x2019;s goal is currently &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326052530/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/20/brooklyns_new_o.php">to build Bushwick Inlet Park</a> between North Eighth and North 14th streets. But the city still does not control the Transgas site.&quot; </p>
