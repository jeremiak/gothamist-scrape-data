<p>The Target ad currently adorning to the 6 train certainly isn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve seen subway wrap ads (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115704/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/02/mta_unveils_first_adwrapped_subway.php">back in 2008</a> the History Channel took over the 42nd Street shuttle). However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115704/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/target-and-mta-unveil-first-full-length.html">NYC the Blog</a> notes this is the &quot;first ever full length train completely wrapped in advertising to run on the New York City subway system.&quot; Don&apos;t expect a new look once you step inside, though&#x2014;the wrapping is just on the outside (as opposed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115704/http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=452561&amp;id=406462895056">the Holland shuttle</a> which gave the train&apos;s interior a makeover).</p>

<p>The ad will generate $250,000 in revenue for the MTA, and will run for six weeks to promote the new Target in East Harlem opening next month&#x2014;check out a few more photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115704/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2010/06/28/transits-first-ad-wrapped-car-debuts-along-the-6/">at Second Ave. Sagas</a>. We&apos;re like <em>thisclose</em> to having <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115704/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/ikea_subway.php">IKEA pay to put couches underground</a>.</p>
