CNN <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152742/http://blogs.thenational.ae/mixed_media/2010/01/hipster-journalism-alert-cnn-teams-up-with-sub-pop-and-vice.html">just announced</a> today that it has teamed up with Vice. Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152742/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/02/wtf_happened_at_the_vice_party.php">that Vice</a>. What do the hipster handbook and the hard news network have in common? First off, VBS.TV is overseen by Spike Jonze &#x2014; which may have intrigued the network, and secondly, they don&apos;t just focus on Williamsburg shenanigans. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152742/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/01/18/vbs.liberia/">here&apos;s their Guide to Liberia</a>. Owner Shane Smith says, &quot;as our company began to evolve and cover stories around the globe, CNN was our first and only choice for a partner. In a world of hyper-partisan opinion-led &apos;news,&apos; CNN&apos;s credibility and reach put it in a class by itself. We couldn&apos;t be more excited with a partner unless it was Jimi Hendrix joining our rock and roll band.&quot; We&apos;re guessing Wolf Blitzer is staying <em>far</em> away from this one.
