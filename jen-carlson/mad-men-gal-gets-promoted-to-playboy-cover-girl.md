<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="tractorlois.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150213im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/tractorlois.jpg" width="225" height="248" class="image-right"> </span>A <em>Mad Men</em> woman has found her way to the cover of <em>Playboy</em> magazine, and she&apos;s got a full-on mid-century themed topless spread inside. No, gents, it&apos;s not the lovely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150213/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinahendricks">Christina Hendricks</a>, and it&apos;s not January Jones (who was practically topless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150213/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/16/were_betty_drapers_breasts_photosho.php">in GQ</a> last year)&#x2014;it&apos;s switchboard operator Lois Sadler! You may remember her from last season&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150213/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/09/an-endlessly-looping-clip-of-mad-mens-lawnmower-sc.html">tractor accident</a>.</p>

<p>In real life that&apos;s character actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150213/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1556400/">Crista Flanagan</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150213/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/07/15/2010-07-15_actress_strip_down_memory_lane.html">the Daily News</a> reports that she was intrigued by the magazine&apos;s pitch of recreating scenes out of &apos;60s-era issues. She also commented on their invitation, saying, &quot;The parts I play, I&apos;m usually a crazy heroin addict or a lunch lady. Nobody&apos;s ever asked me to take off my clothes, or even kiss somebody. I guess I haven&apos;t been seen as a sexy person, and sometimes not even as an attractive person.&quot;</p>

<p>The August issue that Flanagan appears on will also include reproduced ads from that time! Don Draper would be proud. (And we&apos;ll have more on the Season 4 premiere later this week&#x2014;it&apos;s airing this coming Sunday, but AMC was nice enough to send it to us last week.)</p>
