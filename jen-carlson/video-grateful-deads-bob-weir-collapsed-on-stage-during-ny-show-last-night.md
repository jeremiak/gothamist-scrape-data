<p>Seems like just yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080851/http://gothamist.com/tags/gratefuldead">Grateful Dead</a> guitarist Bob Weir was wearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080851/http://i256.photobucket.com/albums/hh185/mattoliverzep/19840703_1870.jpg">his classic short shorts</a>, with his brown hair waving in the wind... but over the years he&apos;s sadly gone more late-Garcia on us. And last night, during a performance with Furthur at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080851/http://gothamist.com/tags/capitoltheater">Port Chester&apos;s Capitol Theatre</a>, he collapsed on stage. The 65-year-old kept on truckin&apos; (sorry) after he was brought a chair, but after a pause bassist Phil Lesh told the crowd that a &quot;strained shoulder&quot; would keep Weir from finishing the show.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080851/http://www.jambase.com/Articles/118467/Bob-Weir-Unable-To-Finish-Furthur-Show-At-Capitol-Theatre-in-Port-Chester">Jambase</a>, Weir was struggling throughout the night.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080851/http://www.furthur.net/tour">The band</a> is scheduled to play Atlantic City on Saturday (and Brooklyn in July)&#x2014;no word yet on whether or not Weir will join them... but our money is on Bob, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080851/http://phishcoventry.blogspot.com/2010/08/bob-weir-stumbles-and-falls.html">who has fallen and gotten right back up before</a>.</p>
