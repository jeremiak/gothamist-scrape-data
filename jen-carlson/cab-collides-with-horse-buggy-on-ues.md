</div></div>					<p>Oh dear. Word just came in over the newswire that a horse and buggy has been struck on East 60th Street and 5th Avenue. The report says there are &quot;2 aided at this point,&quot; and we&apos;ll update as soon as more information becomes available. Hopefully the horse is okay, but either way this will surely give animal rights activists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174008/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">more evidence</a> that horses shouldn&apos;t be lugging tourists around the crowded streets of NYC. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Elizabeth Forel of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174008/http://www.banhdc.org/">Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages</a> writes in, saying &quot;A taxi going south on Fifth Avenue turned into Grand Army Plaza and plowed into a carriage, knocking it over and smashing it.  It is not known if there were any passengers. The taxi continued, crashing into a short wall and causing damage. The horse bolted but is probably OK.  The carriage driver looked &apos;severely injured&apos; according to one bystander&#x2014;removed to an ambulance on a stretcher with a neck/head brace   The taxi driver was also hospitalized.&quot; We&apos;ll update when we get further details on the conditions of the horse and humans.</p>
