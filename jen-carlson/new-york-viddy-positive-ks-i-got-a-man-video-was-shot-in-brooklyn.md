                            <p><em>There&apos;s no time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053750/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_the_Shark">like summer</a> to launch a new series&#x2014;so may we now present: New York Viddy. Just like our old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053750/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycalbumart">NYC Album Art series</a>, we&apos;re going to revisit music videos shot around New York City.

<p>We don&apos;t need to get into details here, but today we&apos;re listening to MTV Party To Go Volumes 1-4.

Remember this <em>video</em>? It was shot in Brooklyn...</p>

<p>There&apos;s not a lot of info out there regarding this video shoot, likely because Positive K&apos;s career went sort of downhill after this hit.

Can you spot any other familiar sites? <em>Where are they brunching?</em></p>
