<p>Over the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145854/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145854/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=611274848909357&amp;set=a.557833087586867.1073741829.504299626273547&amp;type=1">this photo</a> on Facebook, showing her with her arms wrapped around former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson, who she has had a very strenuous relationship with over the past decade or so. The two were all genuine looking smiles! And Love captioned the pic: &#x201C;And this just happened. 2014 going to be a very interesting year.&#x201D; So here come the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145854/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/is-courtney-love-reuniting-hole-20131230">Is Courtney Love Reuniting Hole?</a>&quot; headlines.</p>

<p>While the band did reunite on stage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145854/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/14/video_hole_reunite_at_surprise_show.php">for a Brooklyn show last year</a> (about a year after they said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145854/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/about_last_nights_hole_reunion_at_m.php">they weren&apos;t reuniting</a>), the last time they recorded together in the studio was for the highly successful 1998 album <em>Celebrity Skin</em>. </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if they are even reuniting (maybe they are collaborating on a Hole-branded clothing line!)... but if they are reuniting around music, then it&apos;s even more unclear if this will be for a new album, a reunion show, or a full-on tour. However, since Love has been critical of revisiting the past too much, new music would almost have to be attached to this.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Ms. Love about all of this and will update if we hear back, but she&apos;s probably in the studio finishing up recording the new Hole album with all of the original members and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145854/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/billy_corgan_interview.php">Billy Corgan</a>, so we won&apos;t hold our breath. But if you need some conversation starters for your cocktail party this New Year&apos;s Eve, why not wildly speculate on the Rebirth of Grunge as foretold by this grainy image of the two former bandmates.</p>
