<p>According the paper, out of 1,584 model slots, 94 (6%) went to black models, 17 (1%) to Latinas accounted and 95 (6%) to Asians for 95. Of the 66 designers who showed in Bryant Park&apos;s tents, 18 had no black models, and 6 had all-white lineups. Some in the industry spoke up:</p><blockquote>&quot;I&apos;m disappointed,&quot; supermodel Naomi Campbell told The News when she learned of the findings. &quot;For this to be going on in 2008 is just shocking.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;We are losing the colors in fashion,&quot; said supermodel Tyson Beckford, who was seen applauding the rare black model to strut past him at several shows. &quot;Every season, you notice it&apos;s starting to get worse. We&apos;re not afraid to call them out.&quot;</p></blockquote>The designers point blame at the modeling agencies, however, saying that they don&apos;t send enough models. Michelle Smith, of Milly, said &quot;of the approximately 450 girls we saw on castings from 16 different agencies, only 12 were African-American.&quot; Smith did cast one black model but cut her when she gained weight. Reminding us that fashion pretty much <em>always</em> discriminates.<p></p>
