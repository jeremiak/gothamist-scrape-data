<p>Tourist and locals alike may be interested in this tiny map: a wallet-sized guide of over 250 public toilet locations in Manhattan. Creator Tommy Mintz says, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302050833/http://nyctoiletmap.com/">The New York City Public Toilet Map</a> was unveiled  on Uncle Bob&apos;s Variety Show at the Jewish Museum as part of the Off the Wall: Artists at work. After the presentation, a mob gathered at the edge of the stage to buy copies of the map!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302050833/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/finding-a-toilet-as-performance-art/">The NY Times</a> reports that at age 21, Mintz &quot;received a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, a condition that is caused by inflammation and sores in the lining of the rectum and colon, and causes frequent diarrhea.&quot; So the map is a combination of art and necessity for him.</p>

<p>It&apos;s only $2.50 (including shipping) and you can buy it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302050833/http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=10481089">on Etsy</a>; it would be a wise purchase for those getting around on bike. Of course, those with more advanced technology can access a similar map <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302050833/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/07/map_of_the_day_53.php">on their phone</a>. </p>
