<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084826/http://www.lifeandstylemag.com/2010/10/scene-queens-exclusive-taylor.html">Life &amp; Style</a>, the two were backstage at SNL this weekend, <em>and</em> they were spotted in Brooklyn yesterday; a source told them, &quot;Taylor and Jake were walking around Park Slope holding hands. They looked like a couple!&quot; OMFG!!!1! Just kidding, sometimes celebrities date each other and it&apos;s not really a big deal. </p>

<p>(Besides, we&apos;ll find out all the dirt once they break up and Taylor trashes him in one of her songs.)</p>
