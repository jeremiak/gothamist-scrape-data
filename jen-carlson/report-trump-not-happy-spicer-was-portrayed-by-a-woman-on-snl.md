<p>Over the weekend Melissa McCarthy delivered a pitch perfect portrayal of Sean Spicer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410043748/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/06/sean_spicer_snl_notes.php">on <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>, huffing and puffing at a room full of journalists in the White House Briefing room. It was not far off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410043748/http://dcist.com/2017/01/sean_spicer_lying_liar.php">from what we&apos;ve witnessed in real life</a>. The 8-minute sketch got a lot of attention, and when Spicer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410043748/http://extratv.com/2017/02/05/white-house-press-secretary-sean-spicer-reacts-to-melissa-mccarthys-snl-skit/">was asked</a> about it he shrugged it off, maintaining he hadn&apos;t heard about it until departing church on Sunday, when &quot;his texts had been blowing up so much he thought there must be a national emergency.&quot; Hmmm, wonder who could have been blowing up Spicer&apos;s phone on Sunday morning to talk about <em>Saturday Night Live</em>...</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410043748/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/melissa-mccarthy-sean-spicer-234715">According to Politico</a>, President Trump was not fan of his press secretary being portrayed by a woman, and his &quot;uncharacteristic Twitter silence over the weekend about the SNL sketch&quot; signaled trouble internally&#x2014;&quot;sources said the caricature of Spicer by McCarthy struck a nerve and was upsetting to the press secretary and to his allies, who immediately saw how damaging it could be in Trump world.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicer&#x2019;s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president&#x2019;s eyes, according to sources close to him. And the unflattering send-up by a female comedian was not considered helpful for Spicer&#x2019;s longevity in the grueling, high-profile job in which he has struggled to strike the right balance between representing an administration that considers the media the &quot;opposition party,&quot; and developing a functional relationship with the press.

<p>&quot;Trump doesn&apos;t like his people to look weak,&quot; added a top Trump donor.</p></blockquote>It&apos;s unclear if Trump believes Spicer looked weak <em>because</em> he was portrayed by a woman, but... yes, that is it.<p></p>

<p>You know who didn&apos;t look weak? President Bannon, who, as Death personified, shooed Trump away from the Resolute desk so he could assume his rightful seat of power. </p>

<p>But perhaps Rosie O&apos;Donnell would be an even better fit to portray Bannon. The longtime Trump nemesis has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410043748/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-steve-bannon-saturday-night-live-donald-trump-sean-spicer-melissa-mccarthy">thrown her hat in the ring</a> to play Trump&apos;s chief strategist in an upcoming episode: </p>
