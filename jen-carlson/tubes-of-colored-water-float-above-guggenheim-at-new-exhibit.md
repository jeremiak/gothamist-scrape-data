	<p>Starting tomorrow and running through May 8th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040040/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/gutai-splendid-playground">Gutai&apos;s Splendid Playground</a> will take over the rotunda and walls of the Guggenheim Museum. The centerpiece&#x2014;&quot;Water,&quot; by the late Motonaga Sadamasa&#x2014;consists of tubes floating above the ground floor, each containing a different colored water. The piece is less jarring than Maurizio Cattelan&apos;s 2011 installation, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040040/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/video_maurizio_cattelans_guggenheim.php">featured massive objects dangling from above</a>, but just as playful.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The radically inventive and influential Japanese art collective yielded one of the most important international avant-garde movements to emerge after World War II. Based on fifteen years of research, Gutai: Splendid Playground provides a critical examination of both iconic and lesser-known examples of the collective&apos;s dynamic output over its two-decade history and explores the full spectrum of Gutai&#x2019;s creative production: painting, performance, installation art, sound art, experimental film, kinetic art, light art, and environment art.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This is the first North American museum exhibition devoted to the Gutai group, and features 145 works by 25 artists spanning two generations. The playground will be &quot;organized into six chronological and thematic sections presented along the Guggenheim ramps: Play: An Uninhibited Act; Concept: Can a Piece of Cloth Be a Work of Art?; Network: To Introduce Our Works to the World; The Concrete: The Scream of Matter Itself; Performance Painting: Pictures with Time and Space; and Environment: Gutai Art for the Space Age.&quot; There will also be documentary films and stage events; click through for a preview of the show.</p>
