<p>Warner Bros has teamed up with J.K. Rowling to bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220014/http://gothamist.com/tags/harrypotter">Harry Potter</a>&apos;s world back to life on screen, and in NYC! The series of films won&apos;t feature Harry, however, they will be set 70 years before his time, and are based on a Hogwarts textbook title, &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.&quot; The announcement was made on the author&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220014/https://www.facebook.com/JKRowling/posts/441828229259132">Facebook page</a> today, noting the new project will feature the textbook&#x2019;s fictitious author, Newt Scamander.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Although it will be set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where I was so happy for seventeen years, &apos;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&apos; is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Harry Potter series, but an extension of the wizarding world. The laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films, but Newt&#x2019;s story will start in New York, seventy years before Harry&#x2019;s gets underway.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220014/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/12/j-k-rowling-to-write-new-harry-potter-inspired-film-for-warner-bros/?mod=WSJ_hps_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsForth">the WSJ</a> points out, this is the author&apos;s screenwriting debut&#x2014;she said in her statement that she did not want anyone else to write it: &quot;I feel very protective of it and I already knew a lot about Newt.&quot;</p>
