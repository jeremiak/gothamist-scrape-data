<p>The Twin Towers have made it to the big screen more than a few times, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161424/http://danmeth.com/post/9626315905/twintowerscameos">Dan Meth</a> has compiled a reel of all of its cameos between 1969 and 2000. From <em>King Kong</em> to <em>The Wiz</em> to <em>Ghostbusters II</em> to <em>Superman</em> and of course <em>Manhattan</em>, he did a pretty thorough job. Too bad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161424/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/24/philippe_petit_man_on_wire.php"><em>Man On Wire</em></a> didn&apos;t make it in there though... those WTC shots were filmed in 1977, even if the documentary wasn&apos;t released until 2008. What else should have been included?</p>
