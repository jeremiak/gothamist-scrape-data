But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083415/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/03/park_slope_parents_are_aflutte.html">NYMag</a> points out the Park Slope parents, if the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083415/http://www.brooklynian.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=40985&amp;sid=d09cdf5cc9fbaf1a76afb57c66a7910e">Brooklynian</a> message board is any indication, are rather delighted by their future neighbor.</p>

<p>One stroller pusher declared, &quot;How silly of the Post. Where do they think all the babies come from?&quot; Well, certainly not from vibrators, but point taken. Other residents jokingly inquired <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083415/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/01/union_hall_sort.php">if strollers will be allowed</a>, while one commenter declared, &quot;I give Babes two weeks before it looks like the Tea Lounge.&quot; </p>

<p>For the most part, the locals have one message for Babeland, summed up by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083415/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2008/02/streetlevel_ber.php">a commenter</a>: &quot;Park Slope loves you. We can&apos;t wait.&quot; Seems like those two are gonna get along just fine...but won&apos;t someone think of the children?</p>
