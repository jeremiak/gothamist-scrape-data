<p>Just when we were so happy to have Sad Panda <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606074154/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/06/sad_panda_has_returned.php">back in our lives</a>, reader Daniel Albanese sends us these photos of Spongebob Squarepants. Our first thought was, no big deal, it&apos;s not like this city isn&apos;t big enough for the two of these guys. However, prepare to have your minds blown here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606074154/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadpanda">Sad Panda</a> and Spongebob Squarepants are <em>one in the same</em>. Right? </p>

<p>First of all, they&apos;re in the same spot, and never at the same time; secondly, eagle-eyed Albanese points out that their tip signs are a little bit <em>too</em> similar (just look at the colors and handwriting). If true, and let&apos;s face facts, it is, then this is sad news for Sad Panda lovers citywide. Why? The Sad Panda is a pure, elusive symbol onto which New Yorkers can project all their hopes and fears; Spongebob is a ubiquitous Viacom marketing tool. So this revelation makes Sad Panda a sell-out, and that&apos;s just sad.</p>
