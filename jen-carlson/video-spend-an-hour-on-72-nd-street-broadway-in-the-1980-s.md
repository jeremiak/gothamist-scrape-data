<p>The Upper West Side in the 1980s may not have been as yuppified as it seemed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010045/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/video_carly_simon_rocks_the_uws_in.php">that Carly Simon video we revisited</a> recently&#x2014;<em>shockingly</em> that music video was not totally accurate. Below you can travel back to 72nd Street and Broadway in 1982 and 1983 for about one full hour&#x2014;you&apos;ll get street scenes, old cabs and busses, the NYPD, and New Yorkers talking about getting cable television! You&apos;ll also meet Mrs. Meyers as she buys her daily newspapers (check out the headlines)&#x2014;she tells the camera, &quot;I&apos;ll never be happy... not around here,&quot; right before another woman chimes in, &quot;Tell them to stop making all the apartments condominiums, we can&apos;t afford it.&quot;</p>
