Turns out while some thought the sale of the hotel&#x2014;which has been in the same family for 65 years&#x2014;would be the death of it, it may just be dead already! Michael Musto told the paper, &#x201C;Its legend has been slowly evaporating.&quot; Now tenant Ed Hamilton seems to be questioning ... <em>everything</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190105/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2010/12/whimper.html">He asks</a> (and asks and asks): </p>

<blockquote>Chelsea Does Cara Buckley&apos;s article get it right on the money?  Are we really going to go  &quot;quietly into the night?&quot;  Is this the end of the line for the Chelsea Hotel&apos;s famous spirit of non-conformity and resistance? When did we lose our famous ability to &quot;inspire terror in the streets&apos;?  Are New Yorkers &quot;shrugging&quot; at our plight out of unconcern or bewilderment?  How will history remember the present tenants?</blockquote>

<p>We, on the other hand, only have one question: how has the Hotel Chelsea seemingly escaped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190105/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bedbugs</a>? Maybe that place is magic and we should just leave it alone.</p>
