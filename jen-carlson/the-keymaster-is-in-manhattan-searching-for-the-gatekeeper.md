<p>Over in Greenwich Village, someone is in search of the Gatekeeper, and our money&apos;s on the Keymaster. Have you seen this demigod around? She may also answer to the name &quot;Zuul,&quot; but given she has the ability to possess human hosts and then change into native form whenever necessary, it may be tough to track this one down. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412234610/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/dan_aykroyd_may_recast_bill_murray.php">without Peter Venkmen around</a>, we&apos;re going to need to do our best, New York. So be on watch, because if these two find each other and open the door for Gozer, things are gonna get weird around these parts.</p>
