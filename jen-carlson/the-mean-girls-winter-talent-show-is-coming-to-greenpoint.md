<p>The 2004 hit <em>Mean Girls</em> had a lot of great moments, but the Winter Talent Show was one of the highlights. And now, the fine people at BBQ Films will bring it to life in Brooklyn&#x2014;they&apos;re transforming the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161208152409/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/06/rejoice_the_brooklyn_bazaar_is_baaa.php">Brooklyn Bazaar</a> space into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161208152409/http://meangirls.wikia.com/wiki/North_Shore_High_School">North Shore High School</a> auditorium on December 14th, for one night only. They&apos;ll be showing the film, but they&apos;ll also surround guests with immersive elements evoking the movie&apos;s world, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161208152409/http://gothamist.com/tags/bbqfilms">that&apos;s what they do best</a>. </p>

<p>You&apos;ll likely see a reenactment of this number:</p>
