										<p>This video takes you on an underground ride from 14th Street to 42nd Street. Not that exciting, right? Well it was filmed in 1905. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114813/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/12/14th-42th.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> notes, watch to the 5:00 mark where it gets <em>real</em> good.</p>

At 42nd St, the line runs crosstown to Times Square and then up the 1/2/3.&quot;</p>
