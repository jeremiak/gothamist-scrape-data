<p>Need to warm up? This story should give you the warm fuzzies (sorry). City Harvest reports (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170152/http://www.facebook.com/CityHarvestNYC#!/album.php?aid=319785&amp;id=29095531180">their Facebook</a>) that &quot;FreshDirect donated approximately 72,000 pounds of food this week after Monday&#x2019;s snowstorm brought business to a halt on the East Coast.&quot; The food would have gone undelivered and to waste otherwise. This is a photo from this morning&apos;s 1,000 pound drop off at the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen in Chelsea.</p>
