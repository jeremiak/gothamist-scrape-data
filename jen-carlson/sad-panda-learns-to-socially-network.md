<p>It&apos;s been far too long since we checked in on Sad Panda, but now it&apos;ll be a little easier to keep an eye on the furry one. Someone has started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725030842/http://twitter.com/#!/Sad_PandaNYC">Sad Panda Twitter</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725030842/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sad-Panda-of-NYC/229858433722454?sk=wall">Facebook page</a> for him and his fans! The bio reads: &quot;Chronicling the Going-ons of Sad Panda: The Financial District&apos;s Favorite Furry.&quot;</p>

<p>If you aren&apos;t aware of Sad Panda, please take a few moments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725030842/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadpanda">to catch up</a> on his history. We first spotted him back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725030842/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/26/spotted_sad_panda.php#photo-1">March of 2009</a>, and continued to follow his work since&#x2014;even prompting one filmmaker to dip deeper in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725030842/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/18/sad_panda_behind_the_mask.php">a video expose&apos;</a> of the man behind the mask.</p>

<p>Have you spotted him lately?</p>
