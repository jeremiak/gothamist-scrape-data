</div></div>					<p>Last night we continued tradition and hosted our annual Canada Day Poutine Dinner with NY1&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053850/http://gothamist.com/tags/patkiernan">Pat Kiernan</a>. In the past we&apos;ve hit up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053850/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/20/ny1s_pat_kiernan_takes_gothamist_re.php#photo-1">Pommes Frites</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053850/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/poutine.php#photo-1">Mile End</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053850/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/photos_a_belated_canada_day_celebra.php#photo-1">Windfall Bar</a> for an evening with the gravy-laden Canadian dish. This year we brought our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053850/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/02/win_spots_to_our_belated_canada_day.php">contest winners</a> to Brooklyn, Kiernan&apos;s new home borough, and managed to find an Australian joint that serves poutine. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053850/http://www.sheepstation.net/">Sheep Station</a> is located on 4th Avenue (at the corner of Douglass Street) in Park Slope, and they deliver a very decent dish of poutine for just $6 (our crew devoured multiple plates quicker than you can &quot;Canuck&quot;). Their menu also includes everything from calamari to minced meat pie to fish &amp; chips (we also recommend their veggie burger, which comes with a fried egg on top!).</p>
