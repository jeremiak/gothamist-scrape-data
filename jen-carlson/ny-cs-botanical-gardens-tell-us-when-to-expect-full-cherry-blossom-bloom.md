<p>Yesterday morning Gothamist&apos;s Tien Mao happened upon *the only blooming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234433/http://gothamist.com/tags/cherryblossoms">cherry blossom tree</a> in Brooklyn Botanic Garden (pictured above... and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234433/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/31/first_cherry_blossoms_of_2013_have.php">here&apos;s a mix we made for it</a>)&#x2014;so when will petals everywhere be briefly turning pink? We asked both the Queens, New York Botanical, and Brooklyn Botanic Gardens for some updates on the trees:</p>

Melanie Sifton, VP of horticulture at BBG, told us yesterday: &#x201C;Considering the nice forecast for the next few days, we should see good momentum in the flowering cherries: the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden will be the first place to look, since their weeping higan cherries are the earliest in the Hanami sequence. The cultivars and allees of Prunus &#x2018;Kanzan&#x2019; on Cherry Esplanade will likely be later in the month, unaffected by the recent cold temperatures&#x2014;this winter has been perfectly normal for the plant world at BBG. Keep all eyes on CherryWatch!&#x201D;</p>

A rep at the NYBG told us yesterday, &quot;The Japanese Apricot, which is one of the absolute earliest, is flowering in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234433/http://www.nybg.org/gardens/home-gardening">Home Gardening Center</a>.&quot; And the Associate Curator of Woody Plants Deanna Curtis confirms, saying: &#x201C;The earliest flowering cherries are in bloom, and the show will continue with peak display likely at the end of April.&quot;</p>

A rep for the garden told us this morning, &quot;We have one tree with a lovely pink cloud and the rest of the trees are budding!  I would say the blossoms are imminent; perhaps within two weeks?  The cold weather is delaying things a bit.&quot;</p>

<p><em>*Note: There <em>is</em> currently a second blooming tree <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234433/http://www.bbg.org/discover/cherries">on BBG&apos;s map</a>, but we&apos;re told that is a mistake, and at press time just the one tree is in bloom.</em></p>
