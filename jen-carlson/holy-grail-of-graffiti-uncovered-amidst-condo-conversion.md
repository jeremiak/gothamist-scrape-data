Unearthed in the walls was a large mural created by graffiti pioneers Fab Five Freddy and Futura 2000.</p><blockquote>The artwork contains a variety of images and writing executed in spray paint, grease pencil, magic marker and whatever else was on hand &#x2014; in silver, gold, pink and red. There are cartoonlike pictures of a bomber airplane, images of a heart and a cake, and several references to Quaaludes, a popular 1970s party drug.<p></p>

<p>The mural was found in the eighth-floor loft owned by art critic Edit deAk in the late &apos;70s and 1980s &#x2014; a time when much of fringe art, including graffiti, was being validated. The wall is nearly intact, except for gaps where a dishwasher and plumbing were installed years later.</p></blockquote>And that&apos;s not all...one part of the mural is believed to be by Jean Michel Basquiat (his tag &quot;SAMO&quot; also appears in the stairwell). deAk even told the new owners of the building that &quot;There is a Basquiat, and it&apos;s somewhere where you won&apos;t think it is.&quot; This being the beginning of a movement, many in the art world who were consulted agree it&apos;s &quot;a critical piece of history,&quot; and the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of graffiti.<p></p>

<p>So how does one preserve such a thing in the midst of a luxury condo conversion? Wall stabilization, tissue paper and cheesecloth were all involved until the graffiti could be &quot;peeled off&quot; and mounted to a movable panel. That panel is being unveiled for all to see tonight at an exhibit focusing on the graffiti art movement in the early &apos;80s. The show will also include works from Keith Haring, Basquiat, Kenny Scharf and Ero. Titled &quot;The Wild Style Exhibit&quot; will be on view through February 15th at Gallery 151 [151 Wooster St, 2nd Floor].</p>
