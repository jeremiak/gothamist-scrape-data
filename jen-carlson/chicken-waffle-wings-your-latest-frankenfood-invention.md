<p>Did you think your chicken and waffles couldn&apos;t <em>get</em> more intimate on your dinner plate? Well, they can, and a site called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304124727/http://dudefoods.com/chicken-waffle-wings/">Dude Foods</a> (naturally) tells us about a new sweet and savory Franken Finger Food: Chicken and Waffle Wings. You don&apos;t even need to leave the house to get them, which is the way it should be with such gluttonous guilty pleasures. </p>

<p>Nick from Dude Foods writes, &quot;I started off by cooking four &apos;drumette&apos; sections of chicken wings and whipping up some waffle batter. Once that was done I simply dunked the wings in the batter and placed them in my waffle iron with the ends of the wings (which I left unbattered so the wings would be easier to pick up and eat) sticking out. After that all you really need to do is drizzle some syrup over them and you&#x2019;re all set!&quot; Wasn&apos;t that easy?!</p>

<p>We&apos;re left wondering if there isn&apos;t a way to make this recipe even easier, however, and less messy, say, with chicken nuggets? To the laboratory!</p>
