</div></div>					<p>New York City&apos;s public benches have been around for<em>ever</em>; you know them, they&apos;re wooden and green and have become a small little iconic part of the city&apos;s landscape. Recently we shuddered when a park in Brooklyn painted their benches in all sorts of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228230112/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/14/neon_benches.php">eye-cringing neon</a>, and now the Chelsea Improvement Company has introduced a whole new look to the street bench. Their modern take is now located at 10th Avenue and West 16th Street and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228230112/http://www.dnainfo.com/20100901/chelsea-hells-kitchen/new-public-bench-is-unveiled-chelsea">reportedly</a> made of stainless steel&#x2014;designed to reflect Chelsea&apos;s aesthetic. Should this modern bench madness stop before it spreads and consumes all of the classic green benches? Is it too late?!</p>
