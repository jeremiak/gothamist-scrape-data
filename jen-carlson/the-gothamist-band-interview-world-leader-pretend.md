His penpal&apos;s name is Thom Yorke. Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731150610/http://www.radiohead.com/">that</a> Thom Yorke. Music direction travelling across the pond and down the Mississippi into New Orleans is, apparently, working quite well for WLP. Their cd, <em>Punches</em>, is instantly likeable and embraces the noise of the Big Easy with the sounds (imagined and real) taking place beyond it&apos;s borders. Far away from the competitive scene of New York the band was able to take their time and put everything they have into their sound. They partly credit an overactive imagination for churning out one of the more unique (lyrically and musically) albums we&apos;ve heard. At some points it&apos;s the haunting piano keys and vocals that draw you in, at others it&apos;s the fantastical orchestrations and smart lyrics. We suggest you listen to it all, live, tonight at the Mercury Lounge.</p>

<p><b>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</b><br>
We made this low-budget music video for a New Orleans cable access station. It was about 3am, the night before the video was to air, and we had to come up with a name...so we just rummaged through our records and the first thing we came across that was any good was World Leader Pretend...ta da!</p>

<p><b>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York?</b><br>
We made a large portion of our newest record in New York (Harlem) during Christmastime. I had never been in New York in December. It was a very romantic atmosphere. All blizzards &amp; sleigh bells. We were all poor and sleeping six people on the floor of a tiny apartment.<br>
There was also this other time when we were showcasing and one of the labels put us up in this uber-posh hotel..and we each had our own rooms. I remember staying up all night drinking red wine listening to Bowie&apos;s Lodger and The Rolling Stones <em>Angie</em> on repeat saying to ourselves &quot;How did we get here?&quot;<br>
Bad memories...one time I threw up in the Disney store in Times Square when I was 15.</p>
