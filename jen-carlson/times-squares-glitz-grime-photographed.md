</div></div>					<p>Through August 28th, the Yancey Richardson Gallery is looking at Times Square, then and now, the real and the unreal. The exhibit, titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230105146/http://www.yanceyrichardson.com/current/"><em>Glitz &amp; Grime</em></a>, includes photographs taken in or inspired by Times Square, with both contemporary and classic photographers behind the lens. When traveling from 1945 through 2009 in just a few seconds, it&apos;s hard not to miss the old, gritty Crossroads... even if it&apos;s nostalgia for a time we never knew personally.</p>

<p>The top row of photographs are from the exhibit, with the last seven from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230105146/http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;sa=1&amp;q=%22times+square%22+source%3Alife&amp;btnG=Search+images&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=&amp;start=0">the LIFE image gallery</a> we can&apos;t seem to get enough of.</p>
