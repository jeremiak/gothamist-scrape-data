title: Brooklyn Driveway Shed Hits Market At Half A Million Dollars
---

	
										<p>If you look up this home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130234/https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5897771,-73.9861177,3a,89.7y,311.3h,74.82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scC6mujVZPSSyEWwttJmDNw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">on Google Maps</a>, you may think you&apos;re getting a deal, what with the two obvious structures in view being multi-family buildings. But this listing for 86 Bay 47th Street isn&apos;t for one of those, it&apos;s for what appears to be a shed at the end of a driveway that sits between those two buildings.</p>

<span class="photo_caption">The listing is for this home.</span></p>

<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130234/http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/84-86-Bay-47th-St_Brooklyn_NY_11214_M38448-29620">older listing</a> shows that it was paired up with 84 Bay 47th Street, and was being sold off as a combined lot for possible redevelopment&#x2014;&quot;Attention builders, 84 &amp; 86 Bay 47 sold as a package only, R5 ZONING, combined lot size 40X97... 86 has one family house with 2 rooms and basement with private drive. Both houses need work.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130234/http://www.trulia.com/property/3213378905-86-Bay-47th-St-Brooklyn-NY-11214#photo-4">newer listing</a> is just for 86, however, and being touted as &quot;better than a condo.&quot; According to the listing, it is unclear if building an extension up or out is an option&#x2014;any potential buyer must verify that with an architect. The 1-bedroom structure comes with a driveway that can fit up to six cars, so it&apos;s on a sizable lot (which is listed as being 20&apos; x 97&apos;)... but is it worth half a million dollars?</p>

<p>The home&#x2014;built in the 1920s&#x2014;sits in the Gravesend area of Brooklyn, just about two blocks from Coney Island Creek, one of NYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130234/http://www.nyenvironmentreport.com/the-promise-uncertain-future-of-coney-island-creek/">polluted waterways</a>.
