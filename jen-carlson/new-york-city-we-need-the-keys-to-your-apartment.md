<p>A little insight into that beach home (we&apos;re told it&apos;s a Cape Codder!) on 1st Street and 1st Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151854/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=200">You know the one</a>. Little is known about it but we recently discovered the following: <br>
</p><ul><li>It was built by the current owner, out of a passion for New England-style architecture.<br>
</li><li>Many of the units, lighthouse included, have New English country home touches inside.</li><li>As for the building, it was part the very first wave of tenements to be rescued from dilapidation. The owner bought it years ago and restored the interior himself.<br>
</li><li>The current renter of the lighthouse unit has planted a whole vegetable garden on the roof!</li></ul><p></p>

<p>On that note, <strong>we&apos;re working on a new video series with the folks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151854/http://www.thirteen.org/insidethirteen/2011/02/17/living-spaces-coming-soon-to-thirteen-org/">at Thirteen</a></strong>, and we need your help! We&apos;re on the search for interesting living spaces in all of the five boroughs&#x2014;more specifically, &quot;strange, ingenuous, awful, beautiful, or unexpected&quot; spaces. Please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151854/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us a tip</a> if you know of any, or if you live in one yourself (in which case, send us a photo and a brief description)! And stay tuned...</p>
