<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522152348/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/05/18/still_laughing.php">Last year we held a Laughable Hype Comedy Show</a> at Tonic, a funnier version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522152348/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/movable_hype/">our Movable Hype shows</a>. This year, we&apos;re holding another one and it&apos;s going to be <em>just</em> like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522152348/http://upcoming.org/event/80198/">this Pitchfork Festival party</a> - except, minus Sunset Rubdown, Voxtrot and the Joggers. If you did the math correctly you&apos;re left with the funny...here are the details:
