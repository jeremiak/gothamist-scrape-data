They say the Tappan Zee, Kosciuszko and Goethals bridges are the worst in the state; with subpar steel, limited sight lines and small lanes amongst the list of hazards. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201555/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/city_bridges_worst_of_worst_05vBrsGTjhMR8od0w2980O">The Post</a> points out that all three bridges are up for reconstruction in the next decade... so we got that going for us.</p>
