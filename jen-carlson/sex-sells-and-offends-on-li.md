<p>Cashing in on the movie is fine, but he placed a sign in his window that read: &quot;Who&apos;s having sex in this city? Either way you need the shoes.&quot; Next thing he knew, he had a violation with his name on it.</p><blockquote>On June 3, the village sent Dann a violation stating that he had installed vinyl lettering on his storefront without a proper permit. While Dann had never filed for permission to post a sign in the past, the village&apos;s board of trustees demanded that the lettering be removed.</blockquote>Dann, along with some other shop owners, had never heard of the permit approval process for putting up a sign; he told Newsday, &quot;It&apos;s just an excuse because somebody found it offensive. ... Everyone who passes by calls or stops in to say the window is amazing.&quot; The board noted that, even though citizens complained about the &quot;offensive&quot; language, the only thing <em>they</em> disapproved of was the neon coloring. To date, Dann is holding strong by his pink lettering and leaving the sign in the window. And if you&apos;re looking for a place to purchase Samantha&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141104070948/http://www.imnotobsessed.com/node/45403">Giuseppe Zanotti crystal fishbone shoe</a>, as worn in the movie, they&apos;re waiting for you in Great Neck for just under a grand! <p></p>
