<p>A few days ago some street artists went to the Midwood section of Brooklyn&#x2014;where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113629/http://gothamist.com/tags/adamyauch">Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch</a> attended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113629/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/04/beastie_boys_tour.php">Edward R. Murrow High School</a>&#x2014;and created a mural for the late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113629/http://gothamist.com/tags/beastieboys">Beastie Boy</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113629/http://entreelifestyle.com/wpblog/mca-gratitude-tribute-mural/">Entree Lifestyle</a> crew, who put it up, write:</p>

<blockquote>On a personal note, the Beastie Boys were like older brothers to us. Inspiring us as rappers, stereotype crushers, instrumentalists, culture kings, videographers, editors, business men, show men and as exceptional and special human beings. Thank you for the inspiration, for this and many many more good reasons, in the heart of Midwood Brooklyn, where it all began, we payed tribute to the energy he gave us in the best way we knew how. Thank you for your contributions to music, art, and humanity. Shout outs to Mike-D, King Ad Rock, and all of the family and friends of Adam Yauch. Our condolences during these difficult times. MCA&apos;s essence lives on.</blockquote>Well done.

<p>If you spot any more tributes around town, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113629/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">please alert us</a>. And earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511113629/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/dmc.php">DMC told us</a> &quot;there&apos;s definitely going be a memorial&quot; soon, though it&apos;s unclear if it will be open to the public&#x2014;and there may be two, &quot;The problem is this: he was Jewish, but he became a Buddhist. So they&apos;ve got to figure out how to honor both of them.&quot;</p>
