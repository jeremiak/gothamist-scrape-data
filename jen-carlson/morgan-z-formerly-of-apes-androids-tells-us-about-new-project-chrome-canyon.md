Even though they&apos;ve disbanded, it&apos;s exciting that many of them continue to make music, and this weekend Morgan Z (the band&apos;s former keyboardist) will debut his new project: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150204060417/http://www.chrome-canyon.com/">Chrome Canyon</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150204060417/http://soundcloud.com/chromecanyon">listen here</a>). He has already released an EP, entitled <em>Body Music</em>, with French label On The Fruit Records, and later this year he&apos;ll be releasing a full length, called <em>Elemental Themes</em>. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>This week we asked Morgan a few questions about what he&apos;s been doing since he took off the blue velvet unitard, check it out below before seeing Chrome Canyon&apos;s first live show, this Saturday at Mercury Lounge (and yes, there will be a light show).</em></p>

<p><strong>What have you been doing since Apes &amp; Androids disbanded?</strong> It took a while to sort of find a comfortable identity and direction to go in&#x2014;maybe playing in a band where I was dressed in velour unitards and wearing glitter makeup had something to do with that confusion.  Around that time I had started a private studio in Greenpoint where I was working on random stuff and recording other people.  Then one day Carl, the tech guru who helped me build the place (cool guy&#x2014;grew up working with Les Paul and built a lot of studios), he found a Juno 60&#x2014;which is a pretty swell analog synth Roland made in the &apos;80s&#x2014;in the dumpster outside his building.  He replaced the battery inside and the thing worked perfectly&#x2014;so he gave it to me for a pretty good price, and that got me on a synth kick. So now I have about a dozen, and it just keeps growing.  I started working on electronics and stuff as well, and now when one of these ol&apos; things breaks I can usually fix &apos;em, which is really satisfying for a nerd like me.</p>

<p><strong>When did Chrome Canyon become your main focus?</strong> Chrome Canyon is fairly new, but I&apos;ve been fiddling with this sort of groovy electronic film-score stuff for a while&#x2014;there&#x2019;s even elements of it in when I was going through my &quot;beat making&quot; hip hop phase in high school.  But until a few years ago I was heavily into the digital stuff&#x2014;virtual instruments and laptop recording, etc. </p>

<p>When I started working outside the box (meaning with the analog stuff and in my studio) a light definitely clicked on for me, I finally figured out how to achieve all the rich textures and tambours that come with the imperfections of &quot;real world&quot; electronics&#x2014;they go out of tune, they change slightly take to take. I mean, people have been saying that stuff makes a difference for years, but I never really believed the hype&#x2026; now I absolutely do.  So as soon as I could stop fiddling with the software and concentrate on actual composition (I trained as a classical pianist, but I wasn&apos;t really using any of those skills) I found that I was creating all this material, and that became Chrome Canyon.</p>

<p><strong>Do you record everything at your Greenpoint studio? What kind of process do you go through?</strong> Yes I record everything in my studio, and mostly just back in the control room where I can stack all my keyboards around me , although I do have a nice big live room where we tracked the drums.  For a track like &quot;Branches,&quot; which is on the full length album I&#x2019;m planning on releasing later this year, I would basically record everything except the drums.  That song probably has about 40 layers of synthesizers, stacked to get a really rich sound.  I basically built everything to a temp drum track, then my friend Tyler Thacker (a genius of a musician and artist) would come in a track the drums for me.  His performances were epic, and really took the music up a notch I think.  And I was incredibly pleased at the type of sound we could get from the drums, that would really solidify the tracks and give me the inspiration for the final touches.</p>

<p><strong>With something like &quot;Suspended in Gaffa,&quot; how did you decide to work on that song? And how did you make it so... amazing? I love Kate Bush, and the original, but this version is just so insane, I consistently choose to listen to it over the original.</strong> &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; was one of those things that just happened spontaneously.  I&apos;ve always loved Kate Bush (who doesn&apos;t?) but to try to cover her is somewhat dubious&#x2014;she&apos;s just really one of a kind.  But I have to give credit to Phoebe on that track&#x2014;her voice is just unbelievable.  The original song was one both Phoebe and I loved, so one day I just figured out the chords and tried to make something interesting sounding that Phoebe could sing over.  Then in one afternoon Phoebe just came in and tracked all the vocals&#x2014;so effortless.  And I thought it sounded so great that we decided to just put it out for free as sort of an homage. I&apos;m planning on recording a lot more stuff with Phoebe&#x2014;original material, and some more covers&#x2014;probably for the next record.</p>

<p><strong>Will you be able to bring songs like that to the stage?</strong> Eventually yes! For right now though, the live show is mostly stuff from the full length record I will be releasing, and from the EP I&apos;ve already put out&#x2014;so no vocals.  But I&apos;m hoping that as soon as we have some more material, Phoebe will be up on stage singing it.</p>

<p><strong>What can people expect from the upcoming album?</strong> Hmm, how do you describe your own album&#x2026; I guess it&apos;s sorta a cross of a lot of the influences that I grew up with (somewhat of a &quot;soundtrack&quot; in terms of genre and narrative). Vangelis and Tangerine Dream are pillers, there&apos;s some Pink Floyd, some Kraftwerk, Wendy Carlos definitely is in there, and so is Georgio Moroder, and the more contemporary French geniuses&#x2014;Air, Daft Punk, etc.  </p>

<p>I&apos;d say I owe a lot to John Carpenter whose music (and films) I&apos;m a huge fan of.  But I&apos;m also hoping that amongst those things there&apos;s something of my own voice shining through.  Most people who have heard it have told me it needs to be set to a film.  I couldn&apos;t agree more&#x2014;please someone if you&apos;re reading this set it to a film&#x2014;and preferably a good one! But yeah&#x2014;put it on, get stoned, you know&#x2026; that kind of album.</p>

<p><strong>And your live shows? Are these basically going to be instrumental? What kinds of instruments will be up there with you?</strong> The shows for now are instrumental&#x2014;since all the tracks on this record are instrumental.  I&apos;ve actually went completely nerd on this and programmed an entire synchronized light show&#x2014;so hopefully it will be something people can sorta get lost in.  It&apos;s three of us playing, we all were actually in Ape &amp; Androids, Eric played bass, and Pablo played percussion (he&#x2019;s on drums with me).  I&apos;ll be playing some analog synths, and a theremin.  I had a professional thereminist actually record on a couple tracks which are on the record, but since I just started playing (and theremin, for those that don&apos;t know, is basically the hardest instrument in the fucking world to play) I might end up making a complete ass of myself.</p>
