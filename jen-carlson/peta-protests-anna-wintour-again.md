<p>Last night anti-fur activists (at least four of them!) descended on Pratt Institute as Vogue editrix and fur-lover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424015502/http://gothamist.com/tags/annawintour">Anna Wintour</a> delivered a speech at the Brooklyn campus. Along with their &quot;Fur Is Worn by Beautiful Animals and Ugly People&quot; posters featuring Wintour&apos;s face, they also brought a lifelike skinned fox to illustrate their crusade. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424015502/http://gothamist.com/tags/peta">PETA</a>&apos;s VP Tracy Reiman says, &quot;We scoured photo agencies for the shot that most accurately reflects Wintour&apos;s selfish, cruel nature, and although there were many candidates, this one summed it up best. Wintour is the perfect poster girl for one of the most hideous industries on the planet.&quot; Vogue&apos;s editorial and advertising pages are often filled with fur, and the organization would like Wintour to put a stop to it... which will happen right around the time she puts scrunchies and sweatpants on the cover.</p>
