<p>While the <em>real</em> Gotham City is right here, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/25/gotham.php">of course</a>, sometimes other cities are used to portray it on film&#x2014;you know, since we&apos;re so terribly busy and important here in New York. And so it goes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a> has now relocated from Manhattan to... Newark. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/11/02/expect-n-j-commuter-chaos-this-week-as-the-dark-knight-rises-reportedly-films-in-newark/?utm_source=home&amp;utm_medium=dl&amp;utm_campaign=gotham-new-jersey">CBS</a>, the cast and crew are in the Garden State today and tomorrow, prompting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/dark_knight_filming_in_newark.html">major traffic concerns for New Jersey commuters</a>&#x2014;the Newark Light Rail from Penn Station to Broad Street Station will not be running for the two days, and car traffic will be rerouted.</p>

<p>The movie is in the final stages of filming, and has tried to keep their moves under wraps (calling themselves <em>Magnus Rex</em> on production signs around town). Even Newark Mayor Cory Booker hadn&apos;t announced their plans to film in the city, eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://twitter.com/#!/CoryBooker/status/129366787014930433">Tweeting</a>, &quot;Holy mum batman! I keep super hero secrets,&quot; after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://westward.patch.com/articles/dark-knight-rising-in-newark-officials-won-t-say">this article</a> came out.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect to see the final product in theaters until next summer, but the trailer will start screening before Guy Ritchie&apos;s <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/the-dark-knight-rises-trailer-to-debut-with-sherlock/251297?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">on December 16th</a>, and &quot;a six-minute prologue to the movie is expected to screen before <em>Mission: Impossible&#x2014;Ghost Protocol</em>&quot; next month as well. Until then, did you see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104133909/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/dark-knight-rises-set-photos-hint-batcopter-action-manhattan-article-1.969961?localLinksEnabled=false">these sweet photos</a> of the Batcopter down on Wall Street this week?</p>
