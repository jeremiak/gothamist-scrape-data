title: Watch Josh Groban Sing Donald Trump's Tweets
---

	
										<p>Even the angelic voice of Josh Groban can&apos;t make Donald Trump sound like less of a stale old bag of hot air. Last night Groban appeared on Jimmy Kimmel to sing some of Trump&apos;s &quot;best&quot; tweets&#x2014;including, &quot;Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart,&quot; and &quot;Amazing how the haters &amp; losers keep tweeting the name &apos;Fuckface Von Clownstick&apos; like they are so original &amp; like no one else is doing it.&quot;</p>

<p>Kimmel didn&apos;t stop there, he also created a beautiful homage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121091950/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/17/donald_trump_local_hero.php">Donald &quot;Batman&quot; Trump</a>.</p>
