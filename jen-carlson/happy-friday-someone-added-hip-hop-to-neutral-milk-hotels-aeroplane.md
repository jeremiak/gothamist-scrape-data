<p>In the interest of passing something along that may make you smile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603061344/http://psycosis.bandcamp.com/track/look-at-the-two-headed-boy">here is a mash-up</a> of Neutral Milk Hotel&apos;s <em>In The Aeroplane Over The Sea</em> and a whole bunch of rap and hip hop songs. For the purists, this is probably a nightmare, but for the rest, giving <em>In My G4 Over Da Sea by Neutral Bling Hotel</em> a listen is worth it. Yes, we&apos;re really telling you that listening to something called <em>In My G4 Over Da Sea by Neutral Bling Hotel</em> is a good idea. Honest! </p>

<p>Sure, &quot;Oh Dougie&quot; (nee &quot;Oh Comely&quot;) could have probably been better, and you may not want to think <em>too</em> deeply about a version of &quot;Ghost&quot; now existing with Eminem rapping over it, but other than that, good stuff&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603061344/http://psycosis.bandcamp.com/track/look-at-the-two-headed-boy">download it here</a>.
