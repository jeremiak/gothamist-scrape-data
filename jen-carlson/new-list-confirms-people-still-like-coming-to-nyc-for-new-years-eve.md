<span class="photo_caption">...and also like to leave us with a big mess. (Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104082227/http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinyca/5312796556/">ChristiNYCa&apos;s Flickr</a>)</span></p>

<p>In Priceline&apos;s world, the Lower East Side is the 46th best spot in the United States to celebrate New Year&apos;s Eve. In a &quot;news release&quot; the company sent out, spotted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104082227/http://evgrieve.com/2011/12/lower-east-side-named-46th-best-spot-in.html">EV Grieve</a>, they say their &quot;top destinations list is based on thousands of hotel booking requests made by customers for the New Year&apos;s weekend.&quot; The neighborhood comes behind places like Orlando, Minneapolis, and Miami&apos;s International Airport Area... but then again, that neighborhood has less hotel rooms to offer.</p>

<p>The rest of New York City is doing quite well, however, and if you look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104082227/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pricelinecom-agodacom-release-lists-of-top-new-years-party-spots-2011-12-26">the entire list</a> you&apos;ll see that America still loves us, with Times Square coming in at #1. On top of that, New York City neighborhoods took seven of the top 10 spots, and 14 of the 50 spots on the list, followed by Vegas (baby). A rep at the company says &quot;New York City will be helped this year by a weather forecast that calls for warmer than usual temperatures over the holiday weekend.&quot; <em>The weather</em>, really? You might as well credit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104082227/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/video_new_years_eve_trailer_release.php">Garry Marshall</a> and all these people:</p>

<p>C&apos;mon, Priceline, we&apos;re being helped by <em>being New York City</em>. </p>
