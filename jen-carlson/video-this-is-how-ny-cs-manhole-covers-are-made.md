<p>In her documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161011045358/http://castinindia.com/"><em>Cast In India</em></a>, filmmaker and anthropologist Natasha Raheja travels to a dirt-floor factory in Howrah, India to show where and how our city&apos;s manhole covers are made. She told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161011045358/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/06/short-film-showcase-see-where-nycs-manhole-covers-come-from/">National Geographic</a> in an interview earlier this year that the subject matter interested her because the objects &quot;are an iconic and ubiquitous part of New York City&#x2019;s urban landscape. I became curious about how these pieces of city anatomy are made. I wanted to learn more about the labor infrastructure concealed in the built infrastructure of our cities.&quot;</p>

<p>Her observational piece also shows the &quot;disparate conditions that shape the geographies of production and consumption of everyday urban objects.&quot; Below, watch as barefoot workers stomp the shape into these 300-lb metal covers that we walk over every day.</p>

<p>The workers are unionized, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161011045358/http://www.thedrive.com/article/654/the-secret-history-of-nycs-manholes">according to Drive</a>, and the film also shows &quot;their struggle to negotiate a new contract with their employer. &apos;They are politicized and know they deserve more for what they do,&apos;&quot; Raheja noted.</p>
