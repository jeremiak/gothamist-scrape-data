<p>Wanna spend the weekend with Woody Allen? That documentary we first mentioned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122727/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/woody_allen_thinks_annie_hall_is_ok.php">in August</a> is finally going to air on PBS starting this weekend, all three and a half hours of it. Allen hasn&apos;t historically been the most revealing public figure, so the American Masters documentary is pretty unprecedented, and it seems Allen only agreed to it because his longtime pal Robert Weide (the director of it) convinced him. </p>

<p>Weide explored Allen&apos;s writing habits, casting, directing, and his relationships with his actors, even getting on set access when Allen was filming <em>You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger</em> in London (usually Allen doesn&apos;t allow <em>anyone</em> on set). So what can you really expect? We already know that Allen reveals he sort of thought <em>Manhattan</em> sucked, but here&apos;s a little bit more of a sneak peek. </p>
