title: 62 Things We Will Never Do In NYC Again
---

	
										<p>New York City&apos;s still got it and always will (until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170117210125/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/13/nyc_climate_change_map.php">we&apos;re buried by the Atlantic Ocean</a> in a couple of decades), but this town&apos;s insatiable dynamism has a way of obliterating many of the places we love and sentimentally we cherish, inexorably shuffling our favorite unique things into the gutter of oblivion, more and more each year. It was always thus. Your favorite dive bar is probably long gone, that movie theater you saw the original <em>Star Wars</em> at is now a Chase Bank, you&apos;re paying to get onto the subway in a completely different way, you probably can&apos;t afford your neighborhood anymore, or the next neighborhood over. We&apos;ve compiled the below list of things that are now extinct or impossible to do in NYC in 2016, but it&apos;s just the tip of the iceberg. Enjoy? And see you at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170117210125/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/04/pain_has_a_face_urban_outfitters_wi_1.php">the Urban Outfitters mall</a> on North 6th later, we&apos;re taking an Uber. </p>
