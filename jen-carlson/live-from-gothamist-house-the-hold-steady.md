</div></div>					<p>This past Tuesday afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211165749/http://theholdsteady.net/">The Hold Steady</a> came by to perform a few songs for our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211165749/http://gothamist.com/tags/LiveatGothamistHouse">Live at Gothamist House</a> series. This time we departed our HQ and went over to Ridgewood, Queens&#x2014;where we watched, filmed and recorded the band on a gorgeous roofdeck-equipped recording studio called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211165749/http://floridakeysnyc.com/">Florida Keys NYC</a>. We&apos;ll post all of the videos, as well as an interview and downloadable MP3s of the live recording we did, at a later date&#x2014;but for now, here&apos;s one video of them performing &quot;The Weekenders&quot; off their new album <em>Heaven Is Whenever</em>. The band just embarked on a long tour, and won&apos;t return to play in the city until October (when they&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211165749/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1D004482D6E291BB">at the Beacon Theater</a>). </p>

<p>P.S.: In the future we&apos;ll be hosting contests where <em>you</em> will be able to win a chance to attend these filmings (keep an eye out in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211165749/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/10/pencil_this_in_988.php">our newsletter</a> for those).</p>
