<i>Ashes and Snow</i> is a new exhibit featuring more than 200 large-scale photographic works and an accompanying 35mm film by artist Gregory Colbert. The works reveal the artistic nature of animals as they interact with man. Sounds like a typical art exhibit, no? <br>
Part of its charm, or rather intrigue, is that renowned architect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423192705/http://images.google.com/images?q=Shigeru+Ban&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=ii&amp;oi=imagest">Shigeru Ban</a> designed a Nomadic Museum to house <i>Ashes and Snow</i>, making him the first to take on such and endeavor. The result is a 45,000 sq ft (that&apos;s totally like the same size as our 6th floor walkup apartment!) temporary structure, composed of mostly recyclable materials. The structure will be taken apart and reconstructed at different ports around the globe.</p>

<p>The opening of this show in New York is coinciding with the release of the artists novel, of which the exhibit is named after. Ah yes, a literary component to the art. <i>Ashes and Snow: A Novel in Letters</i> is a <i>fictional account of a man who, over the course of a yearlong journey, composes 365 letters to his wife. The origin of the title [Ashes and Snow] is revealed in the 365th letter. Colberts photographs and one-hour film loosely reference the travelers encounters and experiences described in the letters.</i> </p>

<p>Okay, so we have art, a film, a museum made of shipping containers and paper tubing, and a novel by the artist. In summary: screw the Gates, saffron is <i>so</i> last week, and head over to the next hot temporary art exhibition thingy. We don&apos;t even know what to call it. A fleeting extravaganza of stimuli, perhaps. We&apos;re especially excited to check this out after seeing the amazing images on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423192705/http://www.ashesandsnow.org/">exhibits website</a>.</p>
