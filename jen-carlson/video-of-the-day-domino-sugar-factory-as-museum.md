										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144310/http://gothamist.com/2004/07/01/sugary_land_deal_domino_sugar_plant_purchased.php">In 2004, we believed</a> that the Domino Sugar Factory would make for a great museum, &#xE0; la the Tate Modern. Today the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144310/http://www.nysun.com/article/59509">NY Sun</a> reports that a group of Brooklyn artists are calling on the Community Preservation Corporation Resources development company &quot;to change its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144310/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/25/13_billion_plan.php">plans for the Domino Sugar Factory</a> in Williamsburg, pushing for the creation of a cultural complex similar to London&apos;s Tate Modern art museum.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently the developer plans on turning the factory into a housing complex with over 2,000 units as well as retail and community spaces. They do need approval by the City Council and the City Planning Commission in order to move forward, however, and the first public hearing is tonight. Meanwhile, the artists have been trying to garner attention for their own plan involving a museum being housed in the old factory. Backing them up are some influential numbers, such as how many jobs the museum would create in the area, and the more than $200 million a year in economic benefits it would likely reap. Check out this video slide show highlighting their points for the alternate plan: </p>
