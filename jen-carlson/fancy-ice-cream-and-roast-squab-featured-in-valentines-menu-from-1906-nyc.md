<p>There is a refreshing absence of Valentine&apos;s Day menus in the New York Public Library&apos;s menu archives, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195543/http://menus.nypl.org/menus/24468">here is one</a> from a Valentine Breakfast held in February of 1906 for the Woman&apos;s Press Club. The breakfast was held at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195543/http://nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON023.htm">Hotel Astor</a> (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195543/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Astor_(New_York)">still being built</a> at that point), and featured a menu of grapefruit, salted almonds, olives, Lobster &#xE0; La Newburgh, Roast Squab On Toast, Salade Valentine, &quot;Fancy Ice Cream,&quot; and more.</p>
