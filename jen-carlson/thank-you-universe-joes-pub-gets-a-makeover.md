</div></div><p>The concert gods are smiling upon us today! We just received word that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132325/http://gothamist.com/tags/joespub">Joe&apos;s Pub</a> will be shutting down for three months, starting July 1st, for a <em>much needed</em> makeover. If you&apos;ve ever tried to see a show there without reserving a table, you know that you need to arrive well before showtime to get a seat, or even to get standing room with a view of the stage. (True story: we once &quot;watched&quot; an entire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132325/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/09/suzanne_vega.php">Suzanne Vega</a> show there, standing in the hallway, unable to even see the audience.) That&apos;s all about to change, as original designer Serge Becker gets a second chance and will be stepping in to renovate the space, which will now be completely seated. </p>

<p>We&apos;re told &quot;the bar will be much smaller with a row of stools at the top level, instead of the place where people stand now.&quot; (But what ever will we do without that fun game of dodge the waitresses!) In the end standing room will be eliminated and seated capacity will be expanded. On top of that restrooms will be renovated, sightlines improved, and artists will even get better dressing rooms. </p>

<p>But what about <em>the vibe</em>? Becker says, &#x201C;The much loved look and feel of Joe&apos;s Pub will be kept intact with a few fresh details and tweaks and with the major change being the layout of the venue. The theme is still an elegant modern cabaret space in a soaring neoclassical room.&#x201D;</p>
