<p>Nikola Tesla&apos;s old lab in New York, the Wardenclyffe Tower, is up for sale, and there&apos;s a campaign that&apos;s been launched to help purchase the property and build the first Tesla museum in the United States. The campaign&apos;s goal is to raise $850,000 towards a New York State matching grant that&apos;s been secured by a non-profit. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023091601/http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla">Tesla fan Matthew Inman</a> of The Oatmeal is behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023091601/http://www.indiegogo.com/teslamuseum">the campaign</a> to help out the non-profit, and is hoping they don&apos;t get outbid by a developer. He told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023091601/http://www.wired.com/geekmom/2012/08/tesla-museum-interview/?utm_source=Contextly&amp;utm_medium=RelatedLinks&amp;utm_campaign=Interesting">Wired</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;Tesla is a hero of mine, and very rarely does an opportunity present itself where you can make a difference to your hero&#x2019;s legacy nearly a century after his time.  It&#x2019;d be like starting a crowdfunding campaign to keep Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s original home from getting bulldozed and turned into a Krispy Kreme. I&#x2019;d be all over Operation Make-Lincoln-Not-Doughnuts.&quot;</blockquote>The campaign currently has raised over $500,000 and has 44 days left&#x2014;you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023091601/http://www.indiegogo.com/teslamuseum">donate here</a>.<p></p>

<p>The lab, the final one of the father of the electric age, is located in Shoreham, New York, and it&apos;s where Tesla &quot;attempted to build a tower that would provide free wireless energy to the entire earth. The land, laboratory, and foundation beneath the tower are still there.&quot;</p>
