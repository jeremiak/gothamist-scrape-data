However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905053317/http://www.life.com/image/72432384/in-gallery/45081/a-sailor-a-nurse-a-legendary-kiss">LIFE magazine</a> now takes a look back at the man who photographed the two. </p>

<p>Alfred Eisenstaedt was one of their prolific photographers, covering &quot;everything from post-war Hiroshima, to Ernest Hemingway in Cuba, to Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels&#x2014;who famously scowled when he learned that the elegant young man taking his picture was Jewish.&quot; Eisenstaedt recalled the Times Square image fondly, writing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905053317/http://www.amazon.com/Eisenstaedt-Self-Portrait-Alfred/dp/0896595153">in his book</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I saw a sailor running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight. Whether she was a grandmother, stout, thin, old, didn&apos;t make a difference. I was running ahead of him with my Leica looking back over my shoulder but none of the pictures that were possible pleased me. 

<p>Then suddenly, in a flash, I saw something white being grabbed. I turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse... It was done within a few seconds.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p></p>

<p>It wasn&apos;t until the 1970s that Eisenstaedt received <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905053317/http://www.life.com/image/ugc1055671/in-gallery/45081/a-sailor-a-nurse-a-legendary-kiss">this letter from Shain</a> explaining she was the nurse in the photograph (which, by the way, first appeared way back on page 27 of the magazine amongst many others).</p>
