</div></div>					<p>Well hello, Staten Island. </p>

<p>The borough isn&apos;t exactly synonymous with envy-inducing homes&#x2014;what with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110100638/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/staten_island_suburbia_1960s.php">the &quot;New Town&quot; boom of the 1960s</a>&#x2014;but this mid-century home currently on the market would be worth the ferry ride. Built in 1978, it doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s been updated much since&#x2014;the kitchen is unimpressive, the carpeting is... carpeting, and the furniture belongs in a dumpster. But the shell is beautiful, and it&apos;s probably the most unique 5-bedroom home you&apos;ll get for $1.99 million in any of the five boroughs. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110100638/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/4/13/11424598/midcentury-staten-island-abode--planted-atrium-2m">Curbed</a>, it&apos;s located in the more posh neighborhood of Todt Hill, near Saint Francis Woodlands and Reed&apos;s Basket Willow Swamp Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110100638/http://streeteasy.com/sale/1220233">The listing</a> notes that there are &quot;four bathrooms, floor-to-ceiling windows, a dressing area, detailed fireplace, and small office.&quot; The 5,742-square-foot space also has an atrium, which is definitely the centerpiece of the property. </p>

<p>Go forth, buy on Staten Island, host a bunch of key parties. </p>
