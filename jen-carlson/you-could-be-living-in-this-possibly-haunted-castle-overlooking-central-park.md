</div></div>					<p>The New York Cancer Hospital (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312153407/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Cancer_Hospital">NYCH</a>) was built in the late 1800s, where it remained functioning for almost 100 years. Located at 455 Central Park West, between 105th St and 106th Street, the circa-1880s structure looks like a castle, but despite its old world beauty it was almost demolished in the 1970s, when the hospital shut down. Before it even closed its doors, patients complained of decrepit conditions inside, but when it was landmarked in 1976, it was given a new life.</p>

<p>The property actually sat abandoned for about three decades, but eventually the developers came around in 2000 and turned this place into a luxury condominium.</p>

<p>Click through for a look&#x2014;we expected it to be more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312153407/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/26/flashback_the_collyer_brothers_nys.php">Collyer Chic</a>, but it actually looks more like your aunt went on a shopping spree at Pottery Barn. Nothing a few hundred cats and newspapers can&apos;t change, though.</p>
