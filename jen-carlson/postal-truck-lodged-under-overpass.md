<p>Whoops! Aside from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101034803/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/16/post_office_1.php">long lines</a>, lost packages, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101034803/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/11/rodents_ransacking_packages_at_post.php"><em>rodents</em></a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101034803/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/10/prince_street_post_office_closed.php">closed branches</a>... the United States Postal Service has now taken their fail factor to the streets.
