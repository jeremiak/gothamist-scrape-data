She allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152708/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/01/guggenheim_impersonators_charged_wi.php">conspired with</a> David Birnbaum (of Brooklyn) and Vladimir Zuravel (of Queens) by posing as a member of the Guggenheim family and attempting to hawk fake investments. </p>

<p>Catarina Pietra Toumei, 45, said she was &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; outside of the Manhattan Federal Court yesterday. Her lawyer claimed Toumei never even met her alleged partners in crime, saying, &quot;Her role in this alleged conspiracy was certainly not criminal... they hired her over the phone to work on commission, selling investments nobody ever bought.&quot;  Among the more amusing details of the accusations is how Toumei claimed she was married to John Ratzenberger, aka Cliff Clavin from <em>Cheers</em>.  She and Ratzenberger only dated.</p>
