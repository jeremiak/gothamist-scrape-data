<p>New York-based artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711130909/http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/cone/cone2-28-06.asp">Ultra Violet</a>&#x2014;who has been muse and friend of Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol&#x2014;has created her own piece of art to commemorate the 10th anniversary of 9/11. The 3-foot-tall magenta piece looks just like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711130909/http://gothamist.com/tags/robertindiana">Robert Indiana</a>&apos;s famous LOVE sculpture, and is called IXXI (a palindrome design of the numbers 9 and 11). The 76-year-old told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711130909/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/08/22/2011-08-22_count_on_her_to_mark_911_anniversary.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;Nine eleven is a date that is imprinted on our memories. I&apos;m a New Yorker, so 9/11 affected me. It is a marking of time, a date we will always remember.&quot;</p>

<p>She calls her roman numberal creation a &quot;marking of time,&quot; and it&apos;s now under consideration for inclusion in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711130909/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/27/exclusive_world_trade_center_progre.php#photo-18">the 9/11 Museum</a> at Ground Zero. Currently, it&apos;s on display at the Queensborough Community College of the City University, through October 10th. You can check out more version of her idea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711130909/http://ixxi.tv/art.html">right here</a>.</p>
