<p>A Portland-based filmmaker and father of two, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071240/https://vimeo.com/42106181">James Winters</a>, got his kids and his nephew to reenact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071240/http://gothamist.com/tags/beastieboys">the Beastie Boys</a>&apos; video for &quot;Sabotage&quot; as a tribute to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071240/http://gothamist.com/tags/adamyauch">Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch</a>, who succumbed to cancer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517071240/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/04/beastie_boy_adam_yauch_dead_at_47.php">on May 4th</a>.
