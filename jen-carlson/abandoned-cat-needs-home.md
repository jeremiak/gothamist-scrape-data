<p>Another heartbreaking tale of animal abandonment reached our inbox this weekend, but this one could have a happy ending. Here&apos;s the story:<img alt="2008_03_grecat2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522181410im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_03_grecat2.jpg" width="230" height="257" class="right"></p><blockquote>While walking my dogs this afternoon I found a cat with magical green eyes, a cat that looks to be a housecat, who has lived her entire life safe and cared for, suddenly now abandoned on the New York winter streets in her cat carrier with the door open left to die.<p></p>

<p>Someone left her in her cat carrier on a rarely traversed side street, and before they walked away they opened the door, sending this domesticated house cat (declawed on all four paws) into the streets of the city, with no way to defend herself and no way to care for herself. She was starving when we found her, and sitting terrified in her carrier, too nervous to move an inch.</p>

<p>We guess that this cat must have spent her life with a caregiver who recently died, leaving her abandoned and at the mercy and whim of whoever came in to clean out the apartment and throw her literally onto the streets. She must be so confused&#x2026; wondering where her loving caregiver is, and why she is suddenly freezing, starving and alone. And, where she will go now and if anyone will take care of her.</p></blockquote>The people who took her in already have 5 animals and cannot take in another one; they didn&apos;t want to take her to a city shelter (most, if not all, are overcrowded), so this green-eyed gato is up for adoption! She&apos;&#x92;s approximately 4-5 years old and reportedly &quot;has a very cute tummy&quot; and loves &quot;rolling on her back&quot; for scratches. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522181410/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">Email us</a> if you are interested and we&apos;ll put you in touch with the temporary owners.  <p></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This just in from the temporary caretaker, &quot;The lost lady has found a wonderful home with serious animal lovers who just picked her up and are so excited about her.&quot; If you are thinking of getting a pet, check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522181410/http://www.nycacc.org/">ACC</a> or any local shelter, after all, that&apos;s where this one could have ended up.</p>
