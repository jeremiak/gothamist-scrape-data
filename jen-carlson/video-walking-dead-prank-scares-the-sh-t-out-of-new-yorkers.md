<span class="photo_caption">That&apos;s the stuff.</span></p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to come up with a fresh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193727/http://gothamist.com/tags/zombies">zombie</a> idea, so we gotta hand it to AMC for this <em>Walking Dead</em> prank. Sure, it&apos;s evil Viral Marketing for a television show, but it&apos;s also Very Fun to watch New Yorkers react to a zombie apocalypse. Below, watch as some walking dead hide beneath the streets of New York City, giving tiny heart attacks to the living above them.</p>
