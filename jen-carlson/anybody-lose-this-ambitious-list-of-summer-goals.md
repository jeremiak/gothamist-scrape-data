title: Anybody Lose This Ambitious List Of Summer Goals?
---

	
										<p>Not all #summergoals are worth writing down on a piece of paper. But when you have your mind set on complex achievements, such as finding someone to buy you food, you jot that shit down while it&apos;s still on your mind, and you raise that bar of yours a little higher. YOU! You are our #humangoal. Yes, you, who wrote this list and somehow managed to lose it near Columbus &amp; 76th Street. Our #onlygoal is to get it back to you. </p>
