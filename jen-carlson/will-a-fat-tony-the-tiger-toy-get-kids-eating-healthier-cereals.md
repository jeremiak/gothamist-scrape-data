<p>Artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627221213/http://gothamist.com/tags/ronenglish">Ron English</a> is giving sugary cereals his &quot;POPaganda&quot; treatment, with the release of a limited edition vinyl figure of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627221213/http://www.popaganda.com/blog1.php/2012/01/18/fat-tony-vinyl-figure-coming-soon">Fat Tony the Tiger</a>. The guerilla marketing campaign against sugar cereals comes just in time with a new sugar-loaded Kellogg&apos;s cereal, too. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627221213/http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/01/kelloggs-krave-cereal-chocolate-uk-us.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+seriouseatsfeaturesvideos+%28Serious+Eats%29">Serious Eats</a> notes that their Krave cereal is coming to the States from across the pond, which is basically cereal with a chocolate filling (and even a Nutella-like &quot;chocolate hazelnut&quot; filling). But back to Fat Tony&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627221213/http://www.psfk.com/2012/01/fat-tony-the-tiger-guerilla-marketing.html">PSFK notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In October, English carried out a guerilla campaign by creating a series of parody cereal boxes and covertly placing them on the shelves of grocery stores. These made a statement about sugary cereals by altering the familiar characters and wording seen on the boxes. The Frosted Flakes cereal became &#x201C;Sugar Frosted Fat&#x201D; and featured an obese parody of &#x2018;Tony the Tiger.&#x2019;</blockquote>

<p>While <em>that</em> campaign may have gone unnoticed by the kids, maybe once Fat Tony hits the toy shelves they&apos;ll start asking questions.</p>
