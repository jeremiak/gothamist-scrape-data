<p>The people behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110238/http://gothamist.com/tags/northsidefestival">Northside Fest</a> (that would be the L Magazine, who in turn, has various outlets curate shows around Brooklyn for a few days in the summer) have taken to Brooklyn Borough Hall this morning. They&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110238/http://twitter.com/#!/thelmagazine">Tweeting</a> from their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110238/http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2011/03/09/psssstwere-holding-a-press-conference-at-brooklyn-borough-hall-tomorrow">press conference</a>, where Marty Markowitz tried to steal some of SXSW&apos;s thunder, saying, &quot;to the good people of Texas at SXSW&#x2014;there&apos;s a new sheriff in town.&quot; Let&apos;s be honest, no music festival in New York can ever replicate Austin&apos;s annual queso-fueled adult spring break, but Northside <em>can</em> be better than CMJ, and it seems like they&apos;re upping the ante this year.</p>

<p>The fest will run June 16th through 19th, and so far they&apos;ve announced that Beirut will headline the fest (and they just brought Zach Condon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110238/http://twitter.com/#!/thelmagazine/status/45891890993831936">a coffee</a>!); other performers will include Sharon Van Etten, Twin Sister and Deer Tick. They&apos;ve also brought a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110238/http://www.thelmagazine.com/NorthsideFestivalNews/archives/2011/03/01/announcing-the-first-ever-northside-diy-film-competition">DIY Film Competition</a> into the mix this year. Early-Bird badges will go on sale at a discounted rate of $60 for a limited time, starting at 10 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
