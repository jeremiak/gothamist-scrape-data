<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> A reader sent us the above photo, taken at the northeast corner of 1st and 1st. She wrote, &quot;A timeless message from Pretzel Crisps reminding you that you will never reach any goal when it comes to your body.&quot; Many others have shared her sentiment against the campaign, and last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406074113/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/pretzel-crisps-pretzel-ads-encourage.html">NYC The Blog</a> took some video of one of the ads getting adorned with images of too-thin women, articles about eating disorders, and a new message in response to the company&apos;s declaration: &quot;You can never be too thin.&quot; It reads: &quot;Actually, you can.&quot; </p>

<p>Most controversial pretzel campaign <em>ever</em>? Pretzel Crisps (put out by the Snack Factory) has been responding to the public outrage via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406074113/https://twitter.com/PretzelCrisps">their Twitter</a>, saying they are &quot;using the word &#x2018;thin&#x2019; in a creative way to describe our product,&quot; and that people &quot;seem to be interpreting it in their own way... we&apos;re a thin pretzel cracker!&quot;</p>

<p>We recommend you toss aside the Snack Factory&apos;s anorexic pretzels&#x2014;which contain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406074113/http://www.snacksforlife.com/snackfactorypretzelcrisps.aspx">660 calories</a> per bag, which contains just 66 &quot;too thin&quot; pretzels&#x2014;and instead pick up a big, warm NYC street pretzel, which has about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406074113/http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2009/06/giant-soft-pretzels-salty-sidewalk.html">480 calories</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Perry Abbenante, VP of Marketing at Snack Factory, now tells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406074113/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/pretzel-crisps-we-will-be-taking-you.html">NYC the Blog</a> that, &quot;Based on the feedback received from you and other bloggers, we will be taking the &#x2018;You can never be too thin&#x2019; ads down.&quot; Earlier today he had said they would only be &quot;making some adjustments to the campaign.&quot;</p>
