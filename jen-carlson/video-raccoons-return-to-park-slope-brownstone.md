title: Video: Raccoons Return To Park Slope Brownstone!
---

	
										<p>Remember that raccoon that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114131511/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/raccoon_invades_park_slope_brownsto.php">broke into a Park Slope brownstone</a> only to stumble upon death in a silverware drawer whilst trying to navigate the kitchen? Well, one woman that resides there just sent us along this video, saying, &quot;My cousin Toby, her 2-year old daughter Cleo and I share the 3rd and 4th floor of the brownstone where the poor little guy got trapped in the silverware drawer. Thought you might be interested to know the raccoon caper continues. Last night 2 more raccoons attempted to break in and we caught them on video!&quot; Maybe they were looking for their friend?</p>

<p>Those are determined little suckers! Determined, yet totally willing to take sunbathing breaks with their bellies in the air.</p>
