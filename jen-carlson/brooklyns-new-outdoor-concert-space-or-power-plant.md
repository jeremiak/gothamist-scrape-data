title: Brooklyn's New Outdoor Concert Space...or Power Plant
---

	
										<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/14/mccarren_3.php">McCarren Park Pool</a> soon becoming a place where one will hear children splashing in the water instead of hipsters sighing whilst listening to their new favorite band, the search is on for a new outdoor concert space. Of course, the venue simply wouldn&apos;t do unless it was in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/11/mtv_embraces_br.php">mecca of indie rock</a>, Williamsburg/Greenpoint. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/02/new_outdoor_concert_space_coul.html">NYMag</a> reports that &quot;a leader of the community board in North Brooklyn says the city can set up a parking lot along the waterfront between North 9th and North 10th streets for live music as early as the summer of 2009.&quot; Evan Thies, head of the board&apos;s environmental committee (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://www.evanthies.com/">running for city council</a>), says the space can be acquired and cleared within 18 months, and can become a sprawling 28-acre waterfront park. One immediate hurdle for this proposal is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2008/02/before-waterfront-park-or-concerts-burg.html"><em>another</em> proposal</a> for a large underground <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://curbed.com/archives/2007/11/29/will_end_of_gas_pains_clear_way_for_big_new_burg_park.php">Transgas power plant</a> built at the Bushwick Inlet. There&apos;s a meeting regarding the latter on March 20th, and in the meantime you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://openspacealliancenb.org/form.php">vote for the park here</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502141828/http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=050&amp;sh=story&amp;story=25645">Last November</a> community leaders announced a state legislation to force TransGas Energy from their neighborhood. &quot;The legislation would cut through red tape TransGas has masterfully wrapped around its unpopular bid for a 1,000 megawatt power plant, and force the property to be given to the City so that the Bushwick Inlet Park can be built.&quot;</p>

<p>Wonder if the residents of the new luxury condos sprouting up in that area would prefer loud concerts or a power plant?</p>
