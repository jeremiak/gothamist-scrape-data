The man was 20-year-old Andrew Williamson-Noble of Irvington, New York. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521224314/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/11/03/2009-11-03_nyu_student_found_dead_at_university_library.html">The Daily News</a> reports that he used an NYU-issued card to gain access to the library, and jumped from the 10th floor.</p>

<p>Witnesses heard a &quot;loud thud&quot; but say &quot;there was no blood.&quot; He was taken to St. Vincent&apos;s where he was pronounced DOA around 5 a.m. While it&apos;s unknown why Williamson-Noble took his own life, other students say they just finished with midterms and are still feeling &quot;very stressed out.&quot; </p>

<p>After multiple suicides in 2003, panels were installed on the inner balconies to prevent further attempts &#x2014; one student told the paper it&apos;s not easy to make the jump, and &quot;You&apos;d have to be tall to flop over it, unless you had a chair or something.&quot; Another told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521224314/http://nypostonline.com/p/news/local/manhattan/nyu_student_commits_suicide_at_school_ceAY9J6WR5JsZatJTklbZO">the NY Post</a>, &quot;It&apos;s really stressful sitting in here. I&apos;ve spent 10 hours studying in the library. It&apos;s a very depressing place.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tours have been taken through the library as usual today, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521224314/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2009/11/03/nyu-emailed-ambassadors-about-tour-policy-concerning-students-death/">NYU Local</a> got a hold of instructions to tour guides (ambassadors), which said in part: &quot;While we should not volunteer details about this tragedy to university guests, we must be candid and honest if asked. At this point, our message is as follows: it is a tragic death and is currently under investigation. Please share this response if you are asked.&quot; They were also told to say that &#x201C;Suicides at NYU are not typical.&#x201D; </p>
