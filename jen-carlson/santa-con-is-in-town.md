</div></div>					<p>Once a year a large troupe of handmade Saint Nicks flood the city with red, white and green. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410081005/http://nycsantacon.com/">SantaCon</a> is taking place <em>right this second</em>, after being kicked off at 10 a.m. at 33rd Street and 6th Avenue. Expect for these marathon Santas to pop up on the subway, in the bar and of course the city sidewalks. As the site notes: &quot;They will shrivel at the end of a frantic 15 to 48 hour life cycle, gorging on booze, fornicating, and spreading an overwhelming stench of cheer.&quot; Here are some photos from the scene so far today...</p>
