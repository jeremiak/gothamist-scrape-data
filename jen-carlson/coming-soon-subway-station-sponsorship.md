What would a station ad sponsorship entail? MTA board member Norman Seabrook describes one possible scene: &quot;<strong>Imagine Disney coming in and painting the entire station and painting a yellow brick road</strong>...It may sound funny to some people but if I want to get $20,000 or $30,000 a month to keep this station properly maintained, then I think it&apos;s appropriate.&quot; He also added that this solution is obviously preferred to more job losses and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521062639/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/23/mta_plans_fare_hikes_for_2009_2011.php">fare hikes</a>, and that they wouldn&apos;t go as far as renaming the stations. No other specifics have been released yet, though the MTA mentioned having a dozen or so interested parties. </p>
