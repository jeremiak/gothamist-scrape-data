The supermarket will bring jobs and fresh produce to the surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods, the developers have argued, but the preservationists have noted that all ten houses could be saved even if a supermarket moved in. Just no one tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404185402/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/05/wal-mart_makes_a_move.php">Wal-Mart</a> about the soon to be vacant lot.<p></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Municipal Art Society emailed us with the following statement: &#x201C;If the reported compromise on the future of the Admiral&#x2019;s Row buildings is true we are deeply disappointed because the majority of these buildings could and should be saved.  We will continue fighting to save these important structures. </p>

<p>It is not necessary to demolish the buildings in order to build on the site. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404185402/http://mas.org/mas-offers-six-alternative-plans-for-admirals-row-buildings/">MAS developed 11 alternative plans</a> that that meet the Navy Yard&apos;s program for a grocery store and retail and industrial space while allowing for the restoration and reuse of the historic buildings. If there is to be a compromise, it should be with the size of the 356-car parking lot, and not come at the expense of preserving these significant American treasures.&#x201D; </p>
