<p>Last year Prospect Park saw plenty of dead animals&#x2014;from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094938/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/24/animal_remains_in_prospect_park_san.php">possible Santeria rituals</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094938/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/canada_geese_1.php">government-sanctioned</a> Canada geese slaughters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094938/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/21/what_animals_escaped_death_in_prosp.php"><em>almost</em> every kind of animal</a> fell victim to someone or something. Well, the blood is still pouring over there&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094938/http://brooklynphotos.blogspot.com/2011/01/new-years-sacrifice.html">Brooklyn Photos</a> spotted these decapitated chickens &quot;in the woods in the middle of Prospect Park&quot; yesterday. Looks like the area is still a prime spot for Santeria rituals in 2011! Perhaps this whole dead animal thing will be one of the main focuses of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094938/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/06/flashback_prospect_park.php">new park administrator</a> taking over for Tupper Thomas this year.</p>
