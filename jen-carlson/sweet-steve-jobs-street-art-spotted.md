<p>Did you guys know that tomorrow is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124707/http://stevejobsday2011.com/">Steve Jobs Day</a>? It is, so get your black turtlenecks ready. In the meantime, check out this amazing, and subtle, tribute to Steve Jobs on Bond Street (between Lafayette and Broadway), which shows a young and an older Jobs. The man himself would probably appreciate such a smart design. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213124707/http://twitter.com/#!/SuriR/status/124524221022998528">Suri R</a>]</p>
