<p>Can you guess which year this photo was taken, or what&apos;s going on in it? This was shot right here in New York City, and we&apos;ll update this post later with the year, and more details.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This image is from a stunning collection of color photographs from the 1930s and 40s (see them all at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160710/http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/sets/72157603671370361/with/2179915522/">the Library of Congress&apos;s Flickr page</a>). This one was taken in March of 1943, and the caption reads: &quot;Camouflage class in New York University, where men and women are preparing for jobs in the Army or in industry, New York, N.Y. They make models from aerial photographs, re-photograph them, then work out a camouflage scheme and make a final photograph.&quot;</p>
