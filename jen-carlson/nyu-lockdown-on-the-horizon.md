<p>If it pans out, this would be the first of its kind at a school, allowing officials to bolt classroom doors and building entrances, as well as reach staff and students through a public-address system. It would be placed in the more heavily trafficked buildings and dorms, mostly near Washington Square, with the Silver Center being highest priority.</p>

<p>Does NYU have the cash for the undertaking? They&apos;ll be finding out this summer and will then determine whether the purchase will be made after they test-drive it on one of the buildings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130404054824/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2008/04/16/VirginiaTech/Nyu-Wants.System.To.Lock.Down.Buildings-3327846.shtml">Washington Square News</a> reports currently &quot;the first line of defense against armed assailants is the police. Public safety guards are unarmed; in a crisis, they are supposed to call 911.&quot;</p>
