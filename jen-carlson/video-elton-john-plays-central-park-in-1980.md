title: Video: Elton John Plays Central Park In 1980
---

	
										<p>A year before Simon &amp; Garfunkel did, Elton John took the stage at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033457/http://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/concerts">Central Park&apos;s Great Lawn</a> and played for around 400,000 people. The show was free, took place on September 13th of 1980, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033457/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473030/">and it was recorded</a> for a TV special... so there&apos;s some great footage of it available. Check out some of his hits below:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Rocket Man&quot;</strong><br>

<p><strong>&quot;Imagine&quot;</strong> &#x2014;&#xA0;Elton John addresses the audience, saying this song was written by &quot;a friend of mine who I haven&apos;t seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033457/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/28/38_years_ago_today_john_lennon_join.php">for a long time</a>, but... he only lives just over the road. He hasn&apos;t make a record for ages, but he&apos;s doing well at the moment.&quot; John Lennon was murdered less than three months later.<br>
