					<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606131013/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/16/inside_brooklyn_bridge_parks_new_lu.php#photo-1">1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge</a> opened its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606131013/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/28/brooklyn_bridge_park_condos.php">somewhat controversial</a> doors, and now they&apos;re opening even more. This week they unveiled a seasonally-appropriate rooftop oasis, which will be lovely if it magically doesn&apos;t become too crowded. Though if it does, keep in mind the hotel sits right behind the Park&apos;s Pier 1 lawns, where you&apos;ll get the same striking views, albeit at ground level.</p>

<p>The 1 Rooftop Bar is open to all, though one of the roof&apos;s greatest features is not (which is probably for the best, considering its size)&#x2014;while you&apos;ll be able to see the hotel&apos;s &quot;relaxation pool&quot; from the bar area, only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606131013/https://www.1hotels.com/brooklyn-bridge">hotel guests</a> are allowed access. The bar is on one side of the space and the pool is on the other side, with communal seating in between the bar and the pool.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="roofhotelchairs.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606131013im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/roofhotelchairs.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">(Scott Heins/Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>All in all, the rooftop areas measure out to 3,475 square-feet, and the full-service bar and lounge accommodates up to 450 guests. As for the menu, we&apos;re talking $16 cocktails, $12 glasses of wine, and $8 beers. For food, the menu includes a lobster roll ($25), guacamole ($13), a hot dog ($7), and fries ($6).</p>

<p>And if you are lucky enough to score a seat, you&apos;ll get one of the best views in the city (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606131013/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/29/westlight_rooftop_william_vale.php#photo-1">move over, Westlight</a>).</p>

<p><em>1 Brooklyn Bridge is located at 60 Furman Street, at Brooklyn Bridge Park. The 1 Rooftop bar is open 7 days a week, 4 p.m. to close.</em></p>
