										<p>A short film shot in Astoria, Queens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160124193957/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzard2010">during the blizzard</a> is getting high praise from Roger Ebert, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160124193957/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/movies-1/man-in-a-blizzard-by-jamie-stu.html">who says</a> it deserves to win the Academy Award for best live-action short subject. The short, titled &quot;Idiot With a Tripod,&quot; is an homage to the 1929 short &quot;Man With a Movie Camera&quot; (which you can see on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160124193957/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/movies-1/man-in-a-blizzard-by-jamie-stu.html">Ebert&apos;s blog</a>). Filmmaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160124193957/http://mutinycompany.com/home.html">Jamie Stuart</a> emailed the video to Ebert on Monday by 4:18 p.m., and the critic says, &quot;You can tell from the cinematography he knew exactly what he was doing and how to do it. He held the Vertov film in memory. Stuart must already been thinking of how he would do the edit and sound. Any professional will tell you the talent exhibited here is extraordinary.&quot; Take a look for yourself below (and Stuart has also offered up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160124193957/http://mutinycompany.com/spec/idiot.mov">this Quicktime link</a>):</p>
