<p>The only daughter of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313150421/http://gothamist.com/tags/whitneyhouston">Whitney Houston</a>, Bobbi Kristina Brown (who no longer wants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313150421/http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/11/bobbi-kristina-name-change/">her father&apos;s name</a>) spoke out for the first time following her mother&apos;s death on February 11th. Last night her interview with Oprah Winfrey aired on OWN, where she said on the last day her mother was alive, she &quot;slept in her arms all night and all day long.&#x201D; She also says she&apos;s had visitations from her mother since she&apos;s died&#x2014;&quot;Lights turn on and off, and I&apos;m like, &apos;Mom, what are you doing?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>As for her own future, Bobbi Kristina just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313150421/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/whitney_houston_left_100_of_estate.php">inherited everything</a> from her mother, and says she also plans to follow in her footsteps&#x2014;&quot;We&#x2019;re going to do the singing, the acting thing, the dancing.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Oprah also talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313150421/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/03/live-blog-oprah-talks-to-whitney-houstons-family-bobbi/1#.T14LUGJWq-0">other family members</a>, including her sister-in-law Patricia, who was asked to describe the day Whitney died. &quot;I hear screams. I knew something was wrong. I didn&apos;t know what. I was just numb. As I got closer, and I turn the corner, Mary&apos;s at the door and she&apos;s screaming, &apos;Oh my God.&apos; I saw my brother, Ray, trying to revive her to the point of exhaustion. Then I saw her. She had a peaceful look on her face. She had a peaceful look.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the singer&apos;s tumultuous relationship with Bobby Brown, Houston&apos;s brother Gary said, &quot;I loved Bobby Brown. Bobby was a good guy. I don&#x2019;t know how good they were for each other.&quot; Pat Houston a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313150421/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/03/live-blog-oprah-talks-to-whitney-houstons-family-bobbi/1#.T14VF2JAYU8">dded that she didn&apos;t believe</a> that Bobby was to blame for Whitney&apos;s drug addictions, &quot;There was always so much outside interference... You&apos;re talking about two people who started out in the business very, very young.&quot;</p>
