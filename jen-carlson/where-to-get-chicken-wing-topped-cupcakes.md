<p>Do you have the shakes because your body is withdrawing from all of the sugary, fatty, high in calorie, fried, and alcohol-infused <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720181217/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/04/some_of_the_most_unhealthy_things_y.php"><em>things</em></a> you put into it yesterday? Then you&apos;re going to need to ease into this thing while you readjust to a normal diet again. Lest you go into some sort of shock, head straight over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720181217/http://www.samsbakery.com/">Sam&apos;s Bakery</a> in Bay Ridge, where they&apos;re slingin&apos; some chicken wing cupcakes made by the Robicelli&apos;s folk. Depending on your tastes, there are two options: the buffalo chicken wing cupcake, and the chicken &amp; waffle cupcake. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720181217/http://lockerz.com/s/181108678">yesterday they threatened</a> this would be the last chance until April to get the winged treats, just this afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720181217/https://twitter.com/#!/robicellis/status/166575578940571648">they confirmed</a> they&apos;re still at Sam&apos;s (but you may want to call ahead).</p>

<p>Personally, we&apos;re more interested in one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720181217/http://robicellis.tumblr.com/post/17133547758/flavors-monday-february-6th">today&apos;s other flavors</a>: the pecan potato chip cupcake. Which sounds downright healthy compared to the aforementioned creations.</p>
