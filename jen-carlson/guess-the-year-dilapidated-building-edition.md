<p>Can you guess the year, and where this photograph was taken? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195625/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">As always</a>, we&apos;ll update this post later with the answer and more details. And please, no TinEye cheating or Instagram jokes&#x2014;they&apos;re both just way too easy.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 5:12 p.m.:</strong> This photo, taken in 1930, is from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195625/http://collections.mcny.org/">the MCNY archives</a>, is captioned: &quot;Here lived Thomas Paine, who wrote <em>The Age of Reason</em>, which had much to do for the cause of the American Revolution. Built about 150 years ago. At Bleecker Street. Greenwich Village. Torn down Dec. 1, 1930.&quot;</p>

<p>His time in the house was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195625/http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-lost-thomas-paine-house-no-309.html">revisited here</a>, where they note, &quot;Within the next two decades Greenwich Village experienced an explosion in population and development.  In 1829 Herring Street became part of Bleecker Street and the Ryder house was renumbered No. 293 Bleecker.  Around this time it was purchased by the wealthy Delaplaine family.&quot; It was later renumbered 309, eventually became decrepit, and was ultimately torn down in 1957 to make way for a one-story commercial building.</p>
