<p>Have you ever wanted to go inside of the historic 5 Beekman building? Now&apos;s your chance to not only get in, but to have a champagne brunch under the beautiful atrium, which has barely been seen by anyone since the 1940s. This afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140505143508/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=150546548384554&amp;id=161474093878515">the Friends of 5 Beekman</a> posted an alert to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140505143508/http://tastearchitecture.eventbrite.com/">the TasteArchitecture event</a>, which will get you in there before its conversion to a luxury hotel.</p>

<p>Guests will get &quot;a sophisticated winter champagne brunch in the most beautiful atrium in New York City enclosed by a glass skylight, an exclusive tour led by the building historian, and a professional photoshoot with the magnificent atrium as a backdrop. Signature drink is vintage brut Laurent-Perrier champagne to blend in with the distinctive architecture and the chef&apos;s delectable menu.&quot;</p>

<p>They recommend you dress &quot;chic and warm,&quot; or however you want to look in your photos, which you&apos;ll receive as a gift following the event. Yeah, this is a pretty amazing opportunity... which means it&apos;s going to cost you about $200. Check out some footage of the place:</p>
