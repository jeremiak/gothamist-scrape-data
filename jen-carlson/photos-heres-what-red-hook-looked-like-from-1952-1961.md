</div></div>					<p>Before IKEA and Fairway and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144517/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/27/sunnys_bar_in_red_hook_struggles_to.php">Sunny&apos;s</a>... Red Hook was home to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144517/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/08/huts.php#photo-4">Hoovervilles</a>, corruption and crime. In the 1950s, many of the 21,000 residents of the neighborhood were longshoremen living in the Red Hook Houses (which were built in 1938 &quot;to accommodate the growing number of dockworkers and their families&quot;). According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144517/http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/redhookjustice/redhook.html">to PBS</a>, &quot;the neighborhood had a tough reputation&#x2014;with such notorious figures as Al Capone getting their start there as small-time criminals&#x2014;and its seedy side was immortalized in movies such as the On the Waterfront (1954), starring a young Marlon Brando.&quot;</p>

<p>In the 1960s, containerization replaced traditional bulk shipping for the most part, causing a lot of the area&apos;s businesses (and jobs) to move to New Jersey&#x2014;&quot;unemployment increased quickly as industries abandoned Red Hook, and the neighborhood&#x2019;s economy underwent a rapid decline.&quot; Click through for a look at the area just before all that went down, with these photos from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144517/http://www.brooklynvisualheritage.org/">Brooklyn Visual Heritage</a>, all shot between 1952 and 1961.</p>
