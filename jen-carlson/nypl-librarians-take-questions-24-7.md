Today the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150226/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/no_rest_for_the_query_WVsrgIFBYYK4V66S2aOlqO">NY Post</a> talks to the six senior librarians who field hundreds of questions a day from their station in the Rose Reading Room. While the most common calls are simply inquiries about obtaining library cards, there are also several dozen &quot;cherry questions&quot; a day.<p></p>

<p>Those cherry calls often come from the writers of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150226/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, who have been making sure their portrayal of the early &apos;60s is accurate.  Bernard van Maarseveen says it&apos;s questions like those that &quot;keep us coming in each day.&quot; Recently the writers have asked when taxis got their &quot;off duty&quot; lights, and what programming was scheduled to be on TV the day Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>It can often take days or weeks to answer the questions, as well, because digging offline can be necessary. Isn&apos;t it sort of nice to know you can&apos;t find out <em>everything</em> on the internet? Plus, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150226/http://www.nypl.org/ask-nypl">they&apos;re available</a> via phone, email, online chat and text message, 24 hours a day! Just don&apos;t go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150226/http://gothamist.com/tags/sexting">sexting</a> them&#x2014; one librarian told the Post they won&apos;t answer personal questions like, &quot;What are you wearing?&quot;</p>
