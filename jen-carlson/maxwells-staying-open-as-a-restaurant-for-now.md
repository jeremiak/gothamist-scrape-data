The beloved venue&#x2014;which operated as a bar, restaurant, and venue for decades&#x2014;originally closed on July 31st. We all started to let go... but THEN it was briefly reopened for a few hours as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907030939/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/justin_timberlake_played_maxwells_l.php">Justin Timberlake</a> took over to perform one song for fans (but really for a Target commercial). For a minute we thought: <em>well if it&apos;s just been sitting there, will they... no, they wouldn&apos;t reopen just to close again...</em> Oh but they will!<p></p>

<p>The Hoboken spot will reopen as a restaurant and bar <em>only</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907030939/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2013/09/maxwells_to_temporarily_reopen_as_a_restaurant_only.html#incart_flyout_entertainment">according to NJ.com</a> there have been Help Wanted posters in the window. Co-owner Dave Post says they will remain open until a buyer for the club is secured. How long will that take? &quot;Hopefully, it won&apos;t take too long to make a sale. But even if I sold Maxwell&apos;s tomorrow, it would take 90 days for the license to transfer.&quot; Interested? The $625,000 price tag on the space comes with a liquor license, all furnishings, and a 10-year lease deal.</p>

<p>Dying for some of their divine mac n&apos; cheese that you thought you&apos;d never have again? They&apos;re not open just yet, give it a few days.</p>
