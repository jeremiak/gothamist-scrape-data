<p>Last week a flyer arrived in my inbox advertising an upcoming exhibit that would offer a behind-the-scenes look at the life of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325110653/http://gothamist.com/tags/1970s">1970s New York City</a> go-go bar waitress. There was no message accompanying it, and little information, but the waitress sent the email herself: Judi Jupiter. </p>

<p>If you Google Judi, one of the top results is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325110653/http://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/021_77_07_andy_warhol_judith_openmouth.jpg">a photo of her</a> with Andy Warhol (&quot;he used people,&quot; she told me) at Studio 54, taken by her friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325110653/http://gothamist.com/tags/MerylMeisler">Meryl Meisler</a>. Jupiter&apos;s exhibit, which opened last night on Mott Street, documents a less glamorous scene, however. Her collection of photos gives you a glimpse at what life was like for those working in the topless go-go bars of New York circa 1977. &quot;See what really went on during that time,&quot; Jupiter, a former waitress at 9 of the most infamous topless go-go bars in the city, promises. &quot;It will show the shocking and not-so-glamorous life of workers in the industry.&quot; And customers, too.</p>

<p>Jupiter told us the &quot;most lucrative clubs I worked at were: Playmates (49th St and 7th Ave), and Winks (53rd St between Lexington &amp; 3rd), across the street from Citi Corp... Their lawyers and bankers would spend spend thousands on us girls. We were such an embarrassment they paid my boss millions to close down.&quot;</p>

<p>As for her subjects, Jupiter says she photographed everything from dancers shooting heroin in bathroom stalls, to &quot;a guy giving himself head&quot; (he signed a release, even!). She has stories of a dancer holding up her own boss and walking away with stacks of cash, and well-known theater impresario Joseph Papp frequenting the clubs&#x2014;&quot;I approached him [one night] and he told me to get lost, he had already spent thousands.&quot;</p>

<p>Jupiter eventually became Studio 54&apos;s first official photographer&#x2014;&quot;I experienced NYC to the fullest in the late &apos;70s,&quot; she told me, &quot;It was much more fun&#x2014;no rules or regulations. Drugs and sex were rampant. There were no computers, no cell phones, people actually communicated in person. Everyone was on the dance floor, ages 14 to 80. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325110653/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nDhhBFaSeQ">Disco Sally</a> was an 85 year old woman who came to Studio 54, being carried by young beautiful boys&#x2014;she danced the night away. Everyone was happy. No one thought it would ever end.&quot; </p>

<p>What were some of her most vivid memories of that Studio 54 era? Jupiter told me, &quot;Liza Minnelli would swing naked spread eagle on a chair in the VIP room downstairs,&quot; adding, &quot;Sorry, no photos.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Jupiter&apos;s exhibit, &quot;Queen of the B-Girls,&quot; is at L&apos;Asso Gallery, 192 Mott Street, through July 21st.</em></p>
