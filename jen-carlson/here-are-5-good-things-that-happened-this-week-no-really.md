<p>It&apos;s okay (and important for your mental health) to take a break from staring abjectly into the White House trash fire for a moment and focus on some positive news, because while the actions of these petty, greedy demagogues in D.C. are overshadowing it right now, the good stuff hasn&apos;t stopped happening. It&apos;s true!</p>

<p>Here are five good things that we read about this week:</p>

<ul><li>This 31-year-old invited his 89-year-old neighbor with leukemia to be his roommate. He has also raised money for her medical care. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/https://twitter.com/nbcnightlynews/status/824770951040561156">He told NBC</a> that the experience and friendship has made him remember what really matters in life: &quot;family, love, and human kindness.&quot;
</li><li>Norway would like to give Finland a mountain for its birthday in an &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/norway-finland-mountain-gift-present-border-birthday-anniversary-bj-rn-geirr-harsson-k-fjord-a7541941.html?cmpid=facebook-post">unprecedented show of kindness between countries</a>.&quot; Imagine that.
</li><li>Three <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/http://gizmodo.com/three-puppies-rescued-after-deadly-italian-avalanche-1791573768">very cute puppies were rescued</a> after an avalanche in Italy. 
</li><li>It was Mr. Rogers who told us when we&apos;re scared that we should, &quot;Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.&quot; So at the very least, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/01/26/petition-fred-rogers-international-airport/">he definitely deserves an airport</a>.
</li><li>And finally Dolly Parton commented on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/http://wkrn.com/2017/01/25/dolly-parton-takes-notice-of-toddler-singing-jolene/">a video of a very young fan</a> singing her song &quot;Jolene,&quot; or as the two year old sang it: &quot;Dolene.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/https://twitter.com/DollyParton/status/823964992852652034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Dolly tweeted</a>, &quot;It warms my heart to see how music reaches even the littlest country music fans. Maybe we&#x2019;ll see this little one on the Grand Ole Opry stage some day!&#x201D; Enjoy:</li></ul>

<p>If that didn&apos;t help, one therapist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/trump_anxiety_therapist.php">reminded us</a> this week that thoughts are not facts, and that we cannot become immobilized by negative emotions like anxiety. She also told us to limit your time on social media. We approve her message.</p>

<p><em>We will publish one of these every Friday, so if you see something nice happen during the week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129204240/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">please let us know</a>.</em></p>
