										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_08_ppwb.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103741im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2009_08_ppwb.jpg" width="310" height="201" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103741/http://www.amazon.com/Prospect-Park-West-Amy-Sohn/dp/1416577637/?tag=gothamist03-20"><em>Prospect Park West</em></a>, Amy Sohn&apos;s new novel depicting (and picking apart) the people and places in that neighborhood, has fallen into the hands of Smartmom, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103741/http://onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn.typepad.com/only_the_blog_knows_brook/2009/08/i-finished-amy-sohns-prospect-park-west.html">Louise Crawford</a>. In an incredibly breathy takedown, Crawford comes off as insulted, and maybe a little jealous of the neighborhood author. </p>

<p>For one thing, she doesn&apos;t like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103741/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/13/photo_of_the_da_20.php">Bugaboo culture</a> cliches, the sexless marriages exposed, and whatever else Park Slope parents are generalized for&#x2014;but then she goes on to say that she&apos;s &quot;written about just about everything Sohn covers in the novel.&quot; She also seems opposed to Sohn including a frumpy character in her book (named Karen), but then has no problem admitting, &quot;We all know many like Karen and Sohn writes good and mean about this pathetic, unattractive supermom who is obsessed with buying a coop and getting her kid into PS 321.&quot;</p>

<p>So who is this book for, aside from the Park Slope moms it insults? Crawford suggests the &quot;superficial&quot; story is perfect for those who think their &quot;prowess giving blow jobs is a true measure of your worth as a person.&quot; Heads up, zinger alert!</p>

<p>Concluding the interview with herself, Crawford says she can&apos;t decide if she likes the book or not, (<em>someone</em> contains multitudes!) so we came to a conclusion for her: &quot;I don&apos;t hate it... I hate that I didn&apos;t write it.&quot; The End. Or not... we&apos;ve reached out to Sohn for a comment on her critic.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Sohn tells us, &quot;I was extremely entertained by my friend and neighbor Louise Crawford&apos;s review of my novel, <em>Prospect Park West</em>, and look forward to hearing more the next time I see her at Connecticut Muffin.&quot;</p>
