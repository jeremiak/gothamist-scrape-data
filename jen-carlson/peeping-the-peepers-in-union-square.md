<p>After reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160415092702/http://www.normalbobsmith.com/amazingstrangers">this</a>, you may think twice about having a seat in Union Square. The website peeped some peeping toms in the area, visually depicted above (they added a &quot;red carpet&quot; to illustrate the &quot;peeper zone&quot;).  They also tell us that a &quot;peeper live zone&quot; can contain up to two dozen pervs at one time and can extend up to 30 feet. We wonder what they do when summer skirt season comes to an end...migrate to the West Coast?</p>

<p>While it&apos;s unsettling to see exactly how many eyes can be on one person at one time, there&apos;s not much that can be done about it. Though if City Councilman Peter Vallone&apos;s proposed (and ridiculous) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160415092702/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/02/tribute_to_vall.php">anti -voyeurism bill</a> ever passed, these guys would be racking up some serious fines! That is, if they&apos;re really peeping...</p>
