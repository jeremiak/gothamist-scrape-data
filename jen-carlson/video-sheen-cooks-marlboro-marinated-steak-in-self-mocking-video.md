title: Video: Sheen Cooks Marlboro-Marinated Steak in Self-Mocking Video
---

<p>You know what they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and now Charlie Sheen has taken to imitating his very own crazy side, that we&apos;ve all been unable to look away from for weeks. Yes, <em>finally</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110312032425/http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/bfb12aea47/charlie-sheen-s-winning-recipes?playlist=featured_videos">Funny or Die</a> has enlisted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110312032425/http://gothamist.com/tags/charliesheen">the MaSheen</a> to appear in a self-mocking video. Sheen uses all of his crazy catchphrases in the video, which features him hosting his own cooking show: Winning Recipes. On today&apos;s menu: steak and salad, though Sheen warns, &quot;if you eat like me, you can be like me.&quot; Grab your &quot;cooking wand&quot; and your Marlboro Reds, but be warned: &quot;the taste of Charlie Sheen has the potential to cause your soul to weep.&quot;</p>
