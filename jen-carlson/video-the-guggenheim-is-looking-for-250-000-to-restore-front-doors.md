<p>On May 5th and 6th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152535/http://gothamist.com/tags/guggenheim">the Guggenheim</a> will participate&#x2014;along with 40 historic buildings, icons and landmarks in New York City&#x2014;in Partners in Preservation, a program from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Their aim is to raise awareness of the importance of historic places, and currently the museum has the opportunity to receive a $250,000 grant from them, which they would put towards the historic restoration of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed front doors. </p>
