<p>When you found out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223194529/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> was <em>real</em>, and decided to buy some food to go along with your Costco-sized supply of alcohol, <em>what did you buy?</em> Did you buy frozen spinach and whole grain quinoa, or did you stock up on every non-perishable guilty pleasure indulgence you knew you would crave once trapped in your apartment? If you did the latter, you are probably experiencing &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223194529/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/fashion/sandy-five-weight-gain-due-to-storm.html">The Sandy Five</a>,&quot; as the NY Times is calling it (we like to call it &quot;The Sandy Seven,&quot; because... that&apos;s just more accurate, you know, <em>for us</em>). </p>

<p>One 31-year-old woman &quot;recalled [her Sandy Diet] in horror&quot;&#x2014;it consisted of &quot;Double Stuf Oreos, whole milk, Twix, Twizzlers, Sour Patch Kids... I can&#x2019;t even talk about it&#x2014;my jeans do not button.&quot; The Times declares that &quot;in times of crisis, New Yorkers discovered, food fills an emotional need, not just a physical one.&quot; Indeed, the extra pounds you may be experiencing right now are due not only to the incredibly poor choices you made while filling your pantry, but also stress-eating, and boredom, and the scientific fact that eating doughnuts <em>will</em> actually make everything better. And what better time than a storm to find out if Doritos and French Onion Dip tea &quot;sandwiches&quot; would pair well with a jug of Carlo Rossi?</p>

<p>On the upside, at least you<em> had</em> food, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223194529/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/04/photos_occupy_sandy_volunteers_help.php#photo-1">unlike some people</a>. And now you have an extra layer to protect you from this cold weather we&apos;re experiencing! But maybe now it&apos;s time to stop shoveling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223194529/http://statigr.am/p/313827489237344770_222389007">Rocky Road Ice Cream Soup with a Sprinkle Garnish</a> into our mouth holes, because in just a couple of weeks we&apos;re entering the Holiday Tunnel of Chub, a non-stop eating thrill ride that won&apos;t let you off until 2013.</p>
