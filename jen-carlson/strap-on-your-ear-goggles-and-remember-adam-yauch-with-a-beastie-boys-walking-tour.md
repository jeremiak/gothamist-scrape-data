<p>If you want to stroll around the five boroughs drinking some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_Monkey_(cocktail)">Brass Monkey</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/04/beasties.php">mourning and celebrating</a> the loss and the life of Adam Yauch while listening to <em>Paul&apos;s Boutique</em>, here are some suggestions on where to take your own self-guided Beastie Boys tour. We got things going with the following spots, and you can add your own to the map. </p>

<ul><li>The Beastie Boys met at WNYU (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/https://twitter.com/#!/mariasherm/status/198464741285433344">according to the internet</a>), &quot;first appearing on &apos;New York Thrash,&apos; curated by DJ Tim Sommer.&quot;
</li><li>Their first show was at original guitarist John Berry&apos;s loft at 100th Street and Broadway on Yauch&apos;s 17th birthday, August 5th, 1981.
</li><li>59 Chrystie Street&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2011/12/when-the-beastie-boys-lived-at-59-chrystie/">Bowery Boogie</a>: &quot;the Chinatown abode would function as home, recording studio, and party palace during the formative years when the transition from punk to hip-hop was forged.&quot;
</li><li>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php">album cover for <em>Paul&apos;s Boutique</em></a> (their second studio album released on July 25th, 1989), was shot on the corner of Rivington and Ludlow. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=99+Rivington+Street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.719575,-73.987877&amp;spn=0.005887,0.014441&amp;sll=40.720063,-73.988526&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,168.39,,0,4.52&amp;cbll=40.720131,-73.988546&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=99+Rivington+St,+New+York,+10002&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;panoid=SaEUIVrCIaFrO3wvjsHyjQ">99 Rivington Street</a> looks different, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2011/12/wolfnights-now-open-at-99-rivington-street/">serves gourmet wraps</a> (sigh), but at least it&apos;s the same building facade.
</li><li>Adam Yauch, aka MCA, attended Edward R. Murrow High School in Midwood, Brooklyn. He talked about how kids spit on him when he was a student there, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://www.flickr.com/photos/beastie_boys/536325694/sizes/l/">this old Playboy interview </a>.
</li><li>The Palladium, which is now an NYU gym and dorm, was mentioned in &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_%28New_York_City%29">Sounds of Science</a>.&quot;
</li><li>Albee Square Mall (mentioned in &#x201C;Hey Fuck You&quot;) on Flatbush Avenue: &quot;Kings County is my stomping ground / The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown.&quot;
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://evgrieve.com/2012/05/remembering-adam-yauch-in-east-village.html">EV Grieve</a> points out that 171 Avenue A, former home of 171A, is the studio where the Beastie Boys recorded &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Wog_Stew">Polly Wog Stew</a>&quot; in 1982.
</li><li>Who can forget the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards, where Yauch stormed the stage (dressed as his alter-ego Nathaniel H&#xF6;rnblow&#xE9;r) when the Beasties&apos; Spike Jonze-directed &quot;Sabotage&quot; lost out to R.E.M.&apos;s &quot;Everybody Hurts.&quot; He declared: &quot;This is an outrage! This is a farce!&quot;</li></ul>

<ul><li>Spike Jonze (who directed their &quot;Sabatoge&quot; video and would go on to work a number of times with the band) photographed them on the Upper East Side prior to all of that, including the above <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://www.spin.com/gallery/beastie-boys-25-years-mad-genius?image=9">photo</a> outside of the Guggenheim.
</li><li> 511 Canal Street is where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/movies/09yauc.html?pagewanted=all">Oscilloscope Laboratories</a> HQ is located, and where The Mix-Up was recorded.
</li><li>Madison Square Garden, home to the Beastie&apos;s beloved Knicks and some of their biggest concerts.
</li><li>McCarren Park Pool is the only Brooklyn show the band ever played, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174316/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/10/beastie_boys_bo.php">back in 2007</a>.</li></ul>
