										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="afdparade0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092355im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/afdparade0311.jpg" width="365" height="211" class="image-right"> </span>Can you believe this is still happening? For the 26th year in a row, the April Fools&apos; Day Committee has announced their parade, which will not take place on April 1st, or ever, because it is a joke. They tell us the parade will start at 5th Avenue and 59th Street at noon on the 1st (rain or shine!) and end in Washington Square Park. Once the little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092355/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=5th+and+59th+street+ny&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl">2.6 mile</a> walk is done, a  King and Queen of Fools will be crowned (our money is on parade participants Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan!). </p>

<blockquote>The theme for this year&#x2019;s parade is &#x201C;If It Wasn&#x2019;t For Bad Luck I&#x2019;d Have No Luck At All.&#x201D; The parade will kick off with a Bob Dylan classic &#x201C;A Hard Rain&apos;s A-Gonna Fall&#x201D; sung by the very vocal WTF! Chorus including General Stanley McChrystal, ex-Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele, actors Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen, Representative Charlie Rangel, and deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek look-alikes. 

<p>This year&#x2019;s floats will be lead by Grand Marshall Tony Heyward, whose Lap Pool float filled with crude oil will feature BP, Halliburton and Trans Ocean executives bobbing in the muck. Parade attendees are encouraged to bring stuffed birds, animals and fish to toss into the pool as the float passes.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There is <em>so much more</em>, which you can take in at your own pace <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092355/http://aprilfoolsdayparade.com/">right here</a>. But next year, if we&apos;re really good, can we have a real parade? Like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092355/http://sfist.com/2010/04/02/photos_st_stupids_day_parade.php">St. Stupid&apos;s Day Parade in San Francisco</a>? Maybe that&apos;s asking for too much since we already got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092355/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/we_were_there_phil_collins_day_para.php">Phil Collins Day Parade</a>.</p>
