<p>Extra, extra! Anne Hathaway plays the role of &quot;Straphanger&quot; in her latest public appearance!</p>

<p>Move over, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094713/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/19/michael_cera_spotted_on_the_subway.php">Michael Cera</a>! Famous Oscar award winning Hollywood celebrity Anne Hathaway was <em>also</em> spotted on the subway this past week. The man who took this photo says that Hathaway was &quot;yukkin&apos; it up&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094713/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/anne_hathaway_spotted_breaking_subw.php"><em>classic Hathaway</em></a>) as she and her husband Adam Shulman rode the downtown 4 train last Monday in the middle of the afternoon. When the rest of us were at work.</p>

<p>The actress left her sunglasses on but otherwise did her best to blend in with the commoners, even gazing upon the one sitting next to her. It&apos;s unclear, however, if Hathaway saw the man one seat down, looking lifeless, alone, and drained of hope.</p>

<p>And remember, if you see someone famous on the subway, be sure to steal their souls with your iPhone and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094713/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send it to us</a>. Our own Tien Mao&#x2014;who spotted Hathaway underground on the F train the very next day&#x2014;failed to do this.</p>
