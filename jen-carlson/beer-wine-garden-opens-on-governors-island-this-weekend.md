<p>Why take the subway to a beer garden when you can take a boat? This weekend Governors Island gets its own outdoor imbibing station at their southwestern Picnic Point spot. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131208090137/http://brooklynbased.net/blog/2012/05/theres-a-new-beer-garden-coming-to-governors-island-this-summer/">Brooklyn Based</a>, Little Eva is run by husband and wife team Kevin Moore and Caroline Parker, who also run <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131208090137/http://www.yelp.com/biz/kevins-brooklyn">Kevin&#x2019;s in Red Hook.</a> </p>

<p>The two have a shack that they&apos;ve assembled in their plot, a 16x16-foot fenced in area, and plan to serve up some food along with their beverage selection of red and white wine, Sixpoint&#x2019;s Sweet Action and Brooklyn Lager. Their menu will include oysters, clams, shrimp cocktail, sausages, corn, and also some vegetarian fare.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out for photos of what this little gem will look like, but in the meantime all we have is this description: &#x201C;The vision they have is so exciting and inspiring... incredible vistas, gorgeous landscaping and fields of goldenrod.&quot; Sounds like the description of a Bob Ross painting, and we can&apos;t wait to sit under the happy little trees while throwing back some pinot.</p>

<p>Little Eva&apos;s is located on Governors Island, and their hours are Saturday and Sunday (and holiday Mondays!) from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
