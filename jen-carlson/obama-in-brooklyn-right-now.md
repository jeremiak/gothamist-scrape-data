title: Obama in Brooklyn...Right Now!
---

<p>Barack Obama has popped up in the form of street art in Brooklyn, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142028/http://aavrmag.com/?p=176">AAVR Magazine</a> points out the Grattan Street mural near the Morgan L stop. That&apos;s part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142028/http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/hisownwords">his More Perfect Union speech</a> in the background, and yes, it looks a little bit more like Fred Armisen&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142028/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/24/snl_2.php">Fauxbama</a> than the real thing. </p>

<p>Less detailed Obama murals can be found on Carlton Avenue at Dean Street in Prospect Heights (photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142028/http://www.flickr.com/photos/tracy_collins/2233371418">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142028/http://www.flickr.com/photos/tracy_collins/2237061185">here</a>). How long before Clinton demands Obama apologize for promoting vandalism of public property?</p><div class="galleryEase" id="gallery-0">
