</div></div>					<p>Every year (<em>twice a year</em>) we head up to Lincoln Center during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522055047/http://gothamist.com/tags/fashionweek">Fashion Week</a> to photograph some of the people filling the seats at the shows. But who are these people, <em>really?</em> While we didn&apos;t have them all lay down on a couch to get to the root of their beings, this time around our photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522055047/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> <em>did</em> bring a white board with her. Click through for a look at some of the very colorful individuals who were circling around the center of fashion on Friday&#x2014;from Rookie Mag contributors to musicians.</p>
