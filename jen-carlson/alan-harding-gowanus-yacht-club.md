</em><p><em>The beloved Brooklyn hang only opens during the sunshine months, and this past weekend it unlocked its gate to the beer drinking, hot dog eating masses.</em> </p>

<p><strong>How did the bar become named Gowanus Yacht Club?</strong> The canal is two blocks away and needs all the help it can get.</p>

<p><strong>How was opening night this year?</strong> It was great, the toilet didn&apos;t break.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be any changes this season? </strong>Trivia, bingo and free yoga on Sundays, namaste.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the most ordered food item, and most popular beer?</strong> Hot dogs by far, cooked in Sweet Action by Six Point.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the best part about working at GYC?</strong> The people....it&apos;s all about the people.</p>

<p><strong>Please regale us with one of your worst customer stories.</strong> In general it would have to be the annoying habit that people have of carrying most of their worldly belongings in a valise or some sort of suitcase.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the current GYC soundtrack?</strong> Right now its the radio; I like Hal Jackson on Sunday morning.</p>
