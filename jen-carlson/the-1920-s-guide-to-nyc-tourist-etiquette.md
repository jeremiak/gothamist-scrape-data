<p>Back in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222312/http://gothamist.com/tags/1920s">1920s</a>, they didn&apos;t need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222312/http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette">etiquette</a> signs dissuading New Yorkers and tourists from doing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222312/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/is_this_the_most_horrifying_subway.php">horrifying, unspeakable things</a> on the subway... but they did need to set a few guidelines. Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222312/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/23/thoughts_on_brooklyn_from_the_1920s.php#photo-1">we revisited</a> <em>Valentine&#x2019;s City of New York: A Guide Book</em> for its tips on visiting Brooklyn, and today we look at their simple rules regarding how to act while visiting New York City. They remind the tourist reading the guide, &quot;New York is like your own hometown, only bigger and the vast majority of its people are decent, likeable citizens. But there are also others.&quot; Here are some of their rules, some of which still apply today...</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222312/https://archive.org/stream/valentinescityof00browa#page/364/mode/2up">Some Simple Don&apos;ts</a></strong><br>
</p><ul><li>Don&apos;t ask a pedestrian where a certain street is. He is usually too busy to stop... and won&apos;t know. <br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t cross the street in the middle of the block. In Paris they arrest you for that, in New York they simply run you down. <br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t buy the Woolworth Building, Brooklyn Bridge, the Metropolitan Tower, the City Hall or any prominent structure. <br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t hand your baggage to a porter outside Grand Central unless he wears a red hat. <br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t take the recommendation of strangers regarding hotels... Don&apos;t get too friendly with plausible strangers.<br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t gape <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222312/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/21/photos_women_smoking_in_public_desp.php#photo-1">at women smoking cigarettes</a> in restaurants. They are harmless and respectable. They are also &quot;smart.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t forget to tip. Tip early and tip often. <br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t block the sidewalk. New Yorkers will gather in crowds to see a young lady demonstrate a new razor in a shop window or a safe going up the side of a building. Ignore such gatherings; show our ex-hicks that you come from a real town. <br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t telephone if you are in a hurry. Walk. It&apos;s quicker, though it used to be the other way &apos;round.</li></ul><p></p>
