<p>Can the addition of two letters change <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214094017/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">Santacon</a> forever? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214094017/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFvzLy0643dV4T7U4MYAGbA">One comedy troupe</a> set out to see if Santanacon would not only catch on, but succeed in becoming the anti-Santacon. What they found out, however, is that whenever a group of people come together in costume, day drinking is inevitable. No matter who you become a walking homage to&#x2014;Santa, Santana, the Pope&#x2014;it will end in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214094017/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/16/video_santa_receives_terrible_handj.php">drugstore handjobs</a> and dry-heaving. Nice try, though.</p>
