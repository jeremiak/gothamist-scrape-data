										<p>Thanks to everyone for coming out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154422/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/movable_hype/">our show</a> last night. We had a great time and enjoyed bringing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154422/http://centralvillage.blogs.com/cv/2006/07/movable_hype_at.html">focus back</a> on New York bands, something we&apos;ll most likely continue to do in the future. </p>

<p>We&apos;ll have some photos from the night posted by tomorrow, but for now we just wanted to say thank you to the bands! Project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154422/http://www.projectjennyprojectjan.com/">Jenny/Project Jan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154422/http://www.takkatakkamusic.com/">Takka Takka</a>, <a href="www.lsadproco.com/goescube.html">Goes Cube</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154422/http://www.femmegeneration.com/">Femme Generation</a> were all amazing. And the latter two are responsible for that slight buzzing sound in our ears this morning. Listen for yourself, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154422/http://www.ryspace.com/index.php/2006/07/12/movable-hype-80-knitting-factory-july-12th/">Ryspace.com has mp3&apos;s from the night</a>.</p>

<p>Coming up we have Movable Hype 9.0 - which will be a little bit different from what we&apos;ve done in the past. This one time we&apos;ll stray from The Knitting Factory and head over to the Fulton Street Fish Market at South Street Pier for a show at The Spiegeltent. The tent is coming to town for a few months - it&apos;s been out there in the world travelling for quite some time, from the website: &quot;Since Marlene Dietrich first sang Falling in Love Again on the Spiegel stage in the 1930s, these magic mirrors have reflected some of the worlds greatest performing artists and their enthralled public.&quot;</p>
