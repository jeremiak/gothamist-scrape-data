<p>When it comes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221523/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> the worst offense is when people use their devices as speakers (we&apos;re looking at you, teenagers). It is worse than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221523/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/etiquette.php">a humorously discarded banana peel</a>, it is worse than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221523/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/etiquette_week_subway.php">hogging the seat</a>, it is worse than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221523/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/memorable_photo_sleepy_man_hangs_br.php">freeballing</a>, and it is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221523/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/is_this_the_most_horrifying_subway.php"><em>worse than shitting all over the place</em></a>. Too far? No. Blasting your music on the subway is The Fucking Worst. </p>

<p>Even if everyone on the car is really drunk and neeeeeeds to hear &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221523/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/the_cosby_show_meets_that_blurred_l.php">Blurred Lines</a>&quot; right at that moment, they do not want to hear it from your tinny-sounding speaker. No one thinks you are cool or even rebellious or <em>anything but annoying</em> for spilling sub-par sound into the subway car. A flash mob dance party <em>will not</em> start because you put a song on. </p>

<p>Nothing good is sent out into the universe by you sharing anything that is on your iPod&#x2014;do you see what you&apos;ve done? You&apos;ve ruined the only good thing we have in life: music. Anyway, thanks for letting us vent, obnoxious asshole who will probably never read this!</p>

<p>This PSA was brought on by reader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221523/https://twitter.com/binghott/status/354653573046493184">Barry Hott</a>, who sent along this video and asked: &quot;Is it acceptable to play music from a pocket speaker during AM rush hour?&quot;</p>
