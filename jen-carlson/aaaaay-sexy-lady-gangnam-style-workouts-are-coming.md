<p>As with any international dance craze, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207033351/http://gothamist.com/tags/gangnamstyle">Psy&apos;s Gangnam Style</a> has traveled beyond the borders of the dance floor and has started seeping into the fitness centers. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207033351/http://blisstree.com/move/gangnam-style-dance-workout-classes-295/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+b5media%2Fblisstree+%28Blisstree%29">Blisstree</a>, people worldwide (or at least in Canada) are  horse-riding their way to more toned bodies, with &quot;some instructors are already offering full-fledged Gangnam Style Cardio Dance&#x201D; classes. This is perhaps the fasted a dance craze has transformed into a fitness fad!
