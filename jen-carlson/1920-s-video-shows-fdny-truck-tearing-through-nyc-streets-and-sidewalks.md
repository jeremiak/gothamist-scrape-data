<span class="photo_caption">Streets too congested? Hop on the sidewalk!</span></p>

<p>This video from the 1920s (though the uploader describes it as being from the 1930s) shows the NYC Fire Department in action for a full 11 minutes, from the time a call comes in to the station house, to the battling of the flames. The most riveting section, however, is the drive in between the two, which is filmed from the viewpoint of the truck. From the 2:20 to 6-minute mark, you&apos;ll get to witness some of the most insane driving the streets of New York City has seen (though this film was probably sped up to give the viewer that extra rush of adrenaline/motion sickness). </p>

<p>Watch as the truck quickly zips through the city, alternating quickly between both sides of the street, and even using the sidewalk&#x2014;somehow, no pedestrians were harmed in the making of this video.</p>
