Allegedly Duncan wasn&apos;t a fan of the rapper at all, but was there to see Fabolous, who canceled. Allegedly when he stood up at the show and Rhymes took notice, Duncan told him he wasn&apos;t there to see him, and yadda yadda yadda Busta doused him with water, pelted with water bottles, and had his bodyguard punch him.</p>
