<p>First, Abramovic talks about her MoMA exhibit, which was arguably the most sensational art show in New York in 2010, but added that she was only given $100,000 for it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123123/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/01/marina_mania.php#photo-2">The Artist Is Present exhibit</a> at MoMA saw a packed house every day, and the museum undoubtedly made serious bank from her work, but she says, &quot;I got so little I don&#x2019;t even want to tell. I was paid an honorarium of exactly $100,000. It covered one year of my work, plus how much I pay for assistants and office rent... I made an enormous installation out of the project, which took me one and a half years and some of my own money. They should have this major piece, but they completely ran over me.&quot;</p>

<p>Abramovic is also asked about the breast enlargement she had in the late 1980s when she and her lover/collaborator Ulay were on the outs. While she reminds us that she is an artist, <em>not a feminist</em>, it still seems somewhat odd that the often androgynously-adorned artist would resort to plastic surgery. She told the Times: &quot;I don&#x2019;t care. You know, I was 40 years old. I heard that Ulay made pregnant his 25-year-old translator. I was desperate. I felt fat, ugly and unwanted, and this made a huge difference in my life. Why not use technology if you can, if it can build your spirit?&quot;</p>

<p>Abramovic is currently trying to raise <a 2012="" href-"http:="" gothamist.com="" 05="" 07="" marina_abramovics_performance_art_c.php#photo-1"="">$15 million for a performance art center</a> in Hudson. And her MoMA exhibit lives on... <em>The Artist Is Present</em> film is currently playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123123/http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&amp;near=New+York,+NY&amp;dq=marina+abramovic&amp;sort=1&amp;mid=d25cfc3d1131f0d8&amp;tid=d76e1c1b4aefe8b7&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OKTYT5TZKsir0QW62NWrBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAkQwAMoAg">at Film Forum</a>. Hopefully she&apos;s getting a cut from that.</p>
