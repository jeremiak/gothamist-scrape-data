Seems we&apos;re not the only ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204526/http://gothamist.com/2005/03/25/dear_sxsw_diarypart_2.php">with a crush</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204526/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/14/tourist_the_nat.php">on the band</a>. Now, following the release of their latest album, <em>Boxer</em>, there&apos;s another documentary about the Brooklynites. </p>

If you haven&apos;t watched any of these, which were the brainchild of &apos;ol Parisist editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204526/http://www.parisist.com/staff.php#paris_chryde">Chryde</a>, do yourself a favor and check them out. </p>
