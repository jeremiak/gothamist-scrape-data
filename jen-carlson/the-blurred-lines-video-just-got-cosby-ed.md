title: The "Blurred Lines" Video Just Got Cosby-ed
---


                            
                            
                            
                            <p>When you travel to the car-dependent suburbs and rely on radio for your music, do you know what you&apos;ll hear? &quot;Blurred Lines,&quot; &quot;Mirrors,&quot; and &quot;Get Lucky,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014914/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/353992584386973698">in an endless loop</a>. (Those songs are all over the channels that aren&apos;t playing the awesome classic rock.) &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; is definitely the most infuriating of earworms amongst these Songs Of The Summer, for a number of reasons: </p>

<p>1) Robin Thicke is almost definitely a douchebag.<br>
2) The song isn&apos;t even good, not even by Shitty Summer Song Standards&#x2014;all it has is lyrics that rhyme, TI, and a beat by Pharrell!  <br>
3) The video is really, epically bad. Where&apos;s Robin Thicke&apos;s dad&apos;s <em>Growing Pains</em> money? He should give some to his son to make a less terrible video. Our own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014914/http://www.twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a> has dubbed it: &quot;The Only Video Shot Entirely In The Hollister Stock Room.&quot;</p>

<p>So thankfully someone has come along to at least remedy the video aspect of our National &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; Nightmare, by adding some Cosby:</p>
