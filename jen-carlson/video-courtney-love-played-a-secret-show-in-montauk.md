I used to go every year when I was a little kid and no one knew what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081257/http://www.yelp.com/biz/milk-momofuku-milk-bar-montauk">Momofuku</a> was yet. It was glorious. But even if Montauk has changed, I still love it. You know what I also used to love? The band Hole. And even if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081257/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> has changed (though... change is actually encouraged in humans, <em>supposedly</em>), I would still go see her play live <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081257/http://jezebel.com/5907044/i-found-courtney-love-in-a-hopeless-place">in a second</a>. <p></p>

<p>(It is a good time to mention that I have a nostalgia condition that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081257/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">my boss</a> tells me is fatal, so be sensitive to the pining I do for different eras of my life.)</p>

<p>So anyway, it is with great heartbreak that I announce to myself that Courtney Love played at least one intimate show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081257/http://www.courtney-love.org/surf-lodge-montauk-060113">at Surf Lodge</a> in Montauk this week. Right on the goddamn waterfront. Covering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081257/http://gothamist.com/tags/fleetwoodmac">Fleetwood Mac</a>. </p>

<p>And all I got were these 6-second Vines:</p>

<p>Fine, one non-Vine:</p>

<p>The show was a warm-up show for her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081257/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/courtney_love_is_touring_this_summe.php">upcoming short tour</a> of the New York area.</p>
