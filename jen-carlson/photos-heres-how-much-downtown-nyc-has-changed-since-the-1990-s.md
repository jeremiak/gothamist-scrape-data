					<p>Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060702/http://sbutcher.com/">Steve Butcher</a>&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060702/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/27/east_village_1980s_flashback.php">shared his 1980s photos</a> with us last week&#x2014;also documented the city in the &apos;90s. Are you aware that 1990s-era things are &quot;vintage&quot; now? It&apos;s true, even if it feels like that decade just ended yesterday. But perhaps that passage of time is more apparent when we look back on the changed neighborhoods of Manhattan. </p>

<p>Butcher moved to NYC in 1981, first living &quot;on the sofa in a basement apartment behind the boiler room on St. Marks,&quot; he tells us. In 1982 he moved to Ludlow Street off Houston, where he remains today&#x2014;&quot;Taxis didn&#x2019;t know where Ludlow was and when they got here, they&#x2019;d stop at Katz&#x2019;s but  would not drive down. Hard to believe now!&quot;</p>

<p>On watching his neighborhood change rapidly through time, Butcher tells us, &quot;Without sounding curmudgeonly, in the last 10 years all the historical character and what made the Lower East Side the Lower East Side has been gutted&#x2014;it&#x2019;s so sad.  Handed over to developers and a transient population comprised of students and tourists. It feels more like a campus than anything else.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in the 1980s and &apos;90s, Butcher says &quot;the area was lived in; there was a diversity that is missing today. Every shop was its own shop&#x2014;no chains. Well there was Woolworth&#x2019;s up on Broadway, but we had King&#x2019;s Drugs on Houston before Rite Aid knocked them out. There was Tunnel Stationers on Canal, knocked out by Staples. Orchard Street was a busy, thriving destination as was the whole area  The art scene was amazing, involving so many talented people.  I could go on and it&#x2019;s not nostalgic, it just is what it was, for me. A thrilling and creative place to be.&quot; </p>

<p>Click through for a look at things were looking back in the &apos;90s. Vintage!</p>
