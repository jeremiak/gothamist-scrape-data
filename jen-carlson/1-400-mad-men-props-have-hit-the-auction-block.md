A small sampling of these era-appropriate accoutrements were on display at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121085720/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/10/mad_men_exhibit_preview.php#photo-1">the recent MoMI exhibit</a> celebrating the show, but the production&apos;s prop closet was likely larger than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121085720/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/24/keeping_up_with_the_drapers.php">the Draper&apos;s first home</a>. So where is all that stuff headed?<p></p>

Even Don Draper&apos;s suits, shorts, and 1965 Cadillac Coupe de Ville hit the auction block today. </p>

<p>Through August 6th, you&apos;ll be able to bid on items from the show, courtesy of ScreenBid. Prices are starting low and will likely skyrocket, but it&apos;s hard to say how high they&apos;ll get on the smaller items like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121085720/http://auction.screenbid.com/view-auctions/catalog/id/38/lot/15417/?url=%2Fview-auctions%2Fcatalog%2Fid%2F38%2F%3Fpage%3D2%26items%3D100">Henry&apos;s legal pad</a>.
