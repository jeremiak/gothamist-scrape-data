<p>You can take the orgy out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155448/http://gothamist.com/tags/calvinklein">Calvin Klein</a> billboard, but you&apos;ll still be left with a one-man sex show. The latest image in the company&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155448/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/24/calvin_klein_billboard.php">rotating ad space</a> above Houston Street is pictured above, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155448/http://copyranter.blogspot.com/2010/01/shiny-naked-ck-model-over-houston-st.html">Copyranter</a> reports back saying, &quot;His name is David Agbodji, and he&apos;s part of the new Calvin Klein Spring/Summer 2010 Collection ad campaign... I&apos;m thinking five-story Mr Agbodji is going to light up the switchboard!&quot; But this man is neither under-aged <em>nor</em> involved in an orgy with anyone under-aged... so maybe the downtown prudes will give it a pass?</p>
