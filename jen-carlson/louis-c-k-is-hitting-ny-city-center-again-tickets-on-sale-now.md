<p>Remember when Louis C.K. had to postpone some of his shows because of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328171545/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/28/louis_ck_cancels_shows_due_to_paul.php">&quot;Paul Bunyon Shitcloud&quot;</a> that was Hurricane Sandy? His October 28th shows (scheduled just before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328171545/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/03/louis_ck_sends_a_letter_from_snl_it.php">his SNL appearance</a>) were rescheduled for March 2nd, and while tickets for those are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328171545/http://www.nycitycenter.org/tickets/productionNew.aspx?performanceNumber=6680">sold out</a>, Louis also added a show on March 1st at New York City Center&#x2014;and at press time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328171545/http://www.nycitycenter.org/tickets/ReserveSingle.aspx?performanceNumber=7271">tickets are still on sale</a>! The show is a benefit for P.S. 3 on Staten Island.</p>

<p>Earlier this week the comedian announced via email that his next special&#x2014;featuring material from this current tour&#x2014;would be broadcasted on HBO this April (after that, in September, it will be available for $5 through his website).</p>
