</div></div>					<p>This September the New York Public Library will bring you back to school with some topographical history lessons. They&apos;re celebrating the New York Harbor Quadricentennial with an extensive exhibit featuring rarely seen maps, atlases and other treasures from their own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103149/http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/map/mapping.html">personal collection</a>. The exhibit is titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103149/http://www.nypl.org/research/calendar/exhib/hssl/hsslexhibdesc.cfm?id=508">Mapping New York&#x2019;s Shoreline, 1609-2009</a>, and opens on September 25th... but here&apos;s a sneak peek.</p>

<p>Another interesting note, they tell us that there will be an added feature which includes &quot;animation superimposing our old maps with the contemporary landscape on Google Earth. Basically, it allows layers of information to be available simultaneously on a time-enabled scale. For example, you can see an old lower Manhattan fire insurance map underneath contemporary 3-D buildings, showing which historic buildings still exist and which have been razed.&quot; Amazing! And probably a little terrifying.</p>
