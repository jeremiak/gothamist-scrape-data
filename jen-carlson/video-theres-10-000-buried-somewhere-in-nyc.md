										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="gooooooold0610.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824211237im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gooooooold0610.jpg" width="350" height="208"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Goooooold!</span></i></div> We received an email this morning which alerted us that somewhere in New York City, <em>right now</em>, there is $10,000 in U.S. mint one-dollar coins buried in a treasure chest. <p></p>

<p>The sender of this email told us this was for a new independently-produced puppet web video series that&apos;s launching... but this sort of reeks of corporate viral marketing, no? Either way, there really <em>is</em> $10K buried out there somewhere in the five boroughs&#x2014;and if you find it, it&apos;s yours. According to the below video, clues will start on August 1st, and there will be 8 weekly videos released.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a website set up, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824211237/http://www.welostourgold.com/">We Lost Our Gold</a>, which reiterates this is in no way a contest or promotion. We want to believe, but because viral marketing has made us so jaded, we&apos;re not totally accepting that this won&apos;t end with the finder of the loot becoming a PR puppet owned by some evil corporate overlord. Dig at your own risk...</p>
