<p>Lady Gaga may have only flipped off her old high school <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130021/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/10/gaga_4.php">this week</a> <em>with her mind</em>, but yesterday evening she quite literally flipped the bird while attending a Mets game at Citi Field. Lewd gestures in a ballpark? Why yes, that <em>is front page news</em>! </p>

<p>The photos first started popping up over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130021/http://jezebel.com/5560376/lady-gaga-throws-fit-flips-the-bird-at-mets-game?skyline=true&amp;s=i">Jezebel</a>, where they reported the pop star showed up during the 5th inning with &quot;very little makeup and a skimpy outfit&quot; (more specifically, the bra she dons in her &quot;Telephone&quot; video). She was allegedly upset that the photographers, there to shoot the game, were so close to her front row seats, and had a bit of a meltdown when they turned their cameras on her. She eventually escaped to Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s luxury box, because&#x2014;according to one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130021/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/gaga_goes_batty_ln2WMat76bwgPBUZNqUPyJ">the Post</a>&apos;s sources&#x2014;&quot;having them take pictures of her all game would&apos;ve been annoying to all the fans. That was going to ruin it for everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>However, that&apos;s when she started drawing even <em>more</em> attention to herself: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130021/http://www.tmz.com/2010/06/11/lady-gaga-girl-on-girl-kiss-new-york-mets-game-photo/">she made out with a woman</a>, stripped down to just her bedazzled undies, and gave everyone who looked her way the double finger, all the while screaming &quot;Fuck you! Fuck you!&quot; But since Gaga has declared her love for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130021/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625484/20091104/lady_gaga.jhtml">the Yankees</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130021/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100610&amp;content_id=11054658&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb">in the past</a>, we&apos;re going to go ahead and assume this was all part of some grand psychological warfare plot against the Mets.</p>
