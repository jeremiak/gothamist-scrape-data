										<p>If Kickstarter was around in the early 1900s you would have seen things a little more innovative than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005127/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/latest_kickstarter_for_grilled_chee.php">the Grilled Cheezus</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005127/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/11/brooklyn_girl_raises_nearly_1500_fo.php">birthday party</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005127/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/25/spike_lee_defends_his_kickstarter_f.php">a Spike Lee movie</a> getting funded. And you would have seen a lot of things re-invented for the sole purpose of being able to utilize them while in bed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005127/http://www.joemarinara.com/thedailyespresso/strange-inventions-of-the-early-consumer-era/">the bed piano and bed glasses</a>, for example)&#x2014;we were always lazy! But we were also always looking for a new way to battle the winter elements, and perhaps the most interesting example is the Blizzard Cone from 1939. Why wear a warming cloth mask when you can wear a plastic beak?</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpFZLGXhAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005127im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpFZLGXhAM.jpg" width="640" height="567" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The cone was designed &quot;to protect the wearer from storms and blizzards,&quot; and presumably an added benefit is that your makeup didn&apos;t get messed up and people could still see your face? There&apos;s precious little information out there regarding this piece of ingenuity, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005127/http://www.broadsheet.ie/2013/01/29/make-up-protectors-of-1939/">never quite took off</a>. If it did, we&apos;d need some serious Blizzard Cone etiquette guidelines out there on the crowded sidewalks&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005127/http://gothamist.com/tags/umbrellaetiquette">umbrellas</a> are contentious enough.</p>
