<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:160px; "> <img alt="sidewalk0909.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174422im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sidewalk0909.jpg" width="160" height="106"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174422/http://www.flickr.com/photos/9736580@N06/3876342535/">krzysztof.poluchowicz</a>&apos;s flickr</span></i></div> Is there room for a soapbox on this sidewalk? The latest complaint box on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174422/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/complaint-box-street-clutter/?ref=nyregion">City Room</a> is filled with street clutter grievances; as we know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174422/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/09/newspaper_condo.php">newspaper condos</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174422/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/07/shrinking_sidew.php">sidewalk dining</a> are shrinking our already crowded sidewalks. The site posts a complaint from Julia F. Willkie, who resides on East 79th Street; she states: &quot;What really upsets and infuriates me is how cluttered the streets, avenues and sidewalks have become. I live on the Upper East Side, west of Third and four blocks from Mayor Bloomberg&#x2019;s residence. At the intersection of Third and 79th, three corners host 18 &apos;honor boxes.&apos; Between 77th and 79th on Third are an additional 13 boxes.&quot; Those pesky publications aren&apos;t all that&apos;s in the way, though, she also lists off phone booths, street vendors and newspaper stands as her personal public enemy #1. Finally she declares, &quot;Good Heavens! My head tilts back so I can clear my vision, and street banner advertisements, approved by New York City&#x2019;s tourism officials, are hanging from lampposts.&quot; Does Willkie need to move to greener pastures, or are our sidewalks becoming too much of an obstacle course?<p></p>
