                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lovemarthabloomberg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022657im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lovemarthabloomberg.jpg" width="640" height="467" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In a horrifying game of F/M/K (or the censored version, S/M/K: Shag/Marry/Kill), the 71-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022657/http://gothamist.com/tags/marthastewart">Martha Stewart</a> was forced to choose between Donald Trump, Mayor Bloomberg, and Bill Gates, eventually saying: &#x201C;Trump kill. Bloomberg marry, definitely. And I would do Gates,&#x201D;</p>

<p>[Pausing to let you finish this game, which your brain is now forcing you to play. This too shall pass, etc.]</p>

<p>Stewart, who recently got into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022657/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/martha_stewart_is_single_ready_to_m.php">the online dating game</a>, declared this during a public talk with Bravo&apos;s Andy Cohen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022657/http://www.92y.org/Uptown/Event/Entertaining-Martha-Stewart.aspx">at the 92nd St Y</a> earlier this month, and it&apos;s just now filtering into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022657/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/martha-stewart-cooks-new-image-article-1.1384598">the slow news summer circuit</a>... where it&apos;s also mentioned that she has sexted before, and would consider having a threesome.</p>

<p>Are you now picturing a Bill Gates, Martha Stewart, Bloomberg threesome? Happy Friday!</p>
