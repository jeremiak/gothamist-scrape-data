According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172405/https://www.facebook.com/events/460829883938473/">the Facebook page</a>, the truck is &quot;full of tasty free samples,&quot; but it&apos;s unclear if they&apos;ll be providing anything to dip into those samples (though fingers work fine in a pinch). There&apos;s not much more to say about this&#x2014;just, get yourself some free Nutella! Here&apos;s where: </p>

<ul><li>Saturday, September 29th, 6th Ave Fair (from 42nd St to 57th St) 10 a.m. through 3 p.m.
</li><li>Sunday, September 30th, NYC Oktoberfest (Lexington Ave from 42nd St to 57th St) 10 a.m. through 3 p.m.
</li><li>Tuesday, October 2nd, Rutgers University (249 University Ave, Newark, NJ) 7 a.m. through noon
</li><li>Wednesday, October 3rd, 1 Hudson Place, Hoboken, NJ (by Path Station) 7 a.m. through noon

<p>Also, you will have the opportunity to &quot;be the first of your friends to take a picture next to our giant inflatable Nutella jar.&quot; That will come in handy next time you update your OKCupid profile pic.</p>
