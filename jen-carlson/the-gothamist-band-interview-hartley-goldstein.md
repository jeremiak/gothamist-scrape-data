Thanks for asking.&quot; He is also, however, many other things. Among them are: a 24 year old, a NYC native, a music reviewer, and a musician. We&apos;re here to discuss the latter. </p>

<p>Goldstein&apos;s debut EP is titled, <em>Songs In the Key of Zoloft</em> and features his unique mixture of anxious neurotic pop and meta-folk. It also includes one of our favorite songs, &quot;A Love Song for Annie Hall&quot;.  The ep was produced by Adam Lasus, he also produced that Clap Your Hands and Say Yeah cd that everyone is talking about.</p>

<p>You can catch Hartley live all through October for FREE! His residencey begins this coming Sunday and runs every Sunday in October at Pianos. More details after the interview.  </p>

<p><strong>Is Hartley Goldstein your real name?</strong><br>
Absolutely. In fact, it was my father&#x2019;s name too. I&#x2019;m actually a Junior. I find it great that it&#x2019;s a rather unambiguous name as well. It would be an understatement to say it&#x2019;s quite Jewish, and there was no way when it came time to put out my songs that I was going to change it. My name is kind of a rebellion to the culture of fakers we&#x2019;re currently all surrounded by, while also trying to stir up some of the preconceptions of being a New York City &#x201C;Jew.&#x201D; You&#x2019;d be surprised how much crap a name can cause.</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
Man, my &#x201C;first conscious memory&#x201D;!? I can barely remember what I had last night for dinner, no less what I was doing when I was like 2. That said, I do remember getting driven to Nursery School across the park (Central Park) quite vividly. Must&#x2019;ve been 2 or 3 or something. And this one day, my parent&#x2019;s car was in the shop so they had this loner they were driving. And, of course, 2-year old me starts exploring all the fun to be had in this strange car. No sooner had I pulled down the center arm-rest, had I come upon a funny little blue packet. A Trojan Condom. As I asked my mom what it was, both my parent&#x2019;s started laughing. I stole the condom. For many years, I had no idea what the hell that thing was.</p>
