										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="onion0509j.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083912im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/onion0509j.jpg" width="250" height="176" class="image-left"> </span>Horrible, unfunny rumors that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083912/http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a> is shutting down some of their regional print editions were being confirmed and denied all over the internet today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083912/http://gawker.com/5240012/the-onion-killing-los-angeles-and-san-francisco-print-editions-says-source">Gawker</a> reported that a source told them the publication has &quot;already laid off editorial and sales staff for its Los Angeles and San Francisco print editions, which will cease publication. Tomorrow&apos;s editions of The Onion are said to be the last ones for those markets.&quot; </p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083912/http://twitter.com/hunterw/status/1700135188">a FishbowlNY employee</a> declared that a &quot;well-placed source tells me that Onion rumor is totally false,&quot; we have now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220083912/http://laist.com/2009/05/05/another_comedy_death_in_la_the_onio.php">obtained a memo</a> that CEO Steve Hannah sent out about the SF/LA offices. Bad news area men and women: it confirms the SF and LA shutdowns&#x2014;however it also optimistically states that there are no plan to shut down other print editions (yet). Read it in full after the jump.</p>
