                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="charliealwayssunny0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010115im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/charliealwayssunny0311.jpg" width="365" height="435" class="image-right"> </span>Next week the Bell House will be hosting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010115/http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=3545095">a marathon screening</a> of &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,&quot; and they&apos;re going all out by transforming the space into Paddy&apos;s Pub (&quot;canned wine and all&quot;). We contacted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010115/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206359/">Charlie Day</a> (one of the show&apos;s stars, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010115/http://stereogum.com/103881/apes_androids_golden_prize_video_unveiled_months_a/mp3/">an Apes &amp; Androids fan</a>) to see what he thought about all of this, and to finally settle the score on Philly&apos;s sometimes 6th borough claim&#x2014;of which he told us, <strong>&quot;If you can&apos;t get there with a MetroCard, it&apos;s not a borough.&quot;</strong> Sorry Philly!</p>

<p>Now that <em>that&apos;s</em> settled, here are some of his thoughts on Brooklyn&apos;s own version of Philly. Since the venue is transforming itself into Paddy&apos;s Pub, he says &quot;adding more rats&quot; can give it a more authentic feel. He also suggests the tribute band play &quot;Night Man&quot; and try to sing about &quot;the passion of men and boys for boys and men in the night.&quot; Organizers are advertising &quot;irresponsible drinking and bad decision making, inspired by the gang,&quot; so we had to ask Day if he was proud of himself... he claimed, &quot;I don&apos;t see the connection.&quot;</p>
