<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150704/http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2012/07/07/artspublish/2348914421.html">July 12th</a>, this statue was unveiled on Park Avenue and 56th Street. &quot;#23 Basketball Player,&quot; which honors Michael Jordan, was created in 1999 by Niki de Saint Phalle, and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150704/http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=56488#.UBGupjFWq-0">one of nine</a> of the artist&apos;s sculptures displayed on the avenue, from 52nd Street to 60th Street&#x2014;they&apos;ll remain through November 15th. The Jordan statue is from her iconic Black Heroes Series featuring legendary jazz musicians and athletes, and the artist&apos;s grandaughter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150704/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-2007/The-Short-List-May-2007/">has said</a> in the past that her grandmother saw Jordan &quot;as a dancer. There was such beauty in his movements, such grace and power.&quot;</p>

<p>However, not everyone is seeing the beauty... sports reporter Darren Rovell just spotted the piece, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150704/https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/228154445530267649/photo/1">promptly Tweeting</a>, &quot;The most awkward Michael Jordan statue ever is being exhibited in New York City.&quot; Those sparkly shorts are a little weird, but at least he&apos;s not depicted holding a smaller Spike Lee statue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150704/http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://images.sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/06415fe0596582da44416c647602eb7663e59e8.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://sneakernews.com/2009/06/11/michael-jordan-spike-lee-vintage-nikeair-jordan-ads/&amp;h=768&amp;w=570&amp;sz=134&amp;tbnid=V_QZRCXCeVYTJM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=67&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__-NIS0o7T7Fnb7XdCkgNFmjBbXMA=&amp;docid=7FwU_jh1gdhADM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X7MRUP33Ieqn6wGby4C4AQ&amp;ved=0CFoQ9QEwAQ&amp;dur=412">by the head</a>? </p>
