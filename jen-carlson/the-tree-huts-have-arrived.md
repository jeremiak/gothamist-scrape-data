</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115061817/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/18/a_tree_hut_grows_in_manhattan.php">Tree Hut installation</a> in Madison Square Park has attracted a lot of attention, even getting an SNL mention on this past weekend&apos;s episode. Here&apos;s a glimpse at the construction of the huts, and they&apos;ve even been documenting the project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115061817/http://madsqhuts.wordpress.com/">on a blog</a>. You can meet the artist behind them, Tadashi Kawamata, in person and ask questions tomorrow, a day before the installation officially opens, at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115061817/https://www.madisonsquarepark.org/Programs/MadSqArt.aspx">Tree Hut HQ</a> in Madison Square Park from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. Given the financial crisis, it might not be a bad idea to ask about renting one out--be sure to bring a mini muffin basket so you have the edge on other prospective renters! </p>
