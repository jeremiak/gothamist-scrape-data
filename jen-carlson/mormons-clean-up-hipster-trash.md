										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0909trash.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522000634im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0909trash.jpg" width="140" height="147" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522000634/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/10/williamsburg_religious_mecca.php">Over the weekend</a> the Mormons were out in full force, cleaning up your sinful refuse at McCarren Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522000634/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/37/32_37_lo_mormon_invasion_main.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> got up early to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522000634/http://photo.net/philosophy-of-photography-forum/00DnuX">steal some souls</a> with their camera, bragging that they &quot;managed to capture it on film!&quot; They report back saying that 100 youthful members of the Church of Latter Day Saints were picking up trash and raking leaves before the rest of us woke up at the crack of noon thirty. The paper talked to some of the late-rising locals; one 22-year-old Jessica Weinschenk said, <strong>&#x201C;I guess it&#x2019;s not that weird because religious people do stuff like that. And hey, it&#x2019;s cool if someone wants to clean our park for us.&quot;</strong> Way to go Weinschenk. Unsurprisingly, only one non-Mormon claimed to have ever cleaned up for a community, and <em>of course</em> it was part of Burning Man (he told them &quot;when you leave you have to spend four hours cleaning up after yourself&quot;). It&apos;s not surprising that the Church descended on Williamsburg, which the Parks Department identified as being the park most in need of maintenance within all five boroughs.</p>
