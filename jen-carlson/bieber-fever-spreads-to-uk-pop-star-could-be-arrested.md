										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="balconybieber0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145211im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/balconybieber0311.jpg" width="365" height="284" class="image-right"> </span>Liverpool hasn&apos;t seen this much tween angst since the Beatles. <em>Right now</em> modern day mop top Justin Bieber is holed up at a hotel in the area with thousands of girls outside his window <em>freaking out</em> and awaiting a glimpse of the pop star. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145211/http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/10/justin-bieber-riot-liverpool-screaming-girls-hotel-police-cops-situation/">TMZ</a> (they&apos;ve got a photo from the scene), the cops there have warned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145211/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">The Biebs</a> that it could turn into a &quot;possible riot situation&quot; and have threatened to arrest him if he makes himself visible. </p>

<p>The site reports that &quot;the pop star and his entourage have been warned that if Bieb or his team go anywhere near the balcony... they will be arrested immediately for inciting a riot.&quot;</p>

<p>London: you are officially on Bieber Fever alert! Long Island experienced an outbreak back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145211/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/21/tween_singers_chaotic_mall_appearan.php">in 2009</a>; Bieber took to Twitter to calm his frenzied masses, and his appearance was ultimately canceled after teens trampled each other. Godspeed, London.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Calm down everyone! Justin Bieber was given the all clear and has now waved to his fans, or according to this photo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145211/http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/10/justin-bieber-balcony-arrest-england-liverpool-hotel-screaming-fans/">on TMZ</a>, made a little heart with his hands. The police hope this gesture will now make the fans go away.</p>
