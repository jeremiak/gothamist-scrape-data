										<p>This month, two works by sculptor Richard Serra were brought in to the MoMA - all in preparation for &#x201C;Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years,&#x201D; a retrospective exhibiting the artists work, opening next month. Below, you can see how several hundred tons of steel are transported in to the museums sculpture garden. </p>

</p><blockquote>In 1981, Serra&#x2019;s notorious Tilted Arc, a 120-foot steel curve commissioned by the federal government, was installed at Federal Plaza. Workers complained that the sculpture blocked their view and shielded muggers; security personnel said it could serve as a blast wall for terrorist bombs; a judge claimed that it was exacerbating a rat problem. Serra insisted that the sculpture was site-specific and couldn&#x2019;t be moved. After a public hearing and a legal battle, Tilted Arc was cut up in 1989 and carted off to a warehouse, where it remains. </blockquote>
