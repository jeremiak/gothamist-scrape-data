<p>New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609202358/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/02/gov_christie_jersey_shore_new.html">still complaining</a> about the <em>Jersey Shore</em> cast giving his state a bad name&#x2014;at a recent town hall meeting he declared, &quot;we don&apos;t want them,&quot; and he allegedly plans to ask New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to reclaim the reality stars. But the show <em>was never a New York thing</em>, and cast members <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609202358/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore_%28TV_series%29#Cast">come from</a> Rhode Island, New York <em>and</em> New Jersey. </p>

<p>When Christie brought this up to Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609202358/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/paterson_finally_breaks_silence_ove.php">last year</a>, the former Governor told him it was probably New Jersey that was making the cast so... what&apos;s the word for it? Anyway, this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609202358/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/26/no_one_wants_jersey_shore_going_to.php">a problem</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609202358/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/25/jersey_shore_cast_is_moving_to_ital.php">for Italy</a> now.</p>

<p>Following the fourth season being filmed overseas, Christie may get his wish after all&#x2014;Snooki and JWoww may have just found their new spin-off show crash pad in East Setauket, New York. But doesn&apos;t it look a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609202358/http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/36479">too quaint</a> for those two?</p>
