The station runs out of a storefront on 1st Avenue, a quirky characteristic that intrigues those who walk for the first time, and this year they&apos;re celebrating their fifth year on the air. To do so, they&apos;re taking the music to the Seaport tomorrow for a full day of live performances and much more. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150218013925/http://www.eastvillageradio.com/newspageshows/evr-poster.jpg">More details are here</a>, but expect Lil&apos; Frankie&apos;s pizza (the owner is also the owner of the station), two stages of music and much more. Steve Cohen, station manager, told us a little bit about EVR and what to expect at the festival.</em></p><em>

<p><strong>How long have you been with the station?</strong> 5 years, started the 2nd week. </p>

<p><strong>When did the idea for East Village Radio happen?</strong> Jorge Docouto had recently moved up to NYC. Jorge had been in Austin, and was a part of Free Radio Austin, a pirate radio station. At that time Jorge was working with chef Frank Prisinzano of Frank Restaurant. One evening over a dinner that Frank cooked, Jorge brought up the idea of starting a pirate radio station. Feeling up for an adventure, Frank decided to make the idea a reality.     </p>

<p><strong>How did the storefront come about?</strong> Jorge went out and bought the transmitting equipment, and East Village Radio was born -- as a pirate radio station. Within a few weeks, Jorge was broadcasting on the FM dial at 88.1, and speaking to Frank via cell phone to determine the reach of the station.  Frank was driving around the city in his car listening to the broadcast on his radio. Within the following month, the two got the word out that broadcast slots were available, which resulted in the first schedule for EVR. We broadcasted until December -- then the FCC stepped in to &quot;discourage&quot; any further transmissions.  Fortunately, we were broadcasting over the Internet as well.  This made the shift to an Internet only radio pretty seamless. </p>

<p>To elevate awareness of the station, Frank decided to move the station to its street front location, where it resides today -- adjacent to Lil&apos; Frankie&apos;s restaurant. We like to think of the station as a welcomed gift to the community.  </p>
