<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214624/http://gothamist.com/tags/thenewsroom"><em>The Newsroom</em></a>, which just ended its 2nd season in September, will only get one more go of it. HBO has renewed the series for a third season, but also announced this would be its <em>final</em> season. Maybe this means we&apos;ll be spotting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214624/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/best_subway_commute_ever_spotting_s.php">Sam Waterston on the subway</a> more often!</p>

<p>HBO&apos;s programming president Michael Lombardo said in the announcement: &quot;<em>The Newsroom</em> is classic Aaron Sorkin&#x2014;smart, riveting and thought-provoking. I&#x2019;m sure this farewell season will be one to remember.&quot; And it is our dream that in this farewell season, Sorkin&#x2014;who does like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214624/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/aaron_sorkin.php">his muses</a>&#x2014;will write in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214624/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/01/aaron-sorkin-courtney-love-dating">a Courtney Love character</a>.</p>
