title: Video: Williamsburg Locals React To Hugs
---

	
										<p>Improv Everywhere&apos;s Rob Lathan recently walked the streets of Williamsburg in search of a little love&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309161750/http://www.babelgum.com/5006914?action=share">check out</a> how the locals react to his request for a hug. Spoiler: at the one minute mark, a group of stoop-dwellers start hugging him, but when he asks for an ironic hug, and a post-ironic hug, one declares: &quot;I&apos;m into hugging you but I&apos;m not into your condescension.&quot; Guessing that dude is probably pretty pissed he was duped into being in a video called &quot;Hug-A-Hipster.&quot;</p>
