<p>Wasn&apos;t it adorable when Ryan Gosling fell in love with a fake girl in <em>Lars in the Real Girl</em>? Sure it was, because that&apos;s Hollywood... but what about when a real man falls in love with a mannequin? Currently 38-year-old New York man Ned Neffer is pushing his wife in a wheelchair from Syracuse to Watertown to the spot where they first met&#x2014;she is, by the way, a 6-foot-tall mannequin named Teagan. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110613163427/http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20110609/NEWS03/306099966">Watertown Daily Times</a> reports that the two have been together since the early 1980s, and finally said their vows in 1986. Originally Teagan just had a head, but once he knew she was the one for him, he had a body built for her.</p>

<p>A social welfare examiner told the paper, &quot;This is definitely one of the very oddest things I&apos;ve ever come across, but he seems very happy. I wouldn&apos;t classify him as dangerous at all. He seemed quite happy in his own little world.&quot;</p>

<p>Their journey has gotten a lot of attention on the internet, and Nefer says, &quot;that&apos;s great, I guess, but she&apos;s really the star.&quot; He added, &quot;We both really love the outdoors.&quot; If you do, too, maybe you can &quot;Like&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110613163427/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Syracuse-Mannequin-Man/146684782029094">their Facebook page</a> (set up by their fans). Maybe one day they&apos;ll make it onto <em>Taboo</em>, like that lady who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110613163427/http://www.hulu.com/watch/247194/taboo-in-love-with-the-berlin-wall#s-p1-sr-i1">married the Berlin Wall</a>.</p>
