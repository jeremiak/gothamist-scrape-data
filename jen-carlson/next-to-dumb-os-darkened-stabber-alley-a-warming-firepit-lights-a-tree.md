                            <p>Underneath the Manhattan Bridge, in the archway just a couple dozen feet from DUMBO&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208081042/http://gothamist.com/tags/stabberalley">Stabber Alley</a>, a high-tech trashcan fire will power up some holiday cheer this season. This year the neighborhood&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208081042/http://gothamist.com/tags/deadtree">slain tree</a> will be illuminated with the help of a high-tech wood-burning &quot;FirePit&quot; by BioLite, for a real robot-meets-Rockwellian feel. As added value, it will also give us a first hand look into our not-so-distant dystopian future, when we are all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208081042/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/execution_date_set_for_local_tree.php">dead, lifeless Things</a> being powered up by gadgets.</p>
