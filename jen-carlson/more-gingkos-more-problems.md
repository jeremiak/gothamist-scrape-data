Barry Plonski&apos;s home on 210th Street and 43rd Avenue in Bayside is within smelling distance of <em>multiple</em> gingkos &#x2014;&#xA0;and he places the smell they emit &quot;at the olfactory intersection of animal feces and vomit.&quot; Female gingkos, the smelly fruit bearers, are the ones to blame &#x2014; and there are about 15 in Plonski&apos;s neighborhood.</p>

<p>Locals told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040654/http://www.queenstribune.com/news/BigStink.html">the Queens Tribune</a> that it&apos;s fortunate &quot;Korean people love these fruits... if it wasn&apos;t for the Asian gleaners coaxing fruits down with poles, the smell would be truly unbelievable.&quot; (Learn more about gingko gathering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040654/http://fort-greene.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/urban-forager-video-edition-ginkgo-time/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Parks Department Commissioner Adrian Benepe told one resident of the neighborhood, &quot;despite the admittedly displeasing smell, the trees were of value to the city because they reduce pollution, improve air quality, and enhance property values.&quot; The department won&apos;t remove a tree unless it&apos;s dying, but they do say they&apos;re not planning on planting anymore female gingkos.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a reader tells us of his own Lady Gingko problems, saying: &quot;I&apos;m on the board of my BH co-op, and Tuesday night a bunch of discussion centered around the fact that a branch on one of our gingko trees has decided to change sex &#x2014; from male to female, and is already creating a &apos;stink&apos;. They&apos;ve asked me to look into what can be done. Some people even suggested cutting the branch off &#x2014; something I&apos;m opposed to.&quot; He opined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040654/http://inklake.typepad.com/ink_lake/2009/11/thoughts-while-lying-on-a.html">on his blog</a>: &quot;if the branch wants to be female, let it. Besides, what if we cut this one off, and another branch changes?&quot; The gingkos are mutating, people.</p>
