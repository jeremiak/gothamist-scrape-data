title: WNYC's Street Shots Challenge
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161142/http://www.wnyc.org/streetshots">WNYC explores street photography</a> through the eyes of six New Yorkers (including our own Jake Dobkin); they call the medium &quot;a uniquely New York art form&quot; that dates back to the days of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161142/http://museum.icp.org/museum/collections/special/weegee">Weegee the Famous</a>. Weegee&apos;s site holds a quote from <em>Naked City</em> that sums it all up pretty well: &quot;He will take his camera and ride off in search of new evidence that his city, even in her most drunken and disorderly and pathetic moments, is beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>The station also asks that both amateur and professional photographers alike submit their New York street photography for their Streets Shots Challenge. Here are some of the entries, and the rest can be seen in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161142/http://www.flickr.com/groups/wnycstreetshots/pool">their Flickr Pool</a>.</p>
