</div></div>					<p>In the past decade, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045833/http://gothamist.com/tags/michellewilliams">Michelle Williams</a> has moved to Brooklyn, then to Brooklyn again, and now, again, to Brooklyn. Her new house isn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045833/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/26/michelle_williams_brooklyn.php#photo-1">in Boerum Hill</a> or Red Hook, her previous chosen neighborhoods, but in Prospect Park South. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045833/http://ditmasparkcorner.com/blog/neighbors/welcome-michelle-williams-actress-buys-home-at-1440-albemarle-road">Ditmas Park Corner</a>, the 114-year-old Colonial Revival home (which Curbed calls a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045833/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/06/29/michelle_williams_just_bought_this_crumbling_brooklyn_house.php">crumbling</a>&quot; fixer-upper) is on Albermarle Road and cost around $2.5 million. It features a two-story porch, stained glass, curved windows eight-bedrooms, six-baths, fluted columns, fireplaces, and one more feature Williams wanted: &#x201C;I love living somewhere that feels like the suburbs but is next to an express train.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045833/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2011/11/building-of-the-day-1440-albemarle-road/">Brownstoner</a> once called the home and its location impressive&#x2014;&quot;It&#x2019;s on Albemarle Road, the main street and showcase block of the neighborhood, and it&#x2019;s a huge behemoth in a neighborhood of large houses, sitting on a prime corner lot. This was a home built to impress, and it does so quite well.&quot; It was originally built for Brooklyn lumber dealer J.C. Woodhull in the early 1900s.</p>
