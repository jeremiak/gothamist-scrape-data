</div></div>					<p>This morning Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo, aka the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, were on hand in their hometown to light up the Empire State Building and &quot;shell-ebrate&#x201D; their 25th Anniversary. As night falls and their classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230923/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbNOPy8CjY">1990 movie</a> is screened at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230923/http://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/events/drive-in/">Tribeca Drive-In</a>, the green glow of Turtle Power will be cast on the city. (And yes, that&apos;s April O&apos;Neil alongside them.)  </p>

<p>Also for you TMNT fans, there will be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230923/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002745.html?categoryid=10&amp;cs=1">new live-action film heading your way in 2011</a>.</p>
