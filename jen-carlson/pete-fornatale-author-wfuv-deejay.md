His book contains plenty of stories from the weekend, as well as original interviews with The Who&#x2019;s Roger Daltry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326105302/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/27/joan_baez_singer.php">Joan Baez</a>, David Crosby, Richie Havens, Joe Cocker, organizers, and fans. Tonight you can get a combination of the voice and the stories, as he&apos;ll be reading at Borders in Columbus Circle (7 p.m.); and recently he told us a little bit about the good ol&apos; days... and how they&apos;ll never happen again, no matter how many anniversary concerts are planned.</em></p>

<p><strong>Where did you grow up? How has the neighborhood changed throughout the years?</strong> 512 East 188th Street, Bronx &#x201C;58&#x201D; New York. Used to be almost exclusively Italian-American, now, thankfully, reflects our cultural diversity.  </p>

<p><strong>The story of Woodstock has been told many times, what inspired you to tell it again?</strong> Curiosity: young people who missed it by an accident of birth are intensely interested in the event, the music and the musicians </p>

<p>Nostalgia: I love the past, I just don&#x2019;t want to live there! However, a mental vacation every once in a while to a time in our lives with less responsibility and GREAT music is a very healthy thing. </p>

<p>Mortality: The average age of Woodstock attendees was between 15 &amp; 30. That means the 15 year olds are 55 this year and the 30 year olds are 70! Looking back on their lives at this stage, they want to hold onto things that truly meant something to them in their youth. Woodstock is one of those things.   </p>

<p><strong>What is different about your book from the others?</strong> At my editor and son&#x2019;s suggestion (Peter Thomas Fornatale), our book focuses primarily on the music and the musicians. We tell the story from Richie Havens on Friday at 4:07pm right up to Jimi Hendrix on Monday at 10:30am. It is also equal parts oral history, and my narrative view from the catbird seat I occupied at WNEW-FM.</p>
