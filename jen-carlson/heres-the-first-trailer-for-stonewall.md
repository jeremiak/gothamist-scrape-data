<p><em>Stonewall </em>is the focal point of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108133119/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3018070/?ref_=nv_sr_1">new feature length drama</a> coming to theaters this September. </p>

<p>The film&#x2014;directed by Roland Emmerich&#x2014;follows a (fictional) man &quot;caught up during the 1969 Stonewall Riots&quot; after finding himself in New York following a family fallout. Danny Winters (Jeremy Irvine) is homeless and destitute in Greenwich Village when &quot;he befriends a group of street kids who soon introduce him to the local watering hole The Stonewall Inn; however, this shady, mafia-run club is far from a safe-haven. As Danny and his friends experience discrimination, endure atrocities and are repeatedly harassed by the police, we see a rage begin to build. This emotion runs through Danny and the entire community of young gays, lesbians and drag queens who populate the Stonewall Inn and erupts in a storm of anger. With the toss of a single brick, a riot ensues and a crusade for equality is born.&quot;</p>

<p>The film also stars Ron Perlman, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Joey King; it comes out September 25th. Sadly, it was not filmed here in New York,... but we have to say, Montreal seems to make for a really gorgeous, sun-soaked 1960s New York:</p>
