Shortly after sitting down, a waiter or busboy allegedly threw Haramis to the floor: &quot;The side of my head the last thing to hit the ground. There was some confusion as my boyfriend tried to stop the whole thing, and was then punched in the face, while the Bistro worker screamed &apos;faggots&apos; a few times, for good measure.&quot;<p></p>

<p>After leaving they spotted some NYPD officers, who couldn&apos;t do much since they hadn&apos;t seen anything and there was no evidence of assault. Haramis decided not to file an official claim and instead, along with his boyfriend, went back seeking some form of justice. They talked to &quot;the older of two mainstay bartenders,&quot; who was nearby when the incident took place, but he denied seeing anything, and told them &#x201C;Get out and don&#x2019;t ever, ever come back.&#x201D;</p>

<p>We just spoke with Greg, a bartender at Corner Bistro (the manager is allegedly on vacation), and he told us he &quot;heard something from a bartender&quot; about the incident, but wasn&apos;t there himself and &quot;can&apos;t give any details.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Since posting, another former customer of Corner Bistro, who would like to remain anonymous, has sent us his own story, which is after the jump.</p>
