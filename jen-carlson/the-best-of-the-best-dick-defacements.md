<p>Certain New Yorkers seemingly <em>never</em> tire of drawing a well-placed penis on top of advertisements. And now graphic designer Galen Smith has taken his tireless efforts of making these members immortal (via photography) and put a picture book together. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521041953/http://www.newyorkdick.org/all-about-dick-book-info/">the website</a>, &quot;<em>New York Dick</em> chronicles Smith&#x2019;s years of documenting suggestive scribbles on advertisements in the New York City subway. Bursting with over a hundred penetrating photos and cocky captions, it examines not only the horn dog nature of the average New Yorker with a Sharpie, but also the effrontery of modern advertising.&quot; We are, if nothing else, very mature, New York City. </p>

<p>Smith (who claims he&apos;s not a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521041953/http://www.thegrumbler.net/2011/03/new-york-dick.html?spref=tw">&quot;public prick artist&quot;</a> himself) says, &#x201C;These defacements, besides being a generalized screw you to the establishment, are part of a dissatisfied dialog with advertising, marketing and consumerism that all of us can relate to. The idiocy of the graphic is part of the kryptonite-like power of the whole enterprise. No matter how multidimensional and superhuman an ad is, it is made flat and feeble by a penis drawn on it. And no matter how ubiquitous and branded an apparent one-way communication is, a disrespectful dickish two way dialog is possible if you want it to be, and if you have a sharpie with you.&#x201D; Wow, dick doodling just got <em>deep</em>.</p>

<p>Also, how has no one boner-bombed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521041953/http://www.newyorkdick.org/whats-up-dick-latest-news/2011/3/16/survival-of-the-corniest.html">the New York Lottery&apos;s Minute to Win It guy</a> yet?</p>
