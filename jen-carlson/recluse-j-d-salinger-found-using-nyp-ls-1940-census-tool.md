<p>Today the 1940 census was released, opening up the personal details of 132 million people for the first time after 72 years of privacy protection lapses&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814002412/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5heKwimwDdiZdEd7UUhF79GWTnjKQ?docId=79ba242b1c1a4a58aa2d789cdd6e9674">21 million of those people</a> are still alive. There are a number of ways to access the information in the census, including at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814002412/http://www.archives.gov/research/census/1940/start-research.html">the National Archives</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814002412/http://www.stevemorse.org/census/unified.html">this website</a>, and the New York Public Library has also released a search tool. </p>

<p>Kate Stober at the NYPL tells us it&apos;s &quot;more than just a research tool, we&#x2019;ll be helping New Yorkers create a social history map of buildings and neighborhoods in the five boroughs. When you find an address, the tool pins it to both a 1940 map and a contemporary map, so you can see how the area has changed. You&#x2019;re then invited to leave a note attached to the pin&#x2014;memories, info about who lived there, what the neighborhood was like, questions... As people use the site, we&#x2019;ll build a cultural map of New York in 1940 that will assist both professional historians and laypeople alike.&quot; And that&apos;s pretty amazing.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814002412/http://directme.nypl.org/">search through it here</a>. We gave it a spin attempting to find Al Pacino and Woody Allen&apos;s families, but didn&apos;t have any luck (yet)... but lo and behold, America&apos;s number one recluse was right there in a plain site. Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814002412/http://gothamist.com/tags/jdsalinger">J.D. Salinger</a>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814002412/http://directme.nypl.org/results?token=fsdhwicch5ifqjwpjnmucxkcrq">personal deets</a> from the year (13 years prior to living in seclusion in New Hampshire):</p>

<p>Someone also found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814002412/http://directme.nypl.org/results?token=5snxrbxynicfdy5y7tqc7liwmm">Stanley Kubrick&apos;s father&apos;s listing</a>, noting, &quot;Jack Kubrick is the father of the famous director Stanley Kubrick. In 1940, Stanley will turn 12 in the Bronx a couple of years before his father, a doctor, bought him his first camera.&quot;</p>
