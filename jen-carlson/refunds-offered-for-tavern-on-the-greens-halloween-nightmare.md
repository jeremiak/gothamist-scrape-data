title: Refunds Offered For Tavern On The Green's Halloween Nightmare
---

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142906/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/video?id=7098498">Channel 7&apos;s Tappy Phillips</a> wants answers about that Tavern on the Green debacle that went down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142906/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/02/nightmare_on_the_green.php">on Halloween night</a>. To recap: the restaurant pointed the finger at the promoters, who in turn pointed the finger at scalpers who pushed the event over capacity and advertised the wrong start time. As a result, thousands more than expected showed up to the restaurant and stood around for hours trying to get in. Because what else are you going to do in New York City on Halloween? The cops eventually shut the party down at 1:30 a.m., about an hour after it started. But don&apos;t worry, Tappy&apos;s on it!</p>
