					<p>There are remote parts of Staten Island that are a little creepy, what with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050423/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/staten_island_clown_probably_just_m.php">the clowns</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050423/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/staten_island_locals_fear_wild_turk.php">rogue turkeys</a>, the utter abandonment, the serial killer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050423/http://cropseylegend.com/urban-legends">urban legends</a>. The Island&apos;s farm colony is one of the more vast decrepit areas, home to rotting buildings, vegetation, and the occasional urban explorer. It has been that way since the mid-1970s, when it ceased <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050423/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Farm_Colony">operations as a poorhouse</a>. But after decades of sitting in decay, it will soon come back to life as a residential development.</p>

<p>The area has a dark past&#x2014;it&apos;s where a 7-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050423/http://untappedcities.com/2013/10/15/abandoned-nyc-staten-island-farm-colony-disturbing-secrets/">was murdered in 1920</a>, and bank robber Willie Sutton lived for years after a 1947 prison break. So the future seems brighter, unless we have a Poltergeist situation on our hands, as the land being developed includes <em>an old potter&apos;s field</em>. </p>

<p>As for the plan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050423/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/nyregion/new-life-for-staten-islands-derelict-farm-colony.html">the NY Times</a> reports that the isolated 96-acre area, which is owned by the city, will partially be developed throughout the year for a project called the Landmark Colony. The housing on the site will be sold to those 55 and older, with units set aside for senior affordable housing. There will also be public space for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;On Tuesday, the City Council approved a plan by the New York City Economic Development Corporation to sell 45 acres of the Farm Colony parcel to Raymond Masucci, a Staten Island developer, for $1.

<p>At a cost of about $91 million, Mr. Masucci would rehabilitate five remaining buildings on the site, tear down five others and preserve a 112-year-old men&#x2019;s dormitory as a stabilized ruin. He would also construct three six-story apartment buildings and 14 multiple-unit townhouses, some with built-in garages, for a total of 344 condominiums.&quot;</p>

<p>As the development corporation sees it, the city gets a lot of bang for the buck that Mr. Masucci is paying: the rehabilitation of a dangerous, derelict property; housing for older adults; the renovation of several historical buildings; the creation of new landscaping and publicly accessible space; and the construction of new roads and utilities.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The team&apos;s vision can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050423/http://www.nycedc.com/project/brielle-avenue">seen here</a>, and one of the architects is Timothy G. Boyland, who is the grandson of one of the nurses who worked at the Farm Colony from 1945 to 1965, the Times reports.</p>

<p>The Landmarks and the City Planning Commissions have approved the project, which will also include the landscaping of 17 acres of land. The condos are expected to be ready by next year.</p>
