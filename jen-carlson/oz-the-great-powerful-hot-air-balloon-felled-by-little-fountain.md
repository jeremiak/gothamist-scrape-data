<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410230600/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2013/02/off-to-see-the-wizard-journey-to-oz-balloon-tour-visits-the-disneyland-resort/">the &quot;Journey to Oz&quot; balloon</a>, a marketing tool promoting the March 8th release of <em>Oz The Great and Powerful</em>, stopped in Central Park to bring some journalists on a magical, wintery hot air balloon ride. Then the Wicked Witch blew in some wind and took the sucker down, right into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410230600/http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/south-end/cherry-hill-fountain.html">a tiny fountain</a> that rendered it useless. You&apos;re not in Kansas anymore, balloon! NY1&apos;s Roger Clark was on the scene and dodged a <em>Final Destination</em> moment:</p>
