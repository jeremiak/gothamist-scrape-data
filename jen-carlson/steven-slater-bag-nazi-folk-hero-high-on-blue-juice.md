He told the awaiting press, \"I knew there was a brouhaha about this, but while I was on the inside I didn\'t realize how much attention it got. I think something about this resonated with people. The outpouring of support is very appreciated. I\'m overwhelmed, very thankful. It\'s been a good time.\" His supporters were amongst those awaiting him on the outside, screaming things like: \"You\'re a hero\" and \"You\'re a celebrity.\"\r\n\<p\>\r\nWhen asked about the cuts and bruises on his face, he said they were \"aviation-related\"âand are likely from when the suitcase fell on him during the incident that landed him in the slammer. He also explained a little more about what had happened, noting, \"I lost patience after a female passenger had an argument with another passenger and then opened the bin door, hitting me on the head without apologizing.\"\<\/p\>\r\n\<p\>\r\nThe paper \<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/11/2010-08-11_carryons_were_biggest_turnoff.html\"\>also says\<\/a\> Slater was a \"bag nazi\"âin March he had said, \"I am frustrated with many of them for their unrealistic approach regarding carry-ons.\"\<\/p\>", "credit":"Photo via the AP"};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>
