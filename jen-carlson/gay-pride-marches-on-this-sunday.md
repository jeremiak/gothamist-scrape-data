<p>This Sunday marks the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312194214/http://www.nycpride.org/">Gay Pride Parade</a>. The march will run from 5th Avenue &amp; 52nd St. to Christopher &amp; Greenwich St. beginning at noon -- so either join in on the fun, or adjust your driving and walking routes lest you incur some delays (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312194214/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/trafalrt.shtml#heritage">NYC DoT</a> has some tips). This year should be especially celebratory given that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312194214/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/16/gay_marriage_is_just_hours_away_in.php">same-sex marriage is now legal</a> in California!</p>

<p>The first NYC Gay Pride March was held in 1970, the year following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312194214/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots">Stonewall Riots</a>. The Out at the Center show recently took a look at the history of the parade, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312194214/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj1AlL43Y0o">watch here</a>. </p>
