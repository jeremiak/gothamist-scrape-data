										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="targetshop.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053405im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/targetshop.jpg" width="640" height="400" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Target is the latest to butcher their models with some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053405/http://gothamist.com/tags/photoshop">Photoshop &quot;magic,&quot;</a> a practice upheld by the beauty and fashion industry that, in turn, aids in butchering the self esteem of many women. The latest &quot;problem area&quot; for models is that pesky inner thigh area, which won&apos;t naturally provide an unrealistically wide enough gap without a little digital diet.</p>

<p>In the images for their Xhilaration swimsuit line (which is for young, impressionable &quot;Juniors&quot;) they straight up chopped out the crotch area in such a crude fashion that no one can actually think this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053405/http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Thigh-Gap">achievable IRL</a>, right? There&apos;s also obvious signs of other digital manipulation, well, everywhere. Are they trolling us with that hatchet job on the arms? </p>

<p>Sadly, it&apos;s all very real&#x2014;as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053405/http://jezebel.com/target-photoshops-juniors-swimsuit-model-with-disastro-1540967946">Jezebel notes</a>, the company has long made &quot;interesting choices&quot; regarding size and body image&#x2014;recently they called a plus size dress &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053405/http://jezebel.com/5993540/target-revises-color-description-to-manatee-grey-for-plus-size-dresses">Manatee Grey</a>,&quot; they&apos;ve also used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053405/http://jezebel.com/target-thinks-plus-size-means-being-pregnant-apparen-1495202576">pregnant models</a> for their larger sizes. </p>

<p>As of today, Target has taken down the images from their site, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053405/http://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=Xhilaration+Midkini+&amp;category=0%7CAll%7Cmatchallpartial%7Call+categories&amp;lnk=snav_sbox_Xhilaration+Midkini+">replaced them</a> with regular model-thin young women.
