title: Brooklynite Makes People Food For Your Pup
---

<p><img alt="2007_06_arts_pup.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424021838im_/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_06_arts_pup.jpg" width="300" height="200" class="left">Megan Montgomery was, apparently, the city&apos;s first personal chef for dogs (though were sure there are more than enough now). Preparing her meals in Downtown Brooklyn and using her dogs as guinea pigs, she&apos;s brought Dean &amp; Deluca-esque dining to the doghouse. </p>

<p>Her company is called Zen Chien Personal Chef Service for Dogs, and her menu choices sound like &quot;people food&quot;: Mediterranean ground lamb, with whole wheat couscous, blueberries and fresh-grated squash; beefy macaroni with ground sirloin, sweet peas, sardines, and organic tomato sauce; Caribbean chicken, with shredded, free-range meat, jasmine brown rice, finely chopped mango and grated zucchini.</p>

<p>The chef herself even tastes the canine cuisine as she&apos;s cooking, adding calcium-rich ground bone-meal, omega-6 and -3, vitamin B-12, and multivitamins to help power your pup. <em>Is</em> the food healthy? Montgomery states, &quot;I kept a close eye (and still do) on Milo&#x2019;s coat, muscle definition, weight, stool and teeth. I even sent in a blood sample to test his calcium level.&#x201D; Having your dog dine gourmet-style is going to cost, of course. Depending on the size of the dog, the service runs between $8 and $18 a day.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424021838/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/23/30_23poochcafe.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that &quot;Montgomery concocted the idea for Zen Chien after Milo was diagnosed with a lip tumor in 2005. When I asked my vet if there was anything I could do, he didn&#x2019;t have many answers. I did an investigation &#x2026; and I started cooking for Milo in January, 2006. He&#x2019;s had no tumor re-growth since then.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for a new way to pamper your pup, well...the article, and Google, seem to have nothing on how to contact Zen Chien. If you simply must add the fancy to Fido&apos;s food you can always try an online outlet like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424021838/http://www.chefk9.com/gourmet-dog-food.html">Chef K9&apos;s Doggy Bistro and Bakery</a>. After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424021838/http://news.google.com/news?um=1&amp;tab=wn&amp;hl=en&amp;q=pet%20food%20recall">ongoing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130424021838/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/17/pet_food_recall.php">pet food recalls</a>, it&apos;s not a bad idea. </p>
