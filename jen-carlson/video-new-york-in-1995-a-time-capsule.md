title: Video: New York In 1995, A Time Capsule
---

	
										<p>The below video, filmed about 16 years ago, begins by declaring: &quot;Our purpose is to capture video images of Manhattan&apos;s historic sites before they disappear forever. Follow the Urban Eye as it scans the city&apos;s landscape in search of historic artifacts. Watch as we compile footage for our 1995 time capsule.&quot; These clips are part of a one hour documentary, where host Jerry Rio talks to New Yorkers about the changes the city is going through (back then, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120195707/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/24/goodbye_tower_r.php">Tower Records</a> was the enemy!). At the 8:30 mark (in part one) you&apos;ll meet our villain, who tells Rio, <strong>&quot;I would hope the whole city would turn into a giant Wal-Mart! It&apos;d be like white bread, which I love. I want no help for struggling, old companies. No room for entrepreneurs, no room for individuals.&quot;</strong> (If he&apos;s alive today, that guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120195707/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2011/01/04/newest_plan_for_empty_swath_of_lower_east_side_walmart.php">is psyched</a>).</p>

<p>Rio is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120195707/http://songheads.com/?page_id=249">still around</a> today, sadly his latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120195707/http://www.youtube.com/user/MrJerryRio">YouTube</a> video is called: &quot;Wild drunk sexy party girls answer outrageous questions in nightclub.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120195707/http://cityofstrangers.net/2011/01/the-urban-eye-snapshots-of-mid-90s-new-york/">City of Strangers</a>]</p>
