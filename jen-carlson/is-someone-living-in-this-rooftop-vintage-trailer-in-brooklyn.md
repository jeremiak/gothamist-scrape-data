<p>If you can get a vintage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162123/http://www.airforums.com/forums/f349/1967-streamline-64275.html">Streamline</a> trailer up to the roof of a building in NYC, shouldn&apos;t you just be allowed to keep it there? That should be the rule. However, real life rules state you need permits for such a thing. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162123/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/38/28/dtg-red-hook-airstream-on-roof-2015-07-03-bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, a vintage Streamline (identified by the paper as an Airstream, which is different) currently resides on top of the roof of a one-story building off Van Brunt Street in Red Hook, &quot;and the mobile-home-extension is racking up fines. The non-traditional home enthusiast who lives in the one-story building at the corner of Van Brunt and Seabring streets has also built a wooden hut the size of a studio apartment and installed two 10-foot planters on top of the building.&quot; This is all according to city records, which also state the Streamline has been there since 2012 (Google Earth&apos;s timeline confirms). In that time the owner has accrued $30,000 in fines.</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed that owner is Agron Haskaj, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162123/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203002379371116&amp;set=pb.1553478946.-2207520000.1436208612.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">posted a photo</a> of the Streamline on his Facebook. Haskaj did not respond to a request for comment, but we will update if/when he does.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Paper notes that RX Construction Inc. owns the building, &quot;but mortgage documents show the owner is Haskaj&#x2014;a principal with Trion Construction company. Both companies are roofing contractors.&quot; So at least he knows what he&apos;s doing up there.</p>
