<p>After purchasing a small plot of land <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012809/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/13/new_in_williamsburg_shipping_contai.php">at 351 Keap Street</a> in Williamsburg, David Boyle and his wife Michele Bertomen began troubleshooting how they would build their home on the land. They told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012809/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130301/williamsburg/couple-builds-home-out-of-shipping-containers-williamsburg#ixzz2MJUuuAht">DNAInfo</a>, &quot;We were just sitting around one night, bottle of wine, just feeling like we couldn&apos;t do it. And then just, &apos;How about shipping containers?&apos; came up.&quot; Wine, <em>what can&apos;t it do?</em></p>

<p>Their home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012809/http://archidose.blogspot.com/2010/02/living-in-containers.html">was erected</a> in just a few hours in 2009, but they were then hit with a stop-work order from the Department of Buildings. But now the 1,600-square-foot architectural masterpiece is complete, created out of six shipping containers, each costing $1,500. The delay ended up costing around $100,000 in interest on a building loan, and the entire project topped out around $400,000. Considering they initially scrapped brick and mortar plans for potentially costing around half a million, the shipping container plan didn&apos;t end up saving them too much money.</p>

<p>Still, it&apos;s pretty cool, and contains a roof deck, front yard, spiral staircase, and more rooms than your average oversized NYC apartment. And it&apos;s all theirs&#x2014;they now have their final certificate of occupancy, which was approved yesterday.</p>
