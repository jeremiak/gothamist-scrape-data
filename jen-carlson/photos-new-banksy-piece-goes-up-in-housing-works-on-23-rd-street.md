He wrote: &quot;A thrift store painting vandalised then re-donated to the thrift store.&quot; That thrift store is Housing Works on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023319/http://www.housingworks.org/locations/detail/gramercy-thrift-shop/">East 23rd Street</a>... and we&apos;re guessing a lot of people are headed there to try to buy it right now. He calls the piece: &quot;The banality of the banality of evil.&quot;</p>

<p>There are only TWO MORE DAYS of the elusive street artist&apos;s open-air art show that has taken over the streets all month. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 3:35 p.m.:</strong> We called this Housing Works and were told the painting will be going up for auction. They aren&apos;t sure what the starting price will be as of now. The woman we spoke to told us it was dropped off earlier today, but she didn&apos;t see who dropped it off. The manager Rob says the painting sold two months ago for about $50... &quot;it just reappeared. It&apos;s been there since this morning, no one noticed it.&quot;</p>

<p>For those who don&apos;t know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023319/http://www.housingworks.org/">Housing Works</a> is a great organization with a mission &quot;to end the dual crises of homelessness and AIDS through relentless advocacy, the provision of lifesaving services, and entrepreneurial businesses that sustain our efforts.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 4 p.m.:</strong> Beatrice, another manager, tells us it will be in the store for two weeks before going to auction. It was given to them by an &quot;anonymous donor&quot; they say. We are told they received confirmation early this morning and it seems like they got a suggestion to hang it in that spot, as well. They promise to send out more information and details in a press release soon. So today&apos;s late drop was likely so that something could hang in plain view all day&#x2014;but supposedly no one noticed or commented on it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 4:15 p.m.:</strong> According to an email we just received from Housing Works, &quot;The piece will go up for auction to benefit Housing Works at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023319/http://www.biddingforgood.com/auction/item/B4GItem.action?id=203949755">Bidding for Good</a> this evening starting at $74,000. The exact time is undetermined. It will only run for 2 day through October 31st.&quot;</p>

<p>The painting is originally by K. Sager, and below his signature on the painting is Banksy&apos;s.</p>
