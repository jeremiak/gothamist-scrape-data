<p>One block in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn has been dubbed &quot;drug section&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040306/https://www.google.com/maps/place/drug+section/@40.6116202,-73.9821052,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c244e1f80e6b49:0x4d6e56c0e340367c">within Google Maps</a>, a Redditor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040306/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1z38ul/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_google_maps_calls/">has discovered</a>. But how did West 8th Street between Bay Parkway and Avenue O become labeled as such?</p>

<p>Data found in Google Maps can come from a wide range of sources. Their basemap data (this includes place names, borders, and road networks) comes from a combination of third party providers, public sources, and user contributions. Anyone can suggest an update to the map, or report a problem on a map. There is also a tool called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040306/https://www.google.com/mapmaker">Map Maker</a> that lets locals contribute their local knowledge directly. Sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040306/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/09/rambo_everyone_wants_a_piece_of_god.php">the map algorithms rename a neighborhood RAMBO</a>, other times it&apos;s simply the &quot;Drug Section.&quot;</p>

<p>We pointed this out to Google and a spokesperson told us: &quot;Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We&apos;re aware of the issue and are working to fix it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It&apos;s fixed, and now we don&apos;t know where to get the drugs.</p>
