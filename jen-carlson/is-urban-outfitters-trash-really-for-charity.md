She happened to stumble upon a bunch of boxes outside of their 14th Street and 6th Avenue store, all taped up with the words &quot;broken&quot; adorning them. <p></p>

<p>Opening one box up, she found &quot;gag notepads, a disco ball, mugs, hipster tchotchkies, even an iPod speaker system. The stuff wasn&apos;t brand new &#x2014; some of it, like the mugs, was damaged; most of it was just worn or rough around the edges, and totally usable.&quot; She also found hats, home decor items, sneakers, and boots.</p>

<p>Eventually someone addressed the small scavenging group that had formed, and told them the cops were coming, and that this wasn&apos;t trash at all... but goods going to Salvation Army. <em>Or was it?</em> The scavenger questions, &quot;why were they leaving all of this out on the street for the Salvation Army? Why not deliver it, or keep in storage? A bunch of heavy boxes taped up next to the trash are an easy target for New Yorkers of all stripes.&quot; Moreover, it&apos;s not illegal to rummage and take items from these discarded piles &#x2014; the Department of Sanitation acknowledges one may go through trash left on the curb.</p>

<p>So, where was Urban Outfitters really putting their damaged goods &#x2014; cause we&apos;re pretty sure we&apos;ve never seen a Hamburger Phone at the Salvation Army. </p>
