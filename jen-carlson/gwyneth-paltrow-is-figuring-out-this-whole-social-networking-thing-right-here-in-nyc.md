                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="gwynethsocialnetwork0511small.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131116041108im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gwynethsocialnetwork0511small.jpg" width="300" height="220" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131116041108/http://gothamist.com/tags/gwynethpaltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> has <em>finally</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131116041108/https://twitter.com/#!/GwynethPaltrow">joined Twitter</a> and Facebook&#x2014;probably not a bad idea for someone who &quot;runs&quot; a &quot;lifestyle website&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131116041108/http://www.goop.com/">thing</a>. She made the important announcement just an hour or so ago via a video that seems to have been taken right here in New York City. <em>Such an exciting day!</em></p>

<p>In the video (below), she says, &quot;Hi, I&apos;m trying to join the 21st century. So, it&apos;s me, I&apos;m on Facebook and Twitter, but not right now, I&apos;m walking down the street looking for a cab. See ya!&quot; What Gwyneth is really saying is, &quot;look at how normal I am, not wearing makeup and walking down the street on my own two legs <em>in this heat</em>, not a cab in sight!&quot; There probably wasn&apos;t even a personal limousine just out of the shot, ready to scoop her up once she ended her first social networking transmission. C&apos;mon, <em>Oscar-winning actress</em>, people.</p>
