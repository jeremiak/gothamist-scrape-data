And now the naming duties have been handed down to <em>you</em> with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142007/http://www.nameourspace.com/">Name Our Space</a> contest. </p>

<p>If you win, you&apos;ll get to christen the place with a $1000 bar tab (that&apos;s like 160 drinks), and you&apos;ll get free admission, along with a guest, for a year. </p>

<p>Something to keep in mind: the space will likely be staying the same aside from a few changes (better audio, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142007/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2008/05/former_galapago.php">no puppet shows</a>). So think while you drink, Roff tells us the venue is re-opening &quot;very soon.&quot;</p>

<p>For more info on the contest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142007/http://www.nameourspace.com/">go here</a>, and they also currently have a website up for the venue at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142007/http://www.70north6th.com/">70 North 6th</a>, the address. </p>
