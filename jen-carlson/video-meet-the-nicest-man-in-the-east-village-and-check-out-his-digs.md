<p>Now, <em>this</em> is the type of city home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015233/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/show_us_your_apartment.php">we love to see</a>. The absolutely charming Anthony Pisano has been living in his East Village apartment for decades... and he usually leaves his door open. Anyone is welcome to drop by and come into his living space (which looks more like an antique shop), and he says no one has ever stolen a thing, though he has given some of his stuff away. Thankfully, filmmaking couple Kelsey Holtaway and Mark Cersosimo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015233/http://departurearrivalfilms.com/">documented Pisano</a> and his apartment&#x2014;so go ahead and introduce yourself in the below video. And if you ever pass by his apartment, drop in, he&apos;ll likely be sitting out front.</p>
