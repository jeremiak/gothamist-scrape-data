										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpnu2AboPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpnu2AboPM.jpg" width="300" height="234" class="image-left"> </span>Last year the city&#x2019;s Economic Development Corporation announced their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://www.nycbigapps.com/">NYC BigApps</a> competition, which invited anyone to develop an application using 170 sets of municipal data made available by 30 different agencies. Throughout the process, we&apos;ve seen apps like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/15/taxi_hack.php">Taxihack</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/15/busted_meter_app.php">NYC Broken Meters</a> (aka free parking!) pop up, and last night the winners were officially announced.</p>

<p>Out of over 100 entrants, there were 10 winners (all in all $20,000 in cash prizes were dispersed and they&apos;ll all attend a dinner with Mayor Bloomberg). <em>And the winners are</em>... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://www.wayfindermobile.com/">WayFinder NYC</a>, which allows users to find the closest subway entrance; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://www.taxihack.com/">Taxihack</a>, where you can review your driver; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://www.bigappleed.com/">Big Apple Ed</a>, which gives access to profiles, reviews and information about the city&#x2019;s public schools. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/nyc-announces-winners-of-local-apps-contest/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">CityRoom</a> notes that there was also a Popular Choice award, which was given to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063457/http://www.nycway.com/">NYC Way</a>, an app that &quot;offers a range of information for city residents and visitors.&quot; Well, that&apos;s vague! The app does offer <em>a lot</em>, giving you everything from a list of wanted criminals to tips on keeping it green to restaurant inspection info (that actually may be a terrifying thing to have access to).</p>
