										<p>Did you happen to catch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175611/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml">Stephen Colbert</a> announce his candidacy for President of the United States of America? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175611/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/arts/television/18colb.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports he&apos;s planning to run in South Carolina primaries, and that he&apos;s &quot;serious enough about the stunt that his staff reached out to the state&#x2019;s Democratic and Republican committees in advance of his declaration.&quot;  The S.C. Democratic committee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175611/http://www.news.com/8301-13577_3-9798943-36.html">says they&apos;d have no problems with him running</a>.</p>

<p>Colbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175611/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/29/colberts_comic.php">already has</a> his own tv show, a comic book, an ice cream, a minor league hockey team&apos;s mascot named after him...even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175611/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/opinion/14dowd.html">infiltrated Maureen Dowd&apos;s NY Times column!</a>  Perhaps this was the only way he could outdo himself. Raising the bar even still, he said &quot;he said he hoped to run as both a Democrat and a Republican.&quot;</p>

<p>No one seems to understand the motivation behind his announcement, but it couldn&apos;t hurt in the promotion of his book <em>I Am America (and So Can You!)</em>. Check out how it went down on Tuesday: </p>

<p>The South Carolina primary is expected to be held on Jan. 26. Would you vote Colbert?  And tonight, his guest is Craig Newmark of craigslist.  <br>
