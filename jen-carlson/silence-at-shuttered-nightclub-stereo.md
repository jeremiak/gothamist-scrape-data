Sorry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171948/http://www.stereonyc.com/photogallery.html">clubland kids</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171948/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/01/12/2008-01-12_nypd_silences_slayscene_club_stereo.html">The Daily News</a> reports that last night &quot;a police van and five unmarked cars rolled onto W.29th St. at 9 p.m., did a 30-minute sweep of the open but empty nightspot, posted the closing notice and bolted the club&apos;s doors.&quot; WABC was also on the scene, and has a video of their report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171948/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=5886991">here</a>.</p>

<p>While Schneider&apos;s killer is still at large, the NYPD says the shuttering of the club has nothing to do with the slaying. NYPD attorney Allison Arenson told The Daily News that Stereo was closed due to cocaine being found, and because of their unlicensed security guards. She also says there&apos;s a &quot;whole slew of things&quot; that led to the decision. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171948/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01122008/news/regionalnews/stereo_unplugged_64634.htm">The NY Post</a> reports that &quot;Stereo has been closed three times since last April for a slew of violations, including owing the city nearly $15,000 in fines.&quot;</p>

<p>The club is in an area the NYPD sees as a hotbed for criminal activity, and is just one of the establishments it&apos;s been trying to shut down since 2006. No word on whether they will try to reopen again. But fear not, there&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171948/http://www.jetsetreport.com/nightlife.php?articleId=69&amp;PHPSESSID=2">Stereo by the Shore</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171948/http://gaysocialites.com/2008/01/new_club_coming_to_former_crob.html">another overpriced, glitzy nightclub opening</a> up soon in the old Crobar space. We wonder how long that one will stay out of trouble for. Watch out Chinatown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171948/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/10/clubland_ny_100.php">you&apos;re next</a>.</p>
