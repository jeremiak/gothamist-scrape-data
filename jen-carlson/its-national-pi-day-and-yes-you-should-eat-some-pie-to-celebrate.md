<p>Happy Pi Day, to those celebrating the mathematical constant &#x3C0; (pi). Naturally, the celebration lands on March 14th ever year, and if you don&apos;t know why, then you can stop reading now and <em>shhh rest your brain</em>.  </p>

<p>The day was created by Larry Shaw in 1988, and first celebrated at the San Francisco Exploratorium, where Shaw worked as a physicist. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152451/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day">to lore</a>, on that day the staff and public marched around one of its circular spaces, then consumed fruit pies. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152451/http://www.exploratorium.edu/pi/index.html">Their site</a> states, &quot;On the afternoon of March 14th participate in pi-related activities and enjoy a piece of pie. If you can&apos;t join us in person, watch our webcast on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152451/http://explo.tv/">explo.tv</a> or celebrate with us in Second Life.&quot;</p>

<p>After over two decades of celebrating on a non-official level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution that recognized March 14th, 2009 as National Pi Day. And you know you&apos;ve got a real holiday on your hands when Google devotes a Doodle to it&#x2014;which they did in 2010.</p>

<p>What kind of pie do you think pairs well with Pi Day? It&apos;s also worth noting that today would have been Albert Einstein&apos;s 133rd birthday, and as one person with internet access once stated, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152451/http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Did_albert_Einstein_like_pie">he liked pie</a>.</p>
