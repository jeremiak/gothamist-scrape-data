										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cellphonemovie0611sm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413094238im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cellphonemovie0611sm.jpg" width="300" height="216" class="image-left"> </span>Last night Patton Oswalt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413094238/https://twitter.com/#!/pattonoswalt/status/77876039522598912">Tweeted</a>: &quot;I love you, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413094238/http://drafthouse.com/">Alamo Drafthouse</a>. Culling the morons,&quot; with a link to the below video. The movie theater explains that the video &quot;is an actual voicemail from a woman that was kicked out of one of our Austin theaters&quot; (for using her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413094238/http://gothamist.com/tags/cellphones">cell phone</a>). They have a strict policy on cell phones, and warn their patrons via signage that cell phone use will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>After getting kicked to the curb for texting, she seemed to have drowned her sorrows in a few bottles of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413094238/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhWgFGbMspE">Boone&apos;s Farm Strawberry Hill</a> (probably?), and then decided to drunk dial the theater and leave them this message&#x2014;it&apos;s worth your 1 minute and 47 seconds of time:</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413094238/http://austinist.com/2011/06/06/message_from_the_alamo_drafthouse_d.php">Austinist</a>, this video will screen before movies at the theater. Should New York City movie theaters get more vigilant about kicking out their chatty, or otherwise distracting patrons? At the very least, let&apos;s rev up the public shaming machine in these parts.</p>
