<p>On April 13th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170211/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> will return for, what AMC has dubbed, &quot;The Beginning of the End.&quot; The final season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170211/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/mad_men_wont_end_until_2015.php">will be split</a> into two parts, with 8 episodes airing this year and the final 8 next year. AMC has just released the first teaser to the season, which shows Don Draper walking down the stairs of a plane. While the music accompanying his descent is light and airy, giving the scene an almost Los Angeles feel, Draper could also be coming back to New York City to re-enter his collapsed world. </p>

<p>That&apos;s Wax Tailor&apos;s version of &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot; playing as Draper leaves the plane (h/t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170211/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/don-draper-takes-a-flight-in-mad-men-final-season-tease">Sepinwall</a>):</p>

<p>When we last left Draper he was in a dark place (we&apos;ll have a refresher prior to the season premiere), with the final scene of the season showing him with his kids, standing outside of the whorehouse in Pennsylvania he grew up in:</p>

<p>Does this teaser tell us anything? Last season&apos;s pre-season artwork showed two Don Drapers, and we did end up seeing him bring the curtain back on Dick Whitman, so there could be clues here, too. So step inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170211/http://gothamist.com/tags/truedetective">Rust Cohle</a>&apos;s storage locker and figure out what this teaser video means!</p>
