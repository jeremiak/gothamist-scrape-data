<p>At the start of this week I wrote about <em>this love</em> I had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127073159/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/25/m5.php">for the Maroon 5 song &quot;One More Night,&quot;</a> and how its perfectly manufactured pop vibrations refused to leave my body. Like one of those people who gets the hiccups <em>forever</em> and just has to live with them, I felt as though I would never be able to rid myself of the song. It was all I wanted to listen to for almost two weeks, well past the normal lifespan for a pop song. But then, Brian Jacobs&#x2014;frontman for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127073159/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/ten_nyc_bands_we_miss.php">Apes &amp; Androids</a> (arguably the best band this <strike>town</strike> universe has seen in the past decade)&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127073159/http://stereogum.com/1210002/majestyy-the-notion-spirits-touch/mp3s/">released two new songs</a> via his solo project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127073159/http://majestyy.com/">Majestyy</a>. And I am pleased to report that his song &quot;The Notion&quot; has successfully massacred &quot;One More Night&quot;&#x2014;in fact, it has been over 24 hours since I&apos;ve listened to it, and I don&apos;t sense a relapse in the near future... because then I&apos;d have to stop listening to <em>this</em>:</p>

<p>And that&apos;s not all, there&apos;s also a stellar slow jam called &quot;Spirits Touch&quot;: </p>

<p>And EVEN BETTER? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127073159/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/morgan_z_formerly_of_apes_androids.php">Morgan Z</a>, also formerly of Apes &amp; Androids, has been hard at work in his laboratory as well, and his band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127073159/http://www.chrome-canyon.com/">Chrome Canyon</a> is playing at 285 Kent tonight, where he promises &quot;aerial acrobatics, lasers, and seizure inducing strobes!&quot; Adam Levine, who?</p>
