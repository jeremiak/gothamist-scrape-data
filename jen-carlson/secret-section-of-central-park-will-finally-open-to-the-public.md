<p>[<strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103600/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/11/photos_inside_new_central_park_section.php">See photos from inside the revitalized sanctuary here</a>.]</p>

<p>Did you know that there are four acres of Central Park that have been closed off since the 1930s? While the Central Park Conservancy has given the park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103600/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/06/central_park_1980s_photos.php">a remarkable new life since the 1980s</a>, they haven&apos;t quite gotten to everything, but now they&apos;ve announced a &quot;new&quot; (to you) section is ready for humans: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103600/http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/hallett-nature-sanctuary.html">the Hallett Nature Sanctuary</a> (n&#xE9;e Promontory) will open this summer.</p>

<p>Aside from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, the Sanctuary&#x2014;located by the Pond&#x2014;is the only permanently fenced-off section of the park. &#x201C;The story is, [then Parks Commissioner] Robert Moses closed it off because he wanted it to turn into a bird sanctuary,&#x201D; said the CPC&apos;s Douglas Blonsky.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103600/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/nyregion/a-secret-section-of-central-park-reopens.html?_r=0">the NY Times</a>, the section will now open during certain hours, all thanks to the CPC&apos;s $40 million Woodland&apos;s Initiative, which is aimed at revitalizing lesser known areas of the 843-acre park. The CPC notes on their website that &quot;the Hallett Nature Sanctuary is a perfect example of how even the wildest, most naturalistic habitats in Central Park require constant planning and care in order to thrive.&quot; </p>

<p>Neglected for decades, invasive plants had taken over the area, but now some weeding has tamed the landscape, a new rustic gate (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103600/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/25/nyc_bench_history_shocker.php">those original rustic benches</a>) has been put in place, and new paths have been cleared. An irrigation system has also been set up to help with regular watering.</p>

<p>The Sanctuary is located at on the East Side, from 60th-62nd Streets, just south of Wollman Rink. You can find the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103600/http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/hallett-nature-sanctuary.html">hours here</a>.</p>
