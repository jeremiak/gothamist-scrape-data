title: James Cameron Addresses Titanic Conspiracy That Rose And Jack Could Have Both Lived
---

	
										<p>Four months ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206140841/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/sey0u/jack_and_rose_could_have_both_fit_on_that_wooden/c4dnjar">a Redditor</a> taped out the dimensions of the raft that saves Rose in James Cameron&apos;s <em>Titanic</em> movie, saying both Jack and Rose could have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206140841/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOELajNqh0k">fit on the raft</a>. Here&apos;s the side-by-side:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="raftgate0912.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206140841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/raftgate0912.jpeg" width="640" height="167" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>And this isn&apos;t the only time someone has questioned the end of the film&#x2014;these two women recreated the scene in a pool:</p>

<p>So is Jack&apos;s blood on Cameron&apos;s hands? The theory reached the director, who <em>shockingly</em> will not admit to being wrong. He said in a recent interview, &quot;It&apos;s not a question of room, it&apos;s a question of buoyancy. Jack puts Rose on the raft, then he tries to get on the raft&#x2014;he&apos;s not an idiot, he doesn&apos;t want to die&#x2014;and the raft sinks, and it kind of flips. So it&apos;s clear that there&apos;s really only enough buoyancy available for one person. He makes a decision to let her be that person, instead of taking them both down.&quot; Cameron says he even plans to go on Mythbusters to further debunk the theory and clear his name.</p>
