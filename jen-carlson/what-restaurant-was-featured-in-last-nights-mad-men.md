<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145344/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/mad_men_17.php">last night&apos;s <em>Mad Men</em></a>, Don Draper and Sylvia Rosen end up dining alone at what seems to be a well-known, fancy Italian restaurant. In the past, scenes have taken place at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145344/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/14/mad_men_12.php">Trader Vic&apos;s</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145344/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/09/was_nycs_playboy_club_more_or_less.php#photo-8">The Playboy Club</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145344/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/mad_men_9.php">Minetta Tavern and the Hemisphere Club</a>, so last night&apos;s establishment was likely real (or based on a real restaurant).... but what one was it? </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="MADMENwaiter.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145344im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/MADMENwaiter.jpg" width="350" height="281" class="image-right"> </span><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></p>

<p>There&apos;s some sort of speil from the waiter: Dr. Rosen tells Don, who arrives late, &quot;We&apos;ll get the waiter to do the whole show again.&quot;</p>

<p>It may be a little bit exclusive: Upon having to depart before dinner even begins, Dr. Rosen tells Don and Sylvia, &quot;I&apos;m not taking the foot out of my door of this restaurant. Just order for four or they&apos;ll punish me.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s Italian: Don asks Sylvia what to order, &quot;What looks good here? I&apos;d like some guidance on the Italian menu from my favorite Italian.&quot;</p>

<p>Menu items mentioned: Eggplant rollatini, steak diavolo, branzino.</p>

<p>Decor: There are a lot of framed photographs and paintings on the wall.</p>

<p>It&apos;s expensive: Conversation at the table includes, &quot;You know we&apos;re losing the war?&quot; &quot;Wouldn&apos;t know it from looking around here.&quot; &quot;Yeah it&apos;s something, right?&quot;</p>
