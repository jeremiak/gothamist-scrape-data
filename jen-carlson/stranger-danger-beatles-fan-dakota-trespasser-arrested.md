										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lennononodakota012011.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151714im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lennononodakota012011.jpg" width="225" height="321" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151714/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/20/yoko_ono.php">details were scare</a> regarding the man who managed to sneak into the Dakota, but now more are emerging. 24-year-old graphic design student Sungno Kim, a Korean tourist hitting up some spots in his guide book, says he went to the building because he&apos;s a Beatles fan and read that is where John Lennon lived (and died). </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151714/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/ono_not_again_PV5JLb6unOXrFFLchq1pcK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, Kim says he went to the roof, took a few photos, and on his back way down Yoko Ono got on. He claims he didn&apos;t recognize her, and since Ono definitely didn&apos;t recognize him... she called security. Even though Kim made no attempt to engage her, residents of the building are now <em>freaking out</em>. They say that even tenants don&apos;t have access to the roof, and the elevator doesn&apos;t go there (though, c&apos;mon, surely the elevator goes to a staircase that can reach the roof).</p>

<p>Kim was arrested for trespassing and has to serve a day of community service while the security breach may cost at least one man his job. Normally a guard is stationed at the service entrance, which is how Kim got into the building last Wednesday. A source told the paper, &quot;They may fire the managing agent. They are all freaking out&#x2014;as they should be. The whole reason they have heightened security there, more than any other building, is because of [Ono and the late Lennon].&quot; </p>

<p>Ono says, &quot;I&apos;m fine now.&quot; While her fear is understandable... has no one ever visited a friend at the Dakota before? Surely there have been unfamiliar faces in the elevator in the past.</p>
