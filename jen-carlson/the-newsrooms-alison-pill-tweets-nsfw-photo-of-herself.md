<p>Actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082525/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/25/alison_pill.php">Alison Pill</a>, currently of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082525/http://gothamist.com/tags/thenewsroom"><em>The Newsroom</em></a>, has just Tweeted a photo of herself topless to 13,597 followers. Naturally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082525/http://egotastic.com/2012/09/alison-pill-topless-pill-twitpics-titspic-to-her-twitter-account/">the internet grabbed the pic</a> before she deleted it, which she did, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082525/https://twitter.com/msalisonpill/status/245944627461496833">adding</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Yep. That picture happened. Ugh. My tech issues have now reached new heights, apparently. How a deletion turned into a tweet... Apologies.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>If this were <em>The Newsroom</em>&apos;s Olivia Munn we may think it was a publicity stunt, but poor Pill seems to simply be the latest celebrity who doesn&apos;t know how to Direct Message. Anyway, Will McAvoy would probably try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082525/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzvtn0NlrJk#t=8m15s">to civilize us</a> for posting this, and he&apos;d probably be right...</p>

<p>But we WILL NEVER apologize for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082525/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/is_this_photo_of_jon_hamms.php">posting about Hamm&apos;s Ham</a>!</p>
