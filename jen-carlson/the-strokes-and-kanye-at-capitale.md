Tuesday night we headed over to Capitale for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160527152123/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/08/17/kanye_and_the_s.php">an &quot;intimate&quot; show</a> with The Strokes and Kanye West. As expected, the door was a mess, pr flacks ran around with fistfuls of shiny wristbands, and large doormen told us we weren&apos;t getting in, even if we were on the list. We waited for about 10 minutes, saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160527152123/http://editorial.gettyimages.com/source/search/details_pop.aspx?iid=72202284&amp;cdi=0">these two</a> walk in, and left. 

</p><p>Above is a sonically (and otherwise) confusing clip of Kanye showing up that night. Did anyone make it in? </p>
