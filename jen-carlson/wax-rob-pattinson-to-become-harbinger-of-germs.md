<p>Paired up with the release of <em>New Moon</em> on DVD, <em>Twilight</em> star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211634/http://gothamist.com/tags/robpattinson">Robert Pattinson</a> got immortalized in wax today at Madame Tussauds in Times Square. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211634/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1634729/story.jhtml">MTV</a> braved the scene and reports back that crazed, screaming fans stood in line for hours to see the $220,000 replica. This thing isn&apos;t going to last through the week; the museum allows touching <em>and</em> kissing! Bring your Purell, ladies.</p>
