<p>This morning a Brooklyn man posted this photo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074233/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/17124b/dont_really_expect_this_kind_of_thing_to_happen/">on Reddit</a>, adding, &quot;Don&apos;t really expect this kind of thing to happen to me in the middle of Brooklyn.&quot; We contacted the poster, Brandon McNeil of Bed-Stuy, who tells us the break-in occurred in October around 11 p.m. Here is his tale, <em>which he lived to tell:</em></p>

<blockquote>&quot;We had the windows open with screens in. I was in another room when I noticed a loud bang from my bedroom. I thought my cat knocked something off a dresser so I went to see what happened. As I walked into the room my cat was at the door with his back arched, clearly scared. That&apos;s when I looked up to see what had happened and saw the intruder.

<p>The raccoon and I looked at each other for a few seconds, and i started to wave my jacket at it. Then I started to yell at it. The raccoon seemed confused and wasn&apos;t moving for a while, but eventually turned around and walked back out the window.</p></blockquote> <p></p>

<p>Though at that point the raccoon had a taste of domesticity, and McNeil says it immediately climbed the fire escape and attempted to break in the neighbor&apos;s apartment. At this point, it&apos;s unclear what happened&#x2014;maybe the raccoon is now living upstairs.</p>

<p>So what do you do if a raccoon breaks in to your apartment? (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074233/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/raccoon_invades_park_slope_brownsto.php">It&apos;s happened before</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074233/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/raccoons_return_to_park_slope_brown.php">it&apos;ll happen again</a>.) If this man&apos;s story tells us anything, it&apos;s probably best to stand your ground, reach for your cell phone for photo documentation that you&apos;ll later upload to various social media platforms, and if it&apos;s <em>still there</em> reach for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074233/http://www.nyc.gov/apps/311/allServices.htm?requestType=service&amp;levelOneId=D7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE&amp;levelTwoId=D7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE-3&amp;levelThreeId=D7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE-3-1&amp;serviceName=Raccoon+Control+Information+for+Homeowners&amp;finalSubLevel=3&amp;intentId=E9E66310-8137-11DE-8E9F-96DAE110FEB8">your handy raccoon brochure</a>, or call 311.</p>
