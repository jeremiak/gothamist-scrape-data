The employee of 3rd Ward in Brooklyn who discovered her and took her in sent us this update yesterday, which we&apos;re sharing with you since we&apos;ve received so many emails about her!: &quot;We had a great response from people. The Chihuahua is now with Sean Casey Rescue where they are tending to her wounds and waiting to see if the owners contact them. If not, she will be ready for adopting and a new home.&quot;</p>
