<p>These Asian Small-Clawed Otters are now on view at the Bronx Zoo, having just made their big debut. While some believe they look like wet ferrets, others find the creatures simply adorable. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501205002/http://twitter.com/bfishbfish">Rebecca Fishbein</a>, who never met an animal she didn&apos;t ALL CAPS about, squealed upon seeing these photos, asking:  &quot;WILL THEY LET ME PLAY WITH THE OTTERS?&quot; No, Rebecca, statistically speaking your chance of playing with these otters is lower than your chance of shapeshifting into an otter.</p>

<p>Others believed these otters weren&apos;t going to be very &quot;viral.&quot; To that claim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501205002/http://twitter.com/yenbakas">Ben Yakas</a> pointed to the below photo, anthropomorphizing the otters with this caption: &quot;If you prick us, do we not bleed pageviews?&quot;</p>

<p>Sometime around the end of 2014, people just stopped clicking on our posts about animals. Cute animals became as non-viral as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501205002/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/04/zoo_acquires_two_okay_looking_anima.php">non-viral animals</a>. Fishbein honestly seems like the only person who gives a shit anymore, and she&apos;s only good for one click. </p>

<p>So what happened? In a <em>Behind The Music</em>-esque documentary that set out to answer that question while visiting viral animal has-beens, this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501205002/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/29/photo_amazing_panda_lamb_born_at_st.php">panda lamb of Staten Island</a> walked off set mid-interview. &quot;I&apos;m a panda lamb,&quot; he shouted on his way out, taking a long drag off his Marlboro Red. &quot;A PANDA LAMB. I&apos;m a lamb that has the coloring of a panda, goddammit. No one clicked. No one. What more do people want?&quot;</p>

<p>Panda lamb was never heard from again, and certainly hasn&apos;t showed up on any more websites. Will that happen to THIS FACE LOOK AT THIS FACE, too?</p>
