<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151229042055/http://www.mountain-goats.com/">The Mountain Goats</a> have a new album, <em>Transcendental Youth</em>, coming out on October 2nd&#x2014;and if you&apos;ve heard John Darnielle&apos;s songs before then you don&apos;t need the hard sell, but here it is anyway from humorist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151229042055/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/john_hodgeman_interview.php">John Hodgman</a>. Hodgman declares the album is &quot;VERY GOOD,&quot; and &quot;full of songs about people who madly, stupidly, blessedly won&apos;t stop surviving, no matter who gives up on them.&quot; He adds, &quot;if some of his songs suggest that there are real hells on earth, other songs remind that the heavens are equally close at hand.&quot; </p>

<p>We were lucky enough to hear Darnielle perform some of the new tracks (and classics) right in front of us in late July. Here they are, filmed on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151229042055/http://www.floridakeysnyc.com/">Florida Keys</a> recording studio&apos;s rooftop in Ridgewood, Queens.</p>
