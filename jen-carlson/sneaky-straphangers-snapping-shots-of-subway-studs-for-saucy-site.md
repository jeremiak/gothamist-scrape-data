<p>Forget the antiquated Craigslist Missed Connection, now you can snap a photo of your subway crush and send it to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209204315/http://subwaycrush.net/">SubwayCrush.net</a>, which so far is only posting photos of &quot;hot guys&quot; underground. At press time, the site is currently down (after getting some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209204315/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/10/06/2011-10-06_are_you_a_subway_hunk_check_out_cheeky_website.html">Daily News</a> love today), so we can&apos;t comment on the men posted up there right now. But would you feel violated if your photo was secretly taken and given to The Internet? Ponder that, while checking out this video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209204315/http://www.youtube.com/user/smartstudbrooklyn">a person</a> who videotapes butts around the city. No one is safe!</p>
