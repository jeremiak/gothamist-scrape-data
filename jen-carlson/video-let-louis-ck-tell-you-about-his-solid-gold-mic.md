<p>Ever since purchasing his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191640/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/04/photo_louis_cks_yacht_gets_stuck_in.php">fancy new yacht</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191640/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis CK</a> has really gone full spiral into the glitz and glamor machine fueled by overwhelming fame: in this teaser for his new HBO special, he even flashes his new <em>solid gold mic</em>. Just like one King Tut or someone fancy and rich from olden times would have procured had electricity been around back then. Get a load of this guy:</p>

<p>His special, called <em>Oh My God</em> (filmed during his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191640/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/23/attention_new_york_louis_ck_tickets.php">recent tour</a>), will hit HBO on April 13th, and hopefully we can get some more classic Louis teasers like the above as the marketing engines really get revved up.</p>
