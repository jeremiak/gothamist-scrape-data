<p>Brazilian artists, and brothers, Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo&#x2014;better known as Os Gemeos&#x2014;along with Futura, have completed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003103240/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/os_gemeos.php">their new mural</a> on the side of P.S. 11 in Chelsea. The piece was created in partnership with the AKANYCcreative studio and street art website 12ozProphet. It measures at about 80-feet, and of the design, Os Gemeos says, &quot;We are using different flags painted with non-traditional colors. The idea is &#x2018;one world one voice&#x2019;, no borders, no separation, just everything and everyone working together for a single cause that is a better world.&quot; Let&apos;s hope <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003103240/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/shepard_faireys_mural_is_now_done.php">Shepard Fairey</a> doesn&apos;t cover it up with a Target ad, like their last New York mural <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003103240/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/16/sace_dedication.php">on Houston Street</a>.</p>
