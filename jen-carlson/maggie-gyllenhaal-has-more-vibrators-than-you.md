Everyone involved in the flick got their own modern-day version of the device, but Gyllenhaal got enough to open up her own Park Slope Sex Toy Co-op. The actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201605/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/16/uk-film-toronto-hysteria-idUSLNE78F02N20110916">declared</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201605/http://www.ology.com/celebs-and-gossip/maggie-gyllenhaal-gets-giftedvibrators">more than once</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;By the time I finished the movie I&apos;d been sent maybe 15 vibrators by different people in London with vibrator stores. It was a pleasant surprise.  So I have this incredible collection, and I actually use like one or two of them. <strong>I lend them to my friends, and they&#x2019;ll take them for six months at a time.</strong> [While shooting <em>Hysteria</em>] I was sent a lot of vibrators from different sex stores in England while we were shooting the movie. I shared them around.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Stay tuned for the upcoming Vibrator Share trend in Brooklyn.</p>
