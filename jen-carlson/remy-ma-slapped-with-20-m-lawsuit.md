Until now! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094322/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jm8iCNI-3S5VX9TVEkMXXJU-AFCQD8TM8IM80">The AP</a> reports that the woman she is suspected of shooting, Makeda Barnes-Joseph, is suing her for $20 million -- a figure much higher than the $2,000 Remy thought Barnes-Joseph stole from her that night.</p><blockquote>The lawsuit says the shooting left her disabled, anxious and depressed. The suit also named as defendants Universal Music Group, and individuals who play important roles in Remy Ma&apos;s career, because they should have known she &quot;had a history of unlawful, violent and anti-social behavior.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The defendants &quot;encouraged her to engage in a pattern of harassment, threats, intimidation, physical violence and illegal acts which were designed and calculated by these defendants to enhance, market and promote the persona of &apos;Remy Ma,&apos;&quot; according to the suit.</p></blockquote>Well that plan backfired, Ivan Fisher (Remy&apos;s lawyer) said that &quot;since her arrest, Remy Ma has been unable to get sufficient U.S. bookings, and a proposed recording contract has been put on hold.&quot; As for Barnes-Joseph, she remains &quot;disabled, fearful, anxious and depressed and still unable to return to work,&quot; according to the lawsuit.<p></p>
