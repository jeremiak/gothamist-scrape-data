<p>Last year at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174710/http://gothamist.com/tags/phish">Phish</a>&apos;s show at the Gorge in Washington, Trey Anastasio urged the audience to bring their participatory chanting on the song &quot;Wilson&quot; to the Seahawks&apos; stadium. &quot;By next season, every time Russell Wilson walks on the field... I think you know where I&apos;m going with this....&quot; Football and Phish are an odd pairing (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174710/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RuW2ZWHcz4">but it&apos;s happened before</a>!), so here&apos;s a quick explainer.</p>

<p>For those who don&apos;t know where he was going with that, &quot;Wilson,&quot; part of Anastasio&apos;s senior thesis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174710/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamehendge">at Goddard College</a>, starts off with the repetition of two distinctive, percussive notes. About ten years into the band&apos;s career, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174710/http://www.glidemagazine.com/hiddentrack/14-years-ago-phish-the-beacon/">during a performance at the Beacon Theatre in NYC</a>, some audience members started chanting: &quot;Wiiiiilson&quot; when those opening notes of the song were played. It sounds like this:</p>

<p>And for those who don&apos;t follow football: Russell Wilson is the quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks, who are headed to the Super Bowl next month. </p>

<p>Back at the Gorge last year, Anastasio continued his call upon Washington fans to bring the Wilson chant to CenturyLink Field: &quot;We are absolutely sure that this song is going to be in the loudest stadium in the world next season. Come on guys, it&apos;s gotta happen, it&apos;s gotta happen when he walks on the field. C&apos;mon, make it happen!&quot;</p>

<p>And it did happen. And the NFL made a short film about the entire thing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174710/http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-films-presents/0ap2000000307714/NFL-Films-Presents-Phish-and-Russell-Wilson">which you can watch here</a>. </p>

<p>While the chant was pretty loud at last night&apos;s game, the chant could be LOUDER&#x2014;so if you are going to the Super Bowl this year, no matter what side you&apos;re on, do the Wilson chant when Russell Wilson takes the field. Please. This is the only thing some of us at home will be rooting for. Here, better listen again:</p>
