<p>The below video (courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034550/http://improveverywhere.com/2015/05/26/groundskeeper-acrobats/">Improv Everywhere</a>) looks like a daydream we once had while sitting on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034550/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/bryant_park_movies_1.php">a packed Bryant Park lawn</a> during their popular summer movie series.
