<p>Prefab housing isn&apos;t just for the...&quot;thrifty&quot; anymore! Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/multimedia/2008/01/modular_homes?slide=1&amp;slideView=3">Wired</a> featured a selection of twelve modular, prefab housing units -- from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/30/living_in_the_f.php">lofts</a> to place atop city skylines to 60 square-foot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/multimedia/2008/01/modular_homes?slide=8&amp;slideView=4">cabins</a> with &quot;cathedral ceilings&quot;. </p>

<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/arts/design/08moma.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports that the idea has &quot;become fashionable at architecture schools and among an upscale segment of the housing market.&quot; As such, MoMA has commissioned five architects to set up their prefab-ulous designs in their vacant lot on West 53rd St (those chosen, of 400, are KieranTimberlake Associates of Philadelphia; Lawrence Sass of Cambridge, MA; Douglas Gauthier and Jeremy Edmiston of Manhattan; Oskar Leo Kaufmann and Albert R&#xFC;f of Austria; and Richard Horden of Horden Cherry Lee in London). The exhibit, titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/exhibitions.php?id=5476&amp;ref=calendar">Home Delivery: Fabricating the Modern Dwelling</a>, will open in July, but foundations will be laid next month. And when the houses begin to arrive in May, there&apos;s no doubt it will become a Richard Serra-like spectacle. </p>

<p>At least, that&apos;s what Barry Bergdoll, architecture curator at the museum, is predicting and hoping for. He wants to use this exhibit to show as many people as possible that there aren&apos;t just economical benefits to these housing options, there are environmental benefits as well. Starting in March the architects involved will be contributing weekly to a blog which will give us a peek into the world of prefab off-site assembly and delivery, hopefully including information about those environmental benefits alluded to. </p>

<p>As far as prefab housing in New York goes, this isn&apos;t the first time it will have been exhibited outdoors. Last summer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/17/modernist_imper.php">La Maison Tropicale</a>, the Jean Prouv&#xE9;-designed modernist prefab house, was on display under the Queensborough Bridge before being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/06/la_maison_tropi.php">sold at auction</a> to hotelier Andre Balazs. </p>

<p>How realistic is it for these units to become a part of our cityscape? We asked a New York architect, who told us &quot;As a rooftop application, NYC seems like it could be a good candidate.  However, it&apos;s hard to say whether or not the current building code could be interpreted to get one of these guys installed.  There&apos;s also the issue of zoning, particularly if these are considered habitable spaces. There are also structural issues - it could be costly to install steel in the roof if the current roof doesn&apos;t support its weight.&quot; Take a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508113811/http://openhousenyc.tv/floorplan/2007/12/29/prefab-homes/">this piece OpenHouse NYC did</a> on the prefab fad.</p>
