title: Andrea Peyser Wants Lindsay To Go F*ck Herself

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lindsaynails0710.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lindsaynails0710.jpg" width="256" height="350" class="image-right"> </span>There is so much drama in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindsaylohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>&apos;s orbit that it&apos;s almost surprising she isn&apos;t <em>embracing</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608/http://laist.com/2010/07/06/lohan_sentenced_to_90_days_in_jail.php">this jail sentence</a> she just got slapped with. It&apos;s like a 90-day vacation from paparazzi, family, the internet, and whatever else is driving her to the very edge of sanity. But the troubled starlet is lashing out, and with that, she&apos;s getting criticized with <em>poor baby</em>-toned editorials in all the rags.</p>

<p>Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/07/08/2010-07-08_your_pity_party_is_over_linds_should_drop_poor_me_act_and_count_lucky_stars.html">the Daily News</a> they call Lohan lucky, and say &quot;she blamed everyone but herself. And then she literally gave the court the finger, with the message &apos;Fuck U&apos; etched on her center fingernail.&quot; Yeah, about that...</p>

<p>Thanks to zoom lenses, her special manicure was spotted by just about everyone when photos were released from her hearing&#x2014;but Lohan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/lindsay_lohan_defends_obscene_manicure_aDMu2FbIUH7nl8Yfq32qQK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">is denying</a> it had anything to do with the court of law, and was just an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608/http://twitter.com/lindsaylohan/status/17982400624">inside joke with a friend</a>. A public defender in NYC says, &#x201C;she could have an entire extra sentence heaped on top of her current one&quot; if the judge found she was in contempt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the manicure <em>really</em> got the easily-riled-up Andrea Peyser riled up, over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/no_lindsay_it_time_you_yourself_NEg71ieeTrAoh1AE9gFxxL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post</a> she tells the pretty little trainwreck to go fuck herself! Seems like someone didn&apos;t take their meds before putting pen to paper&#x2014;in the first paragraph she says <strong>&quot;Linz desperately needs is a swift kick in the teeth, a foot in the backside and a broom with which to clean up her many messes, which I would not touch with a full-body condom.&quot;</strong> She goes on to note that LA is &quot;a town of second, third and 23rd chances, the pathologically spoiled, drug-addled skank finally went too far, which is saying a lot in a place where a judge kissed up to girl-beater Chris Brown, and a jury actually freed OJ Simpson.&quot; </p>

<p>But does anyone <em>really</em> think Lindsay is going to jail for the full 90 days? Whatever, you <em>know</em> Dina is sending her over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216054608/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/17/carvel_denies_dina_lohan_a_cake.php">a Cookie Puss cake</a> with some escape tools in it.</p>
