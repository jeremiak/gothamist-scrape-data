title: How New Yorkers View The Rest Of The Country: Help Us Fill Out This Map!
---

	
										<p>This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012746/http://www.funnyordie.com/articles/a106c8188f/the-map-of-america-as-seen-by-a-new-yorker">Funny or Die</a> posted a map of the United States, noting, &quot;New Yorkers have no sense of geography, which is fair, considering the world revolves around their city. As a New Yorker myself, I attempted to draw the map of the United States. As far as I know, it&apos;s 100% accurate.&quot; It&apos;s just that... it could have been <em>so much better</em>! (Like <em>The New Yorker</em>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012746/http://bigthink.com/ideas/21121">View of the World cover</a>.) So below we&apos;ve provided a blank map, separating New York from the rest of the states. How would you have filled it out? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424012746/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">Send yours in</a>, or tell us your thoughts in the comments, and we&apos;ll post a finished product (or a few) later today.</p>
