<p>On March 21st, the Landmarks Committee of Community Board 4 voted to NOT recommend the Chetrit Group&apos;s proposal for an addition to the roof of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191212/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">Hotel Chelsea</a>. Rumor has been that new owner Joseph Chetrit wants to add a rooftop bar, though they&apos;ve denied it when asked. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191212/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2012/04/community-board-4-to-vote-on-landmark-committee-recommendation-wed-442012.html">Last night</a>, the full Community Board had a chance to respond to recommendation&#x2014;here&apos;s some video which shows architect Gene Kaufman explaining the plans:</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191212/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120405/chelsea-hells-kitchen/hotel-chelsea-owner-wants-build-rooftop-bar-documents-show">DNAInfo</a> says they&apos;ve obtained documents that show the owners <em>do</em> want to construct a nightspot on the famous hotel&apos;s roof... which, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191212/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2009/01/endangered-chelsea-hotel-rooftop-gardens-among-first-in-the-city.html">sadly</a>, doesn&apos;t quite look like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191212/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/is_it_your_last_chance_to_stay_at_t.php#photo-6">this magical place</a> anymore&#x2014;they&apos;ve been clearing out things since 2009:</p>

<p>The site notes an application to the Department of Buildings submitted in October which asked for permission to build at 150-person &quot;rooftop bar,&quot; which would be constructed near ten residences (this was one of the LPC&apos;s issues with the proposal). Chetrit and his team have challenged the previous ruling and are attempting to move forward with a proposed plan. However, Chetrit has previously said, &quot;I don&apos;t think it will be a discotheque. It will probably only be a breakfast room or a lunch room.&quot; How quaint... but possibly untrue? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191212/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/nyregion/ed-hamilton-hotel-chelsea-blogger-strolls-the-avenues-on-sundays.html?_r=2&amp;sq=Ed">One resident</a> told us:</p>

<blockquote>Yes, plenty of people still live on the roof. LPC will hear Gene Kaufman&apos;s proposal next week. Basically, they [LPC] are not supporting the addition to the roof for a variety of reasons.  The Board also indicated at their meeting last night that they will send a second letter to LPC recommending that the entire process be slowed down until they understand more about the overall plans for the Hotel.</blockquote>

<p>We have a feeling people will be ordering $16 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191212/http://www.ehow.com/video_4981323_make-sid-vicious-mixed-drink.html">Sid Vicious cocktails</a> any day now.</p>
