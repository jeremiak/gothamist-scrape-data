After being taken in by Animal Care &amp; Control, the one-year-old reptile will be brought to an animal sanctuary in the Poconos. (He&apos;s going to love those champagne glass baths!) According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728042131/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/he_caiman_went_to_new_home_M5iGeIpn0JPFRehm2eEoqN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, yesterday he was being kept under a 100-watt heat lamp in Brooklyn, where an ACC director theorized on how he could have ended up in Queens. </p>

<p>Michael Pastore told the paper, &quot;Someone probably dumped him there. My guess is that someone obtained it as a pet, brought it home, and Mom and Dad threw it out on the street.&quot; Maybe they read somewhere that this thing could grow up to 6-feet long!</p>

<p>The critter hasn&apos;t been given a name yet, but Pastore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728042131/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/24/2010-08-24_three_reptiles_nabbed_in_wild_24hour_span.html">added this</a> little heartbreaking detail about his rescue: &quot;He did let out a couple of little yelps, and if you&apos;ve ever seen a nature show, a baby alligator would let out a little yelp to the mother when it is in trouble.&quot;</p>
