</div></div>					<p>Last night Justin Bieber followed in the footsteps of one of his musical influences, Michael Jackson, and took the stage at the Apollo Theater for an intimate concert. Bieber announced the show via Twitter yesterday, and Macy&apos;s in Herald Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045544/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/justin_bieber_harlem.php">gave out 500 tickets</a> (to anyone who bought some Bieber fragrance). The show was well-documented, and here is what it sounded like&#x2014;turn it up to 11, these screams are stronger than coffee! </p>

<p>The show didn&apos;t go off without a hitch, however... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031045544/http://news.yahoo.com/biebers-hot-show-melts-down-apollo-power-043230787.html">the AP</a> reports that towards the end of Bieber&apos;s set, the power went out, forcing him to close out the show acoustic-style, just like he did during his busking days:</p>

<p>Bieber&apos;s manager Scooter Braun put a nice spin on the outage, saying, &quot;Then we hear the fire alarm. Literally, the boy blew up the Apollo&#x2014;he heated up the Apollo.&quot; After 40 minute of down time, the Biebs reportedly got frustrated, and eventually decided to continue the show without instruments. (HERO.) He told the crowd, &quot;I&apos;m sorry the power is out. (But) you guys have always had my back. I&apos;m going to sing &apos;Boyfriend&apos; and you&apos;re going to sing it back to me.&quot; Bruan declared, &quot;It was one of the most special nights I have ever been a part of.&quot;</p>

<p>The show was filmed, and will air on NBC later this week.</p>
