<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908071833/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/21/letterman_set_trashed.php">set was dumped</a> less than 24 hours after David Letterman&apos;s final sign-off on CBS, but the <em>Late Show</em> marquee that&apos;s been outside of the Ed Sullivan Theater for decades is just starting to come down now. Last night workers began to dismantle the marquee, a job that could take two more days. </p>

<p>As of this morning, it&apos;s still got the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; lettering, so it&apos;s your last chance to get a selfie in front of the historic marquee. You know, for Instagram, and your grandkids.</p>

<p>Stephen Colbert will be taking over the show starting September 8th, and will be setting up shop in the same theater&#x2014;with a whole new set, and shiny new marquee. Gonna miss Letterman&apos;s varsity font though...</p>
