<p>In the 1970s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151202040327/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Dolls">New York Dolls</a> took on another member, their roadie Peter Jordan, who often filled in on bass for Arthur Kane (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151202040327/http://www.popmatters.com/music/features/020625-nydolls.shtml">allegedly</a> when Kane&apos;s drinking became bad or, you know, when his girlfriend tried to cut off his thumb with a kitchen knife). While Jordan hasn&apos;t been taking part in their &quot;comeback&quot; shows over the past few years, he is still very much a part of New York. The former rockstar is now a doorman at a non-residential building in Midtown, near Grand Central. If you see him, show some respect...and ask him if he&apos;s working on a memoir (during his years with the Dolls he kept a diary, which was used as a reference for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151202040327/http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Dolls-Much-Soon/dp/0711996032">one book</a> on the band). And did you know guitarist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151202040327/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/09/an_interview_wi_11.html">Sylvain Sylvain</a> used to drive a cab?</p>
