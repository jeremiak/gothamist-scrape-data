Perching himself outside of the Manhattan Criminal Court while working as a court photographer for the NY Post, he asks everyday defendants, upon their departure, what got them there. The stories are culled together for his Confessions project, giving a broad snapshot of just who is going in and out of the building each day while the press waits for the A-list names to show their face.</em></p><em>

<p><strong>When and why did you start the Courthouse Confessions project/website?</strong> I started it at the beginning of June. I think the third. I  work as a freelancer for the Post as the court photographer. I photograph the perps du jour at the local courts. Robert Chambers, Remy Smith and Tatum O&apos;Neal come to mind as some recent A-listers. While I stand outside waiting, I get the daily request to, &quot;Hey take my picture!&quot; or &quot;Do you want to hear a good story?&quot; Well that&apos;s a no brainer, let me put them both together and I wound up with my latest project. This is part of a trilogy of crime. The other two are &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629041628/http://www.stevenhirsch.com/sexoffenders">Love Thy Neighbor</a>&quot;, Homes of New York State Registered Sex Offenders and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629041628/http://www.stevenhirsch.com/evidence">Evidence</a>&quot; From the Trial Of Peter Braunstein.</p>

<p><strong>Do you tell people what the photos/questions are for?</strong> Yes I tell them it&apos;s for a blog, book or gallery show. I tell them to Google &quot;Courthouse Confessions&quot; so they can find it. I&apos;m having a show next year at Pratt Institute. I might show the whole project.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Have you found most people are willing to discuss their case with you?</strong> Maybe one third of the people I ask will let me photograph and do an interview. I turn down a lot of people willing to do it. The story needs to grab you.</p>

<p><strong>Have there been any happy endings in the stories?</strong> Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629041628/http://courthouseconfessions.blogspot.com/2008/06/julio-brockington.html">Julio Brockington</a> aka Misdemeanor Man. He said, &quot;I hope this is the last one. I wanna retire. I wish I could go back to the number that comes before one, which is zero, because it wasn&apos;t .  I&apos;m not proud of it, but what it is is what it is!&quot;  Sweet man actually. Hey It&apos;s never too late to be hopeful.</p>
