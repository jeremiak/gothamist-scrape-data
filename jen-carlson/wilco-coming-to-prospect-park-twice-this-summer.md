										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="wilco0412bk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135720im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/wilco0412bk.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135720/http://www.bricartsmedia.org/performing-arts/celebrate-brooklyn">Celebrate Brooklyn</a> just solidified that they have the best summer lineup for outdoor concerts this year. Their benefit shows (which mean you have to buy a ticket) include M. Ward, Sigur Ros, Dirty Projectors, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135720/http://gothamist.com/tags/wilco">Wilco</a>, who just announced two nights in the park. </p>

<p>The band will take the stage on July 23rd (with opener Lee Fields &amp; The Expressions) and 24th (with opener Lee Ranaldo Band). Tickets pre-sale is on May 2nd at 10 a.m., with regular sale starting this Friday (also at 10 a.m.).</p>

<p>Though they played Central Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135720/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/25/videos_wilco_storm_adorbs_manhattan.php">last year</a>, the last time we saw Wilco was probably at this intimate Pianos show six years ago, on the day that we got our first digital camera (an important fact to keep in mind as you watch this very short clip): </p>

<p>As for the rest of the shows, they promise a full lineup soon.</p>
