<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smcloetsy0611.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615054647im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smcloetsy0611.jpg" width="350" height="257" class="image-right"> </span>Someone has stumbled upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615054647/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615054647/http://www.etsy.com/people/cherryforeverreturns?ref=pr_profile">Etsy profile</a>, which presumably she uses to procure things with (as opposed to sell things with). It&apos;s nice to see she&apos;s consistent with her internet dealings, incorporating both her charming trademark typo-ridden text <em>and</em> a totally out-of-nowhere financial issues rant in her profile:</p>

<blockquote>just like to come here, my checks are on a wierd sahcedule so bear with, per paypal plus my paypal account has had wierd stuff happen eg salaries and theft, so im very persnickity about it, but if i really like it youll get paid , my cpa hates the word&quot;etsy: &quot; but theres vendors on here i adore nd i al;ways discover new inspiring stuff.</blockquote>

<p>What kind of stuff? Well she&apos;s favorited a drawing of herself (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615054647/http://www.etsy.com/listing/49319173/sale-courtney-love-vs-april-5-1994">on sale</a>!), and some photos associated with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120615054647/http://www.etsy.com/listing/68802860/kurt-cobain-of-nirvana-lived-under-a">Kurt Cobain</a>, but her personal list of favorite items reads: &quot;tattered, vintage dresses and jewels, big fat crystals, things i can use in my home, passementrie, dolls, sometimes, old books, knives, signet rings.&quot; That&apos;s right, dresses and crystals and yadda yadda yadda DOLLS AND KNIVES. </p>
