<p>The most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083117/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Sharknado&amp;src=hash">#viral</a> movie to hit the small screen in the history of television (probably) was last week&apos;s SyFy original flick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083117/http://laist.com/tags/sharknado"><em>Sharknado</em></a>. Have you somehow avoided the mass hypesteria that surrounded its premiere last Friday, like our very own John &quot;I feel smug in that I still don&apos;t know what that is&quot; Del Signore? In short, it&apos;s a movie about a SHARK TORNADO that hits Los Angeles and Tara Reid is in it. And now a sequel is on the way that will bring the terrible graphics and D-list cast to New York City.</p>

<p>The network just announced the Big News, saying: &quot;Every once in a while, there is a perfect storm&#x2014;on television. The fans are clamoring for a sequel. Or perhaps it will be a prequel. What we can guarantee is that <em>Sharknado 2</em> will be lots of fun. We&#x2019;ll be announcing more details very soon. But we didn&#x2019;t want our fans to worry they wouldn&#x2019;t get their fill of more shark fin, I mean, fun next year.&quot;</p>

<p>Co-stars in the original, Tara Reid and Ian Ziering, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083117/http://www.tmz.com/2013/07/17/sharknado-sequel-new-york-city-nyc/#ixzz2ZJdJ3M5D">TMZ</a> &quot;they&apos;re 100% down to appear ... if they&apos;re asked.&quot; Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083117/https://twitter.com/SyfyMovies/status/357363318094184450">they&apos;re looking</a> for title and subtitle suggestions, and there is no bar set, so let your thoughts flow free. This is going to be amazing.... as long as it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083117/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/14/ny_post_trying_hard_to_prove_that_s.php">doesn&apos;t happen IRL</a>.</p>
