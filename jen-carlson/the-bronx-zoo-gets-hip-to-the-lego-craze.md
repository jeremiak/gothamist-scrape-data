Over the weekend the zoo unveiled their LEGO Wildlife Expedition, where visitors &quot;can journey around the park with a Zoofari passport and enjoy special LEGO building activities and displays, with guidance from LEGO Master Builders on select weekends.&quot; You can get inspired by their own LEGO sculptures of tigers, spray toads, flamingos, gorillas, penguins, and more (but don&apos;t expect any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140651/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/21/nypls_lions.php">library lions</a>). </p>
