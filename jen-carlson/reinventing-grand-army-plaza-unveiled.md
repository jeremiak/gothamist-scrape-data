</div></div><p>We&apos;re one step closer to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124164919/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/02/_like_many_when.php">a new Grand Army Plaza</a>&#x2014;earlier this week, the Design Trust for Public Space began installing an outdoor exhibit in the center of Grand Army Plaza which will officially open tomorrow at a public celebration. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124164919/http://www.reinventingGAP.org/">Reinventing Grand Army Plaza</a> installation presents the top 30 entries of an ideas competition organized by the non-profit. The top 30 were narrowed down, from over 200 entries submitted worldwide, by an anonymous jury.</p>

<p>Marty Markowitz will be announcing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners right now (at 11 a.m.), and the public will have the chance to vote for their favorite design (of the 30) via text message or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124164919/http://vote.reinventinggap.org/">online</a> (a People&apos;s Choice Award winner will be declared on October 8th). Learn more about the exhibit and process <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124164919/http://www.designtrust.blogspot.com/">at the project&apos;s blog</a>, and pictured here are the top 4 designs.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The results are in! There was a 1st Place tie between Please Wake Me Up! and Canopy. Coming in 2nd was Urban Stripes, with A Center for Brooklyn coming in 3rd.</p>
