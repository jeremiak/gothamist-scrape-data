<p>Maybe they sense Thanksgiving is coming up, because the menacing turkeys of Staten Island that we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150202070251/http://www.johnbyronkuhner.com/?p=1481">read about earlier this year</a> are at it again. Back in February writer John Kuhner noted, &quot;they especially like the South Beach Psychiatric Center [and] they number around a hundred now.&quot; Indeed, the turkey brood began to form when a local set her 9 turkeys free at the center decades ago. Now according to <a href="www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/10/2010-11-10_scourge_of_staten_island_turkeys_terrorize_residents_as_they_roam_hospital_groun.html">the Daily News</a>, the flock is still around, causing traffic jams, and even trapping frightened women in their cars. It&apos;s a Thanksgiving nightmare!</p>

<p>One 23-year-old dental assistant named Gina told the paper, &quot;<strong>It was straight out of <em>Cujo</em>. I&apos;m sitting in my car Facebooking on my phone when turkeys jumped on my windshield. I screamed like I was being murdered. They just kept looking at me like it was their car.</strong> I felt trapped. I was so scared.&quot;</p>

<p>The locals are crying out for help, saying, &quot;People think turkeys are a big joke... but it becomes a living nightmare... no one will help us.&quot; City law protects the wild turkeys from hunters, so unless locals fashion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150202070251/http://gothamist.com/tags/canadageese">Canada geese</a> costumes for them, they&apos;re sticking around. For now, locals are using garden hoses to keep the birds away from their homes... but won&apos;t <em>someone</em> think of the frightened dental assistants, trapped in their cars?!</p>
