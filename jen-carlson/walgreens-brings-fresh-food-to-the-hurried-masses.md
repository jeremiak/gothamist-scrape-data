Where else can you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170227/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/18/duane_reade_sushi_hotspot.php">buy sushi</a> with your shampoo? Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170227/http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/walgreens-gets-fresh/">the NY Times</a> reports that Walgreens recently brought fresh fruit, vegetables and packaged meals into a few of their Manhattan stores as part of a national pilot program.<p></p>

<p>The paper notes their ham and cheese sandwich on pretzel bread ($4.99) and fruit cups ($1.99) as just a few of the fresh food items you&apos;ll find there. The store hopes that customers &quot;looking to save time or possibly eliminate time from sitting down in a restaurant&quot; will flock to their aisles... but would you?</p>
