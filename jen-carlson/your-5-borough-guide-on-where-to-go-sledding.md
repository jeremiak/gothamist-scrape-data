<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161929/http://gothamist.com/tags/sledding">sledding weather</a>! Winter Storm Hercules <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161929/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/mayor_de_blasio_shovels_his_sidewal.php">delivered on the snow</a>, so grab a sled and some &quot;non-silicon based kitchen lubricant [that] creates a surface 500 times more slippery than any cooking oil,&quot; and head for the hills. Here are some good spots around the five boroughs. And if you don&apos;t have a traditional sled, you can always use a cookie sheet, a garbage can lid, an old tire, or a cardboard box!</p>

</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161929/http://www.squid-knits.blogspot.com/">Squid Knits</a> sends us this tip: &quot;Don&apos;t forget Cedar Hill in Central Park at 79th and 5th.  Fast sledding for the older kids going from west to east and gentler slopes for the little ones going from east to west.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
