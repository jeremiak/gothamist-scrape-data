She had a new lawyer in tow, along with her entourage of family and friends, and she rolled up in a black Lamborghini. Her recent concert at B.B. King&apos;s must have given her some confidence, because as opposed to what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141319/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/27/2010-07-27_rapper_foxy_brown_arrives_at_new_york_court_by_lamborghini_to_face_protection_or.html">the Daily News</a> called her &quot;haggard&quot; look last week, this time around she sported a dress with a plunging neckline, heavy make-up and high heels.<p></p>

<p>She&apos;s in court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141319/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/foxy_brown_3.php">after violating</a> an order of protection taken out by her neighbor, Arlene Raymond, who says she cursed her out last week before mooning her (back in 2007, she beaned Raymond with her BlackBerry). Brown&apos;s new lawyer, Salvatore Strazzullo, says the latest allegations are false, and that the order of protection is &quot;a tremendous waste of the city&apos;s money.&quot; </p>

<p>However, his client then asked the Brooklyn judge for an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141319/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/foxy_claims_she_was_being_stalked_p8pDpyCF28E8MbosALQEVO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">order of protection</a> <em>against Raymond</em>! The judge told her to just &quot;walk the other direction&quot; if she sees her, and instead, the order of protection against Foxy was extended. But the rapper&apos;s camp insists that Raymond&#x2014;who they say wants to be in the limelight&#x2014;is stalking her, and that Foxy is the innocent one.</p>
