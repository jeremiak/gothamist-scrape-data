<p>Borrow your parents&apos; early &apos;80s model Mercury Monarch and drive to Queens, Costanza-style, for a screening of some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083403/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> episodes. </p>

<p>On July 28th (at 7 p.m.), Hulu&#x2014;which retains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083403/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/29/seinfeld_will_stream_on_hulu_in_180.php">exclusive streaming rights</a> to the show&#x2014;is bringing three episodes to Hunter&apos;s Point South Park in LIC. This is partially in celebration of their new short documentary about <em>Seinfeld</em> superfans, cumbersomely called <em>They&#x2019;re Real &amp; They&#x2019;re Spectacular: Seinfeld Super Fans and the Summer of George</em>.</p>

<p>The outdoor screening will feature &quot;three iconic <em>Seinfeld</em> episodes&quot; (the season 8 finale &quot;Summer of George,&quot; plus two others chosen by fans), and will also serve as the theatrical premiere of the documentary short (trailer below). And since it&apos;s too easy to bring <em>Seinfeld</em> references into real life, there will also be: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083403/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI_iOFxsxcc">frolfing</a>, a costume contest, an Elaine dance-off, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083403/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/fun_prints_focus_on_seinfelds_food.php">show-themed food</a> options (including big salads, black &amp; white cookies, salty pretzels), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083403/http://blog.hulu.com/2016/06/29/hulus-summer-road-trip/">and more</a>.</p>
