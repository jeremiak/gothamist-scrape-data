title: After Neighbor Complaints, Williamsburg Waterfront Concerts Will Move... Slightly

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="wburgwaterfront1011.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142955im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/wburgwaterfront1011.jpg" width="640" height="353" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Change was in the air following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142955/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/video_nitrous_oxide_fueled_fans_ter.php">one woman&apos;s account</a> of nitrous-fueled zombie hippies taking over her block after a Widespread Panic concert on the Williamsburg waterfront this summer. Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142955/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/04/fight_for_your_right_to_party_at_wi.php">a Community Board meeting</a> was held to address the location, and it seems the Open Space Alliance (who host the concerts) and CB1 have come to an agreement: future events will be held a couple of blocks away, at a vacant lot on Kent and North 11th Street.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142955/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/41/dtg_concertsmoved_2011_10_14_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the OSA told those in attendance last night, &#x201C;We think this is a better site, has a better impact on residents, and it uses an underutilized property.&quot; But will such a short move make a difference at all? Susan Fensten (the woman who wrote the open letter about her experience with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142955/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/concert_attendees_claim_there_was_n.php">Widespread Panic fans</a>), says, &#x201C;They&#x2019;re still going to have to funnel upwards of 6,000 people into the neighborhood&#x2014;that doesn&#x2019;t seem manageable. And we&#x2019;re still going to be able to hear it. <strong>The era of quiet nights on the waterfront is over.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>For their part, the OSA has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142955/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/04/local_curmudgeons_demand_fewer_will.php">tried to compromise</a> by reducing capacity and rerouting exits&#x2014;plus, out of the 8,760 hours in the year, how many hours of this are the residents actually dealing with? 60?</p>

<p>Comments on the new concert venue will be heard at the next Community Board meeting, at the Swinging Sixties Senior Center (211 Ainslie Street in Williamsburg) on October 20th at 6:30 p.m.</p>
