<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="projlohan0411a.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425191805im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/projlohan0411a.jpg" width="365" height="461" class="image-right"> </span>Lindsay Lohan is <em>finally</em> getting her due respect off-off-Broadway, at a little place called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425191805/http://lamama.org/the-club/project-lohan/">La Mama</a>. Starting April 29th and running through May 8th, the stage will become home to Project: Lohan, a multi-media experience chronicling the life of Lindsay Lohan. The role of Lindsay Lohan will not be played by the fallen starlet herself, however (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425191805/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/lilo_has_commitment_issues_with_new.php">she&apos;s busy</a>), but rather the show&apos;s creator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425191805/http://www.darcydrollinger.com/biography.html">D&apos;Arcy Drollinger</a>. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s what you can expect from what is surely to be the most important play of our time: &quot;With only found text and images from tabloids, magazines, entertainment TV and Internet gossip sites, Lohan&#x2019;s arc from Disney starlet to convicted felon is reconstructed in an evocative timeline as both classic myth and Shakespearean tragedy&#x2014;with surprising and poignant insights into Pop culture, the fragile nature of talent and the people who surround and exploit it.&quot; Fingers crossed for a choreographed interpretation of the whole Fire Crotch incident!</p>

<p>And this is no one-woman show, you need an entire cast to fully portray Lindsay&apos;s downward shame spiral. Joining the fake Lohan on stage will be fake Paris Hilton, fake Samantha Ronson, a fake Lohan family, fake Tina Fey, and a fake Wilmer Valderrama (though we&apos;re holding out hope the real one will show up, what else has he got to do?). But enough talking... let&apos;s go to the video:</p>
