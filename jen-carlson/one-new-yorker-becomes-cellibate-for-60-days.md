I&#x2019;m giving up something much harder than that.&#x201D; She&apos;s casting aside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172110/http://amyscellphone.com/home">her cell phone</a>, after questioning how much her dependency on it has affected her quality of life.</p><blockquote>She also notes that the so-called communication device often keeps her from truly communicating, citing the familiar scenario of sitting at a restaurant table with her friend while they&#x2019;re both on the phone the entire time. &#x201C;Something&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201D; she insists, &#x201C;when you answer your call waiting and hear, &#x2018;Hi, Amy. Were you gonna finish those fries?&#x201D;</blockquote>This is more of an experiment than a lifestyle change. She has been equally concerned with medical studies linking cell phone usage to cancer, hearing loss and memory impairment, calling them &quot;this generation&#x2019;s cigarettes.&quot; For 60 days she&apos;s quitting cold turkey, explaining on her survival guide on her site: &quot;For particularly urgent situations during her sixty-day cellibacy, Amy will allow herself half a roll of quarters &#x2014; exactly twenty quarters &#x2014; to use for payphone calls because, as the self-described cell phone addict explains, &apos;If cell phones are my addiction, I figure payphones will be my methadone.&apos;&#x201D; <p></p>

<p>She&apos;ll be documenting her experience on her blog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172110/http://amyscellphone.com/cellibacy-blog/anyone-have-the-time">observing on the 1st</a>: &quot;Woke up today and realized that I&#x2019;m not only losing a phone.  I&#x2019;m losing a watch.&quot; She also told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172110/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/12/31/2007-12-31_comedian_makes_new_years_vow_to_ditch_he-1.html">The Daily News</a> that &quot;I spend a lot of time on my own. I&apos;m picturing myself sitting at Starbucks - where I&apos;d normally be on my cell phone - and I&apos;ll have to talk to strangers. Who knows where that will lead?&quot; How much do <em>you</em> rely on your phone?</p>
