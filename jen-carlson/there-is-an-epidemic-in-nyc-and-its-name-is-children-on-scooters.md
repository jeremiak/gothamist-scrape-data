<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="newscooterban.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505161809im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newscooterban.jpeg" width="200" height="200" class="image-right"> </span>You may remember back in 2010 when New Yorkers were suffering from a horrible new trend in which parents would take their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505161809/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/17/babies_in_bars.php">babies to bars</a>. Adult bars. And just let them run around and scream like babies <em>inside the bar</em>, where baby-free adults were trying to escape real life at the bottom of an artisanal cocktail served in a mason jar. Just as that false sense that <em>everything is going to be okay</em> would set in, a child would be there to ruin it. And it&apos;s not just bars&#x2014;these reckless monsters have now taken over our sidewalks.</p>

<p>Parents (in particular: <em>all of the parents in Brooklyn</em>) have been purchasing their kids scooters, which is adorable if you live in the suburbs... but on the small sidewalks of New York? We&apos;re already battling overcrowding and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505161809/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">bewildered tourists who won&apos;t stay in their lanes</a>. And even if we install child scooter lanes, you know these speed-addicted beasts aren&apos;t going to abide by them. </p>

<p>The trend becomes a living nightmare when the kids are scooting in groups with their parents trailing behind, barely paying attention as their bundles of joy barrel straight towards pedestrians like torpedoes. The target&#x2014;a.k.a. you, the adult pedestrian who simply wants to stroll along and listen your podcast or whatever&#x2014;is suddenly forced into a haphazardly choreographed Dance of Danger in order to avoid the wheeled terrors. </p>

<p>It may seem like a slight inconvenience to some, but there are so many things that could go horribly wrong here&#x2014;it&apos;s a million accidents waiting to happen! You could fall and break a hip! For that reason and more, we&apos;re using our vast and infinite power to call upon the City of New York to BAN THE SCOOTER! And while we&apos;re at it, ban <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505161809/https://twitter.com/eqx1979/status/279362952241496064">the adult scooter</a> as well.</p>
