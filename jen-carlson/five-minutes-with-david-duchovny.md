<p>Last night we spoke on the phone with David Duchovny, during an interview that was shortened to just five minutes due to the actor&apos;s time constraints (&quot;Jen, this five minutes is gonna be so good you&apos;re not gonna want any more,&quot; he promised at the start). Below is a transcription of that interview, where we try to cram in as much as possible about his career, which we&apos;ve followed since he first appeared on our television as a cross-dressing secret agent on <em>Twin Peaks</em>.</p>

<p>This Friday, Duchovny&apos;s latest movie, <em>Phantom</em>, hits the big screen&#x2014;the dark, submarine thriller is based on a true story, and brings the viewer back to the Cold War era.</p>

<p><strong>I got pretty claustrophobic watching the movie, did you shoot inside of a real submarine?</strong> Yeah, we shot inside of a real sub. There was no set, all sub. It was an actual Russian Cold War Era sub, it couldn&#x2019;t have been any more appropriate for the story. Nothing was done to it. </p>

<p><strong>Where did you film, geographically?</strong> San Diego, where all Russian subs are.</p>

<p><strong>The Cold War Era, and specifically KGB operatives, are popping up in film and television recently&#x2014;currently with <em>The Americans</em>&#x2014;I just assume there&#x2019;s some inner circle in Hollywood deciding all of this: like, this year, everyone focus on the Cold War, then it&#x2019;s WWII or whatever.</strong>  [Laughs] Cabal. <strong>Are there any eras you&#x2019;re interested in seeing get made into a movie/television show?</strong> Not eras, I think like any person I have an affection for the time in which I grew up, so certainly... I like the &#x2018;70s, I like seeing movies set in the &#x2018;70s with stuff that I remember. So this is certainly in that wheelhouse for me, even though I wasn&#x2019;t kind of aware of this stuff going on, or even the Cold War necessarily.</p>

<p><strong>You have a Russian lineage, correct? Did you look into that while preparing and researching for the film?</strong> I do, on my father&#x2019;s side, he&#x2019;s half Russian and half Polish. Most of the research I did focused on military... if there was a difference between Russian military, their behavior in any way from American military. Just trying to be as specific about that as I could.</p>

<p><strong>Do you mind if I ask a few questions not related to <em>Phantom</em>?</strong> Sure, ask about anything. <strong>We&#x2019;re huge <em>Twin Peaks</em> nerds here. Do you have any memories, anecdotes you can share from playing the cross dressing secret agent on the show?</strong> God that&#x2019;s a while ago. I remember Kyle MacLachlan was so nice. I kind of came in second year when I believe they were already kind of winding down a little bit. And Kyle was like, &#x201C;Hey you should be a regular,&#x201D; and I was like, &#x201C;Really, a cross dressing regular?&#x201D; The part was actually written for James Spader, who was friends with Mark Frost who was running the show at that time. And he couldn&#x2019;t do it, so they opened it up for actors to read. So that&#x2019;s how I played the role that was written for James.</p>

<p><strong>Would you ever work on network TV again?</strong> Never say never, but I don&#x2019;t know, it doesn&#x2019;t seem like the kind of schedule I want at this point. It&#x2019;s different... for the type of family life I want to have, but also the artistic life that I want to have. Directing movies, that kind of stuff that I want to do. So maybe not, but then again, I can always be drawn into something that&#x2019;s really good. </p>

<p><strong>What are you working on next?</strong> In a few weeks I go back to shooting <em>Californication</em>. Then after that I do hope to direct another film that I&#x2019;ve written. I&#x2019;m in the midst of trying to raise money for an independent film which is an ongoing and nervewracking experience. </p>

<p><strong>You&#x2019;re a native New Yorker, do you have any favorite places here? Any only in NY stories you can share?</strong> Well I grew up there so I got a million &#x201C;only in New York&#x201D; stories, but &#x2026; right now I&#x2019;m a big Candle Cafe guy. My daughter&#x2019;s gone vegan recently and we like Candle Cafe, on the East and West side. So maybe I&#x2019;ll get a free piece of tofu out of that plug.</p>
