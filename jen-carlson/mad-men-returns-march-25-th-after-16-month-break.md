<p>Finally, we can get our mid-century fix again starting March 25th (10 p.m.), when <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150033/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen">Mad Men</a></em> returns with all new episodes. Can you even remember where we last left off? Don is engaged to his secretary! Joan is pregnant! Peggy is mad about something! Betty fires Carla! </p>

<p>While we already know how the entire series is going to end (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150033/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/matthew_weiner_already_knows_how_ma.php">spoiler here</a>), what&apos;s in store for the upcoming fifth season? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150033/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Mad-Men-Season-5-Premieres-March-25-38433.html">Cinemablend</a> says there have been no hints about the new season&apos;s direction, but we bet there will be whisky drinking, cigarette smoking, and adultery! For now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150033/http://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/news/mad-men-season-5-premiere-countdown-77-days/61448.htm">here are some open ended plot lines</a> that we were left with, and a recap of the season finale:</p>
