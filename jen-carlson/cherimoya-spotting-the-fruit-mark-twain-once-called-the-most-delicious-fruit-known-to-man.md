<p>Over the weekend we came upon this interesting looking fruit at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817180858/http://www.edengourmet.com/store/">Garden Of Eden</a>, wondering if it was really worth the $9.99/lb (though it&apos;s $2 less <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817180858/http://www.edengourmet.com/store/brooklynheights/fruit-vegetables/fruit/tropical-fruits/seasonal-and-specialty/cherimoya.html">online</a>). We weighed the lightest one we could find, which was just barely under one pound, and decided against the purchase. Later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817180858/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/242278087037956096">we discovered</a> that once Mark Twain called the Cherimoya &quot;the most delicious fruit known to man,&quot; and sort of regretted the decision. In more specific terms, this is how it&apos;s been described: &quot;The velvety flesh of a Cherimoya is a delicious, custardy blend of banana, pineapple and strawberry notes.&quot;</p>

<p>The fruit can usually be found here between March and May, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817180858/http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/03/in-season-cherimoyas-choosing-storing-recipes-20100313.html">Serious Eats</a>, so it&apos;s unclear why it&apos;s showing up in September. But if you find some, here are some tips on how to best enjoy them: </p>

<ul><li>Choose one with a green and golden hue.
</li><li>The fruit ripens very quickly at room temperature, and it&apos;s best to eat when they are slightly soft. A ripe cherimoya is like a ripe avocado&#x2014;the skin may be a bit brown.
</li><li>Once ripe, you can store in the refrigerator for a couple of days, but they will start to lose their flavor.
</li><li>You should slice the fruit in half and scoop out the flesh with a spoon&#x2014;do not eat the skin or the seeds.
</li><li>Some suggest sprinkling lime juice on the fruit before eating, or using it for the base of a smoothie, but you should just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817180858/http://foodblogga.blogspot.com/2009/01/what-is-cherimoya-perhaps-greatest.html">eat it raw</a> and without any other additions. At least for the first time.</li></ul>
