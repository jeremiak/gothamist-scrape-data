Recently Bruno Wizard (of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110723225132/http://www.myspace.com/thehomosexuals">The Homosexuals</a>, formerly The Rejects) dropped by his old habitat. The Hotel blog writers interviewed him, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110723225132/http://legends.typepad.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2006/09/a_punk_lourdes_.html">you can read it all here</a>. </p>

<blockquote>Do you think the Chelsea has a special creative energy?

<p>It is unique, there&#x2019;s no denying that. But you can&#x2019;t say that the building has an energy in it&#x2019;s own right. Without the people who live here it&#x2019;s just bricks and mortar. It&#x2019;s the people who are the spirit of the Chelsea. They are already creative when they come here. Some people don&#x2019;t see that: they think that if they stay at the Chelsea they will become great artists, like making a pilgrimage to some kind of Punk Lourdes. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>We found the Editor&apos;s note on the above quote to be quite true of not only the hotel but the entire city, saying, &quot;before the interview began, Bruno told us that people in Europe see the Chelsea more in terms of popular culture, as a center for the exchange and dissemination of ideas, where different art forms can come together and cross pollinate and form movements. New Yorkers, he argued, only see the Chelsea in terms of their own personal interests.&quot;</p>
