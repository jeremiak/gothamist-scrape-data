title: Video: The Only 7 Second Subway Performance You Ever Need To See
---

	
										<p>These young men were recently spotted on the subway enthusiastically performing &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144210/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LBmUwi6mEo">The Tokens</a> or from <em>The Lion King</em> or <em>what/whoever</em>, and while this video is only 7 seconds long, it&apos;s that kind of tight editing that makes it perfect. And [SPOILER ALERT], the unexpected upward pan of the camera prior to the shrieking deserves some kind of Subway Video Golden Globe award. That said, you will be left wanting more!</p>
