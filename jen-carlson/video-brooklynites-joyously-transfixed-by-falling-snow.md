<p>After every good snowfall there are always a lot of snow videos, and without fail a clear winner will float to the top just like a unique little snowflake. We&apos;re not saying <em>this</em> is that video, it&apos;s more like the pretentious little indie that could. Or is it precious? Below you&apos;ll get both.</p>

<p>Sure, to the untrained eye this one minute video showing Brooklynites in the snow may seem unspectacular, but there are some key factors that make it stand out. It&apos;s <em>s l o w e d d o w n</em>. A font. That song that you hear in jewelry commercials is playing over it. And at 26 seconds in you will meet the film&apos;s star: a handsome and troubled young man with all of this natural beauty falling all around him, soaking into his clothes, his skin. And yet he feels empty. He didn&apos;t used to feel this way, what happened? Don&apos;t worry, the token Best Friend comes in at 29 seconds to [SPOILER ALERT] show him how joyous the snow can be... or is he smirking? A good indie always leaves you guessing...</p>
