As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232402/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2007/02/07/the_real_world_1.php">we mentioned yesterday</a>, MTV is sending in their reality crew troops to Brooklyn Tech for a new series. 

</p><p>While it&apos;s unclear as to how many of the BTHS students actually reside in Brooklyn, with all those kids, who knows who MTV will be documenting &quot;the early years&quot; of. BTHS has some accomplished alum, including Leonard Riggio (Founder of Barnes &amp; Noble), Richard Fari&#xF1;a (writer, folksinger, part of the Dylan crew), Richard LaMotta (Founder of the Chipwich ice cream sandwich company!), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232402/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2007/02/07/the_real_world_1.php#comment-1006167">Gothamist commenter &quot;Jason&quot;</a>, who tells us: &quot;as an alum of BTHS, at this point I&apos;d like to give in to my inferiority complex and tell all the stuy and bronx science kids to suck it.&quot;</p>

<p>Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, noting that the borough is already home to &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; stars Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232402/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/local/story/495747p-417747c.html">stated</a>, &quot;From Heath and Michelle to U2 to the Nets ... everybody knows that Brooklyn is the bomb.&quot; Of course, he&apos;s referring to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232402/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/11/23/u2_in_bklyn.php">the U2 concert under the Brooklyn Bridge in 2004</a>. </p>

<p>On their current scrolling news bar, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232402/http://www.bths.edu/">Brooklyn Tech&apos;s site</a> states that Brooklyn Tech SING 2007 is back on February 3rd and 10th, followed by &quot;MTV Returns to Brooklyn Tech!&quot;. So we guess they&apos;re still filming, or starting filming soon. But city officials assure there will be no filming at Brooklyn Tech itself.</p>
