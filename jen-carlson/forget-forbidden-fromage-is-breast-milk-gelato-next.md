---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="breastmilkgelato.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083423im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/breastmilkgelato.jpg" width="225" height="161" class="image-left"> </span>Have you guys heard that some lady&apos;s husband is making cheese out of her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083423/http://gothamist.com/tags/breastmilk">breast milk</a>? This story will not end until everyone stamps their opinion on the forbidden fromage&#x2014;the latest to cough up 2 cents: the Post&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083423/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/intolerant_lacto_nuts_FfIYeztglYmuvPJ0BObcqJ">Andrea Peyser</a>.</p>

<p>She doesn&apos;t <em>try</em> the cheese, however&#x2014;instead she says the controversial product has not only violated health codes, but it&apos;s also become &quot;a litmus test on the way people feel about the value of nursing.&quot; She sprinkles around plenty of quotes from vegan mom bloggers, anti-bottle-feeders, others she dubs as &quot;loony,&quot; and then ever-so nonchalantly injects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083423/http://www.thathomesite.com/forums/load/cooking/msg030703477329.html?19"><em>this</em> piece</a> of disturbing history: &quot;Not very long ago, John Jacob Astor and John D. Rockefeller hired wet nurses for their own use in their old age to provide breast milk for them.&quot; (LA LA LA, we can&apos;t hear you!)</p>

<p>To help get that image out of your head, think about this: Peyser says Lori Mason, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083423/http://gothamist.com/tags/danielangerer">Chef Daniel Angerer</a>&apos;s wife, is already pondering how else to utilize her breast milk in the kitchen, and right now Angerer may just be working on breast milk <em>gelato</em>. Just in time for summer! (A few years ago Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s declined to make Mother&apos;s Milk Ice Cream after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083423/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2008/09/breast_is_best.php">PETA asked them to</a>.) So, would you?</p>
