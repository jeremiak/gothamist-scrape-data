<p>With Netflix and Amazon Prime leading in online original programming, Hulu is jumping in with a new series of their own&#x2014;<em>Deadbeat</em> will premiere on April 9th, in its entirety for the bingewatching audience. The show takes place in New York City and focuses on a &quot;hapless medium&quot; played by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150712/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479527/">Tyler Labine</a> &quot;who will do anything to finish New York City ghosts&#x2019; unfinished business.&#x201D; The whole thing was created by <em>Wilfred</em>&apos;s Cody Heller and Brett Konner, and Brad Pitt&apos;s Plan B Entertainment produced the 10-episode series. </p>

<p>Joining Labine on screen are Brandon T. Jackson, Lucy Devito, and Cat Deeley, and Hulu has just released a series of old school horror trailers, which take place in different decades: the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s.</p>
