<p>The year 2016 is coming to a close, and what better way to shut it down than by staring at fire with a personal pitcher of egg nog in your grip. The fiery, eternal flames of the Yule Log are coming back to the small screen this weekend, and not some rip-off, this is The Original, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228042333/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/24/the_yule_log.php">shot at Gracie Mansion in 1966</a>, while John Lindsay was Mayor. It hasn&apos;t aired since 1969. (In 1970 a new log was filmed... in California.)</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228042333/http://pix11.com/2016/11/02/hot-news-pix11-to-exclusively-air-long-lost-original-yule-log-from-1966/">to WPIX&apos;s Rolando Pujol</a>, the footage was long thought to be lost, but has now been found and restored&#x2014;&quot;The master film contains two minutes of color footage, and the fireplace itself loops every seven seconds.&quot; Check their schedule (which also includes the 1970 log) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228042333/http://pix11.com/2016/11/02/hot-news-pix11-to-exclusively-air-long-lost-original-yule-log-from-1966">here</a>.</p>
