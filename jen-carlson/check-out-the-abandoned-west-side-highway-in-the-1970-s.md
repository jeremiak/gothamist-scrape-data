There must also be progress toward a freer, environmentally sounder movement of Manhattan&apos;s vehicular traffic.&quot; This was written <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229083807/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=940DE0D9153CE034BC4B53DFB566838E669EDE">in 1975</a>, but might as well have been published in the NY Times yesterday.<p></p>

<p>At the time, the West Side Highway, n&#xE9;e Miller Highway (and officially Joe DiMaggio Highway!), was getting a lot of ink. It was sitting at the city&apos;s periphery, an abandoned field of potholes with narrow lanes and hazardous exit ramps. It had also just collapsed in &apos;73 (and been closed &quot;indefinitely&quot;) under the weight of dumptruck, which was carrying asphalt for ongoing repairs of the highway. The multi-billion plan to reconstruct it had plenty of opponents, and in the 1970s things were in a standstill. </p>

<p>It was in 1976 that photographer Jan Staller decided to document it all before plans started moving forward&#x2014;from the Museum of the City of New York recently shared his photos (which you can see the rest of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229083807/http://collections.mcny.org/Explore/Featured/Jan%20Staller/">here</a>):</p>

<blockquote>&quot;In 1976, Staller headed for the west side of lower Manhattan to explore the abandoned Miller Highway. On the vast expanses of that deteriorating roadway&#x2014;better known as the West Side Highway&#x2014;he found unblocked sunlight, an open horizon, and all varieties of weather. Taking advantage of these qualities for his photography he began a body of work entitled Frontier New York. The resulting images describe a transitory experience of atmosphere...&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Photographers were still having fun up there in the 1980s&#x2014;here&apos;s a shot of someone lying in the roadbed in 1980: </p>

<p>Demolition began later that decade, which displaced the homeless who had by that point found shelter on the elevated roadway. In 1989, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229083807/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/25/nyregion/death-of-an-old-highway-a-home-for-the-homeless.html">the NY Times</a> reported on Robert Ing, who &quot;stood beside the ramshackle plywood shed he first built five years ago on the disused elevated portion of the West Side Highway.&quot; Demolition was scheduled to start soon, and Ing was removing his bicycles, radio, and sleeping bag&#x2014;he told the paper, &quot;They told me everything was going to be blown up at 7 o&apos;clock in the morning.&quot;</p>
