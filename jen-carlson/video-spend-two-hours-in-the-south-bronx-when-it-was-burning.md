<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113500/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/the_bronx.php#photo-1">we looked at</a> the South Bronx in the 1980s, through photographs taken by locals during that time (which are now part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113500/http://bronxdoc.org/exhibitions">an exhibition</a>). The South Bronx began collapsing the decade prior, in the 1970s, and this was partially documented in <em>80 Blocks from Tiffany&apos;s</em>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113500/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314014/">1979 documentary</a> showed the daily life of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113500/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/30/the_reapers.php">gang members</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113500/http://gothamist.com/tags/southbronx">the area</a>, focusing mainly on the Savage Skulls and the Savage Nomads. But you&apos;ll also get glimpses of unemployment, abuse of all kinds, prostitution... and block parties. You can now watch the full documentary online:</p>

<p>Here&apos;s more documentation of the South Bronx, through the 1972 documentary <em>Man Alive: The Bronx Is Burning</em>, which aired on BBC and followed firefighters from Battalion 27, Ladder 31 and Engine 82.</p>
