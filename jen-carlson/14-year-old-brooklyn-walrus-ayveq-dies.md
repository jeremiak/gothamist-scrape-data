Sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140826112251/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/25/31_25_death_of_a_legend.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that the nearly one-year-old walrus is now fatherless; at age 14 Ayveq has died (most likely of a bacterial infection)...but at least he left a legacy. Aquarium Director Jon Forrest Dohlin told the paper &#x201C;We are all still in shock about it. He was an absolute delight. He had a magnetism and a charm that was totally his own. He loved people and he knew how to work a crowd and entertain guests.&quot; The paper also mentions the walrus&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140826112251/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/39/30_39thewalrus.html">oddly compelling, masturbation rituals</a>&quot; which gave him international recognition.</p>
