<p>&quot;Why hasn&apos;t <em>The New Yorker</em> done a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042342/http://gothamist.com/tags/womensmarch">women&apos;s march</a> cover? Why is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042342/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newyorkercover17.jpg">THIS</a> lady sledding on their cover next week? The march has been planned for a while.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, obviously we knew <em>The New Yorker</em> would come through, and they have. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042342/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-2017-02-06">This week&apos;s cover</a> features an homage to Rosie the Riveter by artist Abigail Gray Swartz, and it&apos;s titled: &quot;The March.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="newyorkerrosiecover.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042342im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newyorkerrosiecover.jpg" width="640" height="758" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Swartz told <em>The New Yorker</em> that, while she didn&apos;t attend the Women&apos;s March on Washington, she did attend a sister march in Maine. &quot;I marched for all those who need our support, for equality and diversity,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>The issue is on newsstands this week.</p>
