<p>Later this month the St. Patrick&#x2019;s Gymnasium in Nolita will be transformed into Hill Valley High&#x2014;specifically Hill Valley High in 1955. The people at BBQ Films&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052521/http://gothamist.com/tags/bbqfilms">who have recreated</a> films like <em>Christmas Vacation</em> and <em>American Psycho</em>&#x2014;have announced their next big event: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052521/http://bbqfilms.com/enchantment">Enchantment Under the Sea dance</a> from <em>Back To The Future</em>.</p>

<p>On March 22nd and 23rd they will transport you all back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052521/http://backtothefuture.wikia.com/wiki/Enchantment_Under_the_Sea">November 12th, 1955</a>, right alongside Doc and Marty, where you&apos;ll get to attend the dance and punch Biff and all that. Wear your best 1950s formalwear, as a prom king and queen will be crowned that night (even though this wasn&apos;t a prom in the movie).</p>

<p>A portion of event proceeds will benefit the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052521/http://bbqfilms.com/enchantment/">are $45</a> and guests are invited to buy a &quot;Save the Clocktower&quot; ticket to make an extra $10 donation and receive a special gift. Also, this band will be there:</p>

<p>And just make sure they dance... because if they can&apos;t dance, they can&apos;t kiss. If they can&apos;t kiss they can&apos;t fall in love...</p>
