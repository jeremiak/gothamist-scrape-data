<p>In the latest Lenny Letter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104516/http://www.lennyletter.com/culture/interviews/a527/the-lenny-interview-amy-schumer/">Lena Dunham spoke with Amy Schumer</a> about pretty much everything: from the recent Kurt Metzger blow-up, to the strength of women, to Schumer&apos;s new book and how she auditioned to be Shoshanna on <em>Girls</em>, to what it&apos;s like having everything you say get taken out of context, to what it&apos;s <em>really</em> like being inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104516/http://gothamist.com/tags/metball">the Met Ball</a>. Let&apos;s start there:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Lena Dunham:</strong> You and I were literally sitting across from each other at the Met Ball, and it was like a crazy countdown to when we could escape. You were like, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re honored to be here. We&#x2019;re honored to be here.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Amy Schumer:</strong> I left so early. When did you leave?</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>LD:</strong> I attempted to grind my ass on Michael B. Jordan for an additional twenty minutes and then left right after you. I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a marshmallow. That&#x2019;s a child. That&#x2019;s a dog.&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t mean &#x2014; he just seemed confused.

<p>The vibe was very much like, &#x201C;Do I want to fuck it? Is it wearing a &#x2026; yep, it&#x2019;s wearing a tuxedo. I&#x2019;m going to go back to my cell phone.&#x201D; It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, &#x201C;This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Update: Dunham has apologized for projecting her insecurities onto Odell Beckham Jr. and making &quot;totally narcissistic assumptions about what he was thinking&quot;:</p>

Despite my moments of bravado, I struggle at industry events (and in life) with the sense that I don&apos;t rep a certain standard of beauty and so when I show up to the Met Ball surrounded by models and swan-like actresses it&apos;s hard not to feel like a sack of flaming garbage. This felt especially intense with a handsome athlete as my dinner companion and a bunch of women I was sure he&apos;d rather be seated with. But I went ahead and projected these insecurities and made totally narcissistic assumptions about what he was thinking, then presented those assumptions as facts. I feel terrible about it. Because after listening to lots of valid criticism, I see how unfair it is to ascribe misogynistic thoughts to someone I don&apos;t know AT ALL. Like, we have never met, I have no idea the kind of day he&apos;s having or what his truth is. But most importantly, I would never intentionally contribute to a long and often violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies- as well as false accusations by white women towards black men. I&apos;m so sorry, particularly to OBJ, who has every right to be on his cell phone. The fact is I don&apos;t know about his state of mind (I don&apos;t know a lot of things) and I shouldn&apos;t have acted like I did. Much love and thanks, Lena</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2016-09-03T18:12:54+00:00">Sep 3, 2016 at 11:12am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src="//web.archive.org/web/20161110104516js_/http://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

Schumer herself was called out to respond to his rants, and eventually said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104516/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/18/amy_schumer_kurt_metzger_update.php">she was &quot;disappointed&quot; in him</a>. In the interview with Dunham, she sheds a little light on the situation and the man behind it:</p><blockquote>&quot;First I was like, fuck Kurt. It&#x2019;s been years that he&#x2019;s been doing this. He&#x2019;s one of those guys, like a lot of the guys that I&#x2019;m friends with, who are degenerates. Kurt was saying this awful stuff, and in previous years, I would be like, &apos;You&#x2019;ve got to shut up.&apos; Then it would kind of go away. This time, it was just so bad. What he was saying was horrific, and he was being a troll. He can be an Internet troll.  I do understand that [Kurt&#x2019;s actions] would come back to me. I get it, and I wasn&#x2019;t even resentful of the connection. I was resentful of the lack of trust. Like, &apos;Have I earned any good will with you guys? Do you believe that I feel that rape victims should be shamed on the internet? Have I built up any sort of good will?&apos;&#x201D;</blockquote>
