Slip into your best skivvies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102031749/http://improveverywhere.com/2010/01/04/no-pants-subway-ride-2010-details-for-new-york/">Improv Everywhere</a> has posted details for this year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102031749/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/11/no_pants_ride.php">No Pants Subway Ride</a> (their 9th one!), which will take place on Sunday January 10th at 3 p.m. sharp. If you want to participate, you&apos;re going to have to be able to shed those pantaloons and keep a straight face about it while on the subway. Check their site for meeting places (which include spots in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan), and get ready to see some skin. They ask that you do not wear thongs (phew) and say that if you are questioned, tell the person that you &#x201C;forgot to wear pants.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102031749/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">Send us your photos</a> if you spot any of these fairweather exhibitionists!</p>
