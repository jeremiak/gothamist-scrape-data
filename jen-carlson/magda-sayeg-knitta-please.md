										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_magdas.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001051im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_magdas.jpg" width="190" height="285" class="image-left"> </span><em>Magda Sayeg founded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001051/http://knittaplease.com/KNITTA_PLEASE.html">KnittaPlease</a> in August 2005 in part due to so many unfinished knitting projects. Soon a &quot;tag crew of knitters&quot; was out bombing cities with colorful knits. Soon she&apos;ll be brightening up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001051/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/8470">Montague Street</a> in Brooklyn, so even though she&apos;s not living in New York, you can still benefit from her and her crews knitting powers.</em></p>

<p><strong>How often do you create a public knitting piece?</strong> As often as possible! Now that KnittaPlease is my full time job, I am working almost constantly on projects.</p>

<p><strong>How do you decide where to place them?</strong> It depends on the city. New York was easy, because it is filled with significant landmarks. Sometimes, I tag a site with high visibility. Sometimes, the object I wrap has some relevance to the country or city I am in. It is always the contrast of hard and soft materials.  I like to stay connected to street culture, and what it inspires. One of my favorite pieces was a knitted pair of kicks I threw over a power line, (deadman shoes).</p>

<p>I tagged the pedestal of an organ grinder in Mexico City. The musician was in his 50&apos;s and was thrilled-it was sweet. I find myself attracted to the tiniest details that would otherwise be overlooked: an abandoned bike lock, or a small water pipe at the base of a tall building.<br>
                                                                                                                                              <br>
<strong>Recently you were in New York, what did you adorn while here?</strong> I have been to NY several times and have left many tags. I have covered a park bench in Central Park, a &quot;No Parking&quot; sign in Times Square, an old non working phone booth, the &quot;Welcome to Manhattan&quot; sign just over the Williamsburg bridge, to name a few.</p>
