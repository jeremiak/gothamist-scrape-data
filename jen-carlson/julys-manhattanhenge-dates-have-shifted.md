<p>Back in March the American Museum of Natural History&apos;s Neil deGrasse Tyson gave us a heads up as to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528074359/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/here_are_your_2011_manhattanhenge_d.php">the Manhattanhenge dates</a> this year, but since then the July dates have shifted! He&apos;s now updated his own notes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528074359/http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/resources/starstruck/manhattanhenge/">to say</a>: &quot;July dates shifted from earlier posting by one day to better represent the actual New Jersey horizon visible from looking west across Manhattan.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>They will be one day later than previously reported with a half sun on the grid on July 13th at 8:25 p.m., and a full sun on the grid on July 12th at 8:25 p.m.</strong> Make a note of it, and save the dates! Prior to the full sun event on the 12th, you are invited to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528074359/http://www.amnh.org/calendar/event/Experience-Manhattanhenge-with-Jackie-Faherty/">Experience Manhattanhenge with Jackie Faherty</a>, who will give &quot;a visual explanation of Manhattenhenge using the state-of-the-art Zeiss Mark IX star projector and Digital Universe atlas.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528074359/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/photos_from_last_nights_manhattanhe.php">at May&apos;s Manhattanhenge</a>, and don&apos;t forget to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528074359/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr this time around, too! The AMNH says the best spot to be is 42nd Street, though you&apos;ll have some competition.</p>
