										<p>A teeny tiny deer weighing just 1 pound at birth was born at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611031450/http://www.queenszoo.com/">the Queens Zoo</a>, and the Wildlife Conservation Society has just sent out the announcement with adorable photos. Ready?:</p>

<p>This young doe is an endangered southern pudu, the world&apos;s smallest deer, and could weigh as much as 20 pounds as an adult. And she&apos;s not just cute, she&apos;s also kind of weird! The WCS says these little deer will &quot;bark when they sense danger and can climb fallen trees. Although small in stature, only 12 to 14 inches at the shoulder, pudu are excellent jumpers, sprinters, and climbers. What the pudu lacks in size, it makes up in strategy. When chased, pudu run in a zig-zag pattern to escape predation.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Currently, the doe is still nursing, and will then start eating foods like kale, carrots, and hay. At press time, no name has been given to this little gal.</p>
