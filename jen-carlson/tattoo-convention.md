However, we may just have to head over there anyway. </p>

<p>Artists worldwide will be displaying their work and, we&apos;re guessing, will be open for business if you want to get inked. In addition, there will be contests for best tattoos each day (more details on that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103805/http://www.nyctattooconvention.com/contest.html">here</a>), a &quot;sideshow&quot; (which isn&apos;t described but...when isn&apos;t a sideshow interesting?) and book signings. Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103805/http://www.nyctattooconvention.com/art.html">list of all the artists</a> who will be participating, a lot of New York shops are representing - including our favorite, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103805/http://www.nyadorned.com/">NY Adorned</a>.</p>
