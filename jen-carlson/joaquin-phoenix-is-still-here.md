										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phoenix0810.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175259im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phoenix0810.jpg" width="103" height="134" class="image-left"> </span>Seems like just yesterday we were wondering if Joaquin Phoenix had totally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175259/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/27/is_joaquin_phoenix_mentally_ill.php">gone off the deep end</a>, or if he was just getting really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175259/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/12/joaquin_phoenix_on_letterman.php">deep in to character</a> for whatever he was filming with Casey Affleck. Either way, time went by and the world forgot about his antics... until now. The actor&apos;s face started popping up again recently in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175259/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/08/bearded_joaquin_phoenix_immort.html">the style of Shepard Fairey</a>, a street art name now synonymous with marketing and promotion. And indeed, there is something to promote&#x2014;it appears Phoenix intends to rise again with the release of his latest film, <em>I&apos;m Still Here</em>. It was filmed by Affleck in a documentary-style, but something tells us we&apos;re all being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175259/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/"><em>Blair Witch</em>ed</a>.</p>

<p>The film will be hitting big screens on September 10th, and something tells us Phoenix will only be stepping out from behind the curtain in character during his press run.</p>
