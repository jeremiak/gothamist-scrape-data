<p>The Wall Street Journal has printed an opinion piece by Susan Patton, titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174320/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303496804579369420198599600">A Little Valentine&apos;s Day Straight Talk</a>.&quot; You&apos;re going to want to send it to any young woman you know... hopefully it&apos;s not too late! Have they become too focused on their &quot;career,&quot; or spewed feminist propaganda about not needing a husband? Leave them for dead. Patton says we should all &quot;smarten up and start husband-hunting.&quot; Why didn&apos;t anyone tell us this when we were going into crippling debt trying to learn stuff in college? Here are some nuggets of wisdom from <em>Ms.</em> Patton, for the single lady sitting at home alone &quot;mooning over <em>Downton Abbey</em>&quot;:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;Despite all of the focus on professional advancement, for most of you the cornerstone of your future happiness will be the man you marry.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;You&apos;re not getting any younger, but the competition for the men you&apos;d be interested in marrying most definitely is. When you finally get around to looking for a husband you&apos;ll be in your 30s, competing with women in their 20s.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;You should be spending far more time planning for your husband than for your career.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;Men who are as well-educated as you are often interested in younger, less challenging women.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;Casual sex is irresistible to men, but the smart move is not to give it away. If you offer intimacy without commitment, the incentive to commit is eliminated.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;Avoid falling for the P.C. feminist line that has misled so many young women for years. There is nothing incongruous about educated, ambitious women wanting to be wives and mothers.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;College is the best place to look for your mate. It is an environment teeming with like-minded, age-appropriate single men with whom you already share many things. You will never again have this concentration of exceptional men to choose from.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>In her upcoming book&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174320/http://www.amazon.com/Marry-Smart-Advice-Finding-THE/dp/1476759707">Amazon blurb</a> she also notes that you are sure to &quot;find total satisfaction in your roles as a wife and mother.&quot; And if not, you can always turn to trolling.</p>
