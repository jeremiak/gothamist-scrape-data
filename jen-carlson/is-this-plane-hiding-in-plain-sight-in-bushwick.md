										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phptz8aidAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712110147im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phptz8aidAM.jpg" width="640" height="392" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It looks Photoshopped, but it&apos;s not. This plane shows up in the satellite view over the Bushwick Houses in Google Maps&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712110147/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Bushwick,+NY&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=45.149289,80.068359&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bushwick,+New+York&amp;t=h&amp;ll=40.703456,-73.938031&amp;spn=0.001163,0.002776&amp;z=19">see for yourself</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712110147/http://untappednewyork.com/2010/07/23/somebodys-hiding-a-plane-in-bushwick/">Untapped New York</a> points out that &quot;the official imagery date is June 18th, 2010 and the plane appears in both Google Earth and Google Maps, but not in the street views which are from 2009.&quot; </p>

<p>So what&apos;s the deal? No, this isn&apos;t a new playground for the kids&#x2014;the plane is just flying overhead. Still pretty neat though, no? Plus, you get a sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712110147/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/double_rainbow_spotted.php">double rainbow</a> effect since it&apos;s moving so fast.</p>
