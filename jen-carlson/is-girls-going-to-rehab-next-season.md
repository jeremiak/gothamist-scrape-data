<p>As noted by one A. Vandeley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150937/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/girls_postmortem.php#comment-833761875">in our comments yesterday</a>, HBO&apos;s <em>Girls</em> is seeking out some extras for its upcoming third season, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150937/https://www.facebook.com/centralcastingny/posts/10151840114473298">Central Casting</a> has listed some interesting specifics suggesting a trip to rehab and/or an OCD treatment clinic. The second season ended on Sunday and left Adam ditching his 12 steps for a cocktail, and Hannah being rescued from her den of obsessive compulsive behavior. Couples treatment? The extras listing includes:</p><ul><li>HEAVY SET ALCOHOLIC: Male to portray Caucasian heavy set ages 18-25 patient.<br>
</li><li>WELL DRESSED REHAB PATIENT: Male to portray African American patient ages 37-40 well dressed business man with high end suits and/or business casual<br>
</li><li>WOMAN WITH OVERDONE HAIR: Female to portray Caucasian / quiet / overdone hair styled patient ages 60-70. Character is really concerned about her hair. <br>
</li><li>CHAINSMOKING NURSE: Female to portray chain-smoking nurse.</li></ul>In the season finale recap, Dunham refers to Hannah as &quot;broken,&quot; and says Adam showing up is her first step of recovery:<p></p>
