<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161216160032/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> began his show with a cold, cold, cold open. In classic animated Charlie Brown style&#x2014;from the twirling &quot;SPECIAL&quot; logo to the Vince Guaraldi-esque piano&#x2014;Stephen &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; Colbert trudges, head down, through the snow. And then he meets Santa, who voted for Trump: &quot;It was the only thing Donald wanted for Christmas, my hands were tied!&quot;</p>
