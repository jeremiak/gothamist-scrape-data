title: Our Future: Overcrowding and Sewage Delivery?

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0809sewerdelivery.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151010110650im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0809sewerdelivery.jpg" width="350" height="298" class="image-left"> </span>The opening line in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151010110650/http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/07/urban-mole/">this Wired article</a> is sort of terrifying: &quot;It&apos;s 2020, and cities are so overcrowded that it&#x2019;s impossible to deliver packages.&quot; The megalopolis of the future sounds claustrophobic to say the least, but just how <em>will</em> we get our much needed crap delivered to our doors and desks? Before it breeds post-consumer waste, it&apos;ll travel through the sewer systems!</p>

<p>At least that&apos;s one man&apos;s vision; designer Phillip Hermes created the Urban Mole&#x2014;&quot;a capsule that travels through existing networks of underground pipes&quot; delivering groceries, documents, and other goods. As for the logistics, if this were to <em>actually</em> happen, here&apos;s how it would work: &quot;Electric rails within the pipes provide juice for the Mole&#x2019;s motors in a system that works like a miniature subway. Still more pipes run from drop-off points to delivery centers called MoleStations where customers can retrieve their items locally.&quot; A cross-town delivery would take around 10 minutes. But delivering food surrounded by wastewater? We don&apos;t want to be part of version 1.0 of this. </p>

<p>In reality, according to this projections briefing (<a href="www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/census/projections_report.pdf">PDF</a>), we&apos;ll &quot;only&quot; hit the 9.1 million mark by 2030 (we&apos;re at around 8.4 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151010110650/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/census/popcur.shtml">right now</a>)&#x2014;and that doesn&apos;t even take into account the drop off once the <em>Sex and the City</em> movies end and stop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151010110650/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/sjp_warns_futur.php">luring girls here</a> with false hope of living a Carrie Bradshaw lifestyle. So maybe sewage delivery can wait a little longer.
