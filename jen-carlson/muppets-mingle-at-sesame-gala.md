<p>The gang from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234225/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/visiting_sesame_street.php">Sesame Street</a> was out walking the red carpet last night for their 7th Annual Gala benefiting the Sesame Workshop. Held far away from their Astoria home at Cipriani on 42nd Street, the muppets (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234225/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/06/first_lady_visits_sesame_street.php">friends of the First Lady</a>) greeted some bold-face names, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234225/http://www.wcbs880.com/pages/4486303.php?imageGalleryXRefId=1117596#imgXR">Sheryl Crow</a> even performed a duet with Elmo. Here are some of your Sesame faves (glad to see Grover made it out!) with the likes of Mayor Bloomberg, Brian Williams and Al Roker. Why do you think muppets hate Al Roker so much; maybe he didn&apos;t deliver enough &quot;sunny days&quot; to the street?</p>
