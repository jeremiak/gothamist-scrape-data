According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154739/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2011541/Giant-hogweed-cause-BLINDNESS-invades-New-York.html">the Daily Mail</a>, &quot;state officials are warning residents to watch out for infestations of the dangerous plant, which can grown up to 12ft and has flowers the size of umbrellas.&quot; Their website is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154739/http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/39809.html">very alarmist</a>!</p>

<p>The plant&apos;s sap can cause severe blisters, permanent scarring, and yes, even blindness. We&apos;ve contacted the Brooklyn Botanic Garden to find out if they have any intel on this thing, but our contact is mysteriously &quot;out of the office&quot;&#x2014;did the hogweed plants get to her?!</p>

<p>The Department of Environmental Conservation knows of 944 sites in the state, and are warning New Yorkers to stay away from the plants if they spot them. (As you can see from their map, the plants are clearly moving closer to the city!) If you even brush up against one, be sure to wash with soap and cold water immediately, and stay out of the sun for <em>two days</em>. If you spot the monster plant, you can contact the DEC at their Giant Hogweed Hotline (really): 1-800-554-4501 Ext. 58760.
