title: UWS Crane Collapsed This Afternoon
---

	
										<p>Everything&apos;s fine! However, earlier this afternoon a crane struck a piece of scaffolding at an Upper West Side rental building that is under construction. The location was 775 Columbus Avenue, part of the new Columbus Square complex, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150606/http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/crane-collapses-at-columbus-square-at-775-columbus-avenue-developed-by-the-chetrit-group-and-stellar-management">the Real Deal</a> is reporting there are no injuries, &quot;but emergency personnel were on the scene, making sure the crane was secure. It was not clear at press time what caused the collision.&quot;</p>
