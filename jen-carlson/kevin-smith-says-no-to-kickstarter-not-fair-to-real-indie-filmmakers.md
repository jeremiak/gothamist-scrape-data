Unlike other successful, wealthy, and connected people in the biz&#x2014;like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031304/http://laist.com/2013/04/24/zach_braff_launches_kickstarter_for.php">Zach Braff</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031304/http://laist.com/2013/04/12/veronica_mars_kickstarter_closes_to.php">Kristen Bell</a>&#x2014;who are funding projects via Kickstarter that most likely could have been funded in other ways, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031304/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/16/kevin-smith-says-no-to-kickstarter">Smith says</a> that route doesn&apos;t feel right to him. He explained in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031304/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bish9/iama_google_glass_explorer_who_is_thinking_of/c9710ij">a Reddit AMA</a>:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;As for funding the flick&#x2014;we nearly Kickstarted the budget back in November (talked about at great length <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031304/http://smodcast.com/episodes/giant-sized-annual-1-clerks-iii-audience-0/">here</a>). But now I&apos;m feeling like <strong>that&apos;s not fair to real indie filmmakers who need the help. Unlike back when I made <em>CLERKS</em> in &apos;91, I&apos;ve GOT access to money now&#x2014;so I should use that money and not suck any loot out of the crowd-funding marketplace that might otherwise go to some first-timer who can really use it. So if I can get away with it, I&apos;m gonna try to pay for <em>CLERKS III</em> myself.</strong> As much as I love the crowd-funding model, that&apos;s an advancement in indie film that belongs to the next generation of artists. I started on my own dime, and if I&apos;m allowed, I should finish on my own dime.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Well put, sir. And that perfectly explains the crux of the issue people have with these celebrity Kickstarter campaigns. There are still gray areas, however, which we can call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031304/http://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/melissa-joan-hart-kickstarter-fail-160456964.html">The Melissa Joan Hart Problem</a>&#x2014;like what happens when someone is a C-lister, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227031304/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/04/amanda_palmer_tells_us_about_becomi.php">not firmly planted</a> in either the indie or mainstream world?</p>
