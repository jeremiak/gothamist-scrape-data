<p>This week, as millions upon millions of people go to their cubicles to give the universe its daily payout of dying hopes and dreams, a couple of young, good looking, wealthy actors are all, &quot;we can do whatever we want in life.&quot; And so it will be. First we learned that Ryan Gosling would like to quit acting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702183455/http://www.avclub.com/articles/ryan-gosling-will-make-movies-until-he-makes-babie,62041/">to become a daddy</a>, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t want to act much longer... I&apos;d like to be making babies but I&apos;m not, so I&apos;m making movies. When someone comes along I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be able to do both and I&apos;m fine with that. I&apos;ll make movies until I make babies. I have no idea when the handover will happen.&quot;</p>

<p>Now his former <em>Blue Valentine</em> co-star Michelle Williams has told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702183455/http://www.hobomagazine.com/?q=node/259/print">Hobo magazine</a> that she has nearly tired of acting herself, and wouldn&apos;t mind a more domestic and simple life. She says,&quot;I often dream of quitting acting. Walking away and becoming a laundress or a sous chef or maybe writing other people&apos;s love letters for a living.&quot;</p>

<p>If these two young adults can&apos;t make their dreams happen in this life, maybe in their next ones they&apos;ll be birds...</p>
