Patrick Kwan is the New York State Director of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926201533/http://humanesociety.org/">the Humane Society of the United States</a>, and recently he schooled us in some current animal rights issues.</em></p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the latest with the carriage horse situation, and how is the Humane Society involved?</strong> I recently testified at a City Hall hearing in support of Councilman Tony Avella&#x2019;s bill, Int. 658-A, to protect public safety and end the inhumane treatment of horses used for carriage rides. The hearing sets the bill in motion for a committee vote to happen (no date has been set yet).</p>

<p>Also heard that day was an irresponsible industry bill, Int. 653-A, sponsored by Councilmen Kendall Stewart, Oliver Koppel, David Weprin, and Simcha Felder which the HSUS opposes. This bill will weaken enforcement of current laws by removing authority from the ASPCA, New York Police Department, and others to enforce the meager protections that the horses have while providing fare hikes for the industry and shifting the costs of providing water to horses to taxpayers. It opens the door for the industry to self-regulate and escape oversight by independent agencies. What makes Int. 653-A especially reprehensible is that a year and a half ago, City Comptroller Bill Thompson released an independent audit documenting the inhumane conditions the horses live and work in, which found the horses are forced to stand in their own waste in stables and work without adequate water, protection from harsh weather conditions, and oversight by authorities. More enforcement needs to be done, not less.</p>

<p><strong>What is the HSUS&apos;s typical approach to educating people on fur during Fashion Week?</strong> In addition to attending and participating in fashion industry events to promote fur-free fashion, we also organize some of our own to draw attention to the pointless cruelty and killing perpetrated in the name of fashion. In the past, we have sponsored the Fashion Week shows of fur-free designers such as Charlotte Ronson and Jay McCarroll. During the height of this season&#x2019;s Fashion Week, we held a press conference with Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal to discuss the findings of our undercover investigation which uncovered big retailers like Bloomingdale&#x2019;s, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue violating state law by selling unlabeled fur-trimmed garments.</p>
