<p>The Trustocorp crew&#x2014;who when last we checked in were filling stores <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907051820/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/03/trustocorp.php">with fake products</a> like Banko$ (eat the rich) cereal&#x2014;are back with a new public service sign. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907051820/http://twitter.com/trustocorp/statuses/13741749078">It reads</a>: Don&apos;t Feed The Hipsters, and is appropriately placed in McCarren Park, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907051820/http://gothamist.com/tags/kickball">kickball</a> season just began. But let&apos;s presuppose someone ignored this warning and <em>did</em> feed the hipsters, what do you think they like to eat? (Asking for a friend.)</p>
