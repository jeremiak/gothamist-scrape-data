Back in January she was charged with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002031004/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/murder_suspect_natavia_lowery_charg.php">tossing urine</a> at a jail guard on Rikers Island, and yesterday she had her day in court for the incident. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old, along with her cohort in the crime, Valeria Vincent, were indicted by a Bronx grand jury for tossing excrement. If convicted they&apos;ll face up to four years for aggravated harassment, criminal mischief and obstructing governmental administration.</p>

<p>The hearing only lasted 5 minutes, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002031004/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/06/15/2010-06-15_linda_steins_killer_natavia_lowery_back_in_court__for_throwing_human_excrement_a.html">the Daily News</a> Lowery blew kisses to her family as she left the courtroom. One of her supporters yelled: &quot;We love you, boo!&quot; Her lawyer, Paul Brenner, told the press: &quot;I believe she will be fully exonerated of the charges.&quot;</p>
