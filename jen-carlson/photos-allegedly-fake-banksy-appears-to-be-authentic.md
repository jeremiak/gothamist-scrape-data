</div></div>					<p>Yesterday we mentioned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023233/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/this_looks_like_banksy_but_probably.php">a possibly Fakesy</a> up at 6th Avenue and 24th Street, but the piece is real... at least according to the 1-800 number that&apos;s been tagged by all of his pieces so far. A reader dropped by this one and it turns out the number is there&#x2014;when called, if you press #2 the voice on the other end tells you: &quot;Are you looking at one of the great art works of the 21st century? If so, you&apos;re in the wrong place. You should be looking at a stencil of a dog peeing on a hydrant.&quot;</p>

<p>The narration goes on, saying, &quot;It&apos;s a well known truth that the mark of a great artist is his ability to capture light...&quot; he then mentions how this is a silhouette, discusses cartoons, and says, &quot;welcome to the art world.&quot; After that it gets almost impossible to hear.</p>

<p>Some spotted the new piece as early as 8 a.m. yesterday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023233/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/this_looks_like_banksy_but_probably.php#comment-1068261285">one commenter</a> noted that the number was there at that time, so it&apos;s unlikely it was added by someone after. The recording mentioning the piece seems to have only been put up more recently, however.</p>

<p>The new piece hasn&apos;t appeared on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023233/http://instagram.com/banksyny">BanksyNY Instagram</a>, where the previous pieces have been posted after they were put up.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Jen Chung is on the scene and has sent in some new photos, showing that someone has now tagged the dog. There&apos;s also a blue stencil next to the hydrant.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 9:15 a.m.:</strong> Just after 9 a.m., over 24 hours after the piece was first spotted, BanksyNY has posted the piece on Instagram...</p>
