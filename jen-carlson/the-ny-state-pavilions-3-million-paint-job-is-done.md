<p>This weekend visitors to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park will be able to step inside the old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008201905/http://gothamist.com/tags/NewYorkStatePavilion">New York State Pavilion</a> during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008201905/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/06/2015_open_house_new_york_locations.php">an Open House NY event</a>. The event will also mark the 50th anniversary of the World&apos;s Fair closing ceremony in 1965, <em>and</em> serve to celebrate a new beginning. The Philip Johnson-designed structure just got a makeover.</p>

<p>The Pavilion, one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008201905/http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2013/fall/state-of-the-fairs-worlds-fair.html#.Uktspj_NnIk?referrer=http://nyspproject.com/">last remaining World&apos;s Fair structures</a> in the park, just received a $3 million paint job. This is just one part of a larger effort to rehabilitate it. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008201905/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/new-york-state-pavilion-american-cheese-yellow-article-1.2399695">the Daily News</a> deems the color to be the shade of American Cheese, everyone knows American Cheese is a shade of orange not found in nature.

<p>The paint job was &quot;difficult,&quot; according to Jed Coldon, executive director of The New York Structural Steel Painting Contractors&apos; Association. &quot;Painting it was the easy part, but rigging it was difficult because the steel was so intricate.&quot; According to the News, &quot;It took professional painters more than 8,000 hours and 1,600 gallons of paint to get the job done...That included power-washing off decades of rust, applying primer and the historically accurate paint.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008201905/https://www.facebook.com/nyspproject">New York State Pavilion Paint Project</a> has been working towards this since 2009&#x2014;see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008201905/http://nyspproject.com/NYSPcrown4.htm">more photos here</a> of their progress here.</p>
