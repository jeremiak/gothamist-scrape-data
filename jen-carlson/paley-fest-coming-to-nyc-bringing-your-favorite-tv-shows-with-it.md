<p>The Paley Center has teamed up with Made In NY for an October lineup that will bring PaleyFest to the East Coast. While they&apos;ve hosted plenty of big events here before, the PaleyFest has been anchored to Los Angeles for decades&#x2014;but now we&apos;re getting our own. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234029/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/24/flashback_filming_in_nyc.php#photo-1">We were Hollywood before Hollywood was Hollywood, anyway</a>&#x2014;so it all makes sense. Pat Mitchell, President &amp; CEO of The Paley Center for Media, said in a statement, &#x201C;Bringing PaleyFest to New York City after 30 incredibly successful years in LA is a dream realized.&quot;</p>

<p>Katherine Oliver, Commissioner of the Mayor&#x2019;s Office of Media &amp; Entertainment, added that &#x201C;New York City has truly become a TV town in recent years with more prime time episodic series filming on our streets than ever before.&quot; (Which some people love, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234029/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/brooklyn_heights_residents_upset_th.php">and some people hate</a>.)</p>

<p>Their inaugural New York City fest will take place next month, and feature &quot;a star-studded opening night reception,&quot; followed by panels with the casts and creators of <em>Elementary</em>, <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>, <em>The Americans</em>, <em>The Outs</em>, and your new favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234029/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/15/orange_is_the_new_black.php">Netflix bingewatch <em>Orange Is The New Black</em></a>. </p>

<p>This will happen starting October 2nd through the 6th, at their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234029/http://www.paleycenter.org/">West 52nd Street location</a>. Tickets go on sale to members tomorrow, and to the general public on Friday, September 6th. And it may be worth becoming a member, even without the fest moving here&#x2014;earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234029/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/things_we_learned_at_a_mad_men_qa_l.php">they hosted a <em>Mad Men</em> panel</a> and intimate after party for members, where you got to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234029/http://instagram.com/p/Yf78Y4LEEK/">drink whiskey with Jon Hamm</a>.</p>
