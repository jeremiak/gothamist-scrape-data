<p>In the time to come, we will undoubtedly be hearing about magical pieces of music <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045157/http://gothamist.com/tags/prince">Prince</a> has left behind&#x2014;both unreleased and previously unrecognized. This one may be the most unexpected gem, however. </p>

<p>&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045157/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062ZK06G?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0">Donald Trump (Black Version)</a>&quot; is performed by The Time (who you know from <em>Purple Rain</em>), but it was written by Prince&#x2014;it&apos;s catchy AF and Donald Trump doesn&apos;t deserve it. Here are the lyrics:</p>

<p>Honey, baby, you truly know it. (You truly know it.)<br>
You look good. Tryin&#x2019; your best to show it.<br>
If I were you, I would. True love and affection.<br>
These are nice (so nice), but when a money man walks in the room, girl,<br>
You look more than twice.<br>
You look once (you look twice). Can I rap to you, sugar, tonight?<br>
Donald Trump (black version), maybe that&#x2019;s what you need.<br>
A man that fulfills your every wish, your every dream.<br>
Donald Trump (black version), come on take a chance.<br>
A 1990s love affair, the real romance.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904045157/http://www.buzzfeed.com/meganapper/prince-once-wrote-a-donald-trump-song-and-it-is-spectacular#.skEW2O5LV">Buzzfeed</a>, Prince &quot;initially wrote the song for The Time&#x2019;s unreleased album, <em>Corporate World</em>, but it was moved to their 1990 album, <em>Pandemonium</em>.&quot;</p>
