<p>We&apos;ve got about another five months until the next <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307211506/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/cat_fashion_show.php">cat fashion show</a> goes down at the Algonquin Hotel, but over the weekend Animal Planet aired the episode they filmed at last year&apos;s event, for their show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307211506/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/07/john_fulton_must_love_cats_host.php"><em>Must Love Cats</em></a>. When asked, &quot;What does this say about the people in New York?&quot; One woman declares, &quot;They&apos;re into cat fashion.&quot; Not sure if that&apos;s accurate, but it <em>would</em> appear we are more into cat fashion than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307211506/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/14/we_were_there_dog_fashion_show_why.php">dog fashion</a>.</p>

<p>This August will be the new Matilda&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307211506/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/the_algonquin_gets_a_new_matilda.php">first fashion show</a>, and so far there&apos;s been no word on what she&apos;ll wear to her big event. We&apos;re really hoping some of the other cats show up as Charlie Sheen or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307211506/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a>, however. And until then, we&apos;ll be practicing our best Veronica Corningstone impersonation.</p>
