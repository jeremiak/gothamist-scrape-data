</div></div>					<p>Remember a year ago today when there was snow was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622035157/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/27/more_snow_in_the_subways.php"><em>inside</em> the subway stations</a> and... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622035157/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzard2010">everywhere</a>? The Great Boxing Day Blizzard of &apos;10 seems like it was just yesterday, and it&apos;s so fun to reminisce when your car is no longer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622035157/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/25/photos_icicle_audi_forever.php?gallery0Pic=1#photo-1">a popsicle</a>. Yes, everything is so much more magical in retrospect&#x2014;at the time, we only felt inspired by the paralyzing snow after watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622035157/http://mutinycompany.com/home.html">Jamie Stuart</a>&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622035157/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/video_oscar-worthy_short_film_docum.php">gorgeous documentation</a> of it, which even got a nod from Roger Ebert:</p>

<p>It&apos;s getting cold out there and it&apos;s only a matter of time that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622035157/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/28/williamsburg_becomes_ice_planet_hot.php">Williamsburg gets transformed into Ice Planet Hoth</a> again, so while you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622035157/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/27/remembering_blizzageddon_the_boxing.php">take a look back</a> at last year&apos;s snowfall, here&apos;s some homework for you: there needs to be a new fun name for &quot;snowstorm&quot; that can replace all of the following, which we&apos;re a little tired of: Snowpocalypse, Blizzageddon, and Snowtorious B.I.G. (we still kind of like that one, actually). Let&apos;s get crackin&apos;...</p>
