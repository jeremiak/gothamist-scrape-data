Hulu is pricing their ad-free region at $12/month, which is $4 more than their regular subscription fee. The streaming service announced the news today, which brings them further into the ring with rivlas Netflix and Amazon. Currently, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517155632/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/business/media/hulu-starts-a-commercial-free-option-to-rival-netflix-and-amazon.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a>, &quot;Hulu has about nine million subscribers, less than a quarter of Netflix&#x2019;s 21 million paid subscribers in the United States.&quot; Prior to today Hulu was the only major subscription-based streaming service to force ads on viewers, not even including a &quot;skip&quot; feature.</p>

<p>Recently, Hulu had a huge score when they acquired every episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517155632/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/12/seinfeld_the_apartment.php"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> exclusively, but the Times points out that&apos;s also when &quot;viewers used social media to complain about being forced to watch ads in order to watch the series.&quot; And Hulu took notice. </p>

<p>What if we just want the commercials to be less depressing, is there a fee we can pay for that? </p>

<p>The ad-free option is now available for $12, or you can continue to keep the ads for $8. Hulu will also continue to keep some offerings free. Still, this move makes Hulu the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517155632/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/09/streaming_cost_cable.php">more expensive streaming option</a>: Netflix and Amazon offer ad-free across the board, for $8 and $8.25/month, respectively. (Amazon is actually $99 a year, and with that you get free shipping on many items, and other Prime benefits around the site.)</p>

<p>And, to help you decide, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517155632/http://laist.com/2015/09/01/heres_whats_new_to_netflix_other_st.php">here&apos;s what&apos;s coming to Hulu in September</a>.</p>
