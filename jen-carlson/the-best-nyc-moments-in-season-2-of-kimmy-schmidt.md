title: The Best NYC Moments In Season 2 Of 'Kimmy Schmidt'
---

	
										<p>The second season of <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</em> was added to Netflix on Friday, and while the show takes place in a bit of an alternate universe, &#xE0; la <em>30 Rock</em>, it&apos;s undeniably New York City&apos;s alternate universe. And this season, the city and its many characters, problems, and attractions are present enough throughout that it can be considered a cast member.</p>

<p>An underlying plot point over the 13 episodes is also something that real life New York is familiar with: gentrification. Lillian battles to keep her Brooklyn neighborhood <em>real</em> in nearly every episode, staging protests at condo construction sites, tagging walls, and trying to run hipsters out of the local establishments. Below, some of the best nods to NYC.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks De Blasio</strong><br>

<p>&quot;De Blasio Pledges To &apos;Ruin City&apos;&quot; shouts a headline on the front page of <em>BM New York</em>. This would have been more of a NY Post headline, but then we wouldn&apos;t have gotten that <em>AM New York</em> punnin&apos;.</p>

<p><strong>East River Burial</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpW1D2A0PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpW1D2A0PM.jpg" width="640" height="369" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The best part of this kind of alternate NYC is that we also get things that only exist in fantasies that occur in a New Yorker&apos;s darkest, most alone moments. The &quot;Unloved New Yorker Disposal Unit&quot; is one of those&#x2014;the spot on the East River is a modern day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212/http://gothamist.com/tags/pottersfield">potter&apos;s field</a>, where New Yorkers who die alone are dumped in the water. </p>

<p><strong>Bed Bug Street Furniture</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpGJH7alPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpGJH7alPM.jpg" width="640" height="389" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>No one&apos;s gonna touch Titus&apos;s street piano if he spray paints it with the two most dreaded words in the New York City lexicon: &quot;Bed Bugs.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Pizza Rat</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpfGghmbPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpfGghmbPM.jpg" width="640" height="388" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Lillian spots her old friend Pizza Rat, but he&apos;s too big now and ignores her. Diva. And this isn&apos;t his only appearance. Another sign of gentrification in her neighborhood comes when the gang spots a new street: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/like_a_rat_trap_but_for_clicks.php">Pizza Rat Blvd</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Elmo</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpCwg9rcPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpCwg9rcPM.jpg" width="640" height="374" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212/http://gothamist.com/tags/elmo">Times Square Elmo</a> has made more headlines in the recent years than any other Times Square character, and in the show he lives up to his bad reputation. </p>

<p><strong>Coney Island</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpwRODcYPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpwRODcYPM.jpg" width="640" height="363" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In one episode, during a rather critical moment, Kimmy finds herself on NYC&apos;s oldest, most whiplash-inducing rollercoaster: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/16/cyclone_island_first_coaster.php">the Cyclone</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NY1&apos;s Pat Kiernan</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpvWoQ1TPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpvWoQ1TPM.jpg" width="640" height="347" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The most recognizable anchor in NYC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212/http://gothamist.com/tags/patkiernan">Pat Kiernan</a>, is also the busiest with cameos. Here he adds another appearance to his IMDB page.</p>

<p><strong>Millennial Hipster Gentrifiers</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpszDyDqPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpszDyDqPM.jpg" width="640" height="400" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The Millennial Hipster Gentrifier is the trifecta of gentrifiers, and the show perfectly cast <em>Girls</em> star Zosia Mamet as a vintage-Polaroid-toting trust fund artist, along with her husband played by Evan Jonigkeit (who has also appeared on <em>Girls</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Graffiti</strong></p>

<p>When Lillian sees a man tagging the wall she&apos;s pleased that the neighborhood isn&apos;t changing that much, until she learns he&apos;s a FIOS tech who plans to install high-speed internet. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpDycXz4PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpDycXz4PM.jpg" width="640" height="393" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>She creates her own tag next to it, in honor of Notorious BIG. <br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpryTn1sPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpryTn1sPM.jpg" width="640" height="438" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Silverfish</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpRybn4UPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpRybn4UPM.jpg" width="640" height="399" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>One of the characters this season has a silverfish infestation, but you see silverfish easter eggs in other episodes, like with these advertisements. Of course, in real life NYC this would have been roaches or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212/http://gothamist.com/tags/toiletrat">toilet rats</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Street Meat</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpJq8ohnPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpJq8ohnPM.jpg" width="640" height="349" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The street meat vendor nervously declares that his meat is definitely <em>not</em> from a rodeo. Perfect. Though we would have liked to have seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/19/pigeon_food_cart_street_meat.php">a pigeon in his cart</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Uber</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpDOn6U8PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415113212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpDOn6U8PM.jpg" width="640" height="367" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In this season Kimmy gets a job as an Uber driver, and we&apos;re betting Tina Fey&apos;s very drunk character probably has a pretty low rating.</p>

<p>And lastly, there&apos;s the Upper East Side lady-who-lunches, who resides in an alternate universe even in real life NYC. (She gets our full endorsement on bench wine, though.)</p>
