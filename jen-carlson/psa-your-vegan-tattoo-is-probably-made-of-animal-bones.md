										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="vegatats0511.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190833im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/vegatats0511.jpg" width="450" height="183" class="image-right"> </span>Is this anonymous woman now the title-holder of the world&apos;s most regrettable tattoo? It may look simple enough, with the word &quot;VEGAN&quot; inked discreetly inside of her mouth. However, it turns out that black tattoo ink is more often than not made with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190833/http://www.livestrong.com/article/128493-ingredients-black-tattoo-ink/">burned animal bones</a>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190833/http://www.boingboing.net/2011/05/07/vegan-tattoo-is-prob.html">Boing Boing</a>, this was pointed out to her on her Facebook page after she proudly posted the photo of her inked-up inner lip. The site writes that the &quot;string of congratulations comes to an abrupt end when one friend points out that <strong>black tattoo ink is made from burnt animal bones, and thus the VEGAN in question will forever have an animal product in her mouth</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190833/http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/h5qqf/what_an_awful_return_to_omnivorism/">Reddit</a> (in a thread about the tattoo titled, &quot;What an awful return to omnivorism&quot;), one person points out there <em>is</em> such a thing as a vegan black ink, but more likely than not this girl got the animal bone version, which is more common. (Note to NYC-based vegans and vegetarians, you can get an animal-free tattoo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190833/http://planetgreen.discovery.com/food-health/vegan-ecofriendly-tattoo-bradstevens.html">at Fun City</a> on St. Marks.)</p>

<p>As for this girl, at least her tattoo was subtle... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190833/http://www.jinxiboo.com/storage/VeganChin2.jpg">sometimes they aren&apos;t</a>.</p>
