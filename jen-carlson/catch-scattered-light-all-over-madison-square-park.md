</div></div>					<p>Artist and M.I.T. grad Jim Campbell has a new installation&#x2014;Scattered Light&#x2014;that was just unveiled at Madison Square Park, and which features many, many light bulbs. One part of the installation is comprised of 2,000 LEDs spanning 80-feet and displaying flickering human silhouettes when seen from a certain vantage point, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121650/http://nyclovesnyc.blogspot.com/2010/10/in-progress-light-artist-jim-campbells.html">NYCLovesNYC</a>.</p>

<p>The second part of the installation has the LEDs encased in a glass-brick wall; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121650/https://www.madisonsquarepark.org/Programs/MadSqArt.aspx">Madison Square Park</a> website says, &#x201C;The light pulses emanating from each tablet will be rhythmically modulated to represent the voices of individual travelers as recorded in conversation on a subway platform, combining to create a visual symphony rendered in light.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Campbell&apos;s installation will be on view through mid-February.</p>
