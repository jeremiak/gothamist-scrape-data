<p>Have you been jonesing for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122124/http://gothamist.com/tags/chickfila">Chick-Fil-A</a> but would rather starve than take a bite out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122124/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/28/surprise_sarah_palin_loves_chick-fi.php">Sarah Palin&apos;s favorite anti-gay sandwich</a>? The folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122124/http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/07/the-food-lab-how-to-make-a-chick-fil-a-sandwich-at-home.html">Serious Eats</a> entered their food lab recently and came out on the other side with a recipe you can try at home. Turns out the Chick-Fil-A sandwich is just a &quot;soft, sweet, buttered and toasted bun. Two dill pickle chips,&quot; and of course, some chicken (though cooking it is the tricky part).</p>

<p>Chick-Fil-A uses an entire chicken breast half for their creations, but SE notes that they must use miniature fowl, because you&apos;ll need to split your chicken breast in half to mimic the size. Since the chain lists the ingredients online, you know that you&apos;ll need &quot;seasoning [salt, monosodium glutamate, sugar, spices, paprika]; seasoned coater [enriched bleached flour, sugar, salt, monosodium glutamate, nonfat milk, leavening, spice, soybean oil, color]; milk wash [water, whole powdered egg and nonfat milk solids]; peanut oil.&quot; After you collect those goods, you season the breast, &quot;dip it into a milk and egg-based wash, dredge it in a flour-based &apos;seasoned coater,&apos; then fry it all in peanut oil&quot;... but you&apos;ll also need to do some brining.</p>

<p>Head over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122124/http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/07/the-food-lab-how-to-make-a-chick-fil-a-sandwich-at-home.html">to SE</a> when you have some time to spend in your kitchen, it&apos;s a bit of a long read as they experiment with different ways to perfect the product.</p>
