										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="0610orbs.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318020130im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0610orbs.jpg" width="300" height="266"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Gothamist</span></i></div> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318020130/http://gothamist.com/tags/orbs">metal orbs</a> residing in Brooklyn Bridge Park have been a hot topic since their April debut. The playground equipment has been scorching kids on sunny days, and eventually tents were placed over them to block the sun&#x2014;a plan that didn&apos;t really pan out. Now the orbs are being removed all together.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318020130/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/hot_playground_equipment_at_brooklyn_FgZ1Q3NdiJ9O05IweR3KMI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz0rJWvqkHD">the NY Post</a>, a baby girl was burned so badly by the orbs earlier this week that her hands blistered. Her mother told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318020130/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/06/18/2010-06-18_no_play_dates_for_hot_domes.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;It&apos;s unconscionable that there is a frying pan in the middle of a playground.&quot; Barricades were put around them yesterday, and eventually they&apos;ll be taken out and replaced. Park officials have refused to comment on the incident.</p>

<p>One local dad told the paper, &#x201C;I thought the domes were cool. It&#x2019;s too bad they couldn&#x2019;t make them work. The kids loved climbing them if it wasn&#x2019;t too hot.&#x201D; There&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318020130/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/24/union_square_playground.php">Metal Mountain</a> in Union Square Park!</p>
