<span class="photo_caption">Lady Gaga at MoMA, by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://www.flickr.com/photos/joeholmes/4584211011/in/photostream/">Joe Holmes</a></span></p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://search.twitter.com/search?q=gaga+moma">Twitter rumor mill</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> entered MoMA a little bit after noon today and may be waiting her turn to sit down in front of legendary performance artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovic">Marina Abramovi&#x107;</a>. She&apos;s allegedly with her artist pal Terence Koh, but while some are reporting they have seen the duo circling around Abramovi&#x107;, others haven&apos;t spotted her in the area at all. Maybe she&apos;s just grabbing the junk of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/16/marina_1.php">Marina&apos;s naked minions</a> until her turn comes up? Stay tuned! (You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/marinaabramovic/">watch the live feed here</a>... hopefully she won&apos;t get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/gaga_3.php">stage fright</a>.) </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> MoMA just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073033/http://twitter.com/MuseumModernArt/status/13496891250">Twittered</a> that Gaga has left the building.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> Now with photo! It&apos;s probably hard to be intimidated sitting across from Abramovi&#x107; while wearing gold-spiked sunglasses... so why didn&apos;t Gaga take her turn?</p>
