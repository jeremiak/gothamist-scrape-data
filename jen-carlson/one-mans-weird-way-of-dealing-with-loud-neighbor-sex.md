Particularly, how he deals when said neighbors are doin&apos; it. You know, sex. Our protagonist sets up challenges for himself, called &quot;Thin Wall Challenges,&quot; that he needs to finish before the couple... finishes. </p>

<p>In this one, titled &quot;Two Neighbors One Cup,&quot; he starts out asking: &quot;What has four arms and four legs and is currently gettin&apos; it on next door? It&apos;s my neighbors.&quot; He then introduces his task for the day, and if he doesn&apos;t complete his task, he tases himself (though punishments change with each different challenge).</p>
