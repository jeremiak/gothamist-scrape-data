<p>Grand Central&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708075102/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/10/campbell_apartment_grand_central.php">hidden gem of a bar</a>, The Campbell Apartment, will be open on Christmas for the first time <em>ever</em>. Which is perfect for those traveling in and out of the Terminal that day and night. While you&apos;ll be able to get all of their classic cocktails (which will cost you&#x2014;they run up to $20), we&apos;re told that they&apos;ll be serving a special eggnog martini on Christmas.</p>

<p>We&apos;re told &quot;the decision was made because they wanted to ensure that as many people as possible could enjoy the magic of The Campbell Apartment over the holidays.&quot;</p>

<p>Just remember: Class it up, as you&apos;ll have to abide by their dress code&#x2014;no baseball hats, t-shirts, jeans, or sneakers. We&apos;d personally like to see a Jimmy Stewart type slumped over the bar in solitude when we stroll in on Christmas night.

<p>The space has a history dating back to the 1920s, when railroad tycoon John W. Campbell used it as his office. It was Campbell who gave it its first life as an entertainment space, too&#x2014;he added a piano and pipe organ and would often have guests over for private recitals. While it was never his (or anyone&apos;s) residence, he did have a butler named Stackhouse on payroll.</p>

<p>Campbell died in 1957 and the room suffered through some dismal decades as it deteriorated through its various incarnations as a storage space, a signalman&apos;s office, and even a jail. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708075102/http://www.grandcentralterminal.com/store/2137026178/">The Campbell Apartment</a> isn&apos;t exactly a secret, but due to its location off the main concourse, with little foot traffic passing by, it remains a bit hidden up its dimly lit set of stairs. You&apos;ll find it off the Vanderbilt Avenue entrance, and there&apos;s plenty of signage. Their hours are Mon-Sat 12 p.m to 1 a.m., and Sunday they close at midnight.  On Christmas the hours are 11 a.m. to midnight.</p>
