                            <p><img alt="0804carnegiemcmansion.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045958im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0804carnegiemcmansion.jpg" width="304" height="350" class="left">Wall Street tycoon Dr. Mitchell Blutt is at the center of a Manhattan mansion controversy: He purchased two town houses east of his home on East 90th Street between Park and Madison in hopes of combining them into one giant abode. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045958/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/nyregion/29house.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports that &quot;three Romanesque Revival, four-story town houses,&quot; upon merging into one, would create a 17,000-square-foot mansion. The triple Brownstone residential combo is a rare one, and needless to say it&apos;s raising eyebrows around town--especially with Carnegie Hill residents. </p>

<p>While preservationists worry about the landmark- protected buildings, neighbors are nay-saying Blutt&apos;s vision, calling it a &#x201C;McMansion;&#x201D; one recently sent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045958/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/04/22/upper_east_side_mcmansion_fight_begins.php">Curbed</a> some images of the proposal.  The original plans include &quot;a three-story rear-yard addition&quot; (15 &#xBD; feet higher than the original rear walls) and adding &quot;20 feet to the height of the buildings by adding a fifth floor, as well as a concrete bulkhead for a new elevator shaft.&quot; (When his architect presented the blueprints last week, he was told to submit redrawn plans by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045958/http://www.hdc.org/">Historic Districts Council</a>&apos;s Simeon Bankoff called the plan: &#x201C;an audacious proposal. It&#x2019;s the kind of thing that seems to be extraordinarily conspicuous consumption.&#x201D; Blutt, who just spent $20 million pre-renovations to build an unprecedented residence that could house half the Lower East Side, &quot;declined to comment, saying he did not want to bring attention to himself.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045958/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/16/family_gets_60.php">Last year</a> a state appeals court ruled that a family could evict tenants from their building in order to renovate it into a five bedroom home, complete with library, gym, and nanny&apos;s suite. </p>
