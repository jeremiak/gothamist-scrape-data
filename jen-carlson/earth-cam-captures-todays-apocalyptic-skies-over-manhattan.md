<p>ICYMI: Earlier today the skies over Manhattan turned as black as a dark steer&apos;s tuckus on a moonless prairie night, and certain doom hung in the air. The weather was about to turn against us.</p>

<p>For about, like, twenty minutes. Then it lifted and left us with this blinding stark white sky that&apos;s out there now, which holds nothing but promises of rain.</p>

<p>But that dark sky sure was <em>something</em>. And reliable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305084250/https://twitter.com/jimwxgator/status/378206591721275392/photo/1">EarthCam was there</a> to capture it in this stunning and surreal photo that looks like the poster for Roland Emmerich&apos;s next apocalyptic hit.</p>
