<p>Can you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329113356/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">guess the year</a>, and in what neighborhood, this vendor was selling hot dogs? We&apos;ll update later with the answer and more details, as well as some more photos of street vendors from this time. Cheaters and anyone who makes an Instagram joke will be banished from Gothamist and the entire Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 4:25 p.m.:</strong> This photo was taken in 1935, and the Getty Images caption reads: &quot;An Italian street vendor selling hot dogs at night in Harlem.&quot; Here&apos;s a very similar photo, taken 20 years later in 1955&#x2014;the caption reads: &quot;People at an Italian food stall in Harlem.&quot;</p>
