King had suffered from diabetes, and a recent decline in health&#x2014;at the time of his death, his attorney told the Associated Press that he died peacefully in his sleep. Two of his daughters, however, believe King was murdered. </p>

<p>The Clark County, Nevada coroner&apos;s office made the below announcement over Twitter, noting a homicide investigation with the LVMPD. There isn&apos;t currently an investigation, however&#x2014;a police source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909110726/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coroner-examining-b-b-kings-body-after-allegations-foul-play-n364351">NBC News</a> they are waiting until the coroner &#x201C;determines Mr. King&#x2019;s death to be from other than natural causes.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The coroner, John Fudenberg, separately issued a statement yesterday saying there was no immediate evidence to support the murder allegations.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909110726/http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/05/26/arts/26reuters-usa-nevada-bbking.html?smid=tw-share">a Reuters report</a>, &quot;Two of King&apos;s children, Karen Williams and Patty King, alleged that King was poisoned, ostensibly by two of his longtime associates including one who had power of attorney over his affairs.&quot; They claim two associates&#x2014;business manager, LaVerne Toney, and his personal assistant, Myron Johnson&#x2014;prevented them from seeing their father during his final days. Here is the affidavit they filed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909110726/http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/05/26/redacted_affidavits_king_daughters.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909110726/https://news.yahoo.com/2-b-b-king-daughters-allege-2-closest-193139672.html">the AP</a>, &quot;Toney is named in King&apos;s will as executor of an estate that, according to court documents filed by lawyers for some of King&apos;s heirs, could total tens of millions of dollars. Johnson was at B.B. King&apos;s bedside when he died. No family members were present.&quot;</p>

<p>Before his death, one of King&apos;s daughters filed a police report for elder abuse, which also claimed Toney had stripped his bank account of $20-30 million, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909110726/http://www.tmz.com/2015/05/07/bb-king-guardianship-daughter-judge-denied-elder-abuse/">to TMZ</a>. These allegations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909110726/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3072446/Fight-blues-legend-B-B-King-goes-court-Las-Vegas.html">were eventually rejected</a> by a judge, but they declared, &quot;We lost the battle, but we haven&apos;t lost the war.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently memorials are set to go ahead, with a Beale Street procession in Memphis scheduled for tomorrow, a viewing on Friday, and the burial on Saturday in Indianola, Mississippi&#x2014;King&apos;s hometown.</p>
