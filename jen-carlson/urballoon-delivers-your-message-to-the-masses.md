It <em>is</em> however a pretty cool art installation that you can experience on September 18th as part of the Conflux Festival. &quot;The Urballoon consists of a large helium balloon with a video projector and a wireless laptop that projects user-generated content onto public spaces. It floats above its tethers in parks or plazas and displays the video onto the ground, encouraging people to gather around a digital bonfire. People will be asked to address the theme &apos;What is New York?&apos;&quot; Get your answers ready, and look for it in Tompkins Square Park later this month. In the meantime, can someone bring back the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201021351/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/24/soar_above_central_park_in_a_balloo.php">hot air balloon rides over Central Park</a>?</p>
