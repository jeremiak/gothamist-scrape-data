										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152028/http://gothamist.com/tags/coyote">A wascally coyote</a> dodged the NYPD and their dart guns last night in Chelsea. The animal was spotted at West 24th Street and 12th Avenue around 3:30 a.m., running around and away from the crowd that gathered. As shown in the video, police prepared themselves with tranquilizer darts and an animal cage, but alas, even after what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152028/http://www.wpix.com/news/local/wpix-coyote-loose-manhattan-030310,0,5338542.story">WPIX</a> calls an &quot;aggressive pursuit by authorities,&quot; he vanished into the night.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152028/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/manhattan/coyote-spotted-on-manhattan%27s-west-side-20100302-kc">FoxNY</a> he was headed uptown and followed to West 50th Street before authorities lost him. Could this be the same coyote that&apos;s been spotted in Central Park (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152028/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/08/coyotes_at_columbia.php">at Columbia</a>)? Time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152028/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/23/coyote_1.php">compare tapes</a>!</p>
