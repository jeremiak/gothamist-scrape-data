</div></div>					<p>Over the weekend a new lobster purveyor rolled into town, setting up shop at 15th Street and 10th Avenue in Manhattan. The Lobster Tank is putting a little twist on the typical food truck, and slinging their goods from a 1957 Airstream. We&apos;re sold! Co-owner Alyssa Cesarini tells us, &quot;Our Montauk inspired fare and lobster roll attracts our clientele but our music, complimentary blankets and Hula Hoops is what sets this food truck apart from any other!&quot; The hula hooping is free, but their rolls go for $18 (served alongside chips)... and this is the same price for the lobster served <em>without</em> the bread. They also offer a watermelon mint salad with feta for $8, and a tahini veggie wrap, along with assorted (non-alcoholic) beverages.</p>

<p>The Lobster Tank is open Monday through Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Thursday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.&#x2014;swing by and let us know if they have one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221111/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php#photo-1">the best</a> new lobster rolls in town!</p>
