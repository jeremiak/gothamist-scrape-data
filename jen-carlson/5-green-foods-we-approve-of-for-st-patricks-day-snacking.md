<p><em>Let&apos;s leave the green bagels and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://gothamist.com/tags/shamrockshakes">Shamrock Shakes</a> to the amateurs, we&apos;re here to help you class up your quirky St. Pat&apos;s snacks and meals with some more edible suggestions.</em></p>

<p><strong>Green Eggs</strong> aren&apos;t just for Dr. Seuss, you can also make a batch for a St. Patrick&apos;s Day weekend brunch. The important thing here is: do not use food coloring! Martha Stewart has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://www.marthastewart.com/893674/green-eggs-and-ham">a great recipe</a> that delivers a natural look, featuring arugula, parsley, and basil. You can also add some green to your deviled eggs&#x2014;check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes-and-cooking/get-your-greens/pictures/page-4.html">this recipe</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Green Grilled Cheese</strong> will, at the very least, trick kids into eating their vegetables. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://happyhealthymama.com/2011/02/green-grilled-cheese-that-your-kids-just-might-eat.html">This recipe</a> combines spinach, cheese, and a blender&#x2014;an unlikely trio that seem to work quite well together! And it beats a green bagel with cream cheese.</p>

<p><strong>Green &quot;Bun&quot; Veggie Burger</strong>! Shape Magazine has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/meal-ideas/10-tasty-green-foods-st-pattys-day?page=3">a great veggie burger recipe</a>, that&apos;s served between two avocado halves (instead of buns!). If you prefer to be slightly less healthy, you can put your burger between two slices of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://familyfun.go.com/recipes/st-patricks-day-parsley-garlic-bread-678594/">green pesto garlic bread</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Green Goddess Dip</strong> is for those who want to keep things a little healthy on the weekend normally dedicated to overindulgence. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://www.foodnetwork.com/healthy_eating/healthy-appetizer-recipes/pictures/page-9.html">The recipe</a> calls for a low-fat buttermilk base, creamy avocado and fresh scallions, tarragon and parsley. Serve it up with green veggies for dipping.</p>

<p><strong>Sweet Shamrock Pretzels</strong> probably go great with beer, so you may want to pair some up with a pint of Guinness. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://familyfun.go.com/recipes/sweet-shamrocks-685500/">This recipe</a> calls for &quot;canned refrigerated bread stick dough,&quot; but you can do better than that! Try out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205214/http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/02/soft-pretzels-refreshed/">Smitten Kitchen&apos;s pretzel dough recipe</a>, then add melted butter, cinnamon, and green sugar for a coating.</p>
