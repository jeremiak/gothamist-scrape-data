<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="redtide0910.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530151541im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/redtide0910.jpg" width="250" height="212" class="image-left"> </span>Coast Guard officials have warned that a nearly 10-mile stretch of red tide has been spotted in New York Harbor. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530151541/http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/redtide/general.html">algal bloom</a> can be a natural seasonal occurrence, and generally happens when the seas are warm. The toxin-producing phenomena can cause temporary breathing problems, burning eyes and skin irritation, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530151541/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/09/06/coast-guard-swath-of-red-tide-found-in-ny-harbor/">the AP</a>. It&apos;s also detrimental to the shellfish industry, making it unsafe to eat, and often kills fish.</p>

<p>Swimmers and boaters are being warned to avoid the water, which is reddish-brown and was seen near the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, as well as off Staten Island and Jones Beach.</p>

<p>According to the Coast Guard, it will eventually disperse and drift out to sea, but spokesman Charles W. Rowe says until then, &#x201C;stay away from it and anything in it.&quot;</p>
