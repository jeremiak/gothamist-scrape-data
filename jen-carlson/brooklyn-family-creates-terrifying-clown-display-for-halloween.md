title: Brooklyn Family Creates Terrifying Clown Display For Halloween
---

	
										<p>The Brooklyn couple that finds joy in terrifying sweet little children through the power of dark magic and their creative Halloween spirit every year... is <em>baaaack</em>. Their previous displays have included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322024858/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/photos_boerum_hill_residents_want_t.php#photo-3">caged dolls</a>, bloody surgeons, bloody babies, blood in general, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322024858/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/21/brooklyns_bloodiest_halloween_displ.php#photo-1">bloody pumpkin massacres</a>. But this year they&apos;ve gone too far. A clown. Or is that John Wayne Gacy?</p>

<p>A giant, fang-toothed, evil clown in a threatening hug pose, trying to lure children in with cake and a birthday party. But take a step closer and this clown will CUT YOU, with its chef&apos;s knife hand. There is no joy here, son, just pure evil.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160322024858/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulrophobia">coulrophobia</a> is a real thing experienced by both children and adults, especially adults who saw <em>Poltergeist</em> when they were children. This leaves adults in a precarious predicament, standing to lose precious seconds running from Clown Town to safety if they stop to grab their child while fleeing. And if a child dare enter the gate? Forget it. Just look at this Brooklyn mom, standing at a safe distance as that innocent soul inches closer and closer towards this nightmare incarnate.</p>

<p>After the late, great Wes Craven applauded their display last year, you would have thought this year&apos;s would have been an homage to him. And that dude didn&apos;t go NEAR clowns (<em>Carnival of Souls</em> doesn&apos;t count, he was just an executive producer).</p>

<p>The clown resides on Bergen Street between Bond and Nevins, if you would like to avoid it.</p>
