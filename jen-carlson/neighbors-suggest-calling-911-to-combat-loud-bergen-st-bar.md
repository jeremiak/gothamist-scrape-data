The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424141246/http://brooklynian.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=44760">Brooklynian</a> message board was abuzz about the Bergen Street bar yesterday when a local said they had to put up with &quot;bad classic rock at full volume&quot; until well after 2:30 a.m. on Monday night. A reasonable complaint &#x2013; <i>no one</i> deserves to have their dreams invaded by the musical stylings of Foghat &#x2013; but then the bad advice came rolling in: &quot;While the noise is occurring, call 911.&quot; A second sage declared that late at night &quot;is no time for you to worry about whether you&apos;re being inconsiderate by calling the authorities.&quot; That&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424141246/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/13/union_hall_goes.php">the path that one local took</a> when going up against Union Hall earlier this year (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424141246/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/15/union_hall_30_n.php">he lost</a>), so using resources like 911 for complaints like that isn&apos;t always advised--hello, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424141246/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jVoYnJO1PmOdDP4CdqKaHKAkvemgD92BLVK80">Reginald Peterson</a>. Instead call 311 and try talking to the bar owner. </p>
