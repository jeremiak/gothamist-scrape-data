                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bathingsuits0710.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070715im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bathingsuits0710.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="image-left"> </span>It seemed as though New Jersey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070715/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/28/topless_beach.php">was <em>thisclose</em></a> to becoming just a little bit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070715/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/22/jersey_beach.php">more naked</a>, with a vote on allowing a portion of Asbury Park to become a topless beach happening last night. But the prudes win again! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070715/http://wcbstv.com/local/topless.beach.asbury.2.1793020.html">WCBS</a>, city leaders found an ordinance in place that prohibits public exposure; mayor Ed Johnson says he doesn&apos;t plan to change the ordinance to allow nudity, but may update it for other reasons (the same law also prohibits bathing suits on the boardwalk!).</p>

<p>Some residents at last night&apos;s meeting are likely relieved by the decision&#x2014;one declaring, <br>
&quot;I don&apos;t want my family members to be exposed to&quot; toplessness, and another saying, &quot;I oppose any public nudity or partial nudity on city beaches.&quot; </p>

<p>However, the woman who proposed the topless beach, yoga instructor Reggie Flimlin, isn&apos;t pleased with the girded law staying in place. She says, &quot;It&apos;s a shame. They had a real opportunity here to embrace women&apos;s rights in Asbury Park. It&apos;s discouraging.&quot; Other locals who supported her also thought the topless sector would revitalize tourism and create new buzz around the beach town, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070715/http://www.1010wins.com/Asbury-Park-Won-t-Go-Topless/7636712">1010Wins</a>. Well ladies, just pick yourselves up some of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814070715/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/07/jwoww.php?gallery0Pic=4#gallery">JWOWW&apos;s new bikinis</a>&#x2014;your neighbors will soon change their tune. </p>
