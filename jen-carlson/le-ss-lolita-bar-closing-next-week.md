<p>Word on the street is that beloved Lower East Side haunt Lolita Bar will be closing Tuesday night. The Broome Street bar has been operating out of their South of Delancey spot for 13 years, before the area&apos;s storefronts transformed from old school bra shops (in fact, the bar is said to be named after one of them: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131231009/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2011/06/lolita-bra-sign.html">Lolita Bras</a>) to vegan cupcake shops and luxury apartment lobbies.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Lolita Bar and were told that they will comment Tuesday, and will update if we hear anything before that. <em>(What&apos;s going to happen to all of their awesome furniture and lamps?)</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131231009/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/04/lolita_bar_on_broome_to_get_new_own.php">Earlier this year</a> there was a rumor that the bar was purchased by Marshall Stack owner Matthew Kelly. [<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Lolita Bar has confirmed with us that the bar&apos;s last night open is Tuesday, and that Kelly did purchase it.]</p>

<p>This sad development follows the news of North of Delancey mainstays shutting down (Motor City Bar, the Pink Pony, and Alias, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131231009/http://gothamist.com/tags/riples">to name a few</a>). RIP LES.</p>
