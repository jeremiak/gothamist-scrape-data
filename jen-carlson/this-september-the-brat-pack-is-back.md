Since then, there have been some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706141637/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/07/oscars_2010.php">heartfelt tributes</a> that have reunited his most celebrated of creations: the Brat Pack. And now the Film Society of Lincoln Center is hosting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706141637/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/did-we-stutter-film-society-to-pay-tribute-to-john-hughes/">a two-day celebration</a> of Hughes&#x2019;s films, called &#x201C;John Hughes: We Can&#x2019;t Forget About Him.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The series will take place September 19th and 20th at the Walter Reade Theater (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706141637/http://filmlinc.com/">tickets on sale</a> August 5th), and will include screenings of <em>Sixteen Candles</em>, <em>Pretty In Pink</em> and <em>Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off</em>, as well as <em>Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles</em> and <em>Home Alone</em>. The centerpiece seems to be on the 2nd day, when there will be a 25th-anniversary screening of <em>The Breakfast Club</em> followed by a Q&amp;A; between Kevin Smith and cast members Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy. Wow, that&apos;s a big &quot;eat my shorts&quot; from Emilio Estevez.</p>
