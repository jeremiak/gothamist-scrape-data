<p>When Gal Gadot appears in <em>Batman v Superman</em> it&apos;s arguably the best moment in the movie. In fact, director Zack Snyder recreated that picturesque and instantly iconic moment&#x2014;Wonder Woman in the forefront, standing in between Batman and Superman&#x2014;several times. This was Gadot&apos;s first appearance as Wonder Woman, and if it gave you goosebumps, then the trailer for her standalone film (coming out June 2017) is gonna slay you. </p>

<p>The trailer&#x2014;released over the weekend at Comic Con&#x2014;shows Princess Diana of Themyscira during the World War I era. And the below 2 minute and 50 second glimpse puts that entire Batfleck movie to shame.</p>

<p>In the movie, Wonder Woman, who has been fighting for freedom and women&apos;s rights for 75 years, fights alongside Chris Pine&apos;s Steve Trevor, and there&apos;s a wonderful moment at the end of the trailer that she shares with his secretary:</p>

<p><em>&quot;What is a secretary?&quot;<br>
&quot;I go where he tells me to go and do what he tells me to do.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well where I come from that&apos;s called slavery.&quot;</em></p>

<p>When the world first met Wonder Woman in 1941, Hippolyta&#x2014;who raised her, and will be played by Connie Nielsen in the movie&#x2014;explains: &quot;In the days of ancient Greece, many centuries ago, we Amazons were the foremost nation in the world. In Amazonia, women ruled and all was well.&#x201D; That ended when men took over and made women their slaves. </p>

<p>In this original Wonder Woman storyline, as told by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090759/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/last-amazon">the New Yorker</a>, she meets Trevor when his plane crashes into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090759/http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Paradise_Island">Paradise Island</a>, the place all the Amazons escaped to&#x2014;she then brings him to America, &quot;the last citadel of democracy, and of equal rights for women!&#x201D; The movie seems to stay pretty true to Wonder Woman&apos;s roots and origin story.</p>

<p>The movie was directed by Patty Jenkins, and in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090759/http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-needed-female-director.html">an interview</a> Gadot explained the importance of that: &quot;[The movie is] a story about a girl becoming a woman... I think only a woman, who has been a girl, can be able to tell the story in the right way. Working with a woman is a different experience. It feels like the communication is different. We talk about emotions.&#x201D;</p>
