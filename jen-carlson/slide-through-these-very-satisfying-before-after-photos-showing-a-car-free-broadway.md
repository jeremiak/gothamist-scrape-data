The event lasted six blissful hours, but at the strike of 4 o&apos;clock the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424214738/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/21/cars_trucks_buses_ban.php#photo-1">cars returned to the streets</a> to continue the battle of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424214738/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/30/nyc_drivers_bullfight_heckle.php">machine vs. man</a>, while making sure New Yorkers were breathing in their daily intake of carbon emissions.</p>

<p>Photographer Scott Heins was on the scene and reports back that &quot;things felt like a slightly more calm and beautiful version of normal&quot; on Saturday when the cars were banished. Really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424214738/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/13/car_free_nyc_streets.php">makes you think</a>.</p>

<p>Below, slide over the images for a look at Broadway with cars, and without cars. With cars, and without cars. With cars, and without cars...</p>
