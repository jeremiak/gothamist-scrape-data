<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134030/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/06/_kramer_on_regis_and.php">Regis Philbin leaving</a> <em>Live With Regis &amp; Kelly</em> on November 18th, rumors are swirling around who will be his long term replacement. In the past, a source told us they&apos;ll likely bring in a sizable number of guest hosts in for an on-air audition process, similar to the one that led to Kelly&apos;s appointment. And it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134030/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/11/jerry-seinfeld-to-temporarily-replace-regis-philbin/">just announced</a> that the first seat warmer will be none other than Jerry Seinfeld, who has guest hosted on the show before.</p>

<p>Seinfeld will join Ripa for three shows, airing November 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. Executive producer Michael Gelman said in a statement, &#x201C;Jerry is a great friend of ours, and a friend of Kelly&#x2019;s, and it doesn&#x2019;t hurt that he&#x2019;s an entertainment icon. It&#x2019;s a great way to kick off the new beginning of our show.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Following Seinfeld&apos;s stint, more guest hosts will be brought in&#x2014;will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134030/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/pat_kiernan_eyes_regiss_chair.php">NY1&apos;s Pat Kiernan</a> be one of them? Or Kramer?</p>
