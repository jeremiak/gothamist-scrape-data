<p>A <em>shocking</em> new video mash-up featuring scenes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509215640/http://gothamist.com/tags/themindyproject"><em>The Mindy Project</em></a> and <em>When Harry Met Sally</em> shows that Mindy Kaling&apos;s show may be a little bit derivative of the classic Nora Ephon movie. Or maybe it just shows that there are only a few possible romantic storylines in this life. Or maybe it just shows that nothing is original anymore. Or maybe it&apos;s just Kaling giving a nod to one of the women who has influenced her work. </p>

<p>The video even shows almost shot-for-shot scenes from the movie recreated in the series, along with some very similar dialogue:</p>

<p>Bonus points to the fan who made it for using The National for a soundtrack. Subtract points to us for referencing <em>The Mindy Project</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509215640/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/11/holiday_subway_etiquette_dont_bring.php">AGAIN today</a>.
