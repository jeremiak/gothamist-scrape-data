<p>Where can you afford to live in the city? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611031410/http://envisioningdevelopment.net/map">Here&apos;s a visually pleasing way</a> to find out where your paycheck will allow you to live in the five boroughs. According to this map from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611031410/http://ENVISIONINGDEVELOPMENT.NET/">Envisioning Development</a>, the fat cats are on the Upper East Side, where the median income in 2006 was $178,000. Compare that to the neighboring East Harlem, where the median income that year was $29,200. There are even rent sliders to tell you what you could afford in each neighborhood, and what percentage of that neighborhood&apos;s population can afford, say, a one-bedroom for $954.  <em>And</em> you can compare all the boroughs as a whole. </p>

<p>Enjoy this beautifully depressing map, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611031410/http://envisioningdevelopment.net/map">here</a>, and learn more about affordable housing after the jump.</p>
