<p>In the season 2 finale of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173628/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls">HBO&apos;s <em>Girls</em></a>, we see Marnie come to a full-stop in her dazzling downward spiral to get back together with Charlie because it seems safe or normal or whatever. This was going to be a boring storyline going forward, because Marnie is way better when she&apos;s white-knuckling onto sanity and singing Kanye to a bunch of strangers&#x2014;so we&apos;re sort of happy that Christopher Abbott, who plays Charlie, has abruptly announced his departure from the show, effective immediately. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173628/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cutest_boy_leaving_girls_0IrrLAkGdxV4Nqu1N1JxMI">Page Six</a>, &quot;Abbott and Lena Dunham began butting heads as the critical-darling series entered production again. &apos;They&#x2019;ve just started work on Season 3, and Chris is at odds with Lena,&apos; a source said. &apos;He didn&#x2019;t like the direction things are going in.&apos;&quot; Well, he did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173628/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/10/inside_the_girls_season_2_premiere.php#photo-9">look like he was going through some shit</a> at the premiere party earlier this year.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to HBO for comment and will update if we hear back, but for now, Abbott&#x2019;s rep has confirmed his departure, saying he &quot;is grateful for the experience of collaborating with Lena, Judd [Apatow], and the entire cast and crew, but right now he&#x2019;s working on numerous other projects and has decided not to return to the show.&quot;</p>

<p>At least when we talked to Lena Dunham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173628/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/lena_dunham_interview_1.php">last year</a>, she only had nice things to say about Abbott(&apos;s penis bones):</p>

<blockquote><strong>Charlie is really cringe-worthy so far in the first three episodes that I&apos;ve seen.</strong> But he&apos;s so handsome, though! <strong>Yes! But in a way that I would never be attracted to. But I &quot;get it&quot;...</strong> [laughs] Totally! He looks like a model but yeah. When you see him, I think, episode four, he&apos;s got those bones right by his penis that guys have. I was like, &quot;What? Where did those come from? What do you do to get them?&quot; </blockquote>

<p>Alas, now we may never know.</p>
