---

	
										<p>This is equal parts terrifying and beautiful, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213000609/http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/flightpatterns/index.html">a map</a> depicting 24 hours of the nation&apos;s flight patterns (two million planes pass through New York&apos;s airspace each year). This Google map shows roughly 205,000 aircraft the FAA tracked on August 12th, 2008&#x2014;with darker colors indicating a higher altitude and lighter lines showing takeoffs and landings.</p>

<p>And if you think that&apos;s cool, check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213000609/http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/flightpatterns/FPWeb_Final_3.mov">amazing video</a> that goes along with it. It&apos;s like our very own ever-changing constellations.
