<p>Recently a friend residing in Williamsburg said he was going to &quot;the city&quot; for the evening&#x2014;meaning, of course, Manhattan&#x2014;which raised some eyebrows when the terminology was brought to the table at Gothamist HQ. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075253/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan">some fast and loose corners of The Internet</a>, the reason that some people call it &quot;the city&quot; is that &quot;Manhattan is the center of New York City and the New York metropolitan region, hosting the seat of city government and a large portion of the area&apos;s employment, business, and entertainment activities,&quot; and therefore residents of the other four boroughs sometimes &quot;refer to a trip to Manhattan as &apos;going to the city,&apos; despite the comparable populations between those boroughs.&quot;</p>

<p>The Gothamist office is nearly split&#x2014;a quick raise of hands showed that out of the 9 people who participated in our scientific poll, 4 admitted to calling Manhattan &quot;the city.&quot; In one corner, we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075253/http://twitter.com/johndelsignore">John Del Signore</a> (who hails from the Albany area) arguing, &quot;We are ALL the city, even those of us who reside in Staten Island, but elitist real estate masterminds have succeeded in enslaving New Yorkers under the linguistic lash of Manhattan&apos;s pseudo-significance. <strong>I, for one, refuse to submit to the soft bigotry of Manhattan exceptionalism, and have never hesitated to correct anyone who insults New York City&apos;s other four boroughs by mislabeling that arrogant little overpriced island across from New Jersey as &apos;the city.&apos;</strong> This is probably why I have so few friends. That, and what <em>some people</em> have mislabeled &apos;pretentiousness.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Representing those who deem Manhattan &quot;the city&quot; is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075253/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a> (a native New Yorker, raised in Brooklyn), who says: &quot;I disagree with John.  <strong>I think we outer-borough residents call Manhattan &apos;the city&apos; as a way of separating ourselves from its hegemony&#x2014;as a way of repudiating its values of consumerism and celebrity.</strong>  We, the everymen and women of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island, have much in common with our rural forebears, in that we think of Manhattan as a boiling cesspit of disease and despair, surely a product of Satan that we refuse to associate ourselves with.&quot;</p>
