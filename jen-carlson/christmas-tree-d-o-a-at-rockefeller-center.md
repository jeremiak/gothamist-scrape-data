                            <p>Yesterday a perfectly healthy Norway Spruce was chopped down after being deemed perfect for this year&apos;s Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree. It was later dragged down the streets (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007180728/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/11/rockefeller_center_tree.php">from Mahopac</a>) to the Manhattan location, where it now rests before its lifeless body is brought to a standing position once again, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007180728/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCTgcZ6ImsQ">a yuletide Bernie</a>. But don&apos;t feel guilty, the 74-foot-tall beast will most likely be donated to Habitat for Humanity after its holiday stint is up, so it&apos;s not like it died <em>just</em> for us.</p>
