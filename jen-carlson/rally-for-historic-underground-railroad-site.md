Students, activists, local officials and preservationists held the rally and teach-in at the building&apos;s site, the Hopper-Gibbons House at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323220119/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=339+West+29th+Street+New+York,+NY&amp;ll=40.750784,-73.99734&amp;spn=0.008063,0.016801&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.749744,-73.997414&amp;panoid=yMadxK9lJJsxRBJcZqZy0w&amp;cbp=12,359.7,,0,-13.51">339 West 29th Street</a>, which was a hiding place for runaway slaves. The Landmarks Preservation Commission is actively considering designating it a protected landmark, but meanwhile the current owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323220119/http://hdc.org/blog/2009/05/07/rooftop-addition-work-resumed-on-proposed-landmark-hopper-gibbons-abolitionist-house/">continues to receive</a> building permits. One local told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323220119/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/nyregion/thecity/24slav.html?_r=1&amp;ref=thecity">the NY Times</a> last year, &#x201C;Being one of the few African-Americans on the block, I have an emotional connection to this history. <strong>You have a lot of cultural history in New York that money seems to want to push out of the way.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>The house was &quot;named for an abolitionist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323220119/http://savelamartineblockschelseaw29w30nyc.blogspot.com/2007/12/abigail-hopper-gibbons.html">Quaker family</a> that lived there and saved many runaway slaves. The pre-Civil War conduit was used by slaves fleeing southern masters to gain safe passage to sanctuary in northern states and Canada.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323220119/http://chelseanow.com/cn_119/undergroundrailroad.html">ChelseaNow</a> detailed the history of the house&apos;s residents, saying that Abigail Hopper Gibbons and her husband, James Sloan Gibbons &quot;made it a station on the Underground Railroad, taking in as many as 14 escaping slaves at a time. The Gibbons family and other abolitionist neighbors entertained noteworthy opponents of slavery, including Horace Greeley and John Brown.&quot; The house was actually torched and looted by a mob during the Civil War Anti-Draft Riot of 1863, but the family escaped by climbing to the roof and running over the rooftops to a friend who whisked them away in a carriage. You can read the NY Times obituary for Abby Gibbons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130323220119/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/106859760.pdf">here</a> (PDF), they called her &quot;one of the most remarkable women of this century.&quot;</p>
