										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="jfkrunway0410.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522073807im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jfkrunway0410.jpg" width="300" height="201" class="image-left"> </span>So how is this whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522073807/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/jfk_runway.php">shutting down the longest runway</a> at JFK airport thing going? Last month delays were up by 613 even with decreased arrivals and departures. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522073807/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/jfk_planes_sit_happens_q2FPOt1rJHXcIfHFcL4ZfM">the NY Post</a>, the airline industry folk are saying it&apos;s going to get worse! An expert tells them, &quot;Generally, flight activity picks up between March and July, so the delays will only get worse, and that doesn&apos;t even factor in weather conditions.&quot;</p>

<p>The $376MM project will be complete in about three more months, but don&apos;t exhale yet... that same expert says &quot;the mess could last another decade with other JFK construction projects in the pipeline.&quot;</p>

<p>American Airlines, Delta and JetBlue are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522073807/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/airlines_rally_against_3-hour_tarma.php">still seeking</a> to delay a rule that is set to go into effect on April 29th; it would have airlines facing up to $27,500 in fines if planes are kept on the tarmac for longer than 3 hours, which is more likely with the runway being closed.</p>
