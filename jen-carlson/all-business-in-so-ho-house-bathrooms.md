No, no one&apos;s cracking open a fresh can of PBR there just yet, these are more like decadent rich people cutbacks. The House has put up a sign reading: <strong>&quot;Anyone found in pairs in the toilet will be asked to leave the club immediately and their membership will be suspended.&quot;</strong> The sign has reportedly caused quite a stir amongst the well-heeled on a Facebook page that&apos;s since been taken down, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123041742/http://guestofaguest.com/nyc-nightlife/no-sex-at-soho-house/">Guest of a Guest</a> theorizes the bathrooms were not just being crowded with coke buddies, but fornicators, too, &quot;Drug use has always been a common concern for bathroom attendants at our city&#x2019;s hot spots...but apparently, sex is the new cocaine. It makes sense too&#x2026;sex is a lot cheaper, and even the young, rich, and famous need to save up their pennies.&quot; Members, don&apos;t fear, there&apos;s a loophole with this sign which makes threesomes totally acceptable.</p>
