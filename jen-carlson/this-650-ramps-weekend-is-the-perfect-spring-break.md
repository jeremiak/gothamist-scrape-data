<p>It&apos;s springtime, and that means ramps are sprouting from the ground, with their lush green leaves and their beautiful pungent smell. Like little gifts from earth. The best way to celebrate this magic is to free up some of that money you were saving in your kids college fund and head upstate for the party of a lifetime: <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061456/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/27/ramps_spring_break_forever.php">Ramp Picking Weekend at The Arnold House 2</a>: We Know What You Did Last Ramps Weekend</em>.</p>

<p>Once again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061456/http://www.thearnoldhouse.com/">the Arnold House</a>, a 10-room inn tucked away on Shandalee Mountain in the Catskills, is inviting guests up the weekend of April 15th &quot;to celebrate the wildest member of the allium family with a weekend of ramp foraging, pickling and pasta-making.&quot; There will also be a special ramp-themed dinner.  </p>

<p>Here&apos;s what your $649 includes: two nights lodging, daily breakfast, one foraging kit per room (which includes a jar of pickled ramps to take home), a morningtime foraging trip to a nearby wild ramp fields, pasta-making and ramp pickling classes, a special ramp-themed dinner, and a complimentary pack of gum (you&apos;re gonna need it).</p>

<p>Fact: there are no ramps growing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061456/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/27/miami_travel_tips.php">in Miami</a>. Ramp Weekend is <em>the</em> perfect spring break. </p>
