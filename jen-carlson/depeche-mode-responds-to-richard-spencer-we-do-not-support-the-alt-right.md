<p>Earlier today before he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151503/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/richard-spencer-cpac">kicked out of CPAC</a> (the Conservative Political Action Conference),<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151503/http://dcist.com/2017/01/so_many_memes_of_white_national_ric.php"> white nationalist Richard Spencer</a> was asked if he likes rock music, at which point he declared that Depeche Mode is the &quot;official band of the alt-right,&quot; according to <em>New York</em> magazine&apos;s Olivia Nuzzi. </p>

<p>We reached out to the band&apos;s label, and a rep told Gothamist, &quot;That is a pretty ridiculous claim. Depeche Mode has no ties to Richard Spencer or the alt right and does not support the alt right movement.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, in fact, the band was the latest to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151503/https://heatst.com/culture-wars/depeche-mode-frontman-latest-celebrity-to-compare-donald-trump-to-hitler/">compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler</a> when frontman Dave Gahan declared in a video interview (which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151503/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYZU_Wh4s1A">watch here</a>), &quot;The things that he&#x2019;s saying sound very similar to what someone was saying in 1935. That didn&#x2019;t work out very well! The things that he&#x2019;s saying are cruel and heartless and promoting fear.&quot;</p>

<p>Update: Spencer said he was joking. Lol?</p>
