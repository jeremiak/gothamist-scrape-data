</div></div>					<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225427/http://dcist.com/2013/02/postal_service_to_end_saturday_deli.php">it was announced</a> that The United States Postal Service will end Saturday mail delivery effective August 1st. (Note: this does not include P.O. boxes, and packages will still be delivered&#x2014;only mail-to-the-door delivery will stop.) The move was one to save the cash-strapped agency&#x2014;which, keep in mind, does not operate on tax dollars&#x2014;about $2 billion annually. </p>

<p>It&apos;s way too easy to disregard the Postal Service in these days of constant and immediate online communication, but as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225427/http://www.esquire.com/features/post-office-business-trouble-0213#ixzz2K9Eha000">Esquire</a> recently asked, &quot;Do We Really Want to Live Without the Post Office?&quot; No, we don&apos;t. And if their six page article and oral history can&apos;t convince you of that, then click through for a look at the glory days of mail service.</p>

<p>And if you&apos;ve never felt joy in opening a real piece of mail, <strike>we&apos;ll print out this post and mail it to the first 5 people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225427/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">email us</a> their address.</strike> (Update: we&apos;ve hit the limit, but we encourage you to mail something today!)</p>
