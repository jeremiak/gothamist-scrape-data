                            <p>Earlier this week, Birdie, a dog in Brooklyn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901231801/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/07/dog_fashion_show.php">told us all about dog fashions</a>, predicting that &quot;leashes are going to get more constricting and hateful&quot; this season. Well, last night our photographer Katie Sokoler dropped by the very crowded Dog Fashion Show at Bergdorf Goodman to check out the latest in canine wear. There were no constricting or hateful leashes, but it&apos;s important to keep in mind that these dogs are shopping off the rack (<em>disgusting</em>). Surely the next Paris Fashion Week will feature some more fashion forward stuff, but in the meantime, click through for a look at what some of New York City&apos;s pups are (forced to be) wearing.</p>
