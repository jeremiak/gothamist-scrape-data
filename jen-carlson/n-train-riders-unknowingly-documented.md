Someone then pointed out a new Twitter account called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105631/http://twitter.com/n_train_gossip">N Train Gossip</a> which includes a 140-character takedown of each victim the author snaps a photo of. Consider this a warning N train riders! Seems a little harsh, too &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105631/http://twitpic.com/wu2pu">this photo</a> was accompanied by the words, &quot;Ummm... nice Mickey Mouse mp3 player, grown Asian woman.&quot; (It&apos;s cute!) However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105631/http://twitpic.com/uid2o">this nose picker</a> had what was coming to him. Seems NYC is no longer the place where everyone is invisible.</p>
