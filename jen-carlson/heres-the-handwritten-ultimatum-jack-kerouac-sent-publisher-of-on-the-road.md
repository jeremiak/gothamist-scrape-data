In this 1956 note he sent to Viking Press editor Malcolm Cowley, he writes:</p><blockquote>&quot;Dear Malcolm, You&apos;ve all delayed once ore, not sending my work for the summer on the mountain&#x2014;I&apos;ve started an epic novel of 1000 pages THE BEAT GENERATION&#x2014;If you don&apos;t send me a contract with an advance (or some kind of option) by October first, on ON THE ROAD, I am going to withdraw the manuscript from Viking and sell it elsewhere. Than have it demeaned I&apos;d rather it were never published. Period. Jack Kerouac.&quot;</blockquote>According to Open Culture, who has published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012516/http://www.openculture.com/2013/03/six_postcards_from_famous_writers_hemingway_kafka_kerouac_more.html">a series of postcards</a> from famous writers, Cowley &quot;was a believer in Jack Kerouac&#x2019;s talent but was putting off the publication of <em>On the Road</em>.&quot; A few months earlier Cowley told him: &#x201C;Automatic writing is fine for a start, but it has to be revised and put into shape or people will quite properly refuse to read it&#x2014;and what you need now is to be read, not to be exhibited as a sort of natural phenomenon like [the] Old Faithful geyser that sends up a jet of steam and mud every hour on the hour.&#x201D; Kerouac&apos;s postcard had a photo of Yellowstone National Park on the front.<p></p>

<p>That, of course, isn&apos;t the end of the story. When Kerouac received an advance copy of his novel almost exactly one year after this postcard was sent, he told Allen Ginsberg that Cowley had &apos;&apos;&apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012516/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/07/books/the-typist.html">yanked much out</a>&apos; without giving the author a chance to approve the changes.&quot; However, he later &quot;sent a grateful note to &apos;crafty Cowley,&apos; in which he said that the extra &apos;few cuts&apos; were for the better.&quot; BUT THEN, in early 1958, Kerouac wrote to poet Philip Whalen claiming, &quot;<em>On the Road</em> was not edited... It was published as is off my MS. from the 120-foot roll.&apos;&apos; (These letters are all published in the 2nd volume of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012516/http://www.amazon.com/Jack-Kerouac-Selected-Letters-Volume/dp/0670861901">Selected Letters</a>.)</p>

<p>NPR has some more on the myths and legends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012516/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11709924">behind Kerouac and the scroll</a>, and we&apos;ve reached out to a local Kerouac expert to see if he has any more insight on how the scroll really became the novel.</p>
