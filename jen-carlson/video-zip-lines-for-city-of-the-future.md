title: Video: Zip Lines For City Of The Future
---

	
										<p>New public transportation idea: zip lines! From the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022182243/http://kolelinia.com/en/">same people</a> that brought you the bike on a wire idea, the design group now introduces a concept that would have city folk of the future carrying a device around so that they may latch on to a system of steel wires to transport them around town. Looks fun!</p>
