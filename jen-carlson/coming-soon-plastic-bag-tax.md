Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170716/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11072008/news/regionalnews/shoppers_left_holding_the_bag_137588.htm">the NY Post</a> is reporting that Mayor Bloomberg has proposed a charge of 5-cent per plastic bag for shoppers who choose to use them (over, say, their own reusable grocery bags). <strong>&quot;The plan - which may need approval from the state Legislature if it&apos;s determined to be a tax - may include charging shoppers 6 cents, with a penny going to stores as incentive for collecting the new tax,&quot;</strong> the paper reports--all in all it&apos;s a move that could bring in around $16 million for the city. While some cheered on the idea, others expressed concerns, and a Harlem bodega owner noted that &quot;It may work at the bigger stores, but it won&apos;t work for bodega. People want free bags all the time.&quot;<br>
