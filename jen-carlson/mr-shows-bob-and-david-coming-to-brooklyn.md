                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bobdavid0813.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070243im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bobdavid0813.jpg" width="350" height="199" class="image-right"> </span>Saul Goodman and Tobias Funke have nothing on Bob Odenkirk and David Cross&apos;s characters from the 1990s HBO series <em>Mr. Show</em>, cruelly ripped from our hands and brains in 1998. And now the two are reuniting under the powerHouse Arena roof in DUMBO next month for just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070243/http://www.powerhousearena.com/shop/tickets/hollywood-said-no-ticket-sept-10">EIGHT DOLLARS</a>. </p>

<p>The event is to celebrate the release of their book, written in collaboration with Brian Posehn, titled <em>Hollywood Said No!: Orphaned Film Scripts, Bastard Scenes, and Abandoned Darlings</em>.  Posehn will also be on hand for the event, taking place September 10th from 7 to 9 p.m., reuniting the three for the first time in basically forever. </p>

<p>Maybe they&apos;ll even perform some of the unaired sketches from the book? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070243/http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Said-No-Orphaned-Abandoned/dp/1455526304">The book</a> will be released the same night, and features &quot;never-before-seen scripts that were so funny they made Hollywood wet its ninny-pants,&quot; including full-length scripts for <em>Bob and David Make a Movie</em> (with brand-new storyboards).</p>

<p>Anyway, guys, somehow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826070243/http://www.powerhousearena.com/shop/tickets/hollywood-said-no-ticket-sept-10">this is NOT SOLD OUT</a>, so WTF is wrong with you?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It&apos;s now sold out. Good job guys.</p>
