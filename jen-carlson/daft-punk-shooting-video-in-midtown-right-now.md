</div></div>					<p>Mysterious electronic duo Daft Punk (or two guys in helmets) is filming in Manhattan <em>right now</em>. They&apos;ve been spotted at Park Avenue and 42nd Street near Grand Central so far&#x2014;with one witness wondering if it is <em>really</em> them: &quot;Are they imposters? Guess we&apos;ll never know, which is sorta the point.&quot; But one Daft Punk expert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302024055/https://twitter.com/tomoshock23/status/342362878352961537">claims</a> it <em>is</em> them: &quot;That&apos;s actually them, the height difference between the two is just like their other photos.&quot;</p>

<p>The band just released their fourth studio album, <em>Random Access Memories</em> (your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302024055/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/arts/music/daft-punks-get-lucky-may-rule-the-summer.html?pagewanted=all">soundtrack for the summer</a>), so they&apos;ve been showing their shiny helmets once again. Just days ago they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302024055/https://twitter.com/JoshConstine/status/341293127585390592">filming in Copenhagen</a>, and they just wrapped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302024055/https://twitter.com/bryant_dexterlr/status/339391046582669313">on a Lotus F1 ad</a>. It&apos;s unclear if this Manhattan shoot is for a music video, another commercial, or perhaps&#x2014;if we&apos;re really lucky&#x2014;it&apos;s the long-awaited follow-up to their seminal Gap ad:</p>
