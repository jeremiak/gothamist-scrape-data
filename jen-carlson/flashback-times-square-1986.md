</div></div>					<p>In July of 1986&#x2014;eight years before Rudolph Giuliani took over as the city&apos;s Mayor&#x2014;LIFE magazine visually documented Times Square, and its bevy of XXX-rated establishments. Here&apos;s what that summer in the Crossroads of the World looked like. An article in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104728/http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_the_unexpected.html">City Journal</a> once noted that many are nostalgic for this old Times Square, because it &quot;provided a harmless, playful way to subvert stuffy bourgeois morality.&quot; They counter that nostalgic longing, however, with the fact that in 1960 the New York Times was calling 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth the &quot;worst block in the city.&quot; Two years before these photos were taken there were 2,300 crimes on the block, with 20% of them being serious felonies. Could there ever have been a happy median between murder and Mickey Mouse?</p>
