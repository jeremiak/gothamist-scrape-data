THE St. Mark&apos;s institution, even. And the store&apos;s manager and buyer, Jimmy Webb, stands like a punk rock totem over that 3-block world in the East Village, blonde hair waving in the wind. But he won&apos;t be there for long&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163505/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/28/brooklyn_bridge_park_peek.php">according to EV Grieve</a>, the store&apos;s owner, Ray Goodman, has confirmed that they&apos;re moving after forty years in the same storefront.<p></p>

<p>The good news is they will likely reopen elsewhere. Will Trash and Vaudeville at a new location still be Trash and Vaudeville? Hop on your Ship of Theseus and ponder that paradox. For now, EV Grieve says they&apos;ll move from 4 St. Mark&apos;s Place to 96 E. Seventh Street, hopefully by Fall. Goodman told the site that &quot;the rent is creeping up... rent was a factor.&quot; He added, however, that there were other reasons:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I love St. Mark&apos;s Place. There&apos;s no doubt it. There&apos;s something magical about it. This just isn&apos;t any block. The decision wasn&apos;t something that I took lightly. From a business perspective, we saw a shift in the clientele. The block is not as conducive for fashion shopping as it once was. Now it seems as if it&apos;s all food&#x2014;fast food&#x2014;and bongs. Even stores that aren&apos;t bong stores sell bongs.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>We recommend heading over to St. Mark&apos;s before they move out (that date is currently uncertain). They&apos;ve been in this space since 1975, selling rock n&apos; roll gear ever since, and count legends among their customers. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163505/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/fashion/trash-and-vaudeville-still-selling-punks-look-after-38-years.html">the NY Times</a> noted in their 2013 story, the Ramones, Blondie, the Heartbreakers, the Dead Boys &quot;and virtually every other group in the scene were frequent shoppers.&quot; Marky Ramone told them, &quot;When punk was at its height, it was the only place to go at that time, and it still is.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163505/http://www.trashandvaudeville.com/">the store&apos;s history</a>, Goodman &quot;discovered St. Marks Place at the age of 13, and never left. He was immediately attracted to the incredible energy that surged throughout the block.&quot; And he&apos;s still dedicated to the East Village, telling EV Grieve other neighborhoods didn&apos;t feel right, and they prefer to stay in &quot;our natural environment.&quot;</p>
