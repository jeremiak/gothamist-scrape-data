Once that incident faded to the background, certain gossip mongers began to critique the performer&apos;s looks. Naturally, Perez Hilton is the leader of this pack, recently even resorting to asking &quot;experts&quot; about her weight. Well, Apple is punching back.<p></p>

<p>At her show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515133318/http://www2.tbo.com/entertainment/music/2012/sep/19/5/apples-concert-turns-into-confessional-ar-517881/">in Clearwater, Florida</a> over the weekend, she told the audience:</p><blockquote>&quot;I have so much that I would like to respond to about the millions and millions of articles that I have shamefully&#x2026; I&apos;ve given away my computer now, because I cannot do it anymore. But <strong>Perez Hilton... to hire &apos;experts&apos; to comment and say that I am sick is totally, totally irresponsible, and dangerous</strong>, and you should know better, and so should everybody who&apos;s talking about me like that. And I&apos;m not on any drugs. I had some bourbon before I came out here. I&apos;ve always been honest&#x2014;why would I be dishonest about anything?<p></p>

<p>Perez Hilton, TMZ, whoever you represent: I&apos;m not invulnerable to this stuff. I&apos;ve been around for many years, but it hurts. I didn&apos;t need to hear that I&apos;m 90 years old just because I didn&apos;t have a facelift in the last seven years. I&apos;m fucking losing weight because I&apos;m having trouble digesting food because your guts are connected to your brain and I have a lot of stress in my brain.</p>

<p>So lay off with that stuff because it hurts my feelings. If for no other reason, that should be a good enough reason. Stop hurting people&apos;s feelings, stop bullying people because you were bullied. I know that that&apos;s not what you are. It can&apos;t be. Please stop hurting my feelings, because it really fucking bothers me. Seriously. Please stop. It doesn&apos;t matter what I look like!&quot;</p></blockquote>[via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515133318/http://pitchfork.com/news/48039-watch-fiona-apple-hits-back-at-gossip-websites-please-stop-hurting-my-feelings/">Pitchfork</a>]<p></p>
