</div></div>					<p>Recently photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021152/http://www.navidbaraty.com/">Navid Baraty</a> visited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021152/http://www.victoriaandrichardemprise.com/">Victoria and Richard MacKenzie-Childs</a>&apos; home aboard the historic 1907 Yankee Ferry, currently floating in the Hudson off Hoboken. Baraty gave us a glimpse of what their envy-inducing digs look like, and says, &quot;They&apos;ve not only restored the Yankee and kept it afloat for posterity, but they also use the ship as a beautiful studio and show space for their work as decorative artists.&quot; They even have a tire garden, with chickens!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021152/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_%28ferry%29">Yankee Ferry</a> was first used by the U.S. Army to patrol the Boston Harbor during World War I, and was later used to transport newly arrived immigrants from Ellis Island to Manhattan.</p>

<p>You can see more of the ferry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021152/http://www.flickr.com/photos/vwmang/sets/72157627318631019/with/6047770540/">at Baratay&apos;s Flickr</a>, and we&apos;ve contacted the couple to get more information (and permission to come aboard)&#x2014;we&apos;ll update when we hear back.</p>
