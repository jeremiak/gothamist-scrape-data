<p>Sometimes when the weather gets too hot or too cold... the people go a little mad. The streets often feel like some sort of dystopian wonderland whirling with anarchy, chaos, and crime. Look no further than this below video, pulled from a surveillance camera in Bushwick after last week&apos;s snowstorm. In it you&apos;ll witness two men stealthy plotting the demise of a plot of fresh, unblemished snow. To commit this act they begin with trespassing&#x2014;a lookout man keeps an eye on sidewalk activity, while the other jumps a fence. Once he thoroughly&#x2014;and quickly <em>like the wind</em>&#x2014;ravages the snow, the two men bolt, leaving what appears to be the ghost of an angel behind. Be on the lookout for similar angel markings in the snow, this could be the duo&apos;s trademark, and a signal to the public that they may strike again.</p>
