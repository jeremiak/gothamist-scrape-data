<p>As we mentioned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161448/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/26/willig.php">yesterday</a>, this week marked 32 years since George Willig&apos;s climb up the World Trade Center&apos;s south tower. When he got up there, he signed his name on a piece of metal on the observation deck, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161448/http://inklake.typepad.com/ink_lake/2009/05/theres-only-one-way-to-go-and-thats-up.html">a reader</a> has scanned in his photo of it, taken in 1983. We like that Willig even drew the two towers!</p>
