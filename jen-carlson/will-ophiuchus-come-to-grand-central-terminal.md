<p>As you have most likely heard by now&#x2014;there&apos;s been talk of a new astrological sign, along with the possibility of your sign changing. Last week Susan Miller of AstrologyZone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153802/http://twitter.com/#!/astrologyzone/status/24492216923721728">told us</a>, &quot;Nothing changed. Sidereal astrology studies the precession of the equinoxes, and it doesn&apos;t work when we sift 23 degrees.&quot; We have no idea what that means, but it sounds like if you were a Virgo last month, you are still one now. </p>

<p><em>However</em>, not everyone is nay-saying the shift&#x2014;and if you follow Eastern astrology, which is based on your relationship to the stars, the appearance of Ophiuchus is a gamechanger. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153802/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2011/01/16/2011-01-16_oh_my_stars_phew_astrology_worries_for_naught_here.html">The Daily News</a> notes, &quot;the Earth has moved enough to allow another constellation to feature in the mix. This adds an additional sign, called Ophiuchus, which makes 13 signs in total&#x2014;and for those who follow this system, it changes the dates of the remaining 12 signs.&quot; </p>

<p>A breakdown of the shift is below, but what we want to know is: will the ceiling of Grand Central Terminal change to reflect Ophiuchus? We contacted the MTA and a spokeswoman told us they &quot;would not&quot; update the ceiling. Why? Because, she says, &quot;it&apos;s a landmarked work of art not a star map.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Here&#x2019;s a guide to the sign changes:

<p>Capricorn: Jan. 20 - Feb. 16<br>
Aquarius: Feb. 16 - March 11<br>
Pisces: March 11- April 18<br>
Aries: April 18- May 13<br>
Taurus: May 13- June 21<br>
Gemini: June 21- July 20<br>
Cancer: July 20- Aug. 10<br>
Leo: Aug. 10- Sept. 16<br>
Virgo: Sept. 16- Oct. 30<br>
Libra: Oct. 30- Nov. 23<br>
Scorpio: Nov. 23- Nov. 29<br>
Ophiuchus: Nov. 29- Dec. 17<br>
Sagittarius: Dec. 17- Jan. 20</p></blockquote><p></p>
