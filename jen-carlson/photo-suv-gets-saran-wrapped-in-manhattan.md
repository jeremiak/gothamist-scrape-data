<p>Since there is absolutely no good reason to saran wrap your own car&#x2014;<em>unless</em> you are dressing it up as a dead Laura Palmer for Halloween?&#x2014;it seems quite possible that this SUV was the victim of a classic prank. A tipster spotted this scene in Washington Heights yesterday morning, and had &quot;noticed two people wrapping the car in the dark Sunday night.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, maybe they were just using up the remains of their industrial roll of wrap and ran out, but the duo who did this didn&apos;t go all the way with it&#x2014;there&apos;s no weaving, no under-car wrap, and it appears they left a clear seam at which the owner of the car could start unwrapping the whole thing pretty easily. Really a C- job guys, a little more effort and commitment next time if you want to keep an SUV fresh. </p>
