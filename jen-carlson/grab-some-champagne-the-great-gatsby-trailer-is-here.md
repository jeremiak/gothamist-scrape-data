<p>The first look at Baz Luhrman&apos;s trailer for his 3-D version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120526003803/http://gothamist.com/tags/thegreatgatsby"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a> has been released, and if you&apos;ve seen his previous films (<em>Romeo+Juliet</em>, <em>Moulin Rouge</em>) then it will come as no surprise to see he&apos;s created a vivid, over-the-top world from F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s classic novel. It&apos;s sort of like 1920s New York has been drenched in Mo&#xEB;t and Hunter S. Thompson is reading the story to you while squeezing an eyedropper of LSD onto your skin everytime Eckleburg&apos;s eyes appear. Have we mentioned the Mo&#xEB;t? Count how many times you spot it in the trailer, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120526003803/https://twitter.com/ExtAngel/status/205114756703596548">some say</a> is longer than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120526003803/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/21/gatz_the_mesmerizing_marathon_great.php">Gatz</a>.</p>

<p>According to the Frank Lloyd Wright-esque typeface in the trailer, The Great Gatsby won&apos;t be in theaters until Christmas.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120526003803/http://instagr.am/p/LBYoY-BroS/">Here are some old photos</a> of what NYC really looked like during the year 1922, when <em>Gatsby</em> is set.</p>
