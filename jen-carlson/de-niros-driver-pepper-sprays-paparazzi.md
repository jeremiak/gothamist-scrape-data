According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014127/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/laguardia_niro_driver_hits_celebrity_NgWR5zxoI68Fwbyoar0q2I">the NY Post</a>, his driver Vladimir Labissiere pepper sprayed a TMZ videographer earlier today at LaGuardia Airport after he had filmed the actor. This took place just before 11 a.m. in the Delta Terminal, but reportedly De Niro had already passed security and didn&apos;t witness the incident, which began with some verbal sparring. Labissiere managed to hit not only his target with a dose of the spray, but a passerby as well; he fled the scene immediately and the NYPD are trying to track him down to question him about the incident... which we assume is all on tape and will be hitting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014127/http://www.tmz.com/tag/robert+de+niro/">TMZ </a>any minute now.</p>
