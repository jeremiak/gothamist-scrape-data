<p>Weren&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405033924/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/alamo_drafthouse_bottles.php">we just wondering</a> when New York would get its very own Alamo Drafthouse? The Texas-rooted cinema <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405033924/http://drafthouse.com/blog/entry/alamo_drafthouse_goes_to_new_york">has just announced</a> plans for their first location here. The five-screen theater will be on the Upper West Side, located at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405033924/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/landmarked_uws_theater_is_back_on_t.php">former Metro Theater</a> (at 2626 Broadway). Alamo founder Tim League says, &quot;My often-stated top priority for the Alamo Drafthouse has been to open a venue in New York. When we discovered the availability of the historic Metro theater, we immediately knew we had found the perfect location for our new Manhattan home.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a state law that allowed movie theaters to sell alcohol, but even now there are only a few theaters taking advantage of it&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405033924/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/drink_during_the_movies_at_nitehawk.php">Nitehawk in Williamsburg</a> being the most notable, and the most similar to Alamo. Nitehawk also lobbied to change the state liquor law that is allowing Alamo to open.</p>

<p>Like the Alamos before it, the theater will screen new releases and repertory programming, while providing food and drink service to your seat. And yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405033924/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/07/video_should_nyc_bring_this_kind_of.php">the will publicly shame you</a> for talking during the movie.</p>

<p>They plan to open sometime in 2013, and are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405033924/http://www.drafthouse.com/about/employment">currently hiring</a>.</p>
