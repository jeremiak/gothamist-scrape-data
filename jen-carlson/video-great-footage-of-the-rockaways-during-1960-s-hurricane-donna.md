<p>Hurricane Donna hit the states in 1960 (specifically, <em>every</em> state on the East Coast), and she still holds the record for retaining major hurricane status (Category 3 or greater) in the Atlantic Basin for the longest period of time. She kept going strong for nine days, starting on September 9th, but was around for seventeen days total (even briefly becoming a Category 5). According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060529/http://www.qchron.com/news/queenswide/flirting-with-disaster-city-enters-storm-season/article_aaab7449-08cb-5df6-903e-49b0becf8f55.html">the Queens Chronicle</a>, &quot;Donna created an 11 foot storm surge in New York Harbor that caused extensive pier damage.&quot; She also &quot;devastated the Rockaway Peninsula that eventually led to the construction of the bay wall on Beach Channel Drive.&quot; Here&apos;s some amazing footage of locals in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060529/http://gothamist.com/tags/rockaway">Rockaway</a> making the best of the situation:</p>
