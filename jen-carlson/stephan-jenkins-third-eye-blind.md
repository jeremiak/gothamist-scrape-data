										<p><em>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213200/http://www.myspace.com/thirdeyeblind">Third Eye Blind</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213200/http://www.3eb.com/">3EB</a> if you prefer, played at Central Park for Good Morning America&apos;s summer concert series, but yesterday lead singer Stephan Jenkins was in our very own office performing a more intimate set. Despite his bike being stolen the day before after riding it from Bowery to midtown, he still had a smile on his face. The band is releasing a new album, titled Ursa Major, in August, which includes a duet with original indie darling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213200/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/15/kimya_dawson_mu.php">Kimya Dawson</a>. Yesterday he played us some of the old and new (which you can watch below), including one song about being in love with a lesbian&#x2014;no word on if it&apos;s about MSNBC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213200/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/24/rachel_maddow_talk_show_host.php">Rachel Maddow</a>, who he has said he has &quot;an overwhelming and tragic crush on.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>The band formed around the same time that grunge was hitting the mainstream, experiencing that era and everything after, what has been your favorite time for music from the early 90s on?</strong> We were definitely I&apos;d say post grunge and I don&apos;t think we came out really as part of a movement.  Emo was something that came out as was coined later.  My favorite musical period was probably the early, early 90&apos;s, bands like Camper van Beethoven and A Tribe Called Quest.</p>

<p><strong>Any treats in store for the GMA Central Park show? Pi&#xF1;atas maybe?</strong> That&apos;s a good idea.  I don&apos;t know if I can round up enough crickets.  Pinatas are much better when they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213200/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Eye_Blind#Beginnings_.281993.E2.80.931996.29">packed full of crickets</a>.</p>
