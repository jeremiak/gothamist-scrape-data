<p><em>General Hospital</em>, one of the last remaining soap operas on the air, just got an extended lease on life by bringing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170804/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> back to their daytime drama fold. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170804/http://www.tvguide.com/News/James-Franco-General-Hospital-1035645.aspx">TV Guide</a> reports that he&apos;ll be back for a fourth time starting on September 20th, for a long term story arc. They note that he can shoot weeks worth of scenes in just a couple of days because he is... James Franco, or one of the clones in an army of James Franco clones that we refuse to believe doesn&apos;t exist. (We heard he had a collegiate degree in cloning.) This will eventually be revealed in one of the 45 biopics James Franco is producing about his own life, covering the clone army era (present day), which is just one small part of his life, for now. </p>

<p>Back to soap opera Franco&#x2014;he&apos;ll be returning in his Robert &quot;Franco&quot; Frank role, in which he &quot;has a hopelessly mad crush on beefy hit man Jason Morgan (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170804/http://www.google.com/imgres?q=steve+burton&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1840&amp;bih=810&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=iBxuFqDoJM1jLM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.ghofs.net/2008/12/focus-on-steve-burton.html&amp;docid=tk2-5rWj_FBAWM&amp;w=300&amp;h=316&amp;ei=uPIuTrnGMsHYgQe925m3AQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=105&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=151&amp;tbnw=142&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=45&amp;ved=1t:429,r:4,s:0&amp;tx=93&amp;ty=67">Steve Burton</a>) so the timing of his return to Port Charles is no coincidence&#x2014;he&apos;ll be hitting the town just as Jason is all set to wed Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco). Will Franco stop the ceremony or turn it into an unforgettable nightmare?&quot; You&apos;ll have to tune in! Because that&apos;s how they getcha.</p>
