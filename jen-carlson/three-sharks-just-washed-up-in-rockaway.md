title: Three Sharks Just Washed Up In Rockaway
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpjkoNcyPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117102011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpjkoNcyPM.jpg" width="73" height="110" class="image-right"> </span>Beach 3rd Street at the beach in Rockaway, Queens just became the scene of a sharkicide. Reports are coming in that three dead sharks have just washed up on shore there. We&apos;ll update when we have more information. Earlier this season the Coast Guard issued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117102011/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/02/shark_advisory.php">a shark advisory</a>, specifically warning of great whites in the area. No word yet on what kind of sharks washed up today&#x2014;let&apos;s hope it&apos;s just prop marketing for this new insanely bad (yet oh so good) looking movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117102011/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK2bBfuepKk">Sharktopus</a>. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&apos;re now told that there were no sharks! Smells like a cover up to us.</p>
