<p>According to executives at AEG Live, the promoter, they have yet to decide on a third year, saying, &#x201C;There is no question that our biggest challenge is finding suitable headliners, and it has been more challenging this year than in the past. No final determination of any kind has been made for 2010.&#x201D; Another in-the-know exec touched upon the fan reaction, saying, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how great an experience it was for the fans. If we&#x2019;re going to do that show again, we want to be able to make it great and have it be something that people respect.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It seems bookers are whispering behind their backs, too. A few talked to the Times anonymously, not wanting to jeopardize their business relationship with the promoter, saying nothing has been booked and it would be nearly impossible for APW to happen at this point, without a headliner.</p>

<p>In previous years the APW stage has seen Radiohead, Jay-Z, Coldplay, and one too many headlining sets by Jack Johnson. Oh well, there&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003025644/http://www.thebamboozle.com/">Bamboozle</a>.</p>
