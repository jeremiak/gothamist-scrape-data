<p>Not since Fashion Week have we been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321213449/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/12/photos_anna_wintour_and_nikki_minaj.php">so transfixed by a photo</a> of two people. Well move over Nikki and Anna, because the real reveal at F8 yesterday was Andy Samberg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321213449/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150321994685798&amp;set=a.10150321712425798.364040.11204705797&amp;type=1&amp;theater">Zuckerberg makeover</a>.
