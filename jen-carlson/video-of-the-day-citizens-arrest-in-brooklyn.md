title: Video of the Day: Citizen's Arrest in Brooklyn
---

<p>A camera and a YouTube account <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111318/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/10/911_311_hotlines_accepting_photos_v.php">are the new badge</a>! This group of Brooklynites filmed the aftermath of an attempted robbery (allegedly the robber had a razor, which can be seen on the ground in the video). The scene includes a group holding a man on the street until the cops come to arrest him. Language and threats aside, no one gets violent...until another bystander comes over and kicks the would-be robber. Take a look:</p>
