<span class="photo_caption">Holden Caulfield was reportedly based on Freddie Bartholomew, pictured top middle.</span></p>

<p>In <em>The Catcher In The Rye</em>, Holden Caulfield is described as resembling a child actor from a movie; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090010/http://www.life.com/gallery/62491/salinger-and-catcher-in-the-rye">LIFE.com</a> says analysts have since pinpointed down who that actor was: English-born child actor named Freddie Bartholomew&#x2014;specifically, as he appeared in the 1937 movie <em>Captains Courageous</em>. Is this what you imagined one of the world&apos;s most famous literary characters to look like? </p>

<p>Turns out that a lot of other actors fancied themselves fit to fill Holden&apos;s shoes, and since the book was published there&apos;s been a push by many to bring it to the stage or screen. In 1961 the idea of bringing the book to Broadway came up, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150125090010/http://gothamist.com/tags/jdsalinger">J.D. Salinger</a> said he&apos;d be open to if he could play Holden himself (he eventually changed his tune, saying, &quot;I cannot give my permission. I fear Holden wouldn&apos;t like it.&quot;). </p>

<p>Others that had hoped to play Holden Caulfield on the big screen: Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Jerry Lewis, Tobey Maguire, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Alas, Salinger wrote of his character: &quot;Holden Caulfield himself, in my undoubtedly super-biassed opinion, is essentially unactable. A Sensitive, Intelligent, Talented Young Actor in a Reversible Coat wouldn&apos;t nearly be enough. It would take someone with X to bring it off, and no very young man even if he has X quite knows what to do with it.&quot;</p>
