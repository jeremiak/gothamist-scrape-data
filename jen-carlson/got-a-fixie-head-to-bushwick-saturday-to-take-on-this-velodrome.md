<p>This weekend a miniature velodrome will be set up inside of the Bushwick Church (626 Bushwick Avenue), allowing hundreds of cyclists to race around in circles at fast speeds until a huge, beardy pile-up forms in the center of the racetrack. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322172235/http://brokelyn.com/welcome-to-the-velodrome/">Brokelyn</a> promises it&apos;ll be just like &quot;watching NASCAR, but without the potential for being maimed by a gigantic piece of a car.&quot;</p>

<p>The whole thing is being powered by Red Bull, who will set up shop on Saturday and are inviting people to sign up for a chance to race. If interested, email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322172235/mailto:MiniDromeNYC@gmail.com">MiniDromeNYC@gmail.com</a>&#x2014;you could win a thousand bucks and walk away with some sexy scars and sweet bruises. Spectators and would-be participants can find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322172235/http://minidromenyc.eventbrite.com/">more details here</a>, including a list of rules and regulations&#x2014;for example: only sober cyclists with single speed (fixed gear) bikes are able to participate. WELCOME TO THE VELODROME.</p>
