title: Sidewalk Shocks Another Pup

<p><img alt="200712pupsidewalk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015938im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200712pupsidewalk.jpg" width="350" height="266" class="right">The city&apos;s shocking sidewalks strike again! An Upper West Side pup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015938/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=76596">was electrocuted</a> Thursday during a late night walk on 72nd and Amsterdam. This has happened too many times over the past few years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015938/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/07/a_ny_post_repor.php">more recently</a> to a NY Post reporter&apos;s dog in Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem, who died from the shock. </p>

<p>A few years ago when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015938/http://gothamist.com/2004/11/24/con_ed_and_jodie_lanes_family_settle_electrocution_death.php">Jodie Lane</a> died, and her two dogs were injured from a similar shock, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015938/http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_38/conedrespondsto.html">Con Ed reported</a> they had been getting &quot;about 100 complaints about people or dogs receiving electric shocks from street equipment, but the reports have increased enormously in the two weeks since [Jodie Lane&apos;s] accident.&quot;  </p>

<p>Buddy, the latest canine victim, was standing on the electrical plate when he received the shock and the DOT reported it as being &quot;a control box for the traffic light...the insulation of one of the wires had come loose.&quot; Luckily Buddy is okay, but &quot;his owner says he was still clearly uncomfortable walking by that spot.&quot; Con Ed fixed this particular electrical plate, even though it was part of the DOT&apos;s infrastructure. </p>

<p>Incidents like this are more common in the winter, when salt makes water on the ground conduct more electricity. So another friendly reminder: buy your pooch some boots! We suggest some rubber-soled ones, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015938/http://www.watsonspets.com/all-terrain-dog-shoes.html">like these</a>.</p>
