</div></div>					<p>As noted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225521/http://gothamist.list-manage.com/subscribe/post">our newsletter</a> today, 32 years ago tonight, at 8:37 p.m., the blackout of 1977 began. On its 30th anniversary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225521/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/13/the_new_york_ci.php">we did a full recap</a> of the night. The evening has been well-documented elsewhere as well&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225521/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/multimedia/2007/07/gallery_dayintech_0713">here are some more images</a>&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225521/http://images.google.com/hosted/life">the LIFE database</a> actually has plenty photographs from <em>other</em> blackouts in the city&apos;s past (1942, 1959, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225521/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Blackout_of_1965">1965</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225521/http://gothamist.com/2003/08/15/the_new_york_city_blackout_edition.php">2003</a>). In 2003 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225521/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/15/nyregion/15HIST.html">the NY Times</a> looked at how the &apos;65 and &apos;77 ones shaped our history. While the former showed people coming together, proving &quot;reassuring and exhilarating,&quot; they sum up the latter with a quote a priest named Gabriel Santacruz from St. Barbara&apos;s Church in Bushwick. He said the Sunday after the &apos;77 blackout: &quot;We are without God now.&quot;</p>

<p>What years do you remember the lights going out?</p>
