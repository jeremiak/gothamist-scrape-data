Robert Burck, better known as The Naked Cowboy, has landed his very own reality television series. The busker who has made his way up to a tourist attraction, donning underwear and a guitar in Times Square, will host an American Idol-type show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194953/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08212008/news/regionalnews/cowboy_bares_reality_tv_gig_125411.htm">The NY Post</a> reports. He&apos;ll judge other buskers in an attempt to find the world&apos;s greatest street musician (ahem, besides himself, naturally). Burck said, &quot;I&apos;m looking for character more than anything. You could be the greatest musician in the world, but if you stand in jeans and a T-shirt next to me, no one will notice you. <strong>[The winner] needs to be someone who is pure and awesome - like me.</strong>&quot; The Cowboy has been testing out his judging skills <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194953/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/bischoff-hervey-entertainment-television-gets/story.aspx?guid={D7A2D06B-281C-44DD-9430-A1935536CEDC}&amp;dist=hppr">on GMA</a> for their intern competition.</p>
