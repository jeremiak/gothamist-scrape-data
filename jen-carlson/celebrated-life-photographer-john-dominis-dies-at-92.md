<p>LIFE magazine photographer John Dominis died in his Manhattan home yesterday at the age of 92. The cause of death, according to his daughter, was a heart ailment. Dominis worked at the magazine from 1950 until weekly publication ended in 1972, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816035250/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/arts/design/john-dominis-a-star-life-magazine-photographer-dies.html?_r=0">the NY Times</a>, who call him out as a star photographer amongst the magazine&apos;s stable.</p>

<p>Life.com has posted a great selection of photos in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816035250/http://life.time.com/culture/john-dominis-celebrating-the-work-of-a-master-photographer/#1">tribute to Dominis</a> (&quot;Farewell, John. We won&apos;t see your like again.&quot;), whose subjects ranged from athletes to presidents to wars to wild animals to Woodstock to Beatles. Prior to his death, they wrote that their photo archives served &quot;as a testament to the man&#x2019;s enviable ability to see and to capture anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Dominis himself once recalled, &#x201C;The great thing about working with LIFE was that I was given all the support and money and time, whatever was required, to do almost any kind of work I wanted to do, anywhere in the world. It was like having a grant, a Guggenheim grant, but permanently.&#x201D;</p>

<p>His longtime partner, Evelyn Floret, was at his side in their home when he died, and told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816035250/http://nation.time.com/2013/12/30/john-dominis-long-time-life-photographer-dies-at-92/#ixzz2p52K89Fs">TIME</a>, &#x201C;He really saw goodness in the world. He was able to capture it and impart it, and share, in his brilliance, the goodness underlying his talent.&#x201D;</p>
