<span class="photo_caption">Here&apos;s what Colbert would have looked like in Kanye&apos;s video</span></p>

<p>Around 10 p.m. last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072828/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> tweeted that he would be projecting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072828/http://laist.com/2016/06/25/kanye_famous_video.php">his controversial video</a> for &quot;Famous&quot; on walls around Manhattan and Brooklyn, just hours <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072828/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/lena_dunham_kanye_west_taylor_swift_reaction.php">after Lena Dunham</a> took his &quot;art&quot; to task, calling it &quot;sickening.&quot; </p>

<p>He had done something similar upon the release of his video for &quot;New Slaves&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072828/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/18/video_kanye_west_premiers_new_song.php">in 2013</a>. This time around, a screening time wasn&apos;t announced, just intersections:</p>

<p>A few fans seemed to turn out in the rain, or just happen upon the projections, which were rather small:</p>

<p>More entertaining was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072828/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a>&apos;s take on the video, which features 12 nude celebrities in bed together: Kim, Kanye, Caitlyn Jenner, Amber Rose, Ray J, Chris Brown, Rihanna, Donald Trump, George Bush, Bill Cosby, Anna Wintour, and Taylor Swift. Colbert inserts himself into the video, with a box of crackers, telling viewers: &quot;We all just had sex, all of us, at the same time! I wish you could smell it in here...&quot;</p>

<p>While Colbert had some fun with it, others are criticizing Kanye for the video&#x2014;Dunham called it &quot;one of the more disturbing &apos;artistic&apos; efforts in recent memory,&quot; which portrayed &quot;waxy bodies of famous women, twisted like they&apos;ve been drugged and chucked aside at a rage&quot; alongside the likes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072828/http://gothamist.com/tags/billcosby">Cosby</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072828/http://laist.com/tags/chrisbrown">Brown</a>.</p>
