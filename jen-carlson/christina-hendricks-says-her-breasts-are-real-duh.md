<p>It&apos;s nice to check in with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150121/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> cast since they&apos;re not going to be back on the air until next year. Recently we heard that January Jones (Betty Draper) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150121/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/23/that_time_zach_galifianakis_told_ja.php">sort of a bitch</a> in real life. In other not entirely shocking news, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150121/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinahendricks">Christina Hendricks</a> (Joan Holloway) has declared that her breasts are real. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150121/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20496644,00.html">recent interview</a>, she said, &quot;It&apos;s so bizarre that people are constantly asking if my breasts are real or fake. <strong>They&apos;re so obviously real that anyone who&apos;s ever seen or touched a breast would know.</strong>&quot; Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150121/http://www.tmz.com/2011/05/25/christina-hendricks-mad-men-breasts-boobs-chest-italy-photo-giant-massive/">TMZ is celebrating</a> the news with this paparazzi shot of Hendricks showing how she &quot;jammed them into a bathing suit and flaunted them at a resort in Italy yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>She wasn&apos;t always the belle of the ball, however, she recently told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150121/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/news-interviews/Christina-Hendricks-was-bullied-at-school/articleshow/8566191.cms">You Magazine</a>, &quot;I went to a very mean school and was bullied like crazy. I was a bit of a goth with purple hair... There was a long corridor with lockers on either side and kids would sit on top of them and spit on you. It was like something out of Lord of the Flies, but if I learned anything it was to remain true to myself and not to conform for the sake of it.&quot; And today, she&apos;s a &quot;Killer Queen,&quot; according to the fan who put this clip together, at least:</p>
