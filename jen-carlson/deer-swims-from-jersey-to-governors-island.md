										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709081947/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/01/deer_in_the_water.php">Yesterday</a> a deer was spotted in the water off Governors Island. Apparently the young buck was fleeing New Jersey, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709081947/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/12/01/2009-12-01_young_deer_swims_2000_yards_in_hudson_river_from_new_jersey_to_get_to_new_york.html">the Daily News</a>. The paper reports that he swam around 2,000 yards &#x2014; first spotted roaming downtown Jersey City, and then on the rocks off of Governor&apos;s Island.</p>

<p>More video can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709081947/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/091201-deer-stranded-at-governors-island">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709081947/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7147289">here</a>. A self-proclaimed deer aficionado told the News: &quot;Deer will swim to get away from danger, they&apos;ll swim to get to food.&quot; (They have migrated from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709081947/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/05/deer_god_no.php">NJ to Staten Island</a> and maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709081947/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/19/deer_xing_in_brooklyn.php">even Williamsburg</a>.) He added that this buck looked tired and frightened.</p>

<p>Around 1:30 p.m. yesterday, a police boat spotted the deer, shot it with a tranquilizer and brought him to a nature preserve on Staten Island. However, an expert says that deer have a tendency to die after being tranquilized. Sigh. We&apos;ll update when there&apos;s more news of the deer&apos;s current status.</p>
