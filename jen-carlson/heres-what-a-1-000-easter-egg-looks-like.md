<p>Because our pitiful Easter offerings of Cadbury Creme Eggs and Peeps have failed to lure Jesus back for a second coming, it&apos;s clearly time to create an egg <em>worthy</em> of the Son of God. Enter: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307011702/http://www.sugarandplumm.com/">Sugar and Plumm</a>, an Upper West Side bistro, bakery and chocolatier that has created a $1,000 chocolate egg for the holiday. If you don&apos;t want to be left coveting thy neighbor&apos;s egg centerpiece this Easter, you better send your assistant out to pick up a dozen. </p>

<p>The decadent egg contains dark, milk and white chocolates along with marzipan flowers, ladybugs, and what look like Angry Birds. It weighs in around 22-pounds, and stands 3-feet-tall. (Though, if you&apos;re in it for <em>just</em> the gluttony and not the magnificence, one office naysayer points out that for around $600 less you can procure 22-pounds of Lindt chocolate truffles and swim in them.) What&apos;s inside? Nothing, but what do you expect for a lousy one grand? If you really wanted to be baller you would have bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307011702/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/07/save_room_for_d.php">Serendipity&apos;s $25,000 Frrrozen [sic] Haute Chocolate.</a></p>
