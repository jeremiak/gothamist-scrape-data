<p>Last year we made our way to Rockefeller Plaza at like 7 a.m. so we could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030040922/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/09/fleetwood_mac_today_show.php">stand in sleepy awe of Fleetwood Mac</a> at one of those <em>Today</em> show concerts. It was actually a surprisingly chill scene (we&apos;re told they usually see crowds of 500 to 3,000), and you wouldn&apos;t expect that as you&apos;re standing amongst legends belting out your Favorite Songs Ever in the middle of New York City. </p>

<p>Anyway, we were sold on this being a pretty neat little &quot;only in New York&quot; event, especially (maybe <em>only</em>) if you just casually happen upon it. In fact, don&apos;t even cram into the audience in front of the stage, you can just stand around in the back of the stage and listen while you drink your coffee. We recommend doing it that way, you know, to people who live here. (For tourists and die-hards: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030040922/http://www.today.com/popculture/see-show-today-toyota-concert-series-faqs-8C11358051">go here</a>.)</p>
