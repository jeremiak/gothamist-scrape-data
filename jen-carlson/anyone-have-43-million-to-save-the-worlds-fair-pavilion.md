<p>Over the decades we&apos;ve watched the site of the 1964/1965 World&apos;s Fair slowly crumble into a heartbreaking but beautiful state of decay. One of the last remaining pieces (aside from the unisphere, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100606/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/23/75_years_ago_today_a_time_capsule_w.php">the time capsule</a>... and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100606/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/18/is_the_underground_home_at_the_worl.php">underground home</a>?) is the New York State Pavilion. <em>For now</em>. </p>

<p>Yesterday Parks Department officials told Queens residents that saving the beloved structure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100606/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/city-options-nys-pavilion-article-1.1521873">would cost at least $43 million</a> (you know who has that kind of dough? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100606/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/04/mayoral_hopeful_wants_to_bring_back.php">Johnny Cats</a>!) This would include the Tent of Tomorrow and its three <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100606/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/08/finding_the_196.php">observation towers</a> (which were all designed by Philip Johnson), and that money would only go towards preserving it all&#x2014;if we wanted to transform it into something new, it would cost about another $30 million.</p>

<p>Queens Parks Commissioner Dorothy Lewandowski says, &quot;They are in need of repair but they are not immediately falling down. So we have time to have some really reasonable dialogue.&quot; So expect this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100606/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/23/fate_of_worlds_fair_towers_to_be_de.php#photo-1">to go on forever</a>... And yes, The Pavilion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100606/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/16/landmarks.php">in 2009</a>.</p>
