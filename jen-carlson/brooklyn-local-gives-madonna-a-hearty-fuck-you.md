<p>Would you recognize this lady if you saw her walking down the street? One Brooklyn local didn&apos;t realize the woman he was yelling at yesterday was Madonna, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130309040017/http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/09/i-yelled-at-madonna-today-and-i-didnt.html">Althouse</a> has the whole story, but here&apos;s an excerpt:</p>

<p>    </p><blockquote>She&apos;s apparently directing a film and was shooting right in front of my house in Brooklyn on Wednesday. I came outside to do my morning walk and there were crowds of people all over the place. I walked a few feet down my block and a chick with a headset held up her arm and said &quot;You have to cross the street, sir!&quot; I replied: &quot;I don&apos;t have to do anything. This is my neighborhood, and a public sidewalk, and I&apos;ll go where I please!&quot;<p></p>

<p>    <strong>I pushed past and came upon a haggard woman in sunglasses, a baseball cap and a scarf printed with a stylized skull pattern holding a clipboard</strong> and looking into a hand-held monitor along with a couple of other people. Being a veteran of the terrible world of film production, I recognized that this woman was probably the director. I paused as I passed and said to her: &quot;You need to inform your brain-dead P.A.s that they need to treat us residents a little better, honey.&quot; She looked at me, expressionless behind her sunglasses for a moment before one of the men with her said &quot;Move along, sir.&quot; I replied &quot;a hearty fuck you to both of you&quot; and I walked onward.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The movie is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130309040017/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536048/fullcredits"><em>W.E.</em></a> (about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130309040017/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10521347">New Yorker&apos;s obsession</a> with King Edward&apos;s decision to abdicate the throne and marry Wallis Simpson), and is due out next year. Other places Madonna hasn&apos;t been recognized in New York City lately: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130309040017/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/08/spotted_subway-truck_hybrid.php">the subway</a>.</p>
