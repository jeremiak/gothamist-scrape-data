</div></div><p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613195103/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/12/bambu.php">the dead of winter</a> we mentioned that the Metropolitan Museum of Art would be adding big bunches of bamboo to their rooftop garden this summer, in an installation called &#x201C;Big Bamb&#xFA;&#x201D; by Doug and Mike Starn. The site-specific piece will be unveiled for all to see on the 27th (and will remain on the roof through Halloween), but here&apos;s a look at the Starn&apos;s putting it all together. One of them told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613195103/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/arts/design/23bambu.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> that at first the ambitious piece was vertigo-inducing, &quot;but we got over it as we started building.&#x201D; Still, looks dangerous!</p>
