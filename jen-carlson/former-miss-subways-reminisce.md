The pageant ran from 1941 to 1977, and was revived for just one year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522165605/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/nyregion/26subway.html?_r=1">in 2004</a> (under Ms. Subways). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522165605/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/there-she-is-from-a-trailblazing-beauty-pageant/">CityRoom</a> looks at the groundbreaking nature of the organization, which crowned a Brooklyn College student as its first black winner in 1948 (she was even honored by Thurgood Marshall). The site notes that &quot;Some historians point to Miss Subways as an important&#x2014;though mostly symbolic&#x2014;turning point for racial integration. The photograph of Miss Subways was on thousands of subway cars each month, and black activists believed that image of a black woman would send a powerful media message.&quot; Yesterday, the ladies talked about the current state of the subways, one declaring &quot;The subway system is still a mess, and the MTA has a lot of nerve to want more money.&quot; Another winner from the &apos;40s told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522165605/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04222009/news/regionalnews/miss_subways_nostalgia_trip_165611.htm">the NY Post</a> that back in her day &quot;It cost a nickel to ride the subway or get a cup of coffee.&quot;</p>
