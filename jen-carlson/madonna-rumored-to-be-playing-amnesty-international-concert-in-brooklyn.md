<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330032955/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/21/pussy_riot_brooklyn.php">it was announced</a> that the massive Amnesty International concert at Barclays Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330032955/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Feb5Concert/">on February 5th</a> will feature two members of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330032955/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/08/a_timeline_of_the_russian_punk_band.php">Pussy Riot</a>, who were just released from Russian prison camps last month. The concert is a return to the Amnesty concerts of the 1980s and &apos;90s (they stopped in 1998), and in that spirit some legendary talent has been expected to return with it&#x2014;we now have it on good authority that Madonna has been confirmed to play at the show. </p>

<p>Madonna was outspoken about her support of Pussy Riot while touring in 2012:</p>

<p>She also issued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330032955/http://www.madonna.com/news/title/temp">this call to action</a> at the time: &quot;I protest the conviction and sentencing of Pussy Riot to a penal colony for two years for a 40 second performance extolling their political opinions. Even if one disagrees with the location or how they chose to express themselves, the sentence is too harsh and in fact is inhumane. I call on all those who love freedom to condemn this unjust punishment. I urge artists around the world to speak up in protest against this travesty. They&apos;ve spent enough time in jail. I call on ALL of Russia to let Pussy Riot go free.&quot;</p>

<p>Organizers have promised big announcements up until the date of the show, so expect more of these surprises in the next week.</p>
