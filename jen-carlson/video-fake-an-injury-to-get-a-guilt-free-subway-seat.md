<p>Have you ever faked a cough so that someone wouldn&apos;t sit next to you on the subway or bus? Then you probably have the right selfish mentality and exceptional level of laziness for something like the Commuter Cast. The portable cast can be slipped on with ease and allows you to sit guilt-free as grandmothers and pregnant women squeeze on to the standing-room only subway. It&apos;s a fake product... until someone actually uses it. </p>
