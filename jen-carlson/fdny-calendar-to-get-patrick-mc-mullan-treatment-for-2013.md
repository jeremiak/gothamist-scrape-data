</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s always <em>a lot more fun</em> to hear from our friendly neighborhood FDNY rep with some info about their yearly calendar, over, say, more tragic things. So we were pretty excited when some new 2013 calendar information showed up in our inbox. Here&apos;s the scoop: next year&apos;s calendar will be shot by nightlife and celeb photographer Patrick McMullan! He befriended the FDNY a few years ago, and says, &quot;It&apos;s an honor for me to photograph the 2013 FDNY Firefighter&apos;s Calendar of Heroes in our beloved city.&quot; And according to our sources, &quot;Patrick plans to make this calendar the hottest so far.&quot;</p>

<p>A casting call notice was sent out to the field last week, so the firefighters haven&apos;t been chosen yet. But we&apos;ll do our best to follow this important process! In the meantime, here&apos;s a little look back at this year&apos;s calendar, featuring Mr. March, Mr. September, and Mr. November.</p>

<p>And this isn&apos;t <em>all</em> about staring at some of the bravest abs in the city, money raised from the calendar goes to the department&apos;s fire safety education efforts.</p>
