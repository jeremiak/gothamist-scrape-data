<p>You know how in <em>Mad Men</em> people take lunch hours (and smoke in their offices, and have whiskey for breakfast)? Well it&apos;s time to reclaim that mid-century mentality! Because currently the average worker only takes 20 minute lunch breaks, and those are taken at their desk (and they aren&apos;t even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092255/http://www.archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=3526&amp;PagePosition=3">3-martini lunches</a>). Seriously, Don Draper would never be caught <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092255/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbNGBBgrIfU&amp;feature=player_embedded">saying nonsense like this</a>.</p>

<p>So now there&apos;s some nationwide movement called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092255/http://theenergyproject.com/takebackyourlunch">Take Back Your Lunch</a>, and today it will take over Madison Square Park between noon and 2 p.m. Lunchers should meet at the park area closest to Madison Avenue between 24th and 25th streets to take part&#x2014;this will happen every Wednesday throughout the summer (but in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092255/http://www.meetup.com/Take-Back-Your-Lunch/">different locations</a>). Today there will also be a Wildwood BBQ lunchbox special, which includes a pulled pork, beef or chicken sandwich with vinegar chips, coleslaw and pickles, sweet tea or iced tea, and a Fluffernutter S&apos;more&#x2014;all for $15. (Sounds like this doesn&apos;t exactly fit with the campaign to not have a heart attack by age 45).</p>
