										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429135325/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2008/07/22/2008-07-22_flasher_of_teen_sparks_fear_in_heart_of_.html">The Daily News</a> exposes a flasher in Park Slope, or at least points out that there&apos;s one prowling the streets. That&apos;s right, a sexual predator is creepily stalking stroller central. The paper reports that a &quot;man exposed himself to a 14-year-old girl after pushing his way into her apartment building two weeks ago,&quot; saying he had something to show her as he chased her up the stairs. The man fled when the teen&apos;s family heard what was going on in the stairwell and came out of their apartment. The NYPD confirmed the 5:30 p.m. incident, &quot;adding that 78th Precinct detectives are on the case looking for the flasher, described as in his early to late teens, wearing black shorts, a gray T-shirt and a blue hat.&quot; Meanwhile, the poor 14-year-old victim, who had just moved with her family from their native South Africa, is scared to walk on her own anymore.</p>
