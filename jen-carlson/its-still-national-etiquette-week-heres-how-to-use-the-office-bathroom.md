And now, to close it out, here are some tips on how to use your office bathroom. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516193951/http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/bathroom-etiquette">Women&apos;s Health</a> provided some tips on this, and we&apos;ve included some of those with some of our own below. It&apos;s absurd that grown adults need to be reminded of these things, but we&apos;ve seen enough passive-aggressive notes to prove that some office mates just don&apos;t get it.<br>
</p><ul><li>Clean up after yourself. (Game: try not to leave behind any trace of your bodily fluids!)<br>
</li><li>Always flush the toilet.<br>
</li><li>If there are several open stalls, try to choose one that&apos;s not right directly next to one someone else is using.<br>
</li><li>Don&apos;t hang out and chat in the bathroom.<br>
</li><li>Did you drop a paper towel or toilet paper on the floor? Pick it up and throw it in the trash.<br>
</li><li>Are you a man in the ladies room? <em>Okay</em>, but put the seat down please.<br>
</li><li>Hey, there&apos;s your coworker next to you. Look around, are you in a bathroom standing at a urinal? Then be quiet.<br>
</li><li>And it wouldn&apos;t kill you to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516193951/http://blag.xkcd.com/2009/09/02/urinal-protocol-vulnerability/">International Choice of Urinal Protocol</a>, men.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>And of course, always wash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516193951/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMkcn0Vh-4g">your leather-gloved hands</a> after attempting to strangle a coworker.</p>
