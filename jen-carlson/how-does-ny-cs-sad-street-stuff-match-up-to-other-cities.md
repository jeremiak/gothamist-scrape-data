<p>New York City-based author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110405034944/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/20/sloane_crosley.php">Sloane Crosley</a> and her San Francisco-based pal Greg recently started a blog to document all the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110405034944/http://sadstuffonthestreet.com/">Sad Stuff</a>&quot; they spot on the street in their respective cities. While pitting West Coast and East Coast street trash against each other would have made for a great new way for the cities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110405034944/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/travel-tips-and-articles/76423#sg_wrapper#sg_wrapper">to compete</a>, they quickly opened it up for contributions... making it the most comprehensive visual record of things found on the street worldwide.
