<p>Jeff Koons could be bringing a full-size replica 1943 Baldwin 2900 steam locomotive to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005122/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">the High Line</a>&#x2014;which is perfectly fitting since the park used to be an elevated rail line. The train won&apos;t be fixed on to where the remaining tracks are, however, instead it will be hoisted above the park on a crane. Which sounds very safe indeed! Especially with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005122/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/18/is_the_high_line_cursed.php">those old ghosts</a> running around the place, eager to get their hands on one of their ol&apos; means of transport.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005122/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/high-line-may-mix-past-with-koonss-vision/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">CityRoom notes</a> that the Friends of the High Line have been wanting to highlight the park&#x2019;s rail history, declaring, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had a crush on the &#x2018;Train&#x2019; for a while now. To me, it looks very industrial and sculptural. The craftsmanship that went into these industrial engines is quite beautiful.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The sculpture actually isn&apos;t fabricated yet, but will be constructed of steel and carbon fiber, weighing at around several tons. It would also include spinning wheels, a blowing horn, and steam! To get this thing going full speed ahead, there&apos;s the matter of the $25 million or so needed to fund it. The High Line hopes to secure a donor to sponsor the piece, &quot;which could either hang permanently or for several years.&quot;</p>

<p>The piece could also end up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005122/http://arrestedmotion.com/2009/04/jeff-koons-lacma-train-crane-project/">at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a>, but the High Line is cool with sharing&#x2014;&#x201C;There&#x2019;s some symmetry in this sort of transcontinental rail idea.&quot;</p>
