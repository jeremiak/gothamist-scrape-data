<p>According to a new report, graffiti is up 305% in the Ridgewood, Glendale and Middle Village neighborhoods in Queens. (If it were <em>street art</em> this may seal the deal on Ridgewood&apos;s rise to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014153425/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/12/local_paper_declares_next_big_neigh.php">the next &quot;it&quot; neighborhood</a>! Baby steps.) According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014153425/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/17/2011-02-17_can_it_kids_ridgewood_glendale_top_the_city_for_graffiti_complaints_despite_lowe.html">the Daily News</a>, spray paint complaints were down in the five boroughs last year, but police in the 104th Precinct received 800 graffiti complaints, which is up 305% from the 262 of 2009. However, this may have to do with the fact that last year the annual budget for a graffiti removal program in Ridgewood was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014153425/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/11/graffiti-to-last-longer-in-ridgewood/">drastically reduced</a>.</p>

<p>The owner of Myrtle Discount Auto Parts in Ridgewood told the paper a &quot;lowlife&quot; recently tagged his storefront with the letters RIP; he said, &quot;I complained, and they got [him]. He shouldn&apos;t be doing this. He lives in the neighborhood. We pay taxes. We want to have a nice life here.&quot;</p>

<p>City Council member and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014153425/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/13/graffiti_artist.php">hater of graffiti</a>, Peter Vallone Jr., says he believes &quot;graffiti is up&quot; even outside of his borough of Queens, noting, &quot;There are less police on the streets. When vandals see that, they become emboldened, and it leads to other crimes.&quot;</p>

<p>The rest of the city saw a 3% decline in graffiti complaints&#x2014;with 9,850 overall, down from 10,162 in 2009. (Though some neighborhoods, like Chinatown and Coney Island, saw an upswing in the visual vandalism.)</p>
