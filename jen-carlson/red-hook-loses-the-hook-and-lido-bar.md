Bar manager Molly Franklin even held strong that Lido Bar would remain open and that this was nothing more than &quot;bar gossip.&quot; </p>

<p>Earlier this week we received an email from one of the &quot;insiders&quot; stating &quot;Lido actually *is* closing in the next couple weeks (next Friday?). Sounds like your information was better than mine/ours.&quot; It&apos;s a shame that some of the neighborhood mainstays are shutting down, an email to Franklin wasn&apos;t immediately returned today but when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/24/molly_franklin.php">we interviewed</a> her she mentioned the continuous struggle of being a small business in the &apos;hood: </p>

<p>&quot;The toughest part for the businesses along Columbia Street is the never ending road work. We went from being a two-way street to a one-way until the indeterminate end of the project, and during the summer of 2006, the entire street was effectively shut down. You can&apos;t fight city hall, and doing so as a small business is nearly impossible. Infrastructure changes are vital to the expansion of the neighborhood, but it is being done to encourage growth opportunities for big companies and developers.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/10/the_hook_not_to.html">BrooklynVegan</a> reported on another sad loss for the area which we also mentioned in August, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://www.thehookmusic.com/">The Hook</a>. We just saw Broken Social Scene play the intimate venue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/29/broken_social_s.php">last year</a>, a few months before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/25/this_just_in_st.php">Styx took the stage</a>! The owner has now stated that there will be one final party on October 27th, BV notes &quot;strangely - it will be a Halloween party called &apos;The Death of Astroland&apos; - &apos;a laying rest of the Coney Island we all once knew&apos;. So basically the final party at the Red Hook venue will be in honor of the closing of Astroland in Coney Island.&quot; Of course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/24/breaking_one_mo.php">yesterday</a> it was reported that Astroland will be open for another season. Red Hook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/20/last_weekend_of.php">can&apos;t seem to catch a break</a> lately, maybe if they just got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922141708/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/TROLLEYS/redhook/redhook.html">those trolleys up and running again</a>...</p>
