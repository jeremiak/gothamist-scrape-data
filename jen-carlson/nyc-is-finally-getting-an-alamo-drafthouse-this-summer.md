<p>For years NYC has been promised an Alamo Drafthouse, and now its first is set to open this summer. Good news for those who want the unique movie-going experience but don&apos;t want to go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108004933/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/02/alamo_drafthouse_coming_to_yonkers.php">Yonkers</a>. First announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108004933/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/03/alamo_drafthouse_coming_to_brooklyn.php">four years ago</a>, the movie theater&#x2014;known for their no talking/texting ads&#x2014;will open in Downtown Brooklyn (as long as plans don&apos;t fall apart like they did for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108004933/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/alamo_drafthouse_no_longer_coming_t.php">their UWS outpost</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108004933/https://drafthouse.com/national/theater/downtown-brooklyn">The Austin-based company</a> announced the news today, noting that construction at their 445 Gold Street location is almost complete. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108004933/http://www.indiewire.com/article/alamo-drafthouse-brooklyn-location-new-york-city--summer-2016-20160405">to IndieWire</a>, they&apos;re promising &quot;a movie-lover&apos;s paradise featuring seven screens celebrating all forms of cinema... a diverse programming slate blending the best arthouse and independent releases with Hollywood&#x2019;s biggest blockbusters.&quot; Tim League, founder of the Drafthouse, says that they&apos;ll also have some independent programming that showcases the city. </p>

<p>There will be plenty of theme nights, movies both new and old (digital and 35mm), snacks, booze, burgers, and shaming of anyone who tries to pick up their phone during a feature. </p>

<p>The theater will be located right by Brooklyn&apos;s MetroTech and Borough Hall, an area severely lacking in quality cinemas.  </p>
