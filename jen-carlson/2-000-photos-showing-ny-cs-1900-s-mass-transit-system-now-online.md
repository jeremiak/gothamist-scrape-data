	<p>The Museum of the City of New York has an incredible archive of old photos of the city, and they&apos;ve just uploaded almost 2,000 more documenting the Manhattan Railway Company, who operated the Second, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Avenue elevated train lines. They note, &quot;In 1899 the company began building seven substations and one powerhouse to electrify its steam-powered trains. The photographs span 1900-1905 and document the stages of the modernization project.&quot;</p>

<p>During its prime, the system moved a million passengers a day along 102 miles of track and with 334 steam locomotives. For much more on the company, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104233/http://www.amazon.com/Frank-Hain-Manhattan-Railway-Company/dp/0786464054"><em>Frank K. Hain and the Manhattan Railway Company: The Elevated Railway, 1875-1903</em></a>, which chronicles the elevated railway, and Hain, who ran it.</p>
