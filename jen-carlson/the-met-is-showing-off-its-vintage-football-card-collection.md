<p>The cards come from their Jefferson R. Burdick Collection of printed ephemera, and boasts around 150 football cards printed between 1894 and 1959. They&apos;re pairing those up with some old photographs, and a Varsity football sweater from The Costume Institute. From their announcement:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Highlights include football cards from 1894 by the tobacco company Mayo&#x2014;the first such cards to be produced. The rare John Dunlop (Harvard) card will be shown, along with other early collegiate standouts. The exhibition will also feature Hall of Famers such as coach Knute Rockne, Red Grange and his teammate the powerhouse Bronko Nagurski, Jim Thorpe, and Sid Luckman; New York icons such as Frank Gifford, Tom Landry, Charlie Conerly, and Emlen Tunnell; and lesser-known players, coaches, and owners. Another highlight will be two cards depicting Kenny Washington. As a student at UCLA, Washington played alongside Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in professional baseball in 1945. The following year, Washington himself became the first African American to sign a contract with a National Football League team after integrated teams were reinstated.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The later cards are part of the Bazooka Chewing Gum series, from 1959, and include Johnny Unitas, who you know from &#x201C;the greatest game ever played.&#x201D;</p>
