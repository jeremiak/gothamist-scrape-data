</div></div>					<p>While the bagel hasn&apos;t really entered the disturbing culinary school of thought that brought you the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021919/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/krispy_kreme_donuts_take_kfc_double.php">Krispy Kreme Double Down</a>, there&apos;s a new Twitter in town dedicated to one-off bad bagel orders, fittingly titled: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021919/http://twitter.com/badbadbagel">Bad Bad Bagel</a>&#x2014;but can one <em>really</em> make a bad decision when ordering a bagel? Well, it <em>was</em> inspired by a recently overheard (and questionable) order of whitefish on cinnamon raisin&#x2014;but that could be a thing people like, no? In the name of research, we took to the local bagel shop and procured a variety of (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021919/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/24/bagel_tax.php">unsliced</a>!) bagels and cream cheese flavors, then paired them up with toppings like: tomato, radish, chocolate sprinkles, banana and Nutella. Without getting into the nauseating details, the definitive outcome is that you <em>can</em> do wrong when topping a bagel... but you can do <em>no wrong</em> when Nutella is involved. </p>

<p>What do you crave when it comes to bagel toppings? And don&apos;t forget to contribute to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021919/http://twitter.com/badbadbagel">Bad Bad Bagel Twitter</a> when you overhear a strange combo.</p>
