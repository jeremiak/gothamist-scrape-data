title: Video: Musician Recreates 15 TV Theme Songs In 2 Minutes
---

<p>We were skeptical at first when this was sent to us, but New York-based musician Daniel Koren and his friends managed to recreate 15 television theme songs while re-enacting the openings of those television shows <em>without</em> making it unbearably cheesy. And in less than two minutes! You&apos;ll get NYC shows like <em>Friends</em> and <em>30 Rock</em>, and also callbacks to classics like <em>Dawson&apos;s Creek</em>, <em>Cheers</em>, <em>Married With Children</em>, and the original <em>90210</em>. But our favorite is probably the <em>Dexter</em> segment. What&apos;s missing though?</p>
