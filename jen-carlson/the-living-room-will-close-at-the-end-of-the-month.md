<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061230/http://www.livingroomny.com/">the Living Room</a> reopened in Williamsburg after it was priced out of its longtime digs on Ludlow Street in Manhattan. Bad move! Williamsburg is more expensive than the Lower East Side now, and most of the new moneyed residents don&apos;t want no old time folk club. So it&apos;s sadly not a surprise to hear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061230/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/living_room_may_reopen_in_williamsb.php">this old familiar tune</a>: the venue is closing. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061230/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/the-living-room-to-close-at-the-end-of-december/?_r=2">the NY Times</a>, the &quot;no-frills nightclub that gave an early start to Norah Jones... and for almost 18 years has hosted countless singer-songwriters... will close at the end of December.&quot; The announcement came from owners Steve Rosenthal and Jennifer Gilson, who also told the paper that their recording studio in SoHo, the Magic Shop (where David Bowie and Lou Reed have recorded) may close, too.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061230/https://www.facebook.com/livingroomny/posts/10153734566523810">their Facebook page</a>, the owners posted this message:</p>

<blockquote>I have sad news. The Living Room is closing at the end of December. It seems like we just opened a minute ago. Thanks so much to all the great bands that played here and gave us many memorable nights. There&#x2019;s still time for you to stop by and see a show in this gorgeous room and visit our always awesome staff. We wish you all the best and I hope our paths cross again! Please keep supporting live music at your local venues.</blockquote>

<p>The venue first opened in Manhattan in 1998 on Allen and Stanton, before moving to its 2nd home on Ludlow Street. It&apos;s been operating out of a spacious spot (with a sweet roof deck) on Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg since last October.</p>
