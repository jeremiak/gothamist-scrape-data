The Open Space Alliance (OSA) and JellyNYC have been sparring all season over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130755/http://gothamist.com/tags/poolparties">Pool Parties</a> held on the Williamsburg waterfront, and now the last show of the summer has been canceled. JellyNYC started the parties five years ago at McCarren Park Pool, and more recently the OSA (which has a lot of influential board members) has been taking control. Following the publication of an interview that Jelly co-founder Sarah Hooper did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130755/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/13/pool_parties_expensive_depressing_f.php">with NPR</a>, the OSA folk released a fightin&apos; words filled press release through their lawyer (also an OSA board member) last night. It says, in part:<p></p>

<p>&quot;We are deeply disappointed that the August 29th show has been canceled due to the continuing unmet financial obligations of the event&apos;s promoter, Jelly. OSA can no longer cover both the costs of putting on these events&#x2014;equipment, labor, and payments to the State for use of their park&#x2014;and Jelly&apos;s substantial debt.  Our primary concern is improving open space in North Brooklyn, and we will not endanger our mission by putting the finances and reputation of our organization at risk by allowing Jelly to slide on its financial obligations.&quot;</p>

<p>The full release is after the jump, where the organization also apologizes &quot;to the two artists JellyNYC confirmed with the venue for 8/29, Delorean and Dominique Young Unique.&quot; The August 22nd show will go on as planned, and it&apos;s looking like this will be the last of the Pool Parties as we know them&#x2014;though they really haven&apos;t been the same ever since moving over to the East River Police State Park. Jelly has yet to issue a statement of their own on the matter, but we&apos;ll update when they do. One source has told us that the OSA had been trying to bankrupt Jelly with &quot;made-up&quot; fees and by taking over concessions&#x2014;if true, expect to hear about that, because something tells us the gloves are off!</p>
