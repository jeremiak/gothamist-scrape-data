Playing every instrument on the atmospherock avant-pop album, he also recruited some friends to help along the way, such as the Dirty Projectors&#x2019; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195847/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/27/dirty_projector.php">Dave Longstreth</a>. On the periphery you can hear Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Will Oldham -- but the modern day folkie has a sound all his own, and lucky us, he&apos;s playing two shows in New York this week. Catch him this Friday at Silent Barn and Saturday at Cake Shop.</em></p><em>

<p><strong>First thing&apos;s first, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
First things first.  We&apos;re hung over right now in a cafe in chilly Baltimore afternoon. At this minute there is a crazy-ish man talking very loudly and non-stop to everybody. Every thought that pops in his head:  &quot;It tastes good, chocolate cake.  I&apos;m in a good mood today. You&apos;re a very beautiful woman.  You&apos;re like a moon-star.  That is a pink sweater.  Untouchables.  That&apos;s a good movie.  I love that. Untouchables&quot;</p>

<p>Currently there are four of us in Phosphorescent.  We&apos;ve been on the road for about a month.  We were kicked out of the Washington DC club last night for drunken-ness and rowdy but gentle mayhem.  The show was great though.  Every show on this tour has been like that.  We are the best band in America right now.  We can prove it.</p>

<p><strong>You moved from Georgia to Brooklyn, has that move been a good one so far? What differences have you noticed in the music scene/community?</strong><br>
I lived in Athens, Georgia.  I&apos;ve been in Brooklyn for about a year now.  Living out in Bed-Stuy.  I love it here.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think the move will seep into your music?</strong><br>
Yes!  Everything always does.</p>

<p><strong>You recently got a great review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195847/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/46528-pride">on Pitchfork</a>, is this a website you follow? Do you think the review will effect you at all?</strong><br>
Sure I am aware of Pitchfork and I am aware of their influence.  The review won&apos;t effect me personally or artistically but I am glad of anything that brings more attention to the new album, Pride.   It&apos;s a great record.  It&apos;s easily the best record released this year and probably of the last ten years.  I haven&apos;t heard anything that comes close.</p>
