</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206152502/http://gothamist.com/2004/08/23/urbane_jungle.php">Every summer</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206152502/http://ps1.org/yap/">PS 1</a> in Long Island City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206152502/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/25/ps_1_debuts_pole_dance_young_archit.php">changes the appearance</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206152502/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/29/ps_1s_new_courtyard_installation_af.php?gallery0Pic=5#gallery">of its courtyard</a>, and this year&apos;s makeover has just been unveiled. The winning submission for MoMA PS1&apos;s Young Architects Program is &quot;Holding Pattern,&quot; by NY architecture firm Interboro Partners. Partner Tobias Armborst talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206152502/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/moma-ps1s-young-architects-program-announces-winner/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Arts Beat</a> about the design, saying, &#x201C;A lot of the things are commonsensical&quot;&#x2014;the design also has an interest in recycling and sustainability.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206152502/http://www.interboropartners.net/2011/holding-pattern/">firm&apos;s website</a> notes the challenge of designing around an irregular seven-sided polygon (the shape of the courtyard), and says they&apos;ve stringed &quot;ropes from holes in MoMA PS1&apos;s concrete wall to the parapet across the courtyard. In the same way that Hugh Ferris reveals the potential of New York City&apos;s 1916 zoning code by drawing the theoretical building envelope, we reveal the very odd, idiosyncratic space of the courtyard and simultaneously create an inexpensive and column-free space for the activity below. From the ground, the experience is of a soaring hyperboloid surface.&quot; They&apos;ve brought in &quot;an eclectic collection of objects&#x2014;including benches, mirrors, ping-pong tables, and flood lights,&quot; as well. </p>

<p>There doesn&apos;t seem to be a lot of <em>shade</em>, but it&apos;s going to be so hot and crowded during the summer&apos;s Warm Up series that you probably won&apos;t even notice! On that note, someone should really incorporate some beer-dispensing hoses in the next design.</p>
