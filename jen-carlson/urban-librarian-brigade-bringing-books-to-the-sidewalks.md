<p>Two literary-minded Brooklynites have teamed up to bring the printed page to the street. Lauren Comito and Christian Zabriskie have started a movement called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209124849/http://urbanlibrariansunite.org/">Urban Librarians Unite</a>, a library advocacy<br>
organization that will train and dispatch a Volunteer Library Brigade across the city. Before hitting their beats, each volunteer will receive training in reference services, public service, and storytime... but not dancing: </p>

<p>Zabriskie tells us that the program hasn&apos;t rolled out yet, and they&apos;ll first be offering free training on Saturday, April 13th from noon to 5 p.m. in Greenpoint (they ask that you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209124849/http://urbanlibrariansunite.org/">contact them</a> for further details). Until then, they&apos;re working on &quot;getting the carts modified for street use.&quot; Once that all happens, in about one month, the plan is to have the librarians out on the street on weekends from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., hitting various spots around the city&#x2014;&quot;We will be hitting neighborhoods all over the city,&quot; Zabriskie told us in an email this week, &quot;We are absolutely going to do some high traffic areas like Times Square, Central Park, farmers markets, Grand Army Plaza, and the Staten Island Ferry.&quot;</p>

<p>What can you expect to find on the carts? You won&apos;t find any iPads or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209124849/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/video_nyers_still_enjoying_constitu.php">porn</a> like in regular libraries, they&apos;ll be offering up old school print editions of a variety of books (which were both purchased and donated)&#x2014;everything from subway maps to reference books to NYC-centric architecture and local history books. They&apos;ll also offer &quot;bags of books for the kids.&quot; And fine, it&apos;s not all old school print, they will be offering WiFi, and a virtual library where you can download books for free.</p>
