Yet another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131620/http://gothamist.com/tags/minigolf">mini golf course</a> has popped up in New York. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131620/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/science/16tier.html?_r=1">The NY Times</a> reports on Rocket Park, located in Flushing Meadows. Part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131620/http://www.nyhallsci.org/">the Hall of Science</a>, it fittingly combines fun with learning, with a design that&apos;s meant to teach astrophysics. The paper describes the course, saying &quot;you start your nine-hole mission by putting the ball through a &apos;launch window&apos; and achieving the proper &apos;escape velocity.&apos; Then you send the ball around a loop-de-loop and learn all about weightless astronauts, after which you learn about avoiding debris in space and finding the right angle for geosynchronous orbit.&quot; Yep, it&apos;s that easy...so long as the kids pay attention to more than just getting the ball in the hole. Maybe there should be a pop quiz after each round? For now, learn more about the course itself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131620/http://www.nyscience.org/pressroom/article/rpmg">here</a>.</p>
