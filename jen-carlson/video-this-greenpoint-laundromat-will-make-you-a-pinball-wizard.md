<p>There was a time in New York City when pinball was illegal, and NYC Police Commissioner William O&apos;Brien went around smashing machines. This dark time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150719175240/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/08/did_you_know_pinball_was_illegal_in.php">lasted over three decades</a>, but in the end the pinball machine won. Even if it didn&apos;t, we&apos;d like to believe that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150719175240/https://www.facebook.com/SunshineLaundromat">Sunshine Laundromat</a> would still exist today as some sort of prohibition pinball speakeasy. </p>

<p>The Greenpoint laundromat&#x2014;located at 860 Manhattan Avenue&#x2014;has around ten machines right now, set up right in the same room where you are laundering your clothes, so bring <em>lots</em> of quarters.</p>

<p>During the NYC Marathon over the weekend, the joint even hosted a Pinball Marathon&#x2014;check it out below, courtesy of Citizen Productions:</p>
