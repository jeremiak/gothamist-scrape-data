It seems a week doesn&apos;t go by without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150330/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/30/venues_1.php">more news of venues closing</a>. This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150330/http://www.therealdeal.net/breaking_news/2007/04/02/1175539525.php">The Real Deal reports</a> that the 27,000-square-foot building that houses the roughly 11,000 square foot Knitting Factory, is up for sale. The sale, which includes the venue and 18 decontrolled residential loft apartments, is expected to go for $15 million or more. 

</p><p>With last years announcement of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150330/http://therealestate.observer.com/2006/01/the-knitting-factory-musics-new-death-star.html">Knitting Factories opening up all over the country</a> (maybe even Boise, Idaho!), it&apos;s sad to hear the venue may have to shut its New York doors, which have been opened for the past 13 years at their current location. If the new owners want to keep the venue, and don&apos;t raise the rent too much, they&apos;ll be able to stay.</p>

<p>Jared Hoffman (president and CEO of Knitting Factory Entertainment) said the club, which originally opened 20 years ago on East Houston Street, &#x201C;has always been a resilient and tenacious cultural icon.&#x201D; Their plan is to keep going even if these particular doors shut. We&apos;ve held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150330/http://www.gothamist.com/2004/11/13/your_tuesday_night_plans_movable_hype.php">nearly three years</a> of our Movable Hype concert series there, and hope they get to keep their space on Leonard Street - especially after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150330/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/01/26/gothamists_week_2.php">their latest makeover</a>.</p>
