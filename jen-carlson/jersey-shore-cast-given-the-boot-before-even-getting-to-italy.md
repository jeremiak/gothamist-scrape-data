<span class="photo_caption">One of the many things the cast is banned from doing while in Italy: hot-tubbing with David.</span></p>

<p>Is Italy in defense mode as the threat of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144855/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> cast infiltrating the country gets more and more real? Their latest <em>situation</em> is two-fold. First, permits have been yanked from shoots planned at both Uffizi gallery and Palazzo Vecchio. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144855/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/05/jersey-shore-italy-postponed">RadarOnline</a>, the boys were all filming their airport arrival scenes (The Situation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144855/http://twitter.com/#!/ItsTheSituation/status/67094891804635137">even warned</a>: &quot;Watch Out Italy!&quot; via Twitter) when they were stopped in their tracks and told to &quot;hang back.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144855/http://www.tmz.com/2011/05/09/jersey-shore-cast-delay-shooting-florence-italian-president-permits-shut-down/">TMZ</a> is now reporting that they&apos;re simply staying put because the President of Italy is coming to Florence, which would create too much chaos for shoots, so they&apos;re only hanging back until he leaves later this week.</p>

<p>Previously, Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi delivered a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144855/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/italy_lays_down_the_law_for_jersey.php">list of rules</a> the cast had to follow while on his turf (including <em>no drinking</em> during filming!), and a local university has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/05/italian_youths_warned_of_jersey_sho.php">warned students</a> to stay away from the cast when they&apos;re in town. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is still waging his war against the show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144855/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-06/christie-says-jersey-shore-cast-of-new-yorkers-should-get-out-of-state.html">recently saying</a> during an interview, &#x201C;They parachute these people onto the Jersey Shore and try to make America think these are Jersey people, and they&#x2019;re not. They&#x2019;re New Yorkers. They ought to take them out to Montauk, all the way out on the point, and leave them there. And don&#x2019;t drop bread crumbs, so they can&#x2019;t find their way back.&#x201D; (Someone needs to tell Christie that two cast members are definitely from New Jersey.)</p>
