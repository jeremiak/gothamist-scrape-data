<p>What he definitely found is the elusive street artist&apos;s warehouse, which he&apos;s using while in town for his open-air <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230193232/http://gothamist.com/tags/betteroutthanin">month-long residency</a>. It&apos;s located in Red Hook and is at the very least housing all of his trucks&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230193232/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/stuffed_animal_truck_is_the_work_of.php#photo-1">Sirens of the Lambs</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230193232/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/photos_video_banksys_enchanting_mob.php">waterfall truck</a> were both there. But was Banksy really amongst the crew he spotted?</p>

<p>He tells us he &quot;walked up and asked the guys a few questions. They didn&apos;t wanna talk to me just said they don&apos;t know anything. The guy on top was directing the guys what to do... Had an English accent. I frequent the warehouse once a week [and] asked the guys I know there&#x2014;they said [Banksy&apos;s crew] had been there everyday.&quot; He believes the man on top of the truck in the hat is Banksy, but according to our in-house expert Jake Dobkin those guys on top of the truck are most certainly not Banksy. <em>However</em>, maybe that guy down on the ground is&#x2014;he seems to match up with the previous <em>alleged</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230193232/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1034538/Graffiti-artist-Banksy-unmasked---public-schoolboy-middle-class-suburbia.html">photos that have surfaced</a> of him.</p>

<p>The question is: do we really want Banksy unmasked? Wouldn&apos;t that kill some of the magic? Let&apos;s all take a breath and think about this.</p>
