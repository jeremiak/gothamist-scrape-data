<p>It&apos;s not a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808062650/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/playground.php">prison playground</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808062650/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynbridgepark">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a>&apos;s metal climbing domes have parents scorching mad. The domes, part of the playground at the new park, may have looked innocent enough on under the gray clouds on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808062650/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/22/after_more_than_two_decades.php?gallery0Pic=6#gallery">opening day</a>... but now that the sun is out, they&apos;ve turned into tools of torture!</p>

<p>One local father told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808062650/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/04/07/2010-04-07_parents_fuming_over_playgrounds_hot_steel_attraction.html">the Daily News</a>: &quot;It&apos;s outrageous. My first reaction was, &apos;That&apos;s nutty. Why did they put that in a playground?&apos;&quot; And a mom whose son felt the burn recently, says he burst into tears, noting, &quot;It was a pain cry. He was saying, &apos;Ouch, Ouch,&apos; and his hands were all red. They need to fix it.&quot;</p>

<p>So <em>will they</em> fix it? As of this morning Park officials had only put up warning signs telling visitors to &quot;exercise caution&quot; and planned to let the planted trees do the rest, hoping they&apos;d provide shade. But critics weren&apos;t satisfied, noting that black playground mats can even reach up to 165 degrees on summer days&#x2014;some tested the temp of the orbs and found they were up to 127.9 degrees today! So with that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808062650/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/16/33_16_bbp_equipment.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that this afternoon white tents were put up.</p>
