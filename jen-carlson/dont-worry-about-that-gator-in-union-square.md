<p>Has the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005917/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/everyone_watch_out_for_this_cobra.php">Bronx Zoo cobra</a> scared the gators out of our sewers? A reader sent in this photo taken in Union Square today (in front of the Whole Foods). We believe it&apos;s the promo work of the History Channel, for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005917/http://www.history.com/shows/swamp-people">Swamp People</a>, whose 2nd season will be premiering soon... that, or Whole Foods now has gator kabobs in stock. Either way, just one more way you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005917/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/staycation_new_orleans.php">experience New Orleans</a> right here in New York City!</p>

<p>While this guy may be fake, just last year we saw <em>real</em> gators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005917/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/23/gator_in_the_sewers_gator_in_the_se.php">in Queens</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005917/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/14/alligator.php">Brooklyn</a>... though neither were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005917/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/23/urban_legend_uncovered_sewer_alliga.php">of legendary proportions</a>.</p>
