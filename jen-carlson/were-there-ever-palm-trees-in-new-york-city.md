title: Were There Ever Palm Trees In New York City?
---

	
										<p>There is an illustration that shows New York City right around 1770 which features a peculiar sight for these parts: a palm tree. Were there ever palm trees in New York City?</p>

<p>This image has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621052515/https://books.google.com/books?id=DY0hAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA928&amp;lpg=PA928&amp;dq=%22palm+tree+print%22+%22new+york%22+columbia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RayMgDJ6P-&amp;sig=Se6c6O3BYWihrGu5fnHsRkX3nuM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi47dah87bLAhUI3mMKHaPaAEMQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22palm%20tree%20print%22%20%22new%20york%22%20columbia&amp;f=false">described as</a> &quot;the earliest view of King&apos;s College... engraved about 1768 [and] known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621052515/http://www.wikicu.com/Palm_Tree_Print">The Palm Tree Print</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;Palm Tree Print&quot; shows King&apos;s College&apos;s College Hall (later Columbia College), located near City Hall Park in Manhattan. In it, the building is shown &quot;from afar, with what appears to be a palm tree in the foreground.&quot; Was the illustrator drunk? Taking poetic license? Why put a palm tree in an etching depicting New York City if there wasn&apos;t a palm tree there? </p>

<p>Or maybe this isn&apos;t New York at all, and the inscription on the bottom (which reads: &quot;South East view of the City of New York, 1768&quot;) is a lie. Or maybe there were palm trees in New York!</p>

<p>We turned to the New York Botanical Garden for some answers. &quot;Have there ever been palm trees in New York?&quot; we asked. Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621052515/http://www.nybg.org/gardens/curator_profile.php?id_instructor=9">VP of Horticulture and Living Collections</a>, Todd Forrest, believes the palm tree was just a fanciful addition by the artist. </p>

<p>We also reached out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621052515/https://welikia.org/">the Welikia Project</a> (n&#xE9;e The Mannahatta Project), where they&apos;ve been collecting information about the natural landscape of the area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621052515/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/28/nyc_1609_map.php">for years</a>, going all the way back to the 1600s. Eric Sanderson, WCS Senior Conservation Ecologist, and developer of Manahatta and Welikia was familiar with the print. He told us:<br>
 <br>
</p><blockquote>Yes, it&apos;s thought that the palm tree is an artistic license.  Someone told me once (or I read it somewhere, but can&apos;t remember the exact source) that it [the tree] was added by the engraver back in England to enliven the picture, which was originally drawn by a British officer, Thomas Davies, who was stationed in New York during the American Revolution. The engraver knew it was a scene from America, so added an American tree. (Remember that Europeans back then thought of America equally as a tropical place, given the colonies in the Caribbean and South America.)</blockquote><p></p>

<p>So there you have it, there were never palm trees growing in New York, though they&apos;ve always been popular additions to restaurant and hotel decor, and were even shipped in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621052515/http://collections-static-6.mcny.org/Collection/Florida-Building-at-the-1939-New-York-World&apos;s-Fair-2F3XC5835VKE.html">for the 1939 World&apos;s Fair</a>.</p>
