										<p>All has been silent on the stabby front in the South Side of Williamsburg. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033000/http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/A_spike_in_crime_has_Williamsburg_wary/13499.html">Metro</a> now takes a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033000/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/12/stabbings.php">the incidents</a>, which have been going on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033000/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/18/machetes_and_kn.php">since April</a> of this year, and have often involved machetes (possibly wielded by the gang called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033000/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/14/williamsburg_gang_warefare_meets_yo.php">Trinitarios</a>). The paper reports that <strong>the 90th Precinct has &quot;experienced the sharpest rise in crime since last year of any neighborhood in Brooklyn</strong>,&quot; coming in at 13.49% (as a comparison, the 94th precinct--which includes Williamsburg&apos;s North Side and Greenpoint--has seen a 6.38% rise in crime). City councilwoman Diana Reyna told Metro, &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t want to overstate the problem. <strong>But if we don&#x2019;t do something, we&#x2019;re going to have serious problems.</strong>&#x201D;</p>
