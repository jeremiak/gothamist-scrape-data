title: This Map Shows What Books Best Represent Your Neighborhood
---

	
										<p>Is there a certain novel that best represents each New York City neighborhood? Probably not, but a certain set of novels, perhaps. It&apos;s something the NYPL is currently looking at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222052825/http://www.nypl.org/blog/2015/08/13/nyc-neighborhood-novels?hspace=313584">with this map</a>, which will be filled with even more red dots as additional suggestions come through via crowdsourcing. </p>

<p>Staten Island, Queens, and The Bronx are really underrepresented here, but there&apos;s also a lack of literary dots in Brooklyn (which only has 10 novels listed so far).</p>

<p>Their current list of &quot;famous New York City-based novels according to the neighborhood in which they take place&quot; features <em>American Psycho</em> by Bret Easton Ellis (Financial District), <em>Ragtime</em> by E.L. Doctorow (Flatiron), <em>The Great Gatsby</em> (Midtown), <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> (Central Park), <em>The Age of Innocence</em> by Edith Wharton (Upper East Side), <em>Tropic of Capricorn</em> by Henry Miller (Williamsburg), <em>The Bonfire of the Vanities</em> by Tom Wolfe (West Bronx/Fordham), and more.</p>
