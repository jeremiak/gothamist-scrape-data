<p><em>Mr. Robot</em> closed out season one in a flurry of chaos, naturally, with the revolution underway&#x2014;the final scene (before the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025142556/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHrp8rvBLmM">bonus scene</a>), however, is simply a knock at Eliot&apos;s door (we don&apos;t see who it is, <em>but maybe it&apos;s Tyrell?</em>). The show is set to return on July 13th, and its creators just released a first look at what&apos;s to come. The trailer features an Obama cameo (who speaks from a post-fsociety-hack world), more promises of changing the world, more Christian Slater, further inspection of the &quot;infinite loop of insanity&quot; that is&#x2014;<em>or is it?</em>&#x2014;Eliot&apos;s brain, and other minds in their various states of fragile unrest. Enjoy!</p>

<p>That diner you see above was not created on a soundstage, it is gloriously <em>real</em>, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025142556/http://www.yelp.com/biz/paphos-diner-brooklyn">Paphos Diner</a>, and located at 2501 Fulton Street in Brooklyn.</p>
