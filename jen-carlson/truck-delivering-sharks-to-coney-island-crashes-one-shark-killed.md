<p>Yesterday afternoon a semitruck carrying four sharks crashed on I-95 in Florida after one of its 18 tires split. It turns out the truck and its cargo were all headed to the NY Aquarium in Coney Island, and the accident killed one 5-foot sandbar shark. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909111616/http://www.clickorlando.com/news/semitruck-hauling-sharks-crashes/33510036">Click Orlando</a>, it&apos;s unclear if the shark died when the glass tank broke, or if it was ejected. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the Wildlife Conservation Society for comment on the shark transport and death, and will update when we hear back. Meanwhile, the New York Aquarium&apos;s Jon Forrest Dohlin released this statement:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A truck transporting four sandbar sharks to the WCS New York Aquarium was involved this afternoon in a weather-related accident on I-95 in Florida. One of the sharks died as a result. Efforts are being made to move the remaining sharks to an appropriate facility near the site of the crash. There has been no report of injury to any person as a result of this incident. We are still receiving details on the status of the animals and situation. We will advise of further details as they become available.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The rest of the sharks are being held at SeaWorld, where rescuers removed them to after the crash. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909111616/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2545118/">Solid plan</a>.</p>
