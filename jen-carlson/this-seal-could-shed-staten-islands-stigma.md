<p>Staten Island may be known best known <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313094213/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/22/jersey_island.php">for its guido culture</a>, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313094213/http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2010/01/seals_in_annadale.html">Staten Island Advance</a> reports today on a little something that may just help shed that stigma: a gallery of adorable images of a seal basking in the sun! They say that every day this seal &quot;can be found enjoying the early morning sunlight in Annadale,&quot; spotted most mornings on a rock in the waters off Lipsett Avenue (unlike other locals who can be found at Hollywood Tans). One woman delcares: &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything like that on Staten Island.&quot;</p>
