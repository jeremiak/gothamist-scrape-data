<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506165205/http://baconery.com/">Baconery</a> launched at the end of September, promising to bring bacon-loaded baked goods to your home via their delivery service, but now they&apos;re aiming to open up a shop in Manhattan as well. We checked in with Wesley Klein, owner of the New York-based business, this week, and he tells us a storefront is in the works.</p>

<p>Klein says, &quot;We are looking to open a store in three to six months, we want it to be in Manhattan, still looking at neighborhoods that make sense.&quot; Will vegetarians be able to indulge, too? As of now, Klein tells us fake bacon products are not an option, but they do offer turkey bacon (they have a Thanksgiving-inspired cranberry turkey bacon cookie).</p>

<p>Their most popular items are the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bacon Cookies and Bacon Brownies, but this month&apos;s holiday offering is the Gingerbread Bacon Pigs. Intrigued? They&apos;re offering a special on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506165205/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=229941643746123&amp;set=a.152409394832682.39063.137338713006417&amp;type=3&amp;theater">their Facebook</a> this month, if you want to start insulating those arteries for the winter season.</p>
