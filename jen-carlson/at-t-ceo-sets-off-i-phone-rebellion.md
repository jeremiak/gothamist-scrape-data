Like, uh, usage-based pricing maybe? Though he didn&apos;t say as much, he hinted at it as a future solution if the industry can&apos;t find a fix. At the same conference he <em>finally</em> admitted that New York&apos;s service is not up to par, and today AT&amp;T;&apos;s PR firm sent out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122719/http://247wallst.com/2009/12/18/worst-pr-of-the-day-att-t/">a release</a> stating that &quot;AT&amp;T; has suffered in New York and San Francisco from better than average iPhone penetration. In these two cities, AT&amp;T; has been too successful in selling the iPhone, to the point where the network has been severely strained.&quot;<p></p>

<p>After the conference it was the &quot;bandwidth hogs&quot; that de la Vega put the fear into, however, as they rebelled against the idea of limited usage. As such, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122719/http://www.fakesteve.net/">this guy</a> started Operation Chokehold. Has your coverage been worse today? That may be why. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122719/http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2009/1217/Operation-Chokehold-AT-T-FCC-condemn-Fake-Steve-Jobs-plan">Reportedly</a>, &quot;the scheme is aimed at bringing AT&amp;T;&apos;s wireless data network to a crawl Friday afternoon as a protest against plans by AT&amp;T; to impose fees on iPhone users who use what the company considers too much bandwidth.&quot;</p>

<p>The rebellion&apos;s fearless leader is also talking coverage, which seems to be a more immediate problem. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122719/http://www.fakesteve.net/2009/12/att-by-the-numbers.html">He wonders</a> why AT&amp;T; has taken in &quot;billions of dollars in revenue from these new customers, but instead of plowing that money into building out their network, they&#x2019;ve held the money back and applied it to earnings &#x2014; lining their own pockets and looking after their investors instead of looking after customers.&quot; They did say they were too successful in selling product in that press release, after all. While there&apos;s no covert Operation battling dropped calls, there is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205122719/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/08/iphone_1.php">this iPhone app</a> to report where coverage sucks.</p>
