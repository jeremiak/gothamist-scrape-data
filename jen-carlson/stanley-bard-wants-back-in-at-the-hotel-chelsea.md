</div></div>					<p>In 2007 Stanley Bard was ousted from his management position at the Chelsea Hotel, which he had held for 50 years. Since then, there have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235401/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/20/hotel_chelsea_update.php">been changes</a> at the hotel that he, as well as long-time residents, is not thrilled with. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235401/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/chelsea_hero_SMcYc5FxMwE46s77pYOuhL">the NY Post</a>, he&apos;s still part-owner and is now prepared to buy out the other shareholders at a fair price. He told the paper, &quot;I&apos;m not completely happy with what&apos;s happened there... they&apos;re not renting to any long-term people no matter who they are.&quot; Recently hoteliers Andre Balazs and Ian Schrager have expressed interest in the landmark hotel, and he surprisingly says if they win the bid, he&apos;d be okay with that, noting, &quot;These are good people that understand management and wouldn&apos;t force the residents out.&quot;</p>

<p>When Bard gave us a tour of the hotel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235401/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/17/a_conversation.php">in 2007</a>, he spoke about the residents, telling us the community that had formed there with him was &quot;A Mutual Admiration Society.&quot;</p>
