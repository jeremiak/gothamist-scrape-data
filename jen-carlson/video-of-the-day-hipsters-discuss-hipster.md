title: Video of the Day: Hipsters Discuss "Hipster"
---

	
										<p>Question: Is the word &quot;hipster&quot; <em>so over</em>...or is talking about the word so over? Below, a group of self-declared non-hipsters talk circles around what the word actually means.</p>

<p>Nuggets of wisdom are offered up from promoter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519230945/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/07/todd_patrick_co.php">Todd P</a>, author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519230945/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/benjamin_nugent_1.php">Ben Nugent</a>, and Vice head honcho Gavin McGinnes (who notes the word has been his &quot;bread and butter for 15 years&quot;). Todd P describes the hipster experience as such: &quot;When there&apos;s a good idea...it gets picked up fast...not to be an elitist, but really boring people start following these trends.&quot; <em>Burn.</em> Assuming the hipsters are the followers, no wonder everyone is running from the term.</p>

<p>Perhaps one Ray Ban-wearing youth sums it up best when asked if he&apos;s a hipster: &quot;No, I&apos;m from Manhattan. I think hipsters are usually just from the Lower East Side...&quot; He&apos;s burrowed so deeply into his hipster identity he doesn&apos;t even care about geography, which is so...whatever!</p>
