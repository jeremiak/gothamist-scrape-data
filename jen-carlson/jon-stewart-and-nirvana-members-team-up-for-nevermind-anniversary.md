<p>With Nirvana&apos;s <em>Nevermind</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116100305/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/nirvanas_nevermind_turns_20.php">turning 20</a> this year (it&apos;s just one year older than Kurt Cobain&apos;s daughter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116100305/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/frances_bean_cobain_1.php#photo-1">Frances Bean</a>), there&apos;s a lot of nostalgic reminiscing going on. Next month, on September 24th (the original <em>Nevermind</em> release date), Jon Stewart (who used to work for MTV! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116100305/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNntfTDOLNo">Remember</a>?) will host a Q&amp;A; with Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, along with Butch Vig (the album&apos;s producer).

<p>According to the press release we received, this will be a two hour long program, with a live audience (chosen via an online contest). It will go down on September 24th (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116100305/http://www.siriusxm.com/lithium">on channel 34</a>), one day after the launch of &#x201C;Nevermind Radio, an all-Nirvana limited-run channel.&quot;</p>

<p>In two years from now, their followup album <em>In Utero</em> will turn 20, and less than a year after that will be the 20th anniversary of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116100305/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/john_norris_on_finding_out_kurt_cob.php">Cobain&apos;s death</a>.</p>
