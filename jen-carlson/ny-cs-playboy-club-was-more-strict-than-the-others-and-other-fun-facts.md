</div></div>					<p>In the Playboy Club Bunny Manual (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015636/http://thehairpin.com/2011/04/life-lessons-learned-from-the-1968-playboy-club-bunny-manual">unearthed recently</a>), it states: &quot;<strong>At all Clubs, except New York Club</strong>, Bunnies may: 1. Have their pictures taken with patrons, provided there is now physical contact whatsoever; 2. Dance with patrons at the feature dance party, provided there is no close physical contact, (twist, watusi, bugaloo, etc., are examples of acceptable dances).&quot; So why was New York City&apos;s club so prudish? We may never know. But during our journey to find out, here are some other tidbits we came across on the city&apos;s very own bustling Bunny club, which was located at 5 East 59th Street. <br>
</p><ul><li>Debbie Harry worked at the New York Playboy Club form 1968 to 1973!<br>
</li><li>So was Lauren Hutton, from 1963 to 1964 <em>and</em> feminist writer Gloria Steinem in 1963 (whose story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015636/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBhUiQl8F9g">became a movie</a> with Kirstie Alley!)<br>
</li><li>Former NYC Bunny Mary Chipman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015636/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127495661">says</a> by 1971, &quot;The club had seen better days. The clientele, they weren&apos;t really the high rollers. It wasn&apos;t really that cool to be a Playboy Bunny. It had been glamorous 10 years before, but it wasn&apos;t so much at that point.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Check out the glory days in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015636/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1nD-_tfo6M">this <em>Mad Men</em> clip</a>.<br>
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015636/http://my-retrospace.blogspot.com/2009/11/golden-age-of-playboy-club.html">At one time</a> there were 25,000 Bunnies and over a million Keyholders.<br>
</li><li>Keyholders received a physical key which had the Playboy rabbit head logo on it.<br>
</li><li>The Bunnies now all hang out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015636/http://www.explayboybunnies.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=29">right here</a>.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Many more photos of the New York club can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015636/http://www.playboy.com/articles/new-york-playboy-club-p1/index.html">found here</a>.</p>
