<p>We have never, ever wanted to give <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908183716/http://gothamist.com/tags/daria">Daria</a> a makeover. Her wide-lapel green blazer, mustard yellow shirt, and brown skirt were sort of a drab, chromatic nightmare together, but Daria made it work&#x2014;it was (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908183716/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqh7eSNfuI">Fashion Club member</a>) Quinn and her crop tops that were the real problem. But now after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908183716/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/heres_the_original_5-minute_pilot_f.php">sixteen years in the same outfit</a>, Ms. Morgendorffer has been given a new look (below the neck), and she&apos;s not alone: her old pals Beavis &amp; Butthead have been transformed into fashion punksters, and Lisa Simpson has been given legs for days. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908183716/http://swaggernewyork.com/2013/09/04/exclusive-lisa-simpson-daria-and-other-90s-cartoon-characters-take-on-new-york-fashion-week/">Take a look at all of your favorite &apos;90s animated characters</a>, who are now more fashionable than any of us.</p>
