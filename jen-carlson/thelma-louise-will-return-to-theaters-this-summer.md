<p><em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>, the 1991 flick that reimagined the road movie&#x2014;featuring bad asses Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis&#x2014;will be returning to the big screen in August for its 25 year anniversary. Fathom Events is bringing it back to theaters nationwide on August 21st and 24th (you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144604/http://fathomevents.com/event/thelma-and-louise/">locate one near you here</a>).</p>

<p>The movie was widely embraced by audiences and critics, receiving six Oscar noms, with Callie Khouri winning one for Best Original Screenplay. While many may remember Brad Pitt&apos;s abs and the big crash ending, the story focused on gender roles and equality... and violence. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144604/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_%26_Louise"><br>
Did you know</a> that Tori Amos wrote &quot;Me and a Gun&quot; after seeing the film? The song is about her rape, &quot;which she had told no one about before watching this film. Affected by a scene in the movie, Amos began sobbing publicly in a crowded movie theater and writing the lyrics to the song in her head.&quot; In an interview with 20/20, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144604/http://www.healthyplace.com/abuse/articles/tori-amos-on-being-a-rape-survivor/">Amos recalled</a>: &quot;People had to move away from me in the theater, just because I was, you know, sobbing. I was like a little wellspring sitting there.&quot;</p>

<p>Some T&amp;L; Facts:<br>
</p><ul><li>George Clooney auditioned for the role of J.D. (Pitt&apos;s character) five times <br>
</li><li>Geena Davis originally wanted to play the role of Louise, but when Sarandon showed up everyone knew she was right for the role.<br>
</li><li>Thelma &amp; Louise takes place on the road from Arkansas to the Grand Canyon, but was filmed entirely in California and Utah. <br>
</li><li>The Grand Canyon in the movie is really Dead Horse Point State Park in Utah.<br>
</li><li>The Oklahoma City motel where the two encounter J.D. is in Downtown Los Angeles, the Vagabond Inn at 3101 S. Figueroa St. It&apos;s still there today. <br>
</li><li>The production used five (identical) 1966 Thunderbirds.<br>
</li><li><em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em> is one of only four films in which two lead performers were nominated as Best Actress.<br>
</li><li>And then there&apos;s that selfie... so ahead of its time:</li></ul><p></p>
