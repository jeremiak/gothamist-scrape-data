<p>Well, this is unsurprising. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150714025301/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/20/faile.php">Faile prayer wheel</a> bolted on to North 6th Street in Williamsburg has been uprooted by some enterprising art collector (eBay seller). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150714025301/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/04/failes-prayer-wheel-vanishes/">AnimalNY</a> reports that &quot;Despite being bolted to the sidewalk, the carved wooden post with a spinning prayer wheel on top has disappeared after less than a week. While it&#x2019;s not clear who removed the piece, the motivation for doing so is: their work fetches tens of thousands of dollars.&quot; Ah, the five finger bailout.</p>
