That&apos;s the question that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522033022/http://www.cityvision-competition.com/newyork/results/">CityVision</a> competition posed to contestants, who were tasked with designing their imagined future New Yorks. The twist? In this future every resident of Manhattan has fled for an outer borough.</p>

<p>The first place entry went to a team that envisioned Manhattan as a giant landfill&#x2014;&quot;Having been overwhelmingly densified, the population of Manhattan has relocated to the outer boroughs. Seeking energy independence and a sustainable solution to waste control, the city turns Manhattan into a landfill from which it can harness energy. A new landscape of rolling hills transforms the skyline of Manhattan as the peaks of skyscrapers puncture the ground and provide access to a network of underground circulation.&quot; While the idea of runny up a grassy hill to touch the top of the Empire State Building&apos;s spire is intriguing, this is mostly just depressing, and what would this future Manhattan smell like in the future summers?</p>

<p>Second place went to a team who turned Manhattan into &quot;an archaeological site surrounded by massive containing walls that hold back the rising sea. New York&#x2019;s creation leads to its demise, as its development forces the sea to rise. The designers propose to entomb Manhattan in a state of near-destruction, serving as a monument to the twentieth century industrial paradigm.&quot; </p>
