At some point they abandoned their New York City stomping grounds for the warmer weather of the West Coast, but the city is still the inspiration for their latest release. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030122/http://www.deathbowltodowntown.com/"><em>Deathbowl to Downtown</em></a> chronicles the origin of skating in NYC and is &quot;the first to explore skateboarding&#x2019;s urban history in-depth.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030122/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/05/nycs_skateboard.php">View trailer here</a>.)</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>After working on the film for three years, off and on, it&apos;s ready to be released this summer, and this weekend they&apos;re in town celebrating with an art show called The Moving Image (a photographic history of skateboarding in New York City) at Etnies Showroom.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Where did the idea for Deathbowl to Downtown originate?</strong> We have made several skateboard films that were based mostly on road trips over a specific period of time. A historical project was appealing because it was different; also, the evolution of skateboarding is an interesting story because it is organic. </p>

<p>New York is an interesting place for skate history because even though it is the biggest city in the U.S. it was a skateboarding backwater for years. Then all of a sudden it became known worldwide for skating. </p>

<p><strong>How did Chlo&#xEB; Sevigny get involved?</strong> Skating is mostly guys and we thought it would be nice to have a female narrator to give some balance. Chlo&#xEB; has a connection with the scene because she knows many of the skaters from the 90s, from the Kids time. And she has an awesome voice, she did an amazing job. </p>
