</div></div>					<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624212100/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/10/the_algonquin_a.php">Matilda</a>, the famous Algonquin Hotel cat, celebrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624212100/http://www.animalleague.org/campaigns/matilda/matildas-birthday-celebration-2010.html">her 15th birthday</a>&#x2014;and we were there for <em>total coverage</em>. The party was held in the hotel&apos;s lobby and centered around a good ol&apos; fashioned Cat Fashion Show&#x2014;because what better way to celebrate than by making your feline friends dress up in ridiculous outfits and parade in front of humans? John Fulton, the host of Animal Planet&#x2019;s new upcoming show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624212100/http://www.facebook.com/mustlovecatsfanpage"><em>Must Love Cats</em></a> was on hand as the host&#x2014;the show has been filming around the city all week for a NYC episode! When asked what his favorite costume was, Fulton told us, &quot;Diva, the 4 month old rag doll, brought the crowd to a frenzy.&quot;</p>

<p>Our photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624212100/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> pretty much sums up the scene, saying, &quot;I felt emotionally confused the whole time because I thought the show was hilarious but at the same time I felt bad! Some of the cats were so nervous when they came out because the audience was popping camera flashes in their faces and screaming to the cats in baby talk.&quot; She also noted that the dressing room was equipped with a CD called &quot;Relaxation music for my cat and me,&quot; so hopefully that helped them out.</p>

<p>At least one cat looked relaxed&#x2014;the Savannah cat dressed as Elvis. Interesting tidbit: did you know Savannahs more than five generations from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624212100/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serval">the Serval</a> are allowed to be owned in New York state, but <em>not</em> in the city of New York?</p>
