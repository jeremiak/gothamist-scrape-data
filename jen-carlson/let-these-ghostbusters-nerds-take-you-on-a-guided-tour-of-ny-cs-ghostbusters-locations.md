<p>These two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174538/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters"><em>Ghostbusters</em></a> nerds are putting a smile on our faces today. The duo, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174538/http://www.bleedingcool.com/">Bleeding Cool</a>, took a tour of spots the movie filmed at in Manhattan, recreating scenes at most of them. The result is a pretty servicey guide for fellow fans of the film, including eight stops which took about six hours to travel to... this includes breaks, getting lost, and an occasional run in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174538/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnTCajL7I_U&amp;feature=related">with Zuul</a>.</p>

<p>Below is the tour they took... but there are plenty more locations that could have been added, which you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174538/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/01/map_of_the_day_51.php">on this map</a>.</p>
