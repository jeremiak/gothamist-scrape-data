<p>Today Etsy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101656/https://twitter.com/#!/Etsy/status/86070665261748225">Tweeted</a> a link to the below infographic, which may <em>look</em> like some outrageous scaremongering propaganda from the Standing Up Council, but it&apos;s all too real. And it&apos;s not like we haven&apos;t heard it before: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101656/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/19/sitting_down_youre_so_screwed.php">last year</a> we learned that &quot;too much sitting, and not just a lack of exercise, may cause heart disease and other life-threatening illnesses.&quot; Earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101656/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/16/sitting_still_deadly.php">this year</a> it was confirmed, with one researcher declaring: &quot;Excessive sitting is a lethal activity.&quot; And the latest numbers are <em>shocking</em>&#x2014;this infographic states (right next to a scary monster) that &quot;<strong>sitting 6+ hours per day makes you up to 40% likelier to die within 15 years than someone who sits less than 3. Even if you exercise.</strong>&quot; So consider this your reminder: sitting is suicide!</p>

<p>Basically, it&apos;s making us fat, it&apos;s wrecking our bodies, it&apos;s turning off electrical activity in our leg muscles, and doing other terrible terrible things that will give us nightmares later tonight. Since you can&apos;t quit your job (they give you the health insurance you&apos;ll need when your body begins to atrophy from all the sitting!), what are you gonna do? The infographic suggests you interrupt sitting whenever possible, so it&apos;s time to be that person in the office who gets up and stretches and walks around every 15 minutes. They&apos;ll call you &quot;the office crazy,&quot; but you&apos;ll live to BURY THEM ALL.</p>
