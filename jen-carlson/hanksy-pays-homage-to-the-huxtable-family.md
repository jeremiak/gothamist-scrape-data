<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104009/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a> put up some new pieces at the Five Points in Bushwick, right by the Ridgewood border on Troutman Street at Saint Nicholas Avenue. Meet Theo<em>door</em> Huxtable, and Dhor&#x2014;who Hanksy tells us is &quot;somewhat like Thor, but with a lot more door.&quot;</p>
