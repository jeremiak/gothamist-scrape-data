<p>Last night&apos;s episode of the <em>Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> included segments dedicated to Joe Giudice showering his wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141323/http://gothamist.com/tags/teresaguidice">Teresa</a> with expensive gifts for their 10 year anniversary (despite what seemed like major concerns he had over their financial situation; clip below). Or at least, <em>we hear</em> this is what happened&#x2014;we were busy reading books. </p>

<p>In the end, there was a helicopter ride, a diamond ring in a dessert, and of course an overnight stay at a luxury hotel... in Jersey City. Perhaps the best part of all this was when the couple pointed out there was a pretty park underneath them during their flight over Manhattan&#x2014;the pilot quickly pointed out: &quot;That&apos;s <em>Central Park</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Surely this anniversary bill was just the cherry on top of whatever led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141323/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/05/real_housewife_10mm_in_debt_banks_r.php">their eventual bankruptcy</a>. And now the couple is looking to unload their possessions in a bankruptcy auction on August 22nd&#x2014;Gawker has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141323/http://gawker.com/5596550/the-real-housewife-foreclosure-auction-own-a-piece-of-teresa-giudice">a preview</a> of what will be on the block. Wonder at what point during which they were burying themselves under an $11 million debt to creditors that they thought: yeah, let&apos;s buy that suit of armor.</p>
