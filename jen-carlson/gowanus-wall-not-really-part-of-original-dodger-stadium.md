<p>Until recently it was believed that a wall in Gowanus was part of the old Washington Park stadium, where the Dodgers played until moving to Ebbets Field in 1912. In fact, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424005645/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/Dodgers/dodgers.html">believed to be</a> &quot;the oldest section of any former major league ballpark still standing in the country.&quot; However, the 20-foot wall, located on 3rd Avenue between First and Third Streets, isn&apos;t quite what baseball historians thought it was.</p>

<p>According to an expert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424005645/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/12/31/2009-12-31_wall_not_part_of_original_dodger_stadium_says_historian.html">the Daily News</a> spoke with, the &quot;baseball wall&quot; didn&apos;t even exist when the Dodgers played at the field&#xA0;&#x2014; historian Brian Merlis told them, &quot;I can say with absolute certainty that this wall was not part of Washington Park prior to the Brooklyn team&apos;s departure. It&apos;s still an historic wall, but there&apos;s no evidence that it&apos;s the original wall.&quot;</p>

<p>Con Ed is slated to demo some buildings by the wall, and said they will preserve it. Historians still believe &quot;the wall was either part of a carriage house or club house for the players built after the 1912 season.&quot;</p>
