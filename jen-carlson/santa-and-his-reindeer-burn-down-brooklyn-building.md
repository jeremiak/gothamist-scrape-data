<p>Right after the FDNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145928/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/heres_your_christmas_tree_on_fire.php">warns us</a> about fires started by holiday decorations, a three alarm fire has destroyed a rowhouse in Brooklyn. The cause: Christmas decorations! Along with the building at 201 Menahan Street, two other rowhouses were damaged. The fire took place last Thursday at 6 p.m., according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145928/http://bushwickbk.com/2010/12/20/house-destroyed-in-christmas-light-fire/">BushwickBK</a>, with neighbors claiming that an inflatable Santa Claus and a mechanical reindeer hanging on the door were to blame, they were allegedly put up a week prior, and connected with extension cords.</p>

<p>No one was hurt in the fire, but one woman told the site that she lost everything; &quot;I am happy to be alive&#x2026; The roof of the building is laying on my living room floor and the entire apartment is flooded.&quot; Maybe this is a good time to watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145928/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/heres_your_christmas_tree_on_fire.php">that video</a> again.
