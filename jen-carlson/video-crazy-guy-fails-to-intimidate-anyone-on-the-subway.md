title: Video: Crazy Guy Fails To Intimidate Anyone On The Subway
---

	
										<p>Meet Bloody Loco, one of the many colorful characters that make up this city. If you&apos;re lucky, maybe you&apos;ll run into him on the subway! Just make sure you recognize, <em>ASAP</em>, or else you&apos;ll become the co-star of both an improvisational piece of street theater, <em>and</em> a YouTube video. This all went down on the 7 train yesterday (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210114/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/21/happy_common_courtesy_day.php">Common Courtesy Day</a>!). Some call it an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210114/http://www.epicfail.com/2011/03/22/intimidation-fail-4/">epic intimidation fail</a>...</p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210114if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/-aRJDI3v4AM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>But what was going on before someone hit &quot;record&quot;? Is Bloody Loco a library bounty hunter tracking down late fees? A down-on-his-luck Kindle salesman? You can&apos;t see it on camera, but our theory is that after the video ends, Loco starts screaming, &quot;Print Is Dead!&quot; </p>
