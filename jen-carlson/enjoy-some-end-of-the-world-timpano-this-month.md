<p>If you missed the 1996 Stanley Tucci movie <em>Big Night</em>, which revolves around a failing Italian restaurant, then you may still be unfamiliar with timpano (also called timballo). In the below scene you&apos;ll see a timpano being made from scratch in the movie&#x2014;the recipe they&apos;re using is actually a real Tucci family recipe, which Stanley&apos;s grandmother brought over from Calabria, Italy (you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820052556/http://www.amazon.com/Cucina-Famiglia-Italian-Families-Traditions/dp/0688159028">find it in this book</a> they wrote!).</p>

<p>Of course, the best way to experience this massive food beast is by making your own (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820052556/http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/5668/Big-Night-Timpano.html">here&apos;s the Tucci recipe</a>), but at least one New York City restaurant is serving it up this month. Chef Laurence Edelman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820052556/http://www.leftbankmanhattan.com/">of Left Bank</a> restaurant in Manhattan has created the dish using &quot;everything you want to eat before the world ends.&quot; This includes tomato, b&#xE9;chamel, sausage, meatball, boiled egg, spinach, aged provolone, chicken liver, prosciutto cotto, buffalo mozz, parm, soppressata, and fresh garnanelli, with a shell of fresh pasta. </p>

<p>He&apos;ll only be serving it up on December 21st (aka <em>end times</em>), and if you want in you&apos;ll have to get together some friends, give Left Bank 24 hours notice, and prepare for the $65 per person charge (this also gets you olives, almonds, green salad, saut&#xE9;ed green veg, extra tomato sauce, and extra parm). What, no dessert?</p>
