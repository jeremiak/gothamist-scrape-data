Luckily, the folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208142311/http://www.thirteen.org/nyontheclock/video/nathan-stodola-renegade-accordion/49/?slider=1">Thirteen documented</a> his time on the street &#x2014; which earns him money to put towards his graduate degree in engineering at Columbia.</p>

<p>He says he usually starts around 10 a.m. in Washington Square Park, if you want to catch him (though he moves around to Central Park and Union Square later in the day).</p>
