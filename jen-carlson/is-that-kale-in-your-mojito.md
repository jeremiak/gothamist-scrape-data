---


                            
                            
                            
                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="kalejito0713.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053339im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/kalejito0713.jpg" width="270" height="351"> <br> <i style=" width:270px; ;display:block"> via Fifty Shades Of Kale</i></div> Are you searching for the perfect drink to transition you back to normalcy after a day of binge drinking under the sun? The Kalejito has got alcohol <em>and</em> a superfood. So, it&apos;s perfect.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053339/http://www.wellandgoodnyc.com/2013/07/03/kalejito-a-kale-infused-fourth-of-july-cocktail-recipe/">Well + Good</a> has pointed us towards a new cookbook unfortunately titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053339/http://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Shades-Kale-Satisfying-Recipes/dp/0062272888/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373036801&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Fifty+Shades+of+Kale"><em>Fifty Shades of Kale: 50 Fresh &amp; Satisfying Recipes That are Bound to Please</em></a>. [Pause for sigh. Another sigh. <em>Another</em> sigh. And one UGH. Now cry, gently.]</p>

<p>The authors of the cookbook talk about their kale version of the Mojito, saying, &#x201C;The cocktail&#x2019;s refreshing zing comes from a healthy dose of mint&#x2014;an herb thought to relieve stress, aid digestion&#x2026;and stimulate the senses. [Kale] intensifies its already vibrant green color, making for an elegant, gemlike cocktail that couldn&#x2019;t be more seductive.&#x201D; Okay, hopefully we&apos;ll drink enough to forget about their sexualization of kale.</p>

<p><strong>Kalejito</strong><br>
2 teaspoons superfine sugar<br>
4 ounces white rum<br>
&#xBD; cup packed torn kale leaves<br>
&#xBD; cup packed mint leaves, plus 2 sprigs for garnish<br>
Juice of 2 limes (about &#xBC; cup)</p>

<p><em>Combine all the ingredients in a blender and blend on high speed. Pour over 2 glasses filled with ice. Garnish with the mint sprigs and serve immediately.</em></p>

<p>Also you can probably just add kale to any drink&#x2014;delicately place some Lacinato into your Bloody Mary, shove some curly leaves into your lager... there are no rules!</p>
