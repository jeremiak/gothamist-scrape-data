										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="php8XEC2QAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001147im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php8XEC2QAM.jpg" width="300" height="209" class="image-right"> </span>OMFG, a new study has come out showing that 33% of teens and young adults have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001147/http://gothamist.com/tags/sexting"><em>sexted</em></a>. Which is to say they have shared and/or viewed sexually explicit photos or messages on their phones or computers, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001147/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/of_kids_are_texxxters_rqN8ycl0XXzwPjxDQWgp8K">the NY Post</a>. Since there have been at least two suicides reported after girls had their nude photos &quot;sexted&quot; around, the matter is being taken seriously... but shows no signs of letting up. </p>

<p>The paper talked to some city teens, and one on the UWS told them, &quot;You&apos;d be surprised how often it happens &#x2014; everyone sends racy messages to each other. A girl likes you and she will sext you to get your attention. You can&apos;t see each other, so she&apos;ll send you pictures of herself, her body.&quot; </p>

<p>Another student noted, &quot;It&apos;s irresponsible, because once you send it, you can never take it back, and who knows what will happen to the message once it&apos;s out there.&quot; Which brings us to James Lipton. Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001147/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/29/james_lipton_pi.php">James Lipton</a>. He&apos;s the talking head for a new cell phone campaign that declares, &quot;Before you text... give it a ponder.&quot;</p>

<p>Next time you&apos;re sexting, think of all the possible &quot;Tweets about your beets.&quot; More reasons not to sext after the jump...</p>
