</div></div><p>Here&apos;s a look at the Kenny Scharf mural on Houston Street, at least this is how it was shaping up yesterday (he has at least another day to go). The photographer, Jim Kiernan, tells us that Kenny was wearing UGGS (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602124224/http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/tags/Uggs/default.aspx">RIP Sheep</a>), and was &quot;super cool to all of the fans that stopped by to talk/ask for autographs.&quot; What do you think, better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602124224/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/26/rip_shepard_fairey_mural_2010-2010.php">that Target ad</a>?</p>
