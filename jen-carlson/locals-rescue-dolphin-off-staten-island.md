Earlier today we received an alert about a &quot;distressed dolphin on S.I. side of bay.&quot; Luckily, some animal-loving folks were around to help out, and shortly after we got another alert updating the situation. This one said, &quot;Civilians got the dolphin off the sand bar and the dolphin is headed toward the channel.&quot; Aw, way to go civilians! The Coast Guard and Mammal Rescue are staying on alert to make sure the dolphin gets to where s/he needs to go.</p>
