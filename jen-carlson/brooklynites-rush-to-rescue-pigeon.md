<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="poorpigeon1109.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150605im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/poorpigeon1109.jpg" width="250" height="235" class="image-right"> </span>A pigeon in Brooklyn was recently rescued by some animal lovers after being &quot;dangled upside down from a piece of string that was caught around her leg and tangled on a tree branch two stories above a busy sidewalk.&quot;</p>

<p>When a passerby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150605/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/11/chain_of_caring.php">contacted PETA</a>, the bird was already there for days without food or water. The organization reports back that while local animal control agents were unable to help, &quot;they referred our cruelty caseworker to the local fire department, which dispatched a truck minutes after. Firefighters drove by to survey the situation and returned in a truck with a tall ladder, which they climbed to reach the bird.&quot;</p>

<p>The pigeon&apos;s wounds were infested with maggots and it was rushed to a vet, who discovered it was suffering from a broken back, and put it out of its misery. PETA asks that everyone help an animal in need... think of how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150605/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadrat">sad rat&apos;s story</a> could have turned out.</p>
