She claims that workers never received overtime or minimum wage, and now could have hundreds of others joining in on the suit (which already has around 20 bartenders on board). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309064532/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/26/4040.php">This isn&apos;t the first lawsuit</a> against the club.</p>
